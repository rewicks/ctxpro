And if he's dead, I want to bury him.<eos> "Hitler ist kaputt!" I heard your son say it.<eos> He's a child, Lutz.<eos> It means nothing to him, it's a game.<eos> He hears things and he repeats them, that's all...
- I am.<eos> - In December?<eos> We've had a very strong year.<eos> The year's not over. We don't know where we're gonna land.<eos> I wanna reward people. I want them to feel good about the work they've done here.
- Sorry, mate, I'm using that.<eos> Situation here, Jason.<eos> It's time to call your better half.<eos> Sorry, John, you're on your own.<eos> Oi, I'm gonna roast your nuts and feed them to you, Constantine.
Back on the pavement. Seven days a week.<eos> I like your stories.<eos> I think you should write them down.<eos> You think?<eos> Yeah. Just write them the way you say them.
He's an estate agent.<eos> Doesn't actually own them.<eos> You know her old man don't know, right?<eos> The keys.<eos> She nicked them.
Unfortunate?<eos> Sir, are you on drugs?<eos> WOMAN: Now, there's no call for that kind of hostile language, Mrs. Withers.<eos> (SIGHS) This is insane.<eos> Your son tore my daughter's fingernails off, tore them clear off.
Those aren't my cassettes.<eos> They got in my bag by mistake.<eos> You know, Dennis, I might believe that if there was one cassette on one topic... Maybe two, but not four.<eos> These didn't fall into someone's bag.<eos> Someone went shopping for these and placed them in a bag.
- Thank you for meeting me, Dr. Preston. - Of course.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You need more sessions with me, right?<eos> Desperately.<eos> And you can't afford them, right?
To your daughter.<eos> That's right.<eos> So, what do we do?<eos> Do you remember what we did with Ruby's things?<eos> Where we put them?
Where are we going?<eos> There should be a hallway up here.<eos> Yes, this way, this way!<eos> These are people's ashes.<eos> - Families just left them here?
Might be about Sherlock.<eos> Of course it's about Sherlock. Everything's about Sherlock.<eos> 'How did you know my kitchen was tiny? '<eos> Well, look, the fading pattern on the paper, it's not much, but it's enough to know your kitchen window faces east.<eos> Now, kitchen noticeboards. By instinct, you place them at eye level, where there's natural light.
Examine him.<eos> Right then, mister!<eos> Now, I need your handcuffs.<eos> I happen to know there's a pair in the salad drawer.<eos> I've borrowed them before.
I mean, how are you even allowed in here?<eos> Oh, I can go anywhere I like.<eos> Anywhere at all.<eos> They gave you keys?<eos> They presented them to me.
Oh, really?<eos> Okay.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Examine them.<eos> Are you examining them now?
Me too.<eos> At least he gave me the coins.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He must've left them out there for me to find.<eos> Left them out where, honey?
She was in a coma.<eos> How they biting back there, Doc?<eos> You know, just the other morning, I caught two brown trout in my pajamas.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did you make a breakfast out of them?
You submitted a set of fingerprints a few days ago to our database, and we need to verify the source.<eos> Well, I can show them to you, but our search was blocked.<eos> That must have been from your end?<eos> I'd like to see the prints, please.<eos> Where did you lift them from...
I see you found what you were looking for.<eos> She's a piece of work, isn't she?<eos> Always spinning a new web.<eos> I was just looking for some answers.<eos> You won't find them here.
- Hush.<eos> - Everything is ruined.<eos> My mother wore those pearls on her wedding day... and my grandmother... and her mother before her.<eos> That's why I was so proud and happy to wear them.<eos> Had I been married here and not in Italy, I should have worn them too.
- make it all inky and pink? - I...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't want to do Valentine's Day shit, okay?<eos> I don't want to do that.<eos> All right, look, all these people are in here today because they don't have people who love them and get them shit on Valentine's Day.
I'm gonna stay by the car, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Look... I meant every word in that letter, so... I don't have much else to say.<eos> You know, I used to love getting your letters.<eos> I reread them like a dozen times.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> The letters your father wrote to you are beautiful.<eos> How would you know that?<eos> Because I read them.
Put it on... ring finger, left hand.<eos> Now... you know what I want, Ray.<eos> You want the coordinates I got from Hastings?<eos> Rather, his pretty secretary, Betty?<eos> Do you really think I'm gonna give them to you?
How much?<eos> And Willy Dunne.<eos> - Right this way, boss.<eos> Yeah. - Willy was Glen's body man.<eos> Put your things in here. I'll let you spread them out how you like.
I'm using "worked" in the broadest sense, including not only our show, but your cooking show and helping you to pick out a cat, and while we all appreciate the food and we love Mr. Swizzleboots,<eos> We're just asking for one night off.<eos> Well... not quite sure what to say.<eos> Just thought the crepes would be a special treat, but... we... we don't have to have 'em.<eos> Not if people don't want them.
Glinda may have chosen me, but I serve you.<eos> Your pregnancy says otherwise.<eos> Glinda of the North has arrived.<eos> Witches.<eos> You may have outlawed their magic, but your people still love them.
After what you saw?<eos> You were protecting those girls.<eos> And you risked your life for them.<eos> Why?<eos> The tunnel in Nimbo would have brought them to Glinda.
Are you gonna help me or not?<eos> What's that?<eos> Wheeler tree sap.<eos> Some of my masks have moving parts.<eos> Grease things up, get them moving...
Not anymore.<eos> You could have, but...<eos> People create gods when they wonder why things happen.<eos> Do you know why things happen?<eos> Because gods make them happen.
Your death brings you back here.<eos> You keep coming back over and over again and again.<eos> I don't remember any of it.<eos> I don't remember these other lives.<eos> Nobody can remember them directly.
Hi.<eos> You've been sent off the field too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you forget your sneakers?<eos> I brought them, but I didn't wear them on purpose.
Why?<eos> Because I wanted to be with you.<eos> Are all your shoes like that?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> My dad gets them from the dump.
I-I like pickles.<eos> We're out of pickles.<eos> What about potato chips?<eos> We got chips.<eos> Number 42 makes them.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> It's not just the ones I killed.<eos> I think about the people I didn't kill, too.<eos> We're gonna bring them back when it's all over.
- Nothing helpful.<eos> What's going on?<eos> [ metal clinking ] ELEANOR: You're about to make a terrible mistake and I am asking you to reconsider.<eos> I am entitled to exercise these sentences at my discretion.<eos> But I'm not asking you to cancel the hangings. I'm asking you to cancel the theater around them.
I don't know what you're or how you...<eos> But private matters between me and my...<eos> I hear things.<eos> I hear them because I listen.<eos> I see them because I watch.
Crys, come on.<eos> You don't miss San Vicente?<eos> I do miss some things.<eos> The steaks at the Corner Club.<eos> You know, you really don't appreciate them until you're eating surf and turf at an Applebee's wannabe.
- You owe me.<eos> - And why's that?<eos> - Because you made me this way!<eos> In Berlin, you woke me f-from a coma f-f-for answers.<eos> I don't have them.
Because I'm not gonna let it.<eos> Ruth, none of this is your fault.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> Some people, you put them together, and no matter how much they love each other, they just don't work.
- I just killed a man.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll turn myself in tomorrow.<eos> The other ladies you saw, they had nothing to do with it.<eos> I'm hoping you'll consider leaving them out of whatever you tell the police.
Do not touch the array.<eos> Step inside the event chamber, close the exit port behind you, and turn the latch to the left.<eos> Hard to the left.<eos> It'll stick.<eos> Then pull your knees towards your chest and hold them there.
- Not to worry, love.<eos> - It's yours, probably.<eos> All right, let's get to the ooey-gooey.<eos> We have gathered your notes and attached them to these beautiful birds.<eos> And now we are going to set them free so they can fly off to every corner of the world, spreading those messages of love to people everywhere.
Because it's not true.<eos> Evening.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> - What did you do with my birds?<eos> I let them go just like I always do.
Rita Mae Brown.<eos> She left?<eos> She and a few others... like her were making the Democratic Party uncomfortable.<eos> The lesbian thing.<eos> Betty Friedan called lesbians a menace and forced them all out.
She left?<eos> She and a few others... like her were making the Democratic Party uncomfortable.<eos> The lesbian thing.<eos> Betty Friedan called lesbians a menace and forced them all out.<eos> No one forced them to push their lifestyle in our faces.
I need a medic over here!<eos> I did it, Tom.<eos> I got, I got the flash drive.<eos> I should be able to restore the sleeper cells.<eos> We can round them up.
But after I was finally released from prison... my son hardly knew me.<eos> He still feel ashamed of his drug-smuggling mother.<eos> One day, he will understand.<eos> And now, life is a big trap made up of little traps.<eos> If you listen hard... sometimes you could hear them snap shut.
I've spent a lot of time trying to piece stuff together about Mom and Dad, but since nobody in this family ever actually talks about anything... there's not much to work with.<eos> Right after Mom and Dad...<eos> I found these letters.<eos> Actually, "found" is wrong.<eos> I rescued them from the trash.
Yo, if she shoot this guy, we gonna get guard brains all over us. Ew.<eos> No, these are my good pants.<eos> - That's what I'm saying. - I had frogs when I was a kid.<eos> We lived by a creek.<eos> We used to scoop them up into buckets...
He took your what?<eos> It's my art.<eos> And I spent a lot of time on them.<eos> And they're beautiful.<eos> And... and that piece of shit Paul Bunyan confiscated them, and I want them back.
No, you know what?<eos> Now, you get Elena's old sparkly ones.<eos> With the multicultural princesses?<eos> No!<eos> Lucky for you, she never wore them 'cause they were too gender-specific.
I mean, that's nice when you think about it.<eos> Doesn't make him innocent. I mean, I'm sure Norman Bates was nice, at least when it came to his mother.<eos> Besides, I mean, look at our board.<eos> Look at the killer's M.O.<eos> First, he kills his victims as humanely as possible, takes care of them for six months, and then brutally kills them again.
Mickey, it's getting too dark for this part of the pirate game.<eos> I need you to go and fetch something for me.<eos> All right, Mummy.<eos> I have noticed a certain halting of progress since I assumed the role of your spiritual directress, but the prospect of life vows can be a difficult time for a novice, and you are assured of all our prayers.<eos> I don't always doubt them.
They're gonna kill you if you don't eat.<eos> They're gonna kill me anyway.<eos> I thought for sure I'd go to Harvard.<eos> I wrote Emerson about 10 letters, but I never got a chance to send any of them.<eos> I'd like to think he would have taken them seriously, though.
Oh, okay.<eos> This rexie girl, who saw my stuff on Tumblr, liked the way I saw... so much, that when she slit her wrists, she left me the fucking note.<eos> And you know what her parents did?<eos> They sent me pictures... so I'd really know what I'd done.<eos> People say they love you... but what they mean is, they love how loving you makes them feel about themselves.
From going from the walker, needing wheelchair assistance at the airport to strolling down the street, enjoying the fresh air, the sunshine.<eos> Two weeks, it's all it took, two weeks to get off all the meds and start to feel the inflammation just kind of drain out of the body where the movement was much easier.<eos> Just a lot of healing occurred very rapidly just by doing the right things for your body.<eos> When you're treating diseases with drugs, you know there's one drug you take for cholesterol, a different class of drugs you take for high blood pressure, different class of drugs you take for diabetes, but, with diet, a plant-based diet affects all these diseases.<eos> One diet to kinda rule them all.
When their leader comes, they will kill you.<eos> Yeah, well, shit happens.<eos> Do you know what Boko Haram does to girls?<eos> They will sell them as slaves, and they'll be raped by their so-called husbands, forced into motherhood before they can even be children themselves.<eos> Their own families will shun them.
They didn't have Fuji apples, so I got you Honeycrisp.<eos> - Hope that's all right.<eos> - I'm sure it'll be fine.<eos> Um, did you get the, uh...<eos> Yeah. I got them.
Um, did you get the, uh...<eos> Yeah. I got them.<eos> I went ahead and, um...<eos> I figured I should maybe...<eos> I wrapped them up... you know, for safety.
- Should I? You famous on YouTube for sucking a camel's dick?<eos> You know, comedians are dark, man.<eos> Inside, most of them are crying their eyes out.<eos> Those girls you kidnapped, they need water, they need food, and they need clean clothes.<eos> You think I kidnapped them.
Turned it into a collection of Hummers, helicopters and, apparently, Freddy Mercury's ashes.<eos> Wait, you mean like his burnt-up body?<eos> The story is Freddy's cremated, but his ashes go missing.<eos> To this day no one knows where they are.<eos> Ja admitted to me once when he was high he bought them.
- Okay, but you and I both know - who Michael Scofield was.<eos> - We've awoken something, something people are trying to hide about Michael.<eos> Jacob?<eos> That's game theory.<eos> You meet people. You bring them into your life until the moment you need to manipulate the relationship to your advantage.
Speaking to my client in this way<eos> - is an abuse of power.<eos> - But that's what you do.<eos> You get vulnerable, broken people into your clutches,<eos> - and you devour them.
I don't have the keys.<eos> I know you do.<eos> Join us and you will live.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> I don't have them.
Just promise me one thing.<eos> We're gonna see every one of those psychos behind bars.<eos> Bore me for a single moment, you'll see what I'm really capable of.<eos> RACE DAY 3<eos> I will cut your fingers off, shove them up a monkey's ass and make you chase them.
And how do you expect me to figure that out for you?<eos> You seem resourceful.<eos> You'll find a way.<eos> I need answers, Simon.<eos> And if I don't get them, I might just bar all vamps... from fraternizing with their Shadowhunter friends.
Nice snakey. Go away, please.<eos> Encanto.<eos> Who am I kidding?<eos> I still suck at encantos!<eos> Those veins on Dot's face. I'd know them anywhere.
What's that?<eos> Think of it as a weaponized tablet preloaded with address resolution protocol spoofing.<eos> The Argus site is protected by microchipped gun turrets.<eos> Right.<eos> This will shut them down?
Controlled explosion that just destroys the docks and cooks the surface.<eos> Nobody ever gets in there again.<eos> There's got to be a better way.<eos> Screw it.<eos> Why don't we just pack every bomb we have onto the surface and detonate them all at once?
Let's hope so, old friend.<eos> Now, gentlemen, we have less than 48 hours to save Salem.<eos> With respect, Mary. It's the people that matter...<eos> not the town.<eos> So why not lead them out of here?
A queen.<eos> The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me.<eos> Their own uncle.<eos> They stole my best ships and ran.<eos> Sailed them right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.
Are you okay with this?<eos> I can't lose half the deacon board. Over a choir director.<eos> Wasn't he fired from another church?<eos> Two churches.<eos> And he sued them.
You're listening to DJ Dave here, and up next, on "Christians Count," we have bishop James Greenleaf from Calvary to talk to us about the fall revival.<eos> Tell us about it, Bishop.<eos> Well, we've got something for everybody this year... men's night, ladies' night, pack a pew night, wildfire... that's a youth night... and my favorite, friends and family.<eos> Count me in for ladies' night!<eos> I know you're jesting, but if there are men out there looking for godly women, Calvary's the place to meet them, in no small part due to the large numbers who show up.
For that joint-eater will take the good out of your supper so no matter how much you eat, after, you'll never be full up, never.<eos> Never. Never. Never.<eos> Oh, oh. Mother, that's enough.<eos> There seemed no room for the spirits of old in Virginia, so Essie no longer told her tales.<eos> She kept them in her heart, where they warmed her like her father's stew on a chill night in Bantry Bay a lifetime ago.
Red cloth for a meeting, the address is on the card...<eos> And the number of eggs denotes the time.<eos> You got it right.<eos> When you didn't respond to the eggs...<eos> Well, I've just never had anyone bring them back before, much less as a snack.
Don't worry yourself over me.<eos> It pains you, what you had to do.<eos> I know.<eos> I feel for you over it.<eos> But we've given up things... Or had them taken from us.
Nathaniel Barnes was infected with the same virus. He's alive.<eos> Jim spared his life.<eos> And yet he gunned down Mario on his wedding day.<eos> You're the real virus, Jim.<eos> You seep into people's lives until you destroy them.
That's what makes you a hero.<eos> Oliver has killed.<eos> He's still considered a hero.<eos> Yeah, and he lives with the weight of that decision every single day.<eos> I think that sometimes, the only way to stop bad things from happening is to just get rid of what's causing them.
The real one went over something called Wickery Bridge in 1992.<eos> Anyway, I have spent the last three weeks sending people into that river to look for that bell, and they haven't found a thing... but I know it still exists, because it can't be destroyed.<eos> That's not ominous.<eos> Blame the witches.<eos> No wonder people found them so annoying.
Uh, yeah.<eos> Look around.<eos> We are in the hotbed of supernatural energy, with the artifacts and books and talismans and the God knows what else.<eos> I mean, witches literally eat that up. They siphon it without trying.<eos> So the girls' magic is going haywire because we brought them to the Armory?
End of story.<eos> We're done here.<eos> - Hey, Becky, listen.<eos> - You can save your sorrys,<eos> Xavier, I don't want them.
Vampires.<eos> Gets funnier every time I hear it.<eos> Vampires nest in groups of 8 to 10.<eos> Victims are taken to the nest where the pack keeps them alive, bleeding them for days or weeks.
"Standoffish" refers to a person who, for various reasons, is not associating with others.<eos> It is a word which might describe somebody who, during a party, might stand in a corner instead of talking to another person.<eos> Gustav?<eos> Jacquelyn here. [sighs]<eos> It would not describe somebody who provides one bed for three people to sleep in, forces them to do horrible chores and strikes them across the face.
Fetch the bucket, Nurse Hastings.<eos> Let's see the discharge, shall we?<eos> Major?<eos> What's happened? Where are my intestines? Ooh!<eos> I mean, I saw them. They were right there.
What?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, man.<eos> Here you are.<eos> These pills are definitely a problem.<eos> Well, doctor prescribed them.
Feuds are never about hate.<eos> Feuds are about pain.<eos> They're about pain.<eos> Please welcome to the stage, tonight's winner, Miss Marilyn Monroe!<eos> I've got great tits, too, but I don't throw them in everyone's face.
I am the only opinion that matters.<eos> I'll make you proud of me,<eos> I promise.<eos> Years later, when I heard what was going on, I was furious.<eos> I mean, at the time, we didn't know that these two great screen legends, friends of ours, were being manipulated so cruelly by the men around them.
I can't make heads or tails of it, but you are welcome to look.<eos> You sure?<eos> Of course. It's you.<eos> Well, uh, I gotta say... I can't blame you for getting mixed up with all this.<eos> I mean, these legal notices... I mean, no one really understands them.
Did she already say something?<eos> I just want you to know, I was not unkind, though I was quite firm.<eos> Well, what are you talking about?<eos> Your daughter was corrupting my twins.<eos> I caught them smoking.
You have to be out before the real EU envoys show up and your cover's blown.<eos> - What about weapons?<eos> - Weapons are my job.<eos> Dumont thinks that we can just, uh drive them right across the border. How?<eos> What are we hiding them in?
How was working for your dad?<eos> It was...<eos> Pouring concrete, every day, all day long.<eos> To pass time, I would start composing these poems, in my head.<eos> And at night, I'd go home, I'd write them down...
...to bring them to the ball is...<eos> Is what, Giuliana?<eos> Compassionate?<eos> They are our nieces. My brother's children, rest his soul!<eos> And after their parents died, we took them in.
Just a ball?<eos> It's the prince's ball.<eos> I need a rich husband, and I'm never going to find him stuck in here.<eos> And if I don't find a husband who'll pay your bride price and mine, you'll never get to go be with your beloved nuns.<eos> I'd hardly call them beloved.
If Romeo Montague committed murder on our soil, then he should be put to death at the Crown's hand.<eos> There he is!<eos> We have too many enemies outside our city walls to turn the families within them against us.<eos> I cannot simply execute Lord Montague's only son.<eos> Then what do our laws mean, brother, if we won't enforce them?
Can you look at me?<eos> I want my meds.<eos> I need my meds.<eos> My brother has them.<eos> Please let me take them, and then get me out of here.
I've never come across a case quite like it.<eos> Mrs Wallace has made up her mind, and seems to believe that God approves of her actions.<eos> If I may venture an observation, when people seek the approval of the Almighty, it is generally because they fear they will not get it.<eos> Sister, you know as well as I do that many poor women have given children they cannot feed to relatives better placed to do so.<eos> And we have never condemned them.
What do you think I should do?<eos> I never thought that dragons would exist again.<eos> No one did.<eos> The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.<eos> Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.
I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me.<eos> They're not here now.<eos> - What are these?<eos> - My faces.<eos> - Where did you get them?
Days, weeks?<eos> And not one of them was reported missing.<eos> Scary.<eos> And you come and do your thing and they just go on about their lives.<eos> The whole town swallows them up like nothing ever happened.
An offer to buy it.<eos> I've accepted.<eos> I just need you to review these terms.<eos> I represent supplies in the farm-to-table business.<eos> We buy non-working farms and get them working again.
- Bye-bye now. - Take care. It's just one big flesh tube now, huh?<eos> Yep, okay, all right, buddy boy, here we go.<eos> You've come to the right place.<eos> Josh and Lucy's apartment is a crude and primitive world, but in some ways, beautiful.<eos> Now, what would you say if someone showed you these curtains and said they got them for only $200?
Sounds good.<eos> Yeah, just noodling.<eos> Wish my noodling sounded that good.<eos> So at the trial... I never believed those things I said.<eos> And I said them anyway.
- Be right there.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> These girls are going through hell.<eos> Anybody can see that.<eos> It's hard enough on 'em as it is without all this crap we're putting them through.
But we don't have a budget for focus groups.<eos> I could call a few of my friends.<eos> No.<eos> I know your friends.<eos> Get them all together in a room and we'd end up with a doobie-smoking vibrator orgy on our hands.
My son's name was Gabriel.<eos> After his grandfather.<eos> You know, I, I used to like to be in his room after he died.<eos> In his bed, you know, surrounded by all his things.<eos> The sheets still had his smell, and I used to wrap them around a pillow and pretend I was holding him.
I loved my mother, too.<eos> It was the residue of guilt, shame... Need.<eos> Love kept me at her bedside until she died.<eos> Nearly caused me to miss out on the greatest work humanity has ever undertaken.<eos> The protomolecule devours old constructs and recreates them.
And pick up the storyboards.<eos> We took care of that last night.<eos> You searched my house?<eos> Holland know you have them?<eos> I returned them the day after, but then I got to thinking, maybe I needed a little insurance.
Scribe.<eos> "I, Henry Tudor, King of England, "hereby, prohibit any English trade with Burgundy."<eos> There.<eos> That's for all the times that Yorkist duchess tried to catch me in her trap for Richard's executioner.<eos> You must decree the English Lords' reduce their guards, or they will form them into private armies and rise up at every tax you levy.
Shock me, pour cold water on me, inject my heart with adrenaline.<eos> - Adrenaline?<eos> - Yeah, I saw it in a movie.<eos> If there was something I could do to wake you up, I would have done it by now.<eos> Well, I just can't watch that lawyer tear them apart. Okay.
And... you know how seriously I take my job.<eos> You don't blame me for your current situation, do you?<eos> Remember who set you up in that cushy new office of yours?<eos> You and Alcala, you made promises.<eos> And I kept them.
You're not the only one who's hurting here.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> As I was saying. Dr. Harris shared two other options.<eos> And why are we just hearing about them, Ted?
[sighs] Yeah, but Gary tasted so good.<eos> - Again, tiny balls.<eos> - We can't kill people, Sheila.<eos> I know.<eos> What if I just ate pieces of people, and then we let them go?
And do you have a receipt for this replacement laptop?<eos> I don't care about that paperwork shit.<eos> You'd have to ask my business manager.<eos> But I had my patients' records fully backed up at my office.<eos> So I just transferred them to my new PC.
- Emotionally similar.<eos> Some of the photos and videos are over a decade old.<eos> The FBI just confirmed that the photographs and videos all originated from multiple locations and have been actively traded for at least five years by a child porn ring.<eos> So we can feel confident that Gavin Jacobs, or someone he blackmailed, did not create any of those images.<eos> Well, they collected them, though, ma'am.
She's as tight as a nun's nip.<eos> Why are you moaning?<eos> She loves you.<eos> She loves my profit.<eos> She loves my pert heavers. She'll have them worn to sagging, and for what?
Yeah, go ahead.<eos> Turn that little thing up there.<eos> I thought you were looking for Lil Foster.<eos> I was on my way, but I stopped to get Hezzy's bones first.<eos> Faster we got them, faster his spirit could rest.
That's not the same as wanting him.<eos> It's more like the memory of him.<eos> Are you saying she doesn't deserve that?<eos> Is there a reason why you're holding on to them?<eos> Why you haven't spread them?
It's more like the memory of him.<eos> Are you saying she doesn't deserve that?<eos> Is there a reason why you're holding on to them?<eos> Why you haven't spread them?<eos> I kept them because nobody else wanted them.
Gretchen?<eos> If this was just about that, then I--I wouldn't be thinking twice. I would just tell him no.<eos> Then if you don't mind my asking, what is it about?<eos> My father thinks I have a better chance of getting past the bar if I'm not still working at the firm that hired Mike.<eos> But you're loyal to the people here, and you don't want to leave them.
You said you weren't a homicidal maniac.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Not yet.<eos> He's a bully.<eos> And where I come from, bullies take desperate young girls like your daughter and force them into prostitution.
I didn't kill him.<eos> Not yet.<eos> He's a bully.<eos> And where I come from, bullies take desperate young girls like your daughter and force them into prostitution.<eos> And when they finally get knocked up, they peddle them to johns who get off on that.
Not yet.<eos> He's a bully.<eos> And where I come from, bullies take desperate young girls like your daughter and force them into prostitution.<eos> And when they finally get knocked up, they peddle them to johns who get off on that.<eos> After they have the kid, they push them right back out on the streets even before they have a chance to heal.
And they've already decided on your punishment.<eos> No.<eos> You're being sent to a nunnery.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Thanks to the laws of our faith and my friends at the Vatican who enforce them, it's already been done.
Does this look familiar?<eos> Now let's find out when you last used OffKey.<eos> Then we'll run your cell to Chandler's house, see if it sets off an alert.<eos> While Commander Mason works with your phone, let's examine your choices.<eos> While you still have them, because if we trace back all the information on your OffKey app before you cooperate...
It is our right to protect ourselves, yes?<eos> May I see them?<eos> - He bought them. - Legally.<eos> I know.<eos> Please, he has never once fired them, and never wants to.
You can keep your shoes on.<eos> Want some baby carrots?<eos> 'Cause there's a lot of baby carrots.<eos> Baby carrots saved the carrot industry.<eos> People didn't even know they wanted them till they saw them.
Was it her favorite?"<eos> I was just full of questions, you know.<eos> Usually, he couldn't remember... which was hard for both of us.<eos> So, I just started making up stories.<eos> Sometimes I would share them... and then, sometimes they were just for me.
I'm looking for my chapstick.<eos> Oh, what, was that the first thing that popped into your head?<eos> Shane.<eos> It was the fries.<eos> I like to wait, so I can eat them with my burger.
But if you want to explain, We are obviously willing to listen. Okay.<eos> First off, I am not selling drugs.<eos> I am giving them away.<eos> With the purchase of one of my photos, You get free baggie of medicine.<eos> I'm calling them pot shots.
If not...<eos> Did you ever get a report back on the fingerprints?<eos> It's inconclusive.<eos> You're very good.<eos> After I heard what the girl said, I took the pills from Lawrence's bedroom and I put them in Eric's.
Like I said, Richard, my focus here is Sam Dalton.<eos> Or anyone else who's committed a crime.<eos> I refuse to betray the group.<eos> Yeah, but you're okay betraying three innocent victims?<eos> Three women who go to sleep at night and wonder if the cops are ever gonna catch the son of a bitch who attacked them.
I have to.<eos> There's a... a patient I'm worried about.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you know the nurses up there. You just give them a call when you're ready.
No -- don't terminate anyone.<eos> I have to calibrate your settings down to something a little less lethal.<eos> My apologies.<eos> I only follow your directives.<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes you follow them a little too well.
But you are not strong enough.<eos> Then you must be strong enough for both of us.<eos> Go out amongst the harlots.<eos> Tell them no penitence is ever enough.<eos> For once they besmirch themselves, the stench will follow them their whole lives through.
- I can't.<eos> Every time I go out, RJ makes this face like, "Mommy, aren't I enough?"<eos> Ugh, babies are the worst.<eos> The trick is to not say goodbye to them.<eos> Alondra, you need to put on a crop top, go to a concert and shake those boobs for someone who doesn't just see them as dinner.
Come on. One of the wheels is frozen.<eos> Oh, uh, where are we taking it?<eos> There is an illegal chop shop like two rows down.<eos> Chop shop?<eos> They chop things up, not fix them.
We have tables?<eos> Tonight you are guests, just like everyone else.<eos> This is not an excuse to misbehave.<eos> Girls, don't you all look beautiful.<eos> Line them up, please.
Lovely.<eos> Please remove the damaged ones.<eos> Mrs. Waterford, ma'am. Whatever punishment these girls had to endure was for the greater good.<eos> They deserve to be honored just like everyone else.<eos> And we do honor them.
Zoe, uh, got her out.<eos> She was the only one.<eos> Those guards at the school were not gonna let those women go.<eos> We think, they were, um, looking for fertile women.<eos> Gathering them up.
Our dock is a half mile down river, if you change your mind.<eos> Let me show you something.<eos> The town fought back.<eos> They tried to hide the fertile women in here.<eos> The Guardians took them and strung everyone else up.
Wow.<eos> What did she say to that?<eos> She said "Get out of my Range Rover".<eos> Well, you know how women don't want men telling them they CAN'T have an abortion?<eos> I don't think they like you to encourage them to have one either.
I couldn't compete, so they eliminated me, and it filled me with disdain, almost hate.<eos> Hate is nature's most perfect energy source.<eos> It's endlessly renewable.<eos> I don't want to lean into that feeling.<eos> You know the rider in the bicycle movie who, just when he has victory in sight, takes his hands off the bars and just holds them out like this, taking in the sun, gliding, letting all the other racers whiz by him just because?
He's an American rapper.<eos> I'm British, not elderly.<eos> No, listen, our system gives us trouble when it comes to opening security doors...?<eos> You mean like... this?<eos> Can you open all of them simultaneously?
Maybe something happened to her when they got back from that dinner party.<eos> When Eddie went to Homerton Hospital with Julie-Ann, did he have crutches?<eos> According to Teresa O'Duncie's statement... he did, yeah.<eos> But Julie-Ann's injuries...?<eos> Julie-Ann didn't have them then.
And he looks like a little boy.<eos> Anyway, in The Big Bust-Out 5, there's this super hot noire named Sapphire, huh?<eos> And, uh, she gets the guards to open up the door for her by asking for dinner.<eos> And when they do, she's so grateful, she lets 'em spit roast her right in the cafeteria.<eos> So we get them to bring us dinner.
- And a very handsome leg it was.<eos> Before I knew it, the leeches were attacking me.<eos> - Terrible!<eos> - [both] Ghastly!<eos> I fought them off as best I could.
Bad, bad science man!<eos> Oh, the cuffs.<eos> Fun, huh?<eos> Patent pending.<eos> It's funny 'cause Shark Tank turned them down.
Let's get out of here!<eos> Oh, so it went well?<eos> Jack Spheer's nano swarm ate my source. Oh, no.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Two people have died, and I didn't save them! - Okay.
- Sorry?<eos> If you're looking for coffee pouches, they're in the top cupboard.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Oh, and they're all good.<eos> I took the decaf packets and threw them away.
Thanks for coming.<eos> Thank you for asking.<eos> Blue, the traps.<eos> All right, yellow attracts the flies.<eos> And the Vaseline gets them stuck.
It's inexpensive and, truth be told, it's very, very clean.<eos> I mean, these girls were bad, you know, so...<eos> But Clay, he introduces us.<eos> And the... and the girls ask how we know each other.<eos> Clay looks at them with a straight face and says,
Well, the obvious... we find a real wall.<eos> You really are smiling, aren't you?<eos> Do you know why?<eos> You're an awesome tutor.<eos> When the Vikings invaded, they used to pull their longboats out of the water, turn them upside down and live in them as houses until they'd pillaged and looted enough to build new ones.
And the best instruction in the sciences. Eastern Europe has to offer.<eos> And what would your daughter do with such instruction?<eos> Chatter in her sewing circle? Mileva does not sew.<eos> She's up all night, filling her brain with things I can't begin to understand.<eos> Then how do you know she understands them?
Herr Professor.<eos> Mileva Maric.<eos> One doesn't lose track of the sole woman in the room.<eos> She's up all night, filling her brain with things I can't begin to understand.<eos> Then how do you know she understands them?
I'm sure you read in the papers of the Archduke's assassination.<eos> Shocking news.<eos> They're saying it was at the hands of a Serb, protesting Austria's annexation of Bosnia.<eos> Do you think we'll continue to see anarchy in the Slavic territories?<eos> In my opinion, Dr. Haber, I imagine the Slavic nations will continue to defend against anyone who views them as mere "territories" to be acquired.
But you do know Claude.<eos> I-I want to learn what she enjoys.<eos> Something we might share together.<eos> She loves the stars.<eos> When we were children, she used to gaze at them for hours, deep into the night.
Mary is in an unnatural position.<eos> Women are not suited to rule.<eos> It distorts their feminine virtues.<eos> Hardens their temperaments.<eos> Makes them unaccommodating and caustic.
Children are so motivated these days.<eos> These snacks are delicious.<eos> Spicy. Cheesy. Crunchy.<eos> Great. Even the adults have lost their minds.<eos> The President of the United States sent them.
What are you asking me, honey?<eos> Hey.<eos> Loman, uh, find the stash?<eos> Yeah, over 500 counterfeit pills.<eos> Testing them for Fentanyl.
What did she do?<eos> Pickpocket, prowls the Wall Street happy hours.<eos> Takes over 10 grand.<eos> You sure about the cameras?<eos> Yeah, the firm only installed them in the supply room to deter employee theft.
It's gotta be exhausting, right?<eos> The lying, the running.<eos> Aren't you both tired?<eos> These people are murderers.<eos> They skin people alive... or they... they hang them from bridges to make a point, or if... if they want someone to just... disappear... they dissolve their bodies in acid.
What is it that the scientists say?<eos> For each action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<eos> Nuclear weapons are the obstacle to world peace, not its solution.<eos> But they exist.<eos> Well, I think the best way to ensure they're never used is to give control of them to the scientists who made them.
Your Honor...<eos> Counselors, please approach the bench.<eos> Hi, John.<eos> You know why I came down here... in the first place, started my career?<eos> I always thought I'd be somebody that left things better than I found them.
- Oh, Mylanta.<eos> Why do you guys have that stuff hanging from your ears?<eos> We're wearing them out of pity.<eos> Cecelia made us these earrings out of garbage. I know.<eos> I threw all those things out because one of my students kept putting them on his...
Criminals were put into hypersleep and given Nightblood to protect against solar radiation.<eos> Nice of her to share that with our ancestors on the Ark.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The Nightblood protein chains are broken.<eos> How did she get them to bind to the blood cells?
"came to a place where a brave boy called Hamnet lived,<eos> "called Stratford.<eos> "All the girls were crying,<eos> "so Hamnet killed the dragon with his sword<eos> "and saved them all,
No.<eos> So it ends like this, freezing cold, with no one.<eos> A sad man's death.<eos> An old man who is loathed has this death.<eos> "All the girls were crying, "so Hamnet killed the dragon and saved them all.
- Damn it.<eos> - Before you ask, no. No luck with the adoption records. No luck with the hospital.<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> Your wards are airtight.<eos> - You complained, so I fixed them.
Tumbleweed.<eos> I'm not even gonna ask about the sword.<eos> What are you doing with Mom's pills?<eos> - I can explain. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I was stealing them.
And you all... you know me.<eos> You know I was here with you after that.<eos> What I can tell you... is that nobody was more upset and concerned about what happened than the Hesbys.<eos> The Hesbys don't do these things because they have to.<eos> We do them because they are right.
As a result, I am now able to describe, in some detail, the full reach and grim sordidness of Mr Paul Pennyfeather's despicable crimes.<eos> What are those crimes?<eos> Beneath that seemingly fresh face lies the dark, stale soul of a man who delights in prospering from the sexual slavery of young women.<eos> Beyond imagination is the full extent of his unholy violations.<eos> But I have them listed, here.
- Wait a minute...<eos> - We have no idea where this will send us.<eos> Risk nothing, get nothing.<eos> Look, these ships are weapons in our own backyard.<eos> I need to know who controls them.
All clear.<eos> Okay, check your weapons.<eos> I need one body in that hall drawing fire.<eos> The rest of us are gonna circle around and outflank them.<eos> Take them by surprise.
Where's the car?<eos> Adrian?<eos> - I gave you the keys, Adrian! - I don't have them!<eos> I...<eos> I swear I had them near me when I... I...
But this rise of the dead, that caught us by surprise.<eos> - You seem to be managing.<eos> We're fairly self-sustaining.<eos> Yeah, and heavily armed.<eos> Yeah, no sense having all these resources if you can't protect them.
Patience, on the other hand, well, that's a different story.<eos> Let's just say that I, er... painfully mastered patience.<eos> For the Queen.<eos> You must have a million emotions.<eos> Can you describe them for us?
Well, sometimes.<eos> [imitating Amy] "Adam, wash your tennis shoes.<eos> "They're disgusting." [Jonah chuckles]<eos> Okay, well, they are disgusting 'cause there was a family of spiders living in them, so...<eos> Okay, well, they're my shoes, and I paid for them, so it's kind of none of your business.
So they made me sit shoulder-by-shoulder with another kid and then put our arms around each other.<eos> They called it 'healing touch, ' though, of course, all I could think about<eos> Enough.<eos> There was a sympathetic counselor.<eos> He made copies, smuggled them out.
So are you.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry... about the people you lost.<eos> I didn't know most of them.
Damn fine lady.<eos> Mm. That's why you didn't get a snow globe.<eos> No business trip.<eos> Oh, I haven't thought of those snow globes in a million years.<eos> Yeah, we just were unpacking all of them.
- Oh, yeah!<eos> - This feels good.<eos> - Why do shoes cost so much money?<eos> ! - He wasn't so perfect!<eos> He loved them and he was fucking them!
- Thank you very much.<eos> - Oh, my!<eos> Look at those curtains.<eos> Where can I get those?<eos> I made them from my husband's death shroud.
The jewel of Wessex.<eos> Uhtred is expecting you.<eos> There is a way, lord, from the holy books.<eos> Then do it.<eos> Uhtred is with the women, lord, helping them prepare food.
- Fetched you some eggs.<eos> Couldn't find any boxes.<eos> Eh, thanks, love.<eos> Look at them.<eos> I'll have them with a little bit of toast.
Everybody off!<eos> Wait. Wait. Wait.<eos> Those are chau's clippers.<eos> Shit!<eos> They must smuggle the people through, sell them back to chau, she doubles her profits.
Polizeifuhre, Fraulein Adler.<eos> Obviously, yesterday was not a day to be proud of.<eos> The Resistance clearly knew the action was coming.<eos> They had inside information, which means the leak among the Jewish workers in the office was not caught quickly enough.<eos> I never wanted them here in the first place.
Dr. Miller said this would happen sooner or later.<eos> Price of doing business.<eos> Hey, so, uh, did you figure out what's wrong with this guy?<eos> Something is definitely off.<eos> You know, he takes light bulbs and smashes them onto himself during his wrestling matches?
Megan,<eos> I want you to see something.<eos> This is your narrative board.<eos> It has two sides.<eos> And as we talk, we're going to identify the lies you tell yourself, and you're gonna write them on this side of the board.
So, how about we talk about that silo?<eos> And the munitions you were keeping there.<eos> Certainly.<eos> They are Russian-made land mines, 300,000 of them, flooded the market after Russia pulled out of Afghanistan.<eos> Browning Reed bought them, legally, and used them for our Demining training.
If anyone could get him to remember, it would be me.<eos> Let's get some fresh eyes on this, that's all I'm saying. All right, see what you can do, Nas.<eos> Patterson's got something.<eos> All right, these torus tattoos are like fraternal twins, mostly similar.<eos> But if you look closely at the differences and drop them into a grid, the symbols create an alphanumeric sequence. I found 11 grids worth.
illness, war zones.<eos> Unlike a normal brain, Roman's reacted the same to both... neutrally.<eos> His memory's been wiped, his brain's not going to act normal.<eos> Automatic reactions like that are engrained early.<eos> Amnesia would not take them away.
Good. Let's see how Roman feels about this.<eos> Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> This is a chance to prove your value to the team and get you out of this cage.<eos> Don't you want that? Of course I do, but... I don't remember these people.<eos> You remembered them this morning, just by looking at a photo and listening to an engine motor.
- Hey.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Good, good.<eos> Just, um, seeing how you're feeling about the lines.<eos> I know you're learning them on short notice, so...
Yeah. Funny.<eos> Nobody could make me laugh like him.<eos> That's nice that you could remember the good times.<eos> I mean, I... I remember the events.<eos> But the feelings I've lost them.
- Close your eyes.<eos> All right, now, I want you to picture the love of your life.<eos> Imagine that you have 30 seconds to win her back.<eos> One shot, three sentences.<eos> What are those sentences, and who are you saying them to?
Yes.<eos> Michael Farmer doesn't hold a driving licence.<eos> He's never held a driving licence.<eos> He's never owned a car, neither has his grandmother.<eos> I'm familiar with those findings, and naturally, I gave them consideration.
He's one of the most prolific serial killers ever.<eos> He's also one of the escaped convicts from that mass prison break last year.<eos> He had something like 40 victims, right?<eos> 47 that were recovered, but he claims to have killed over 100.<eos> He kidnapped his female victims, starved them for days, and then cut out their reproductive organs, hence the nickname.
- Yeah.<eos> Plus, I don't like it when people tell me what not to do.<eos> Another thing we have in common.<eos> Well, they did say we were a perfect match, so...<eos> I asked my friends for some trashy magazines, but instead they brought in those, and then they wallpapered the place with them which kinda makes it look like I like staring at pictures of myself, which is kinda bizarre.
Yeah.<eos> How are you getting on, son?<eos> Both Roz and Nick Huntley's cars have shown up all over town, but both their movements check out only with their known haunts - home, work.<eos> I reckon Roz knows the locations of the ANPR cameras.<eos> Yeah. And avoided them all, the wee witch.
Electrons in your brain sending signals.<eos> Are you familiar with ophiocordyceps unilateralis?<eos> It's a fungus that infects ants.<eos> It's amazing, really.<eos> The spores take over their central nervous systems and force them to climb to a high point, and then the fungus begins to grow up, bursting from the tops of their heads like a branch.

- Stop.<eos> That I am establishing that his whole motivation is... Stop!<eos> That's enough.<eos> You've done enough damage to the witness.<eos> If you have any more questions, ask them.
Even that hour you made me wait in the car.<eos> Well, that's the problem with sober parties.<eos> There's no alcohol to dilute the insanity.<eos> Are all your work events like this? Yes.<eos> That's why we keep them to a minimum.
Oh, I hope it's not Norteguay.<eos> Well, that's just bad as North Korea.<eos> And Norteguay's been rattling their sabers at the U.S. ever since that last round of sanctions.<eos> Threatening to kidnap our scarediest geeks?<eos> But their threats are nonspecific, and their dictator, Alejandro Durante, he calls them "earth-shattering."
If we don't do something soon, it's the same as letting him fall!<eos> That's it.<eos> We let him fall.<eos> I am so sorry. Some of the acid must've fallen on his head and it's eating his brain.<eos> Those safety nets you have, we tie them together, we stretch them across the sinkhole, we cut the cables, we let the silo drop onto the nets and catch it, and then Joe gets out to safety.
- Right after I fixed it.<eos> - You fixed it?<eos> Yeah. I picked up a few skills at the theatre so I thought I'd bring them home and use them here.<eos> Well, how did you find hinges to match these exactly?<eos> Stephanie said Cassie picked them out from her store.
Sometimes they come with vivid detail.<eos> Others are more... Impressionistic.<eos> How do you get these visions?<eos> They're not mine.<eos> I don't see them.
We're saying that we are too boring to appreciate them properly...<eos> - Is what I'm going with.<eos> - Jake, I agree with you.<eos> Pilsners are boring.<eos> That's why I don't drink them anymore.
Nobody wakes up thinking, "My world will explode today."<eos> "My world will change."<eos> Nobody thinks that.<eos> But, sometimes, it happens.<eos> Sometimes, we wake up, we face our fears... We take them by the hand.
It was an accident.<eos> Yeah, that's okay, son.<eos> Clothes can be cleaned up and there's plenty of wine.<eos> He always said that he wanted us to be perfect, but he lived for the imperfections.<eos> Saw them as opportunities
Okay, maybe you were.<eos> I'm just saying you need to be realistic about the dangers we face.<eos> Agent Thomas, I have something you might like to see.<eos> These letters were penned by General Washington.<eos> I've read them all before, of course... but I missed something... a cipher that has revealed new information.
By drawing those symbols.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> It was my fault. I should have just been honest with you.<eos> I should have just given you answers, instead of making you go looking for them on your own.
Dale, with your business acumen, you'll be able to help us with the business side of it.<eos> And the girls will have a summer job.<eos> And Chip will add the toppings.<eos> And I'll come by every once in a while.<eos> I'll not only cut and curl the fries, but I'll fry them.
That's a no-go.<eos> So we'll leave the way I came in.<eos> Don't move.<eos> See, this is why I hate guns.<eos> And this is why I love them.
My contemporaries mock me, but we'll be laughing when we find the gold.<eos> Here are the maps of the areas we'll be searching from our respective boats.<eos> These are our pirate vessels?<eos> Sturdy 40-foot fishing vessels.<eos> Just had them serviced.
I'm still what's inside of you.<eos> I am all that will ever be there.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> All those things in my life you can't stand looking at... they're real.<eos> And now that I have them, you will never take them away from me.
All those women?<eos> I have to go.<eos> No.<eos> - Stop. - You're you're scaring me.<eos> I washed them in holy water.
Sam's car's moving...<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> Sam?<eos> Sam! I need your car keys right now.<eos> - I don't have them.
- Mary...<eos> - I know.<eos> I know.<eos> But these people need me, okay?<eos> No one else will help them.
He loved me, but he married me to be like everybody else.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> Oh, his love letters.<eos> They were beautiful.<eos> And I burnt them.
Throwing away a good shirt?<eos> See, the bat is askew.<eos> I can re-stitch this in two minutes, make it good as new.<eos> And ever since then, Luz and I have been business partners.<eos> We buy defective shirts at the outlet mall, fix them, and sell them to kids in Norwalk for a profit.
Those pipes sound like somebody let an octopus loose in the Williams-Sonoma.<eos> I know, Mom, but if you're gonna stay clean today, you're gonna need to control your temper.<eos> I'm your kindness Sherpa, remember?<eos> Yes, you're right.<eos> But just so you know, as soon as the New Year is over, I'm going to steal those chimes and drop them in the bottom of the ocean.
I'm your kindness Sherpa, remember?<eos> Yes, you're right.<eos> But just so you know, as soon as the New Year is over, I'm going to steal those chimes and drop them in the bottom of the ocean.<eos> I know you will, Mom.<eos> - Hide them where no one can find them.
But just so you know, as soon as the New Year is over, I'm going to steal those chimes and drop them in the bottom of the ocean.<eos> I know you will, Mom.<eos> - Hide them where no one can find them.<eos> - Okay, Mom.<eos> Wrap them in chains, drive them to the pier, and then I'm gonna drop them off...
I wish we were at war.<eos> These are the place settings for the wedding.<eos> Much more dangerous.<eos> How's Josh doing in the royal kitchens?<eos> Uh... he's declared them "adequate."
I'm going out to dinner.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> With who?<eos> - A friend.<eos> Okay, your only friends are cows, and you eat them.
Oh, I've seen better in the Olympics.<eos> Oh! Oh, my God, Ella's next!<eos> We are running a jam with Ella Kellogg on the piano.<eos> Does Brad Jr. have fake eyelashes on?<eos> Ella is wearing them, yes.
You hear him sometimes shooting his guns in his garden.<eos> Not last night.<eos> Hello.<eos> I believe you wish to talk to me.<eos> Does your brother always leave his guns out or does he lock them away?
What are you doing here?<eos> Well, you weren't in your office, and your ringer was off, so I had Abby ping your phone.<eos> I got pinged? Mm-hmm. That is so awesome.<eos> Recordings from last night.<eos> We need to get back so you can translate them.
I can't think. I can't listen. I just freeze.<eos> But... don't worry.<eos> I have a strategy.<eos> Floor here's kind of sticky.<eos> Did you know that some frogs have pads on their feet that secrete a thin layer of mucus so to help them climb things?
_<eos> Look, I'm in the middle of something.<eos> Can we do this later?<eos> Now is good.<eos> I tell you to stay away from Mary's kids, and you take them to that punk-ass godson of yours.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Where did your gut feeling get me and Mary?<eos> They need a manager like me. - Stop.<eos> - You stop.<eos> You had those girls, and you lost them.
They need a manager like me. - Stop.<eos> - You stop.<eos> You had those girls, and you lost them.<eos> They know that?<eos> They know why you lost them?
Y'all heard that?<eos> Baby, we in there this year.<eos> We winning.<eos> And don't be late.<eos> Them Scissor Siblings, baby, they don't even know what I'm gonna to do to them.
Sometimes I get all up in my head.<eos> I start thinking bad things, and then bad things happen.<eos> I think all secrets are best buried.<eos> Help me get these girls through this murder, and forgive me for the sins I commit along the way.<eos> I know you looking after them, 'cause it's clear I can't stop this girl group thing from happening.
Okay, with my ma it's a little complicated, all right?<eos> What was that?<eos> What-What are you doing?<eos> Sorry, I thought I just heard your big balls roll onto the floor.<eos> I was looking for them.
It's low-tech, but it's highly effective.<eos> Big boom, lots of fire.<eos> Okay, so the first car drops the explosive.<eos> And it causes the bodyguards to scramble with Hill.<eos> Which pushes them out into the open.
Hey, if you're gonna be in my selfie, the least you can do is smile.<eos> Or at least do something more flattering with those legs.<eos> Another universal sign coming at you.<eos> I'll crop you out.<eos> The only reason she bought those chairs is because I wanted them.
Well, thank you, Chloe.<eos> I thought this was gonna be, like, a whole...<eos> I just need you to answer one question, though.<eos> There she is.<eos> Did I steal these chairs or did I get them fair and square?
I just need you to answer one question, though.<eos> There she is.<eos> Did I steal these chairs or did I get them fair and square?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Did I steal these chairs or did I get them fair and square?
Oh, God.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What you brought me here to do... mess with people.<eos> Billy, why did you take the scissors?<eos> Oh! Okay. I found them!
My stupid friend Billy did.<eos> Apologize.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> W-Why are you taking their side?<eos> I mean... you're the one who's always bagging on them.
Mom, help!<eos> Like most brothers, when we got together, we didn't always make the brightest of decisions.<eos> What are you two dopes doing?<eos> Deciding which college we should go to.<eos> We taped 18 hours' worth of "USA Up All Night" movies and carefully studied them all.
Just pretend I'm the HOA.<eos> Tell me an idea you have for the Neighborhood Watch.<eos> I think we should put up security cameras in the cul-de-sac.<eos> No, that's too expensive.<eos> We buy them wholesale using funds from the October car wash!
The Stars (Are Out Tonight), the song, is about David's attitude towards celebrities.<eos> He's had a good dose of other people's celebrity, which he found distasteful.<eos> He had different things on his mind he'd been ruminating over and it was all coming out now, it was like he was birthing this stuff.<eos> He was trying a lot of things, he had to flex his muscles to get back in shape, like a runner or an athlete, that's what he had to do.<eos> You know, we just would throw these songs at the musicians, they'd never heard them before.
So what now?<eos> Now we cover our tracks. I'll do this.<eos> You finish with the tools.<eos> What about the safes?<eos> We'll open them up when things have cooled down a bit.
Yes, well, let's get out of here first, and we can ponder that later.<eos> I've nearly got it!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> He's got a heart condition!<eos> Those pills - I found them in Carrie's hand.
I'm not officially a pastor yet.<eos> In one way, that sums up my being here, and why I'm coming to the night vigil.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - The council has rules.<eos> - Your church does not comply with them.
Larry Henderson may seem to be a harmless, affable, bewildered poet.<eos> But believe you me, beneath this calm facade brews the violent tempest of a man who took the words "...till death do us part" all to literally when he extinguished the life of Margaret Henderson.<eos> Disagree. But she is a lyricist.<eos> What happened to your shoes? !<eos> They didn't match so I hid them in the bushes.
The judge's docket is backed up, So he's going with a blind strike voir dire. To speed things up.<eos> I love the blind strike.<eos> What the hell's a blind strike?<eos> Well, normally, attorneys take turns. Striking jurors in open court, but...<eos> But with blind strikes, Each side makes their lists in private. Then we give them to the judge at the same time,
For your son?<eos> He presented me with Trevor's medals in a black leather box.<eos> Kid sent 'em back.<eos> You still have yours?<eos> I threw them away years ago.
We understand he had over $30,000 in us bills on him.<eos> Counterfeit bills.<eos> Untraceable.<eos> We'd like to review any eyewitness reports.<eos> Well, I'll forward them from the police prefecture if you tell me why you are so interested in a random Hit-and-Run.
Listen to me.<eos> Please, believe me.<eos> When I went back to the room, Corina was already dead.<eos> We have your fingerprints on her neck.<eos> Because they put them there.
Age, coloring, vanished off the streets.<eos> But the difference is a big one.<eos> The first two vics were runaways, addicts. Turned tricks.<eos> Classic street life.<eos> Nobody out there looking for them.
Okay?<eos> It's not about my knees, okay?<eos> You're not getting a boob job.<eos> Your mom's not here, and I'm not signing off on it.<eos> My mom bought them for me.
Now, this is Maxwell Clay, AKA Gold Fish.<eos> This guy has priors for gun and narcotics possession.<eos> And three months ago, he bought a batch of over 20 guns from Agent Tucker, including the .45 that was used to kill Rebecca Clark.<eos> This guy preparing for war?<eos> Well, he's his own mini-straw buyer, so he buys the guns from Tucker and sells them out of his bar.
So just say it.<eos> How to find the words...<eos> Well, uh... well... when we found Scott's bones... well, I-I panicked, and I-I, uh... I kind...<eos> Well, I...<eos> I moved them on to your side a little bit.
I moved them on to your side a little bit.<eos> What?<eos> Well-well, they were kind of on the line, so I just...<eos> I just... I kind of... I...<eos> I just scootched them over a little bit, and... Look, I've felt horrible about it ever since, but it... the case is closed, so, it's over, right?
You better start talking, Reznik.<eos> You better tell us who you hand those girls off to, or you'll never see the outside of a jail cell again.<eos> I don't know who.<eos> They don't want me to know who, in case I get caught.<eos> I get them from Hayes.
You just don't understand!<eos> Help me understand, Gordon, what were you doing outside Dr. Wade's house.<eos> I need my meds.<eos> Get me my meds!<eos> I'm getting them.
It uses cellphones as a location array.<eos> Once you activate it, it transmits a signal that is relayed by any live cellular device in its proximity.<eos> Aram's keys weren't at his apartment.<eos> Right.<eos> Which means he probably still has them with him.
Last night, Andi gave me a foot massage under false pretenses.<eos> I had to "ooh" and "ah" and pretend I was into it.<eos> I faked it.<eos> Look, there's no other way to avoid getting our wives mad.<eos> Well, I have a thought: you could just not do the things that make them mad.
Well, we bounced back with Emme.<eos> Hey, I need a hot dog.<eos> Want grilled onions?<eos> Takes a little longer.<eos> Well, I'm kind of in a hurry, but, yeah, I want them.
And why can't you do it?<eos> Because I can't say "Black-light my world!" if I'm the one black-lighting my world, okay?<eos> So... black-light my world.<eos> Sometimes healed scars are invisible in normal light.<eos> What caused them?
Right, because your shoe is so much bulkier to fit into these little slots.<eos> Let's see if this helps him.<eos> Air Force Ken has no shoes on right now.<eos> Oh, my gosh, he's now holding his shoes in his mouth.<eos> Why don't you just drop them at this point?
Thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> So I'm only 17 now, but I will be able to vote in the next election... or, since I don't see any women up there, maybe even run.<eos> Okay, so... there are active oil and gas wells all over the city, most within 2,000 feet of homes and schools and hospitals.<eos> Only drilling companies cover them up with buildings so people don't know what's happening right next to them.
What about the fact that you're Jewish?<eos> Get me Sy Green in the music department.<eos> And have some invitations made.<eos> We're throwing a party. Right away, Mr. Stahr.<eos> You took the Nazis' own words and put them into the mouths of criminals and madmen.
Numbers! Numbers... right.<eos> Our patient-per-day ratio may be barely down, but that's because Pat gives the doctors more time to spend with each patient, and because of that, our re-hospitalization rate is down and our overall morbidity and mortality rates,<eos> because Pat knows how important patient care is.<eos> Yeah. And when the nurses union needed more manageable hours,<eos> Pat gave them to us because he knew it was the right thing to do.
We've been interrogating the captured members of the Virginia Field Force, but it's slow going.<eos> Why is that?<eos> The VFF was not a typical anti-government militia.<eos> Once they merged with Covenant of John, they became a doomsday cult.<eos> So, we're not just questioning these men, we're deprogramming them.
Same here.<eos> - Now, that's what I call a party.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will got them for me.
- Now, that's what I call a party.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will got them for me.<eos> You know where he got them?
Jasper!<eos> Jasper!<eos> Don't leave!<eos> I'll give you your cigarettes back!<eos> I'll give them back, yeah.
- Tandy?<eos> - Cigarettes?<eos> - You've got to be kidding me!<eos> - What? Jasper, where'd you get all those cigarettes?<eos> Come on, Tandy, we all know where he got them!
Look in the hole!<eos> Oh my... Damn!<eos> Elliot, you can't go makin' a hole in the wall every time you hallucinate on hard drugs!<eos> If I did that, my apartment would look like Swiss cheese.<eos> Oh my god... you know how we look at really successful people, and they're like smart, and rich, and happy, and we hate them?
I love you, too, Rogelio.<eos> That we'd end up here.<eos> We've been through so much together and so much without each other.<eos> And life is beautiful and hard, and the only thing I know for sure is that I want to go through it all with you.<eos> I had Botox this morning, so the tears are struggling to fall, but I feel them.
Okay, I have some preliminary wedding ideas.<eos> Totally off the cuff.<eos> You know, I might have some ideas, too.<eos> But of course.<eos> I welcome them.
Heard you did quite a job backing up your partner, Sebastian.<eos> I don't know what came over me. It's like I had superpowers.<eos> What did Mitchell Castor have to say?<eos> Well, Kelly's the one who brought him into the operation.<eos> Plan was to dump the drugs in the ocean, marked with geotrackers, then the buyers would collect them later in a small boat.
And all that before.<eos> You act like you barely know me.<eos> Two days in this school and you're so worried what the girls in hijabs think of ya.<eos> Look, Missy, they're me mates.<eos> You don't know them, like I don't know your mates.
That I killed nine other women.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - Yes. But not Alice.<eos> Did you hate those women?<eos> I didn't know them.
Sure, I got it plugged in time.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe there is something to genetics.<eos> Your DNA didn't buy those pills.<eos> Your DNA didn't make you swallow them.
Agent Zapata's cell was turned back on briefly just long enough for us to trace it.<eos> She's sending up a flare.<eos> - What's the address, Stuart?<eos> - 219 Prospect Way, an abandoned warehouse in the Bronx.<eos> I've got the blueprints. I'm sending them now.
They're all credit unions that don't have counter-to-ceiling bullet-proof teller windows. - Okay.<eos> - All right, so I've narrowed it down...<eos> these green pieces signify the last three banks downtown that don't have teller glass, and they're all within a few blocks of freeway entrances or Lakeshore Drive, which makes it real easy for a motorcycle to just disappear.<eos> All right. Get Jay and Erin hip to this. Break up into teams.<eos> Check out these banks and their surveillance cameras, see if anyone's casing them.
We live in divided times.<eos> But the time for that divide is over.<eos> Today the FBI and the CIA worked together to help keep our country safe.<eos> Now, this was your mother's legacy. And I commend her for blazing this trail... Seeing that we work stronger together, instead of against one another.<eos> So, we will not only rebuild both our intelligence agencies from scratch, we will combine them to help rebuild the faith and trust of the American people.
Let's play this out, because she will not lose to you twice.<eos> She already said that this wasn't about the two of you being the same.<eos> Then she's all about the game.<eos> She thinks that I cheated last time because I lied about her dad, so it's integral to her that she beats me by following the rules.<eos> Yeah, but, Spence, she controls the rules, and she will change them to ensure that she wins.
A moment?<eos> Will you excuse me, please?<eos> ♪ I like the sunshine... ♪ Now, look, if this about those stolen guns, now is not the best time.<eos> Someone was killed with one of your guns, Mr. Bancroft.<eos> And if we don't find out who stole them real soon, more will likely die.
It's the end of the line.<eos> Let me do this.<eos> If I'm successful, you'll have more benefits as the boss.<eos> If I fail... I'm going to die anyway.<eos> Rules are rules. And you broke all of them.
I received all your letters, and I do like your mustache.<eos> I've been doing all your arm exercises.<eos> Thank you, but those won't work on your fat arms.<eos> How do you know my arms are fat?<eos> I deliberately left them out of all the photos.
- So, did you guys... ?<eos> - No, he was a gentleman.<eos> Eh, well, I just tuned out.<eos> It was weird...<eos> He asked me all these questions and listened to the answers and then remembered them and mentioned them later.
It's a good question.<eos> I might be able to shed some light.<eos> In 1987, when new citizens were sworn in at the Bennett Courthouse, it was customary to give them pocket-sized copies of the Constitution.<eos> These were on display at Ms. Spivey's memorial.<eos> I borrowed them, along with this photograph of the victims taken shortly before the shooting started.
I have more emotions than you.<eos> I have them.<eos> I'm having one right now.<eos> She really left you?<eos> We will not only rebuild both our agencies from scratch, but we will combine them.
Federal agent.<eos> Put the canister down slow.<eos> And then let me see those hands.<eos> Easy.<eos> Let me see them!
Even when I was a kid, I loved girls.<eos> I loved them.<eos> And there was all--<eos> When I was 12, I discovered that girls are the greatest thing.<eos> I would ask them out.
And there was all--<eos> When I was 12, I discovered that girls are the greatest thing.<eos> I would ask them out.<eos> That's what I did.<eos> I walked up and asked them out.
So it can blend into its surroundings, even when it's in motion.<eos> See that tree?<eos> If the snake came in through there, ate the wolf, it would look like it just disappeared.<eos> Snakes don't just gulp their prey.<eos> They crush them to death first, and then slowly eat them.
If that was all we had, you would be correct.<eos> But it isn't.<eos> Couple weeks ago, Roy Booker purchased a mixture of Chinese herbs.<eos> They're meant to, uh, flush the body of toxins.<eos> Some people use them as a detox prior to a workplace drug test.
You don't think I've enough to deal with?<eos> Can you not leave that?<eos> We've got to find out what he's done with his pills.<eos> What do you think he's done, Nicole?<eos> He's chucked them.
The blinds have more than 40 slats, but he never goes below the 26th one.<eos> 26 letters in the alphabet.<eos> Four different gears on this model of Enigma.<eos> Four blinds flipped every day.<eos> Anyone looking up at his window could see them.
Now, we're still connecting the dots, but two of them were obvious rivals to your consulting business.<eos> The others worked in related fields and must have crossed you somehow, so you had them killed by SBK.<eos> What is it gonna take for you to understand I have nothing to do with SBK?<eos> All these people died during the last two years.<eos> You don't know them, but you know the dates of their deaths?
Not that I wasn't happy to hear you were in Bronxville, but why did you want me to meet you here?<eos> I arrived a short while ago to test a theory.<eos> I think Luke Munro may have used one of the chains on these swings to choke Mira Tunney.<eos> As you can see, testing my theory has proved impossible.<eos> So, whoever took them did so a short while ago.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> So what they're saying is true?<eos> Is it you?<eos> W-What did you do, Harry?<eos> ! He sold the names of three very wealthy and powerful people to an international consortium that wanted them dead.
Augusta!<eos> Whoa! That's where they play The Masters.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's a tradition unlike any other.<eos> And why do you have them?
When I say SBK will be gone, he can take that as a fact.<eos> And when... can I tell him that you have set your sights on him?<eos> The message, see that he gets it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I think what happened to these people is a tragedy, but I don't know them.
The current was not that strong.<eos> You weren't supposed... I told you, don't go out there.<eos> Dude, you're supposed to be this great swimmer, right?<eos> Nobody was supposed to be out there.<eos> Okay, it's kind of like at Lollapalooza. Like, do you remember when you... like, you were so drunk and, like, you were trying to drink and drive, and I was trying to stop you, so then I pinned you down and I, like, took your keys and I fucking threw them into the field
To make the world better.<eos> Start with me, and I'll start with you.<eos> I think I might like you.<eos> So there were devil engines in her house, Bishop?<eos> I saw them with my own eyes.
I'm, uh... I'm not a fancy person.<eos> I don't, um...<eos> You know, I'm wearing a onesie.<eos> I'm not...<eos> I have friends that love jewelry, and I love them.
God, or the universe, or nature, or whatever the fuck, created this anxiety-ridden... paranoid cokehead... that thinks that everybody wants their acorns.<eos> Nobody wants your acorns.<eos> No one else in the world eats acorns.<eos> Only you.<eos> That they hide them everywhere.
It literally sucks the life out of you.<eos> Look, I know those last two jokes, they aren't smart.<eos> They have nothing deep to say.<eos> They're just wordplay.<eos> But I love them like my... very own aborted fetuses.
She's decent.<eos> She likes to think she is, and she wants to do the right thing.<eos> People are not, you know, innately good.<eos> They don't want to do the right thing.<eos> They want to do the wrong thing, but society confines them.
But many of you millennials probably know us from our hit existential drama, Waiting for Godot...<eos> Hello.<eos> But in our version, Godot shows up, like three minutes in, and then we prank that mofo with Too Much Tuna, baby.<eos> We come out with bowler hats on.<eos> We take them off, [clicks tongue] we got two tuna sandwiches on our heads.
They got a blight.<eos> An ecosystem out of balance.<eos> Other side.<eos> Okay, please face forward again.<eos> I need to see your hands. Put them out there.
She attacks him in public, and there are knife wounds all over the place.<eos> That's an impulse killing.<eos> It's emotional. That's why this doesn't make any sense.<eos> Well, maybe she just lost it.<eos> I mean, people keep things bottled up, and then something sets them off, and some poor shit takes the brunt of it.
- Look at us, everybody!<eos> Look!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - We made T-shirts for everyone!<eos> - No, she made T-shirts. I paid for them.
In six months, I would change an unpopular novelist who feared death into a best-selling novelist who desired to commit murder.<eos> Don't you think that sounds like an interesting game?<eos> Is that why you sent those invitations to them?<eos> You need friends if you want to play.<eos> I selected women appropriate for you, and had them come to your home.
Don't you think that sounds like an interesting game?<eos> Is that why you sent those invitations to them?<eos> You need friends if you want to play.<eos> I selected women appropriate for you, and had them come to your home.<eos> I carefully, and occasionally forcefully, manipulated them.
Please.<eos> You know...<eos> I don't want anyone else to get hurt.<eos> Shin...<eos> Saying you're sorry because a family member is a murderer... or feeling responsible for the death of someone you lived with... or doing things just because that's the way you do them... or making up reasons for things...
I've read his chromo-so-much-better facial does wonders.<eos> You know that's fancy for baby dick-tops?<eos> What? !<eos> Yeah, Ollie pays hospitals for infant circumcision flaps.<eos> Then he sends them to a lab in Long Island City that extracts the proteins and makes them into a serum. [gags]
Do what?<eos> There's too many guns.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> He put them here.<eos> Who put them here?
Well, then I suppose you saw me pick up those explosives?<eos> And where are these explosives now?<eos> On you.<eos> You fucking piece of shit.<eos> I put them on all of you.
You know how I know that you are the Ghost, my friend?<eos> Because if you're not... I will kill you.<eos> I will cut you slowly and painfully with my knife.<eos> So painfully... that your innards will fall out and spill out on the floor.<eos> Then I will grab them and place them on your chest.
- So the Starling sisters lied?<eos> What difference does it really make?<eos> For God's sake, of course it makes a difference.<eos> It's not the truth.<eos> The truth is, they stole a boat from a man who terrified them and set out to cross 50 miles of open sea into a war.

This camera set me back three months of my army pension!<eos> Thanks, Grandpa.<eos> And, Jason...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Back in the '80s, when Andre the Giant used to go to the Playboy Mansion, he'd stack five playmates on top of each other on a bed and fingerfuck them all. Five at a time.
Who thinks of that?<eos> Welcome home, King Mudbeard!<eos> My father, and my father's father, and my weird Aunt Chloe, have all searched for the eggs.<eos> But only I,<eos> - King Mudbeard, have found them.
- My nephew.<eos> He's good, right?<eos> I'd sunk my entire life savings into 65 cases of premium bed sheets but I overlooked one crucial factor.<eos> No one really cares about old people.<eos> Why don't you just sell them back?
A taste, a glimpse, a few pilfered grains from Strategist Wang's supply of black powder.<eos> He's mastered the transmutation of these elements.<eos> People speak of a weapon.<eos> There are many weapons here.<eos> Why have we not seen them?
Hey-<eos> I knew I could count on you, Mr. Cougar.<eos> How are you, Mr. Tiger?<eos> This is my man.<eos> And I promised these young ladies we'd give them a ride home.
Have one of our Havanas?<eos> Bring the candle!<eos> Oh, my roses!<eos> You'll squash them!<eos> Why not take them off?
Whoa! There.<eos> Master Bear, Master Chicken, Master Croc!<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> Jade creatures attacked our villages.<eos> We've tracked them here.
^.^.^.^subtitles by^.^.^.^ ® Sud_Arun collections ®<eos> In 1917, I signed up to fight the Huns in France.<eos> Good men died all around me. And I saw no reason for it.<eos> The rules we lived by were lies. And they didn't apply to those who made them.
You can't do this!<eos> I own 10% of the company.<eos> Your father set those shares aside, for me.<eos> Correction.<eos> He gave them to your mother... who sold them to me a year ago, while you were gone... along with the bond on the house.
I took you in off the street, okay?<eos> When no one else would.<eos> You are such a cliché.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're getting close to people so now you have to push them away.
Everyone thinks you had a bad flu.<eos> Kind of a pneumonia.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I knew it's what you'd want, Kits.<eos> The orchids downstairs, who brought them?
I knew it's what you'd want, Kits.<eos> The orchids downstairs, who brought them?<eos> Was it Betty?<eos> I completely forgot.<eos> Martha's friend, Ellie, brought them.
You know, as a matter of fact, I'm not gonna dance tonight.<eos> Harry Truman called Eleanor Roosevelt the First Lady of the world.<eos> She answered the door to the White House herself.<eos> When she wanted to learn how to fly, she got Amelia Earhart to promise to teach her.<eos> She could only cook scrambled eggs, and served them on Sundays for dinner.
May I come inside?<eos> I... I... I can help you bandage that cut.<eos> I don't even think there are bandages inside, um, the house, or not.<eos> Eliza?<eos> I know where he kept them.
I... I... I can help you bandage that cut.<eos> I don't even think there are bandages inside, um, the house, or not.<eos> Eliza?<eos> I know where he kept them.<eos> You know where he kept them?
Well, obviously not.<eos> We taught them how to build a good, solid bicycle.<eos> They took that wisdom and started making all the bikes themselves.<eos> - Now they own the market.<eos> - Because they can sell them for nothing.
No, it's not a transfer.<eos> Jerico Stewart was chosen because he has frontal lobe syndrome, trauma to the brain when he was a child.<eos> Incredibly rare. One in 10 million.<eos> His frontal lobe remains in an undeveloped state. A hotbed of neural stem cells.<eos> We stimulate them with theta waves, duplicating the pattern.
He was always... "searching for the truth".<eos> On each of these video cards is some truth that he was proud to have captured.<eos> And if he wasn't happy with it, he would throw it out.<eos> He used to treat these like original film in a camera.<eos> He would never reuse or copy them.
Oh, trust me.<eos> I'm already thinking of a new song.<eos> - Just from going for coffee?<eos> - Yeah. It's what I do.<eos> I sort of take everyday situations, and then I look at them from a different perspective.
- Yeah. It's what I do.<eos> I sort of take everyday situations, and then I look at them from a different perspective.<eos> It's gonna be a Coldplay vibe, I think.<eos> 'Cause that's what Chris Martin does.<eos> He gets really mundane things and he makes them about the universe, and stars, and electricity and shit, so...
One cut was when a card was canceled, And if a duplicate was used, the terminal would recognize Which is a forgery and warn the cashier<eos> We assume that risk as long as we do not try the card.<eos> Like I said, we were just making money, a lot,<eos> And the problem with that is that money does not change people.<eos> Show them as they are.
Hello.<eos> So they're the last breeding pair in existence.<eos> So if I hadn't managed to rescue them, that could've been the end of Graphorns forever. All right.<eos> What, you rescue these creatures?<eos> Yes, that's right. Rescue, nurture and protect them. And I'm gently trying to educate my fellow wizards about them.
That's what I do all day long.<eos> You wanna know how an Irish kid raised on welfare became governor...<eos> How a homicide detective becomes Captain?<eos> We contain situations.<eos> We don't blow them up.
I feel like a sacrificial goat.<eos> Well, let me tell you, them goats can kick, and bite, and scream, and scratch, and poke your eyes out too, and they can start fires.<eos> The horns are sharper than yours.<eos> Them goats can turn into super-goats.<eos> And you can lock them super-goats up, but what I have heard is this.
You don't even know this guy.<eos> Just shows up and wants girls.<eos> - Doesn't even fuck 'em.<eos> - Seems like an easy turnaround.<eos> And what does he want them for?
Just shows up and wants girls.<eos> - Doesn't even fuck 'em.<eos> - Seems like an easy turnaround.<eos> And what does he want them for?<eos> I don't care what he wants them for, Sadie.
She's a pure innocent.<eos> Never had to deal with the fears of life.<eos> Ironic, people... who have suffered the most... have the strongest resistance. Your daughter is just gonna get worse.<eos> She'll die.<eos> In the meantime, you gather all the dolls and the box... and bring them here to me along with your daughter.
He was also wearing one of those dolls.<eos> I know how this sounds but I need to find those dolls.<eos> This could be Chloe's last chance.<eos> Somehow it left something in her.<eos> And if I don't find them all the doctors, they're not gonna be able to do any good. So hate me, just help me.
Major Susan Turner. 110th Military Police.<eos> The Major Turner who's wanted by the MPs for espionage?<eos> You mean these MPs?<eos> These crates are supposed to contain weapons belonging to the United States Army.<eos> In fact, you sold them to insurgents.
There's no doubt, Max, that you helped Jeanine take over Chicago, and exert brutal control over it's citizens.<eos> So, my only question to you is this.<eos> Did you feel justified in murdering people in support of her regime?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> People are sheep. They need a Shepherd to guide them.
Don't help me.<eos> 138.<eos> 138 combat missions.<eos> That's how many I've flown, Tony.<eos> Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew em.
Take it easy on the nice boy act.<eos> You were saying something awful?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've lost the keys.<eos> One of your ten doubles will probably find them for you.
Uh, those go outside.<eos> I don't want the eggs with the dessert.<eos> It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?<eos> So do you want to put them here?<eos> Do you want them with your hot dogs or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to. Do you want to put them with your other salad and your corn?
Don't move.<eos> Who wants some American cigarettes?<eos> Sometimes the Krauts they come to get American cigarettes.<eos> American cigarettes?<eos> We confiscate them from the Resistance.
I still remember the drinks he used to mix.<eos> You know what I remember?<eos> His chubby fingers and bitten nails.<eos> That's what.<eos> He used to stick them down my pants when I was waitressing here.
Any chance she was here?<eos> Well, it's possible.<eos> Either here, or in London, or she knew somebody who has.<eos> There must be thousands of these chips.<eos> People hang on to them sometimes for luck.
Surrounding our village was a big forest.<eos> And deep within this forest... there was an abandoned temple.<eos> It is said that the line between the world of the dead and the living... is very thin at this place.<eos> You should go there.<eos> Take the ashes of your son... spread them on the steps of this temple... lock yourself inside... and when night comes... he will come to you.
We don't have that at home.<eos> That's your only evidence?<eos> I smelled his underwear.<eos> I waited all day for him to take off his shorts.<eos> When he did at last, I pounced on them. And sniffed.
I can't hear a goddamn thing you're saying, Humphrey.<eos> Come on over here.<eos> I said what's your idea?<eos> Well, right now it's all about the rules of the Senate.<eos> And Dick Russell's been studying them since he was sucking on his mama's titty.
She's doing good.<eos> It's just a precaution.<eos> Is that necessary?<eos> Well, most precautions aren't.<eos> It's why we call them precautions. Wow.
- A major collection, all stolen.<eos> - Sorry to hear that.<eos> Was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?<eos> No, not really.<eos> So nobody in particular you can think of wanted them?
Oh, I've got something to, um, help you along.<eos> A schedule.<eos> The rules.<eos> Mrs. Heelshire, she was kind enough to write one out, you see?<eos> Now, it may seem a bit silly, but it is important that you follow them because brahms is not like other children.
But when I saw how much he wanted it, I thought it was worth the risk.<eos> Worth the risk?<eos> Of a great actor being remembered for a catastrophic last performance?<eos> There's nothing the world loves more than a car crash.<eos> Milly has already packed your things, and Joseph has them in the car outside.
Fairest woman...<eos> Do not fear... .. nor fly.<eos> For I will touch thee but with reverent hands.<eos> I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,<eos> And lay them gently at thy tender side.
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.<eos> Well, then, you mean not as I thought you did.<eos> To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee. To tell YOU plain, I had rather lie in prison.<eos> Why then, thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.<eos> Well, then, mine honesty shall be my dower, For by that loss I will not purchase them.
Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were, And he that slew them fouler than he is:<eos> Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.<eos> My words are dull.<eos> O, quicken them with thine!<eos> Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
Of course it does.<eos> Running a great house in Paris had proved more complicated than I'd ever imagined.<eos> Fortunately, Jared had selected his servants with care, so we had no worries regarding their trustworthiness.<eos> Even after several weeks, Paris itself remained an endless source of fascination.<eos> As I gazed upon the quaint city streets, I found it hard to believe that in a mere 40 years, the French Revolution would turn them into rivers of blood.
- I do not wanna talk about the pills again.<eos> Listen out...<eos> I've invested so much sweat and time into those pills.<eos> A lot of hours of creativity.<eos> Okay. And I'm going to throw them down the toilet if you keep talking
Two...<eos> You have aerials.<eos> You have aerials of this area?<eos> Thankfully.<eos> Where did you get them?
Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I got so fucking hammered last night,<eos> I don't remember anything. Yeah, you disappeared after we hit the volcano.<eos> Danny said he saw you talk with some guy in a $10,000 suit although I don't think Danny would know what a $10,000 suit looks like.<eos> Neil, your house, there's so many people. You want me to kick them out?
Nothing to do with me, i wash my hands of that.<eos> As Milton said, mind is its own place. And in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven. - So what?<eos> - So urge is both. It's like a magic key to the soul for whoever-- I mean have you seen the way that people are acting around here?<eos> It's bizarre.<eos> Once we lose our inhibitions, we don't remember why we had them, I mean look around you. Life still goes on, does it not?
Of course it is.<eos> What should I do, let her die?<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Why do I subscribe you to papers if you don't read them?
Hello, Linda, how are you?<eos> On the bed, heels to bottom and knees nice and wide apart.<eos> Sadie warned me about this.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> Some of the old hands come with their knickers in their pockets, and don't put them on until we've finished!
A bite mark?<eos> I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> Oh, I'M perfectly all right! But this woman - Lizzie - she looked as if she'd been attacked by an animal.<eos> There's things go on round here that you don't want to trouble your head with.<eos> Sergeant, we've had working girls on our midwifery books, and we see them in the doctor's when they have VD.
It was such a wonderfully frivolous thing.<eos> It meant that I was with friends.<eos> That I wasn't alone.<eos> I don't bother much with maraschino cherries any more,<eos> I don't even put them in my Horlicks, or my barley water -- they taste revolting.
- Hello, nurse.<eos> - Any objection to me popping by?<eos> - I can just leave you with your friends.<eos> - Bless you.<eos> And bless them, never met any of them before!

Not Cornell's.<eos> - He didn't have the guns.<eos> - Oh, yes, he did.<eos> That's why Detective Scarfe got shot.<eos> Detective Scarfe stole them from evidence and then gave them back to Cornell.
- I can't...<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just put them on one more time.
It's a new super fruit that helps you mellow out and relax.<eos> 'Member "The Fugitive"?<eos> - 'Member "Bambi"?<eos> The guys at work told me about them.<eos> Been taking them about six months now. I'm telling you, they really take the edge off.
I'm going to the bathroom.<eos> Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing.<eos> I know that a war is coming between us and the girls.<eos> I knew it the moment they sat out the national anthem.<eos> They sat it out because you were harassing them online!
Well, they told us to do that in Catechism.<eos> Yellow?<eos> You've got to be kidding.<eos> What happened to the shelves I built there?<eos> Kyle didn't like them, so he took them down.
Just like her poor daughter Gillian was all these years ago.<eos> Now with all due respect, we don't know what happened to Gillian.<eos> Some Aliens were up there.<eos> There were lights up on Mother Sullivans Ridge.<eos> People see them all the time.
The queen is head of the house and the 5 has wolf power.<eos> What?<eos> And I have a pair of Gordon Woolmer business cards.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't like my cards, so I switched them out.
Look like ordinary balls to me.<eos> Typical white balls.<eos> What are those little letters?<eos> They're monograms.<eos> S.S. Oh, no, you're looking at them upside down.
Well, if I can extract plant D.N.A. from the illegal brownies, then I can compare the two.<eos> If not, all I can test is the same T.H.C. levels. And that won't prove conclusively that the samples are the same.<eos> - Angela told me about the cameras.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I don't want them in my house.
Now we're gettin' somewhere.<eos> I'm sorry I took your rocks.<eos> They weren't really my rocks.<eos> They belong to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<eos> I gave them to Korsak for his turtles.
- Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Great!<eos> Okay.<eos> I will get his fingerprints to Korsak, who will send them to Interpol, and then we will check...
Look, if you don't want to make a profit, that's fine.<eos> But don't stop the rest of us. - Us?<eos> - Us.<eos> As in everyone but you.<eos> Who did you send them to?
Really?<eos> I'm trying to manage it.<eos> There's no good time to find out your best friend's been murdered, but particularly not three days into cocaine treatment.<eos> Did you know Nicole had breast implants?<eos> It was O.J.'s idea, but I'll be honest with you, she loved them.
Could you just send somebody over here?<eos> Okay, what is he doing there?<eos> Are these the 911 tapes? Yeah.<eos> The media made a request,<eos> And some idiot at county released them.
Is that... is that correct?<eos> That night I couldn't have, no.<eos> What did you do with them?<eos> Where were they until you booked 'em into evidence the next day?<eos> I put them in the trunk of my car.
I sought those things out, too.<eos> To the exclusion of all else.<eos> My father was a cobbler.<eos> He died when I was young and I took over his shop.<eos> He was a simple man and he made simple shoes. But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them.
Tell me more about these hunters.<eos> Uh, they're human. Hate Elves.<eos> They hunt us down and harvest our ears.<eos> Harvest them?<eos> Harvest them for what?
Gnomes.<eos> They think Elf ears have some sort of medical properties.<eos> By this time next week, my left ear will be ground up in some horny Gnome's tea.<eos> I was travelling with two friends.<eos> I'm worried that these hunters might have snatched them.
One hell of a mess, aren't we?<eos> They're here.<eos> Find them.<eos> Nobody gets out.<eos> Now, about my friends. Tell me where you last saw them.
This is not the time for negotiations behind closed doors or agreements between small groups.<eos> It's time to be open with each other, and I will be totally open with you.<eos> People chose you to lead them, both in light, and in times of darkness.<eos> Therefore, the resignation of the Government will not be accepted,<eos> - not when people so strongly need someone to lead them.
Your shift starts in half an hour.<eos> Meds?<eos> Yes, Mom.<eos> I'm not your mother. I'm just concerned.<eos> Did you take them?
And I want to tell you that it's all gonna go back to normal, but honestly, I have no clue.<eos> Anyways, the footage came back on that BE, and we've got a suspect.<eos> I'm going to bust him right now if you want to come with me.<eos> - Why don't you give me those eggs?<eos> I'll put them on top here.
I hope y'all enjoyed Belinda's biscuits, everybody!<eos> New Tuesday tradition right here!<eos> Pump it up!<eos> The way you said that, it kind of sounded like you got the faculty the biscuits.<eos> Well, you got them on my behalf, so I did get them the biscuits.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.<eos> Or 13.<eos> Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?<eos> Well, his references aren't too clever.<eos> Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
Just enough for the fireworks display, a little amuse-bouche.<eos> - But the main course...<eos> - Never left Istanbul.<eos> You knew British enforcement were on to you, so you changed the method of delivery.<eos> Left them on the boat.
And then I impressed you all with my arm.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The milk bottles.<eos> I knocked them over.<eos> No, I... I knocked them over.
It's hot!<eos> Oh, dude, don't fucking touch it! I told you it's hot!<eos> Oh, my gosh! I thought it was like Jacuzzi hot.<eos> - No, it's boiling hot!<eos> Now, we add the eggs, and we hard-boil them, okay?
I'm not guilty!<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Yes.<eos> Tell me, where did you find these shoes?<eos> I got them done.
Mm-hmm. Like when you... took credit for all of our work.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Prometheus?<eos> Thief of fire. Does it ring a bell, Ken?<eos> Hmm? You stole my ideas and you pawned them off as your own.
I just wanted to come down and tell you, you know, in person.<eos> You found them?<eos> Where?<eos> Around the house? No.<eos> I hired a private investigator and he tracked them down.
But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law, and you are Jimmy McGill, attorney at law.<eos> Both free to practice as we see fit.<eos> Separate firms under one roof.<eos> We're both headed uptown, so why can't we share a taxi?<eos> You do things your way and I do them mine.
What about clients?<eos> Mesa Verde.<eos> It'd be a hard sell to take them with me.<eos> Separate firms under one roof.<eos> You... do things your way, and I do them mine.
I mean, he fits the parameters.<eos> You're telling me he's in need of medical care so urgent that we can't wait around on court procedure.<eos> - Most certainly.<eos> - Yeah. And Chuck is not able to understand the consequences.<eos> I mean, he can understand them, but he...
It's part of my plan.<eos> We need information that I cannot get directly from The Prince.<eos> Information that comes in the form of letters from his father, from other potential financiers, and most importantly, from these wealthy Englishmen, if they do even exist.<eos> So, Fergus steals the letters, and...<eos> Aye, and we copy them, and then he puts them back before anyone notices they've gone missing.
It's over.<eos> It's over.<eos> Now all that remains is that we escape this place and survive.<eos> All the doors are covered by men seeking the bounty.<eos> And I have to imagine the tunnel exits are being watched as well, given Hornigold's familiarity with them.
I mean, for an otherwise sane woman, she had these pockets of complete and thorough madness within her.<eos> Although it's been six years since I've seen her face... to this day, if I... if I see a broom by a bed, I...<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> A woman has that power, God-given, to leave her marks on you.<eos> And it's far harder to dispose of the marks than the woman who left them.
Well, it's all about protecting harlee.<eos> You know that.<eos> I want to bring her in on the job. Not until we have to.<eos> These people value discretion.<eos> We make them happy, we all benefit.
Yeah.<eos> There's a lot of them.<eos> I don't know; shouldn't I at least write him back?<eos> I guess that's gonna be up to you.<eos> You know, these letters are yours now, if you want them.
It may have even drawn them to the house.<eos> Fact: the living facility they opened was cheap, which ensured a bounty of applicants, but they had their own unique criterion for accepting applicants.<eos> They wanted families who were tired of taking care of their relatives, families who just wanted a place to store them until they died.<eos> But the most bizarre criteria for accepting a patient had to do with the letter of their first name.<eos> They chose people and murdered them because they were using the letters of their names to spell out their favorite word.
"More sugar beets."<eos> - It's not that different now.<eos> - I'm not gonna talk.<eos> Just give me something I can take back to my superiors like the location of safe houses.<eos> Your colleagues will be avoiding them anyway.
Yes? What do you want?<eos> Could you turn down the radio, just a little?<eos> I'm not asking you to turn it off. My wife gets these migraines.<eos> Don't tell me how to play my radio. Keep your nose outta my business.<eos> She rarely gets them... Just lower it.
It's just a rich woman's hobby.<eos> But I have my shares, and if I sell them, then I can afford to live.<eos> I'm sorry, Harry.<eos> Do you remember when I first came to London?<eos> You opened doors for me when everyone was slamming them shut.
Hmmm... Also I was wondering if you've had a chance yet to review the Colson affidavits.<eos> No.<eos> Okay...<eos> Um, let me know when you do.<eos> I'll look them over in the morning.
Paul, the police claim your fingerprints are on a pair of decorating shears.<eos> They say the shears, the scissors, tested positive for Joe Brawley's DNA, a blood sample.<eos> They were retrieved from the water... here.<eos> I know where that is, I go running there sometimes.<eos> Is it possible you came across the scissors while you were running, considered them dangerous, picked them up and threw them into the water, out of harm's way?
Yes.<eos> Loosening and tightening your grip around their throat?<eos> Keeping them suspended between life and death?<eos> Yes.<eos> Binding them first?
He's just a pen-pusher.<eos> It's this Henry Williams we need to find, but all we've got is the name.<eos> What about these two women at the station?<eos> The contract workers.<eos> Still trying to find them.
Franklin, are you getting this?<eos> 'Cause I'm really talking to you.<eos> Huh? Shmallow Cakes aren't really cakes.<eos> They're marshmallow paste sandwiched between two cookies covered in chocolate.<eos> And while our tax code deems cakes luxury items and hits them harder, cookies are obviously necessities, and therefore exempt.
Is a fair question.<eos> Does anyone in this room think the government should abolish drivers' licenses?<eos> - That's absurd.<eos> They're a government incursion into individual liberty.<eos> We accept them because they make sense.
Sure.<eos> After six years, how many of those 24 drill bits do you think are still in their case?<eos> None of them.<eos> None of them.<eos> My husband has lost them all.
I think you know who I am.<eos> I thought that you were dead.<eos> They haven't killed me yet, as hard as they may try.<eos> Is it hard to look at me?<eos> Considering what I know about you, the things you've done, the people you've done them to...
That's unfair and you know it.<eos> What's unfair is life, but it's all there is.<eos> It's the rules.<eos> My God. Here the rules aren't the same for everyone.<eos> You break them whenever you want.
So they were stolen, but then they end up back in the possession of the original dealer and somebody on his crew?<eos> Sounds like a big coincidence, doesn't it?<eos> What's that word you like? Cahoots? That's what this is.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I mean, Nash sells guns to this place, then he steals them back, takes off the serial number and gives them to his crew.
It goes quicker.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> I get the curiosity, but we have questions ourselves.<eos> And we'll be the ones asking them while we drive you back to wherever it is you call home.
So, Laura and Sarah.<eos> They went off the radar for 2.5 days with a guy they just met, Jeff little.<eos> It doesn't look like he's made the best life choices and it doesn't bode well that he's attached himself to these girls.<eos> He played favorites, leaving Sarah odd man out.<eos> You think he split them up for a reason.
Before we start the day, should we say a little prayer?<eos> What?<eos> I think we're too hard on Christians in this country.<eos> In fact, they should be applauded and supported for holding tightly onto their beliefs.<eos> Even when presented with solid evidence that unequivocally refutes them.
- You just don't fit the bill.<eos> Look, you don't have to sign this thing.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> The last page is just obscene drawings of cartoon princesses.<eos> I saw them; you're very talented.
Fourteen!<eos> Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra.<eos> It makes a painful... and then... it crumbles to the ground.<eos> Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time and, and, and... and...<eos> Lucas cuts off its seven heads, and Dustin places them into his bag of holding.
Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra.<eos> It makes a painful... and then... it crumbles to the ground.<eos> Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time and, and, and... and...<eos> Lucas cuts off its seven heads, and Dustin places them into his bag of holding.<eos> You carry the heads out of the dungeon, victorious, and you present them to King Tristan.
Hang on, guys. Change of plans.<eos> They switched the order. They're gonna let Thomas testify first.<eos> Danforth convinced Biden the order wasn't fair to Thomas.<eos> But that doesn't make any sense. The hearings are about my charges.<eos> What is there to talk about until I introduce them? It's strategic.
If you want to lodge formal charges, let's rock and roll.<eos> Otherwise, you...<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> We're about to rock like Cameo in '86.<eos> You're smashing back every one of their questions ...when they fucking ask them.
David Tellis was your boss?<eos> I was his intern.<eos> I wanna sue for sexual harassment and a hostile work environment.<eos> Kirkland might argue that you intentionally brought this on yourself.<eos> That you incited these reactions and recorded them to file a lawsuit, but, given the balance of power between you and David Tellis, you have a strong case.
Acting alone, neither Wolverine nor Cyclops could defeat the Herculoids.<eos> But acting together, if every man in the Get Down Brothers rhymes,<eos> -with our rhymes combined--<eos> -You can't rhyme.<eos> I can. If Zeke writes them.
That's the posture you're looking for.<eos> Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you can actually be quite charming.<eos> Have the neighbors complained?<eos> Safe to say, they're asking questions.<eos> The rocks would prefer not to move, but we shall move them yet.
- You see, Father, my name is Javier.<eos> Someone's brother-in-law's friend told me about you.<eos> Ah no, it was a student at the college.<eos> Yes, and all these people came with you?<eos> No, I don't know them.
Wonder how Dana held up?<eos> She might still be there.<eos> Maybe I would be too, if I liked to party.<eos> Are you solely cash-based?<eos> No, I set up a company and can take credit cards, but my clients rarely want to use them.
Oh, my good God!<eos> This stupid, stupid little girl...<eos> Because he's a Muslim?<eos> Don't you know how they treat their women?<eos> Keeping them in purdah, hidden away.
I don't know.<eos> The Russians used to use postal chess to send messages to each other all the time during the Cold War.<eos> If I worked for the NSA, and I didn't want anyone tracking my communications...<eos> This would be a way to do it.<eos> You know what, maybe she's sending directions to her own PO Box, then someone else is picking them up?
We investigate, uh, um, certain matters.<eos> Miracles?<eos> Mm, that's... that's part of it, yeah.<eos> I believe you saw that statue bleed real blood, and I believe you've seen other things... Things you doubt because of the rational parts of your brain or because you're surrounded by people of limited imagination.<eos> I have sought you out because I not only believe you saw these things, you saw them for a reason.
Some would consider the ideas dangerous.<eos> My father would say they're only dangerous because they still matter.<eos> Oh, they're his ideas?<eos> What, he incited people?<eos> - Inspired them.
I always drive like that.<eos> - What? - Richard.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> "Almighty God created the races white, black, "yellow, Malay, and red, and he placed them on separate continents.
She's in Kawasaki.<eos> That's right nearby.<eos> That's right.<eos> So her remains will go there?<eos> They don't want them.
- Have you seen the kids?<eos> - No, I thought they were downstairs<eos> No, I've already checked downstairs<eos> - Have you seen the girls?<eos> - No, I've not seen them
I like that. It's dope.<eos> ♪ Sun will always shine ♪<eos> ♪ Sun will always shine ♪<eos> ♪ Sun will always shine ♪<eos> You tell me about these chains you got and how we gonna break them.
No, that's a wild accusation to make!<eos> I passed out on the way down, and then I woke up and I saw your shoes.<eos> The bottom of those red Louboutins you love so much.<eos> - Oh, my God, she's crazy! - Wait, no, no, no.<eos> Rhonda, a whole lot of women rock them shoes.
Don't see anyone here.<eos> I'm taking a look around.<eos> Where are you now, Warren?<eos> I don't remember getting these pills, Max.<eos> Someone put them here.
Aren't you going to eat this?<eos> I don't like eggs.<eos> - Just egg boxes.<eos> - Where do you get the eggs from?<eos> I trade them off against other stuff.
Prairie, here's the thing.<eos> The process can sometimes help people to heal.<eos> Storytelling is cleansing.<eos> But I also want to make sure you control the narrative. That you profit from it.<eos> And did it heal them?
Okay, I'm just really tired of being the gbf that just literally helps you two with your problems.<eos> I have a life too, you know?<eos> Did you know I can speak three languages?<eos> You do not.<eos> Okay, correction, I could if I learned them.
What happens if I push this button?<eos> That'll get you out even faster.<eos> Push it.<eos> A mess.<eos> We spent so much time teaching the girls how special they are, why didn't we teach them how to shut a cabinet door?
Hey, um, I want to apologize about earlier.<eos> I... I didn't mean to cross a line.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're training to be in the FBI. It's good that you want to get answers.<eos> Maybe I want them, too.
You're in the horns of a dilemma.<eos> Horns... of a... dilemma.<eos> There's this woman.<eos> I like her a lot. And I know she's about to get crushed, and the guy who's gonna crush her is my patient, too.<eos> All these people matter to me, and I can't do my job if I judge them.
I really...<eos> Now I'm going to hunt her down and turn her into fish soup!<eos> Mermaids are highly intelligent cryptid species.<eos> They're fierce and able to make weapons.<eos> They're extremely dangerous, so as soon as you see them, use full force!
Cute.<eos> Look, you gonna smack me around or break a couple fingers?<eos> Have at it.<eos> Because while you were playing grab-ass on the continent, I was already playing this game with the Japanese.<eos> And they took these fingers and tied them to a jeep and dragged me around in circles...
A gamma cannon.<eos> Gamma rays?<eos> Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?<eos> We have to destroy those rods now.<eos> The rods are safe. She won't find them.
That's my promise.<eos> If I fall, there's nowhere I want to fall except in your arms.<eos> You've made promises to me before, darling. I...<eos> I know, but...<eos> And broken them.
I... you know that I can't.<eos> But you want to.<eos> Sure, I mean.. if you could keep your mouth shut, maybe... but you totally dicked me over the last time I did it.<eos> Try on the shoes at least. I'll get them.<eos> They're the same size. She won't have to send them back.
Luke, it was just you.<eos> Instead of letting this lie like I asked, you kept the conversation going, and to be honest, you made it worse.<eos> Because she cut me off!<eos> Will, I get you don't want to be out there talking about your personal business, but somebody had to say something, 'cause you sure as hell weren't going to.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but these people... they won't just go away 'cause we ignore them.
Make yourself comfortable.<eos> I'll be waiting.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I was looking for cigarettes.<eos> I don't keep them here.
It's Memorial Day, all right?<eos> Let's, uh, scatter them with the others.<eos> Finn's ashes aren't yours to scatter.<eos> What about Raven?<eos> Besides, if Abby still has them, it means she's saving them for Clarke.
Hey, while I've got you here, this is a list of wedding venues.<eos> Uh, uh, uh. You know the rules.<eos> Business only till four o'clock.<eos> I am very well aware of the rules.<eos> And even though I find them deeply annoying at times, I confess that strong boundaries are one of your best qualities.
Because I have no problem reminding you.<eos> What if someone comes in here?<eos> Well, too bad for them, because the doors automatically lock.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since I got them fixed.
We have to make it look like you're dead.<eos> If your money's moving, it means you're alive to move it.<eos> Now, I'm doing what I can to impede the progress of the case.<eos> The La Araña cards went back to the NYPD precincts for each individual murder.<eos> When we want them back for evidence, it'll take a year to find them.
- She passed, Hank.<eos> - Oh. I didn't take that little boy's ship.<eos> I don't even know how it got there.<eos> My brother used to be a patient here, and we thought it might be nice to have his dental records.<eos> Your sister already picked them up. Oh.
Get out of my sight.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Looking for his dental records.<eos> What?<eos> Don't try lying, Willa. They already told me that you picked them up.
Don't try lying, Willa. They already told me that you picked them up.<eos> You need help.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - I don't know. Mom asked me to pick them up.<eos> - His doctors wanted them.
He's coming... your Mr. Chandler.<eos> I have reason to fear him.<eos> He is foretold as my singular enemy.<eos> Fear not old prophecies.<eos> We defy them.
- It's dead simple.<eos> There are about 60 cameras.<eos> All linked to security HQ.<eos> Hello, I've reserved a room for Sophie Baroud.<eos> Cut them all and the cops get an alert.
Is the alarm off?<eos> No sweat.<eos> - And the guards?<eos> - All set, too.<eos> You tied them up?
- And the guards?<eos> - All set, too.<eos> You tied them up?<eos> I aimed a gun at them.<eos> Then I gagged them and tied them up.
Uh, I very much look forward to your presentation.<eos> We have so much to learn about these creatures.<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen.<eos> That's our guy.<eos> Because he called them "creatures"?
The best thing about my success is that I can give her the life she deserves.<eos> She is beautiful.<eos> - But you wanted to show me something.<eos> Who are all these people?<eos> I don't recognise them.
You have all exceeded my expectations.<eos> Wait, what about me?<eos> Did I miss something?<eos> Have I not exceeded Lizzy's expectations?<eos> Or have I not met them?
Thank God! Thank God.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> The station said you asked for me.<eos> When I came home, the lights were on but I turned them off before I went out.
There's no need to do this. We can keep your family safe.<eos> Only I can protect my family.<eos> You think that, by controlling women, that, somehow, makes you more of a man?<eos> Real men don't hurt their families.<eos> They love them.
He had a go at you, didn't he, Aiden?<eos> He tried.<eos> Why didn't Jamie stay at the fair for Christmas?<eos> Cos, according to the vicar, it closes.<eos> Yep, come winter, they pack up all the rides, store them in an old depot in Gateshead and go home.
Keep chasing!<eos> It improves the flavor!<eos> Sure, sure, whatever works for you.<eos> I guess we don't need our chickens anymore.<eos> Don't worry, I've already found a research facility that will raise them humanely.
- [Sighs]<eos> We should start a campaign for that.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> What... what is wrong with you guys? Wow.<eos> I'm sorry I'm a self-starting entrepreneur who knows her market. And sorry I'm a generous young man who appreciates girls and helps them attain their dreams.
What the hell happened to your shoes?<eos> We were playing basketball.<eos> But... Boy, you never play basketball in basketball shoes!<eos> You wear them to weddings, funerals, and the Grammys.<eos> Then you dust them off and resell them on eBay and get you some more.
Well, you sure are blessed.<eos> God is good.<eos> I wish I could get new sneakers every day.<eos> Or at least once a year.<eos> But they'd steal them as soon as UPS left them on my stoop, if I had a stoop.
John, I will not accept this life.<eos> And neither should you!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, would it kill someone to plant a few peonies? !<eos> I have a feeling if you want peonies, Moira, you're gonna have to plant them yourself.
Oh, I, uh... I put up four new cameras, and they seem to be working pretty damn well.<eos> Yeah, but this is the overnight.<eos> You're breaking the rules.<eos> Actually, those are my rules.<eos> I made them, so I can break them anytime I want.
Okay and, um, we are rolling in three, two, one... action.<eos> Ladies, beautiful, wonderful ladies.<eos> Welcome to season 14 of "Everlasting."<eos> Now, usually our suitor waits for you. But see, this season, our suitor is more well-known, more prominent than ever.<eos> And in order to get our ladies to be surprised, we had to make them wait until now.
It's this one, this one or that one.<eos> You can see these things are...<eos> they're completely turned to stone.<eos> They're completely fossilized, so they're brittle.<eos> And when erosion comes and exposes them, they just shatter.
Colonel John Glenn will be the first American to orbit the Earth.<eos> As you can see, there are thousands of people here today to witness this historic event.<eos> Paul, something's off here.<eos> These landing coordinates don't match yesterday's.<eos> The IBM just ran them.
It's, uh...<eos> Kevin, it's personal.<eos> You see these legs?<eos> I used to press 900 pounds with these legs.<eos> Now I drag them around like limp sausage.
Let's say<eos> I disagree.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> So this is what's going to happen now.<eos> I'm going to take these plates, I'm going to put them in one bag.
Mine.<eos> You follow, she dies.<eos> Normally, he would take a hostage to the tunnels. - But, that location has been compromised.<eos> - Well, why the sudden change in M.O.?<eos> He's been killing victims, not kidnapping them.
Okay, the plan is perfect and it'll work perfectly, especially if you agree to drive the van.<eos> Is the Sheriff on board with this?<eos> How do you think I got the keys?<eos> I thought you stole them.<eos> While that's a perfectly reasonable assumption, I did not steal them.
I am really helping my mom with this campaign.<eos> I get it, Spence.<eos> Why is it so easy to fall back into old habits?<eos> They're hard to give up.<eos> That's what makes them habits.
The point is our boss is excited and it would be a good thing for us to keep her that way.<eos> Has he sent you more pages?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Can I see them?<eos> I thought if I came here I could read them without you having to put them on the Internet.
Looks like Felicity keeps files on various criminals.<eos> Who's the Dodger? Looks like we have ourselves a taller, more dude-like version of Felicity.<eos> And I can help.<eos> Now look. These bees, they're tiny computers, ok?<eos> With Felicity trapped inside, you guys are gonna need someone to hack them, but I'll have to "bee" careful.
She said we left them there to die, and we did.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> All those people at Reddington.<eos> There of their own choosing, Oliver.<eos> And we know that HIVE drugs people to make them susceptible to suggestion.
Basically, it's a collector magic.<eos> And here I thought earthquake machines were as strange as it got.<eos> Esrin Fortuna told me that one of these chambers exists in Star City.<eos> I'm betting it falls on a Ley line.<eos> What did Vixen call them--Wi-Fi for magic? - Yeah.
Let's look at this beautiful new car, presented by Ken.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Peter, what the hell happened to my underwear?<eos> They're all stretched out.<eos> Oh, sorry about that. Me and the guys were using them to shoot crab apples at Old Man McCratchen's truck.
- Good lookin'.<eos> (both roar) Oh, shit, Mayweather! Got everything?<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Got the new sides and shit?<eos> I just got them and haven't had a chance to look.
Don't worry, ladies.<eos> There's plenty of me to go around.<eos> Mother's pearls?<eos> Where did you get those?<eos> Where did you get them?
A respected religious order with missions across the world.<eos> Perfect front for criminal scumbags.<eos> This isn't gonna be easy.<eos> Nuns with M60s and Katanas?<eos> That would make them Nunjas.
Correct.<eos> Not always the case with you and your teams, though, is it?<eos> In your four years at South Ferry, there's been transfer requests from officers who didn't want to be in your team.<eos> WALDRON: Some guys can't cut it.<eos> I want them off my squad.
He took your son away because you are not well, Karen!<eos> The judge did not take my son away.<eos> You took my...<eos> Do you recognize these people?<eos> Have you ever seen them before?
I'm sorry.<eos> Maybe this is not a story for a celibate priest.<eos> It's all right. Please go on.<eos> In that case, the Daimyo's concubines were all jealous and they fought and fought without end.<eos> So the Daimyo of Hirado drove them away from his castle, and peace came into his life again.
Five of them, in fact.<eos> All hanging in the pit.<eos> Have you found the words on the wall?<eos> "Praise him."<eos> I cut them there with a stone when I was in this cell. Like you.
- Just one more thing.<eos> - Name it.<eos> You know that I wasn't happy that you copied part of the Book of Doors that burned in the synagogue.<eos> Those unregistered doors... have caused us more than one problem day in and day out.<eos> I propose a treaty with respect to them.
- I do not belong here, I am no one.<eos> - listen to me for once, damn it!<eos> Let's see. I've been considering your petition to save the artwork and after some serious meditation on what you said<eos> I'm convinced, you're right, Velázquez.<eos> We aren't going to destroy them.
So, if you ever wanna talk... or feel scared, I'm here for you, okay?<eos> Let me help you out there, sweetie.<eos> Oh, what you gave him my suit and tie?<eos> And my best white shirt.<eos> You hate these things, you haven't worn them in years.
- Children: Whoo! - Jared:<eos> What kind of ice cream place is this?<eos> Adrian P. says the cherries are poppin'.<eos> Hey, if the truckers eat here, you know it's gonna be good.<eos> Well, truckers also urinate in empty jugs and then fling them at hitchhikers.
- Yeah.<eos> He's the chief medical examiner.<eos> He's scheduled to testify for Reyes.<eos> Well... his report says that Lisa, Frank, Jr. and Maria Castle each were killed by a single gunshot, but Frank says there were multiple wounds.<eos> He describes them in awful detail, um... different angles, uh... bullet calibers, exit wounds that are too big for a handgun.
Ma'am, can I ask you, do you guys always serve bullshit here or is that just her, huh?<eos> Fresh pot.<eos> I'm sorry. You were saying?<eos> He's the kind of man who hurts people.<eos> Not like you, but... he damages them.
This isn't your fight anymore, Ta-er Al-Sahfer.<eos> I'm not gonna let you rot here.<eos> Not when you're in here because of me.<eos> I am in here because of my choices, beloved.<eos> I made them ready to accept my punishment.
- I didn't ask for that.<eos> - But those wings out there in the human world?<eos> Luci, they're too powerful.<eos> A piece of divinity.<eos> Humanity can't handle them.
Then people might die? Yeah, I get that.<eos> Just saw a chap toss himself off a building after a mere peek at them, so if you're done telling me things<eos> I already know... will you help me or not?<eos> You tell me something.<eos> If you truly hated the wings, why'd you hold onto them all this time?
I came to ensure the wings get back where they belong. Which is where exactly?<eos> You mean besides on your back?<eos> Oh, surely, my fine-feathered friend, you don't expect that to happen.<eos> They belong in the Heavens where they were created.<eos> If you don't want them, that's where they'll be.
Little did I know their dirty secret.<eos> And what's that?<eos> - Feels good to do good.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Good deeds do bring an amount of personal satisfaction to those who engage in them.
- Sure they would. - No.<eos> No. Most people wouldn't have cared.<eos> You're different, Kara.<eos> You see people.<eos> You understand them. And it makes me wish that I could...
Boredom.<eos> The inmates are restless.<eos> They have nothing to fill up their time, so they're... they're picking fights and they're acting out, and you can't really blame 'em, and we don't have the money to give them jobs,<eos> but we can give 'em something else. Something that gives them a reason to... to get dressed in the morning.<eos> That makes them more productive members of society, in and out of prison.
Order of bacon, miss parkerjar.<eos> Sausage and links, miss parkerjar.<eos> Sausage patties, miss parkerjar.<eos> Belgian waffle with ice cream.<eos> Now I couldn't make any fries, so I did find some home fries and put them on top for you, miss parkerjar.
The state is dead.<eos> And you're the best AI mind in the hemisphere.<eos> My neural nets are not for sale.<eos> Fine.<eos> Keep them.
What's up?<eos> Is this more comfortable than the big truck?<eos> You know who that goes to?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, the girls, where are you taking them?
Get in the truck and go and wrap my arms around my little girl.<eos> You need to do what you gotta do.<eos> Being a father's the most important job in the world.<eos> Your daughter needs you.<eos> All these girls have a father that loved them, too.
I see it.<eos> I'll let you get back to your book.<eos> Okay.<eos> I like the braids, by the way.<eos> Oh, thanks. Zora did them.
- Completely.<eos> - Here.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> So, you're here to pick up Sophia?<eos> Oh, no, Kerissa is getting the girls, taking them straight to soccer.
What I say.<eos> Nobody here understands what you're saying, King Ragnar.<eos> Well, then maybe they ought to listen, instead of talking.<eos> We are going to lift the boats up the cliff.<eos> Then we are going to carry them across the mountains, past the forts, and then simply slide them back into the river.
There's nothing left.<eos> The defeat of Ragnar Lothbrok will resound down the ages.<eos> As long as my brother is still alive, he is not defeated.<eos> What is the point of making camp here?<eos> We are going to lift the boats up the cliff, carry them across the mountains, and then simply slide them back into the river.
You don't think I had something to do with this.<eos> Just want to know how the admission process works.<eos> I'm sure privacy is a major concern here.<eos> Who has access to the applications?<eos> I see them all. Then I divide them into four groups.
James, as you read this, I will be taking my brother's body home to where our family is from.<eos> I will take his ashes home and pray that at last it will bring some peace to his troubled mind.<eos> And then I am going to stay here for a while.<eos> Maybe this place will bring peace to me, as well.<eos> I put these words on paper because if I said them to you, I might not go, and I need to go.
Falling in love, getting engaged, getting married, and getting pregnant, all in a year.<eos> Mm.<eos> We've made some big decisions, right?<eos> Decisions that would scare most people.<eos> But I guess what's kept them from scaring me is knowing that we've been making them together.
I'm not exactly housebroken these days.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - You're on our ship.<eos> You were shot, and you're okay, but it's your mods that I'm worried about.<eos> Did you see all of them?
For God's sake, just pick a pair, and just because you've been invited by a couple of old tarts to a Sunday roast does not mean that you can take my manservant for days.<eos> Uh, I thought we agreed on "personal assistant"?<eos> And the Von Falconburgh sisters are not tarts.<eos> They are the most popular queens in all the seven realms.<eos> I remember the first time I saw them.
Adrien told me that you played the piano very well.<eos> Yes a little bit.<eos> So you accompany us tonight?<eos> The bells rang all day, they did not stop more.<eos> Even the deaf heard them.
Listen, my friends and contacts I have on the inside, I think they're sick.<eos> And... and I... I need to know what's happening to them.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> I know how you feel, but my hands are tied.<eos> Right, because you let Lommers tie them.
It's fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> This is fine.<eos> Why is he holding the bananas wrong?<eos> It's humans that hold them wrong!
OK.<eos> The word is yeast.<eos> I've done some research, and I've found that scientists at the University of Bath believe yeast will duplicate palm oil's key properties almost exactly.<eos> Women spend a lot of time keeping yeast out of their vaginas.<eos> I don't think we can convince them to put it back in.
I can't believe that you of all people-- Yeah, you, are talking about being disrespectful to our mother.<eos> Because we had front-row seats for your drunken outburst.<eos> Oh, you're bad at this. You're bad at calming people down.<eos> I didn't mean those things.<eos> I was angry, but I didn't mean them.
I'd like to know if I agree with your choice.<eos> What happened to "one for all"?<eos> You want your lands back and a treaty guaranteeing Lorraine's independence from France.<eos> France has no right to them.<eos> Louis took them by force and deception.
Harry, I'm kidding.<eos> No, we're not postponing.<eos> It took us a whole year to get here.<eos> The press releases have already gone out. Reservations have been made.<eos> Well, so we'll unmake them.
I'm just gonna, uh, wait outside.<eos> Keep your phone on.<eos> 1, 2, 3...<eos> I mean, those short ribs were so good, I feel like even the cow that they came from would forgive you.<eos> Yeah, well, I braised them for three hours.
Everything good here, ladies?<eos> I know it's all good with you, beautiful.<eos> What?<eos> Usually that pobrecito can barely say two words to you.<eos> And if he does, he either says them to his feet or your boobies.
She's a strange bird.<eos> Be nice.<eos> Nah, I think it's sweet.<eos> The way you pick up strays.<eos> Several calls were made from this number. I need to know who made them.
He burned them all as they came in.<eos> This one, he just forgot the envelope.<eos> Mom, did you read the letters?<eos> I saw bits of some of them.<eos> Alan never gave them to me.
of a United States senator for something that you believe to be, but can't be certain, is harmless.<eos> Did I... I leave anything out?<eos> Nuance?<eos> How can you be sure that these pills aren't dangerous?<eos> Your lab analyzed them.
Dude, what did I tell you about studying before 9:00 a.m.?<eos> Why are you reading that?<eos> I already told you everything that you need to know. No.<eos> You told me how you created an alter ego to sneak back in and how you promised them money in order to rise through the levels faster and how you're secretly working from within to take it all down,<eos> but there is so much more, like how they kidnap people and send them to farms in foreign countries or how their money comes from owning the patent to podcasting or how they believe that our skin is poisonous.
The answers to all of your questions are on the other side of this door.<eos> And our future is on the other side of the border.<eos> - We're gonna fail.<eos> - So what? Then we'll spend the rest of our days busting Palins in Anchorage, but it'll be worth it.<eos> Shelby, you'll have your answers whether they're good or bad, but at least you'll have them.
- Alright.<eos> - I left my cigarettes at the bar!<eos> You're going.<eos> My cigarettes are at the bar!<eos> You didn't see them?
Aah! But things are just as bad here.<eos> Maybe you are better off without me after all.<eos> Vincent, listen to me.<eos> I've spent most of my life looking for answers.<eos> And now that I've finally found them, now that I have found you, I'm not giving up.
- Indeed we have! - (LAUGHING)<eos> The evening was a success!<eos> Although the exertion of it has worn me out.<eos> I'll leave the lights to you, Bumble.<eos> (LAUGHING) I shall extinguish them in quick time, my angel.
Got yourself assigned to the shiny New York division, must make you feel good.<eos> Hell, I'll bet you think the Pope ought to stop his sermon whenever you burp up a thought.<eos> Well, I promise you, you have never seen anything like Mr. Pralines and Cream.<eos> Oh, sure, he... he plays Cowboys and Indians with his victims.<eos> He tickles his victims. He cuddles them... with their own unicorn.
Someone getting access to your every thought, your every secret?<eos> That's pretty much my worst nightmare.<eos> The files could've been stolen to access any one of these minds.<eos> I mean...<eos> Wait, but isn't it also possible someone wanted all six of them?
How about I just ask you what I came here to ask you?<eos> Ah, I see you're straight to the point.<eos> Gotta love it.<eos> Shoot.<eos> The police found some VHS tapes in my house and they admitted them into evidence.
Ma'am!<eos> You can't just go in there!<eos> What?<eos> You spend more on the cab to get here than you do on those damn cigarettes.<eos> This is the only store that sells them. What do you want me to do?
Killing badgers is the fastest bloody way to get thrown in clink.<eos> I'm not that stupid. Okay, fine.<eos> You know best.<eos> I didn't have the keys to the gun cupboard.<eos> I gave them to Harry about 6 months ago.
- Challenges? How the fuck can you stand there and ice queen this shit?<eos> Your boss specifically told us this was supposed to be a nice little war between old enemies, right?<eos> Since when did normal, everyday citizens become targets?<eos> You think there are rules, Mr. Gecko?<eos> If there are, Amaru is not following them.
What girls?<eos> In the mall.<eos> Parking lot.<eos> You said some sweet words.<eos> Led them to a quiet spot.
Appreciate it.<eos> - Ethan...<eos> - I'm sorry, Andre.<eos> - Hey, where are all Dean's boxes?<eos> - I put them in storage.
I'm all right.<eos> Grab the keys, brother.<eos> Come on, buddy. I got you.<eos> Get the keys.<eos> Tommy, you just had them downstairs, man.
Defensive wounds, possibly, or they could have been trying t punch their way out of someplace.<eos> In that instance, other bones in the hands would have been broken, but these wounds are localized to the knuckles.<eos> Like they were repeatedly hit with something.<eos> Premortem torture.<eos> He's punishing them before he beheads them.
That's not the way to prove it.<eos> Please.<eos> You'll kill me.<eos> - It's all been a lie. - No.<eos> You helped so many people because we made them believe in you.
Oh, by the way, I just polished the floor in the Eisenhower Room.<eos> - Tom, stop.<eos> - Be careful in there, all right? - Huh?<eos> - That was something.<eos> Why did Tom James just wrap up his balls in butcher paper and put them in my purse?
I like that.<eos> I underestimated the appeal it would have for those banished to the fringe and those wishing to exterminate them. But...<eos> I'd never had one of them actually enter my home, threaten me.<eos> And yet, you didn't call the police?<eos> If you engage with these people, it just emboldens them.
Not ridiculous at all (!<eos> The legends date back at least 4,000 years to the ancient Assyrians and Babylonians.<eos> Most of these legends arose from fears of moral degradation.<eos> Bram said these superstitions all but died away with the Industrial Revolution?<eos> They did... until he exhumed them with Dracula.
Jane Dough is innocent.<eos> Oh.<eos> The case.<eos> It was the fleabites.<eos> Everyone had them... you, me, the wife, the dog.
That's what everybody thinks until the music stops, which is why if you involve Donna in this deal, so help me God, I will pull every string I have to tie your project up in court for the next 20 years.<eos> I'm just trying to make my way.<eos> All I'm telling you is, you can make it without Donna.<eos> You act as if you think I don't love my own daughter.<eos> People who love other people don't put them in positions to break the law.
You.<eos> You've been bending the rules since the day you were born, and I'm not letting you get away with it anymore.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You bent rules up and down this entire case.<eos> Except the difference between you and me is, I'm bending them to get justice.
You know, I used to have such high hopes for your organization.<eos> High hopes for Howard.<eos> Halcyon was once such a promising company... like AOL.<eos> Put an entire generation online.<eos> Companies can so easily lose their way. Forget what it was that made them great to begin with.
We have a confirmed location of the child.<eos> I want this done today.<eos> The way to get Kirk's attention is through his money, and the only money we can get to is sitting in Diaz's war chest, which is unfortunate for the bloviating senator from Missouri because he cannot win the election without it,<eos> and we're gonna steal it.<eos> The Bureau prevents bank robberies. We don't commit them.
I want to see your feet.<eos> I could be your father!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Fine, no need to get excited.<eos> Take them off and I'll let you go.
Sit, and take off your shoes.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Go on, sit.<eos> - Take them off.
Now things are gonna get serious.<eos> Serious how?<eos> Further devastation for The Leyland School... exposing individuals for who they are and what they did.<eos> Justice for Taylor Blaine.<eos> I told my girls I was gonna do great things, and I'm gonna do them.
Oh, please.<eos> You've imagined doing this yourself. I know you have.<eos> But what about the twins you ask?<eos> No regrets there.<eos> In their current phase our girls generally think of me as some kind of unfortunate oddity who embarrasses them in front of their friends.
How many women?<eos> Hundreds.<eos> As recent as last week.<eos> They're trafficking women.<eos> Both Stern and Aubin were offered several promotions and both turned them down.
But you don't believe it, do you?<eos> - What makes you say that?<eos> - I can tell.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> People lose things all the time and forget where they've put them.
Not exactly.<eos> I thought about you a lot during the war.<eos> What was happening.<eos> Whether you were all right.<eos> When you sent letters to Papa, he'd let me read them.
Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna bring over the replacement brains personally.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Bye.<eos> I told you, you need to take the yellow coolers out of circulation.<eos> They noted them in the FBI report.
Like how dangerous they can be.<eos> Someone in your organization has one.<eos> Kira?<eos> Sarah?<eos> There's a Neo network here that does them.
- Have you seen our lab?<eos> We have major trouble controlling contamination.<eos> Still, it's remarkable what you've achieved with so little.<eos> I assume that you've used Kira's cells again?<eos> Yeah, they were helpful in a few attempts, but the father's contribution to her DNA takes them way too far from the LEDA genome.
- You clones are so much more than the sum of your parts.<eos> We operate in countries where human cloning is not illegal.<eos> Where our corporation supersedes their citizenship, their personhood.<eos> So why grant them this illusion of freedom?<eos> If we want to know if our lab rats' tails will grow back, we damn well will cut them off and see!
- What's happening?<eos> - They've cordoned off the garage.<eos> - We can't take photos.<eos> - The security cameras?<eos> The police took them. The car park company have their own.
But it's about the little things, too.<eos> You want to hear the most romantic thing honey ever did for me?<eos> Well, one day, I came home late from golf.<eos> And there on the table, I saw a pair of over-easy eggs that honey had left for me.<eos> I ate them up, and I passed out with the plate on my chest.
Hong, Huang, it don't matter.<eos> It is important to make clear that Barry is no one in this family's uncle. He's a bum.<eos> Continue.<eos> I'm gonna give you some of Barry's secrets of the trade.<eos> When I walk around and I see French fries uneaten and untouched, I put them in a little baggie and put them back in my bin.

Mm!
I will hand them over personally.<eos> Why don't we drop the whole<eos> "I'm a fighter for my patients" act, all right?<eos> We know you mistreat your patients, and we know you did something to these four women.<eos> Yes, I helped them.
Hello, Mr. President.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you know you could get Gettysburger French fries in a bag from the grocery store?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Freedom fries... Right from the store. You just put them in the microwave.
# And all the lights that lead the way are blinding<eos> # There are many things that I would like to say to you<eos> # I don't know how<eos> # You're going to be the one that saves me The songs on that record, they're extraordinary songs, and they're not extraordinary songs because of anything that I did.<eos> I only wrote them, and we only played them.
# There are many things that I would like to say to you<eos> # I don't know how<eos> # You're going to be the one that saves me The songs on that record, they're extraordinary songs, and they're not extraordinary songs because of anything that I did.<eos> I only wrote them, and we only played them.<eos> It's the millions of people since who fucking sing them back to you to this day that have made them extraordinary.
Wait! You have to forgive... me.<eos> Hey, what just happened with the York boys?<eos> Funny story, g-good story.<eos> Uh, we found the killer.<eos> He gives his victims two hours to, uh, be forgiven for their sins, or he cuts them up!
He's in a cell in the intake.<eos> Wait, you... you tried to stop Zoom alone?<eos> Long story.<eos> Well, we have to get him back.<eos> Wally, before Zoom took Dad, we all agreed that if we got him off this Earth, we would close the breaches for good, and we would never open them again, under any circumstances.
You found the book.<eos> Was there any evidence it had been tampered with?<eos> No.<eos> And until I find any, I'll choose to have hope.<eos> Those pages could have fallen out and still be in this house, and I, for one, won't give up without trying to find them.
She thinks I lied to you.<eos> He took the pages.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> Ask him to show you his hands.<eos> He's been hiding them since I got here.
He assaulted Dr. Rogers in the morgue.<eos> And to make the assault stick, we need to put him there,<eos> - but Dr. Rogers never saw his face.<eos> - She lifted his prints.<eos> She collected them herself, off her own body.
How can I help ya?<eos> Yeah, I had some questions about, uh, memberberries.<eos> Yeah. Everyone wants memberberries these days.<eos> Right over here.<eos> Don't know what makes them so popular.
Gerald, we need each other!<eos> The Danish are planning something horrible against us!<eos> I'm not one of you, okay?<eos> I just need to stop.<eos> Guys, I've been thinking this over a lot, and we need to be more active in showing the girls we respect them.
Well, it started as a safe space for women. Ooh!<eos> Then, it became a safe space for women and men. Oh!<eos> Now, it's more of a safe-ish space for women... Mm-hmm. ...and a really safe space for men to look at women...<eos> I hear you.<eos> ...while also being driven around by them. -Wow!
You're getting on that plane come hell or high water.<eos> I can never tell if you're lying.<eos> To be clear, I am the hell and the high water.<eos> I can never trust my gut when it comes to you.<eos> You're skipping around in a field full of bombs and mistaking them for daisies.
You just didn't trust me?<eos> You confused feet with meters.<eos> I had no choice! No.<eos> You asked Happy to take pictures of these plates... before I confused the units of measurement.<eos> That's when you took them.
The next day I quit and begged my father to give me a shot.<eos> You know, the others say that, uh, S.E.G. is a...<eos> A turnaround shop like that's some kind of an insult.<eos> I'm not familiar with that term.<eos> We buy companies and turn them around and make them profitable again.
After all, you own the place.<eos> Most of it, at least.<eos> Before I started altering myself, someone else had beaten me to the punch.<eos> I want to know who and why.<eos> These things you're doing, have you ever stopped to ask why you're doing them?
How about showing them a little respect, okay?<eos> We were just wondering if you knew that internal monitoring increases the risk of an infection without offering a comparable amount of clinical benefit.<eos> Her mother was a midwife.<eos> She grew up with this stuff.<eos> We're also wondering why, if you really want to respect these women, you'd have them stand around for an hour while you talk about how the TV can play soothing sounds of nature.
Something's happened to him.<eos> - You blame us?<eos> - By process of elimination.<eos> What possible rationale could we have to drag an entire Crusade army all this distance only to turn on them now, when we need them the most?<eos> I've long questioned how your minds work, or even if you have them.
Madam Secretary, I'm happy to meet you.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Inciting a demonstration against the very work you were appointed to support?<eos> I tried to share my concerns with you.<eos> And when I didn't embrace them, your next step was to humiliate the president?
Not since 1992.<eos> Yeah, it's all right. Come in.<eos> I went through the East Africa report again last night.<eos> There's been a change since we sent it to you for approval.<eos> The CIA redacted a few lines, classified them.
Okay, I think I may have misread, "that body belongs to both of us."<eos> Good morning, everyone!<eos> I'm speaking loudly so you can all hear me over the vast gap in our status.<eos> I have some exciting news.<eos> To cut back on the number of stolen scrubs, we're installing a machine to dispense them.
It's not your fault.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> This was my plan.<eos> We need those ships.<eos> Why didn't you just hand them off to us in deep space?
He did it!<eos> Sabine, you take this one.<eos> We'll move on to the next ship.<eos> I'll call in the air support.<eos> As you can see, your ships are safe and sound right where you left them.
So the profile you gave us, the serial killer you described, it doesn't line up with what we know of the Ripper.<eos> Really?<eos> How so?<eos> Well, he chloroforms his victims first, and then he chokes them, to kill quickly, silently, minimal use of violence.<eos> And then he carefully poses them.
There's one here in D.C.<eos> See?<eos> You need me.<eos> I cleaned the bones.<eos> I don't think we got all of them.
You will never have a good marriage by lying.<eos> (Both) We would never lie!<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, Elliot, Alan hates your cornrows.<eos> - (Gasps) - But I only hate them 'cause you look too handsome.
You're late. Theodore, make a note of that in our attendance records, please.<eos> 15 people auditioned; I could only take 11.<eos> This musical adaptation of Moby Dick is my senior thesis, and it is not gonna be easy.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> I'm, like, obsessed with the songs in the show. I've memorized them all.
This will be a perfect place to start my new collection.<eos> Query, does anyone have more coins?<eos> I must collect them all.<eos> So, in order to keep his self-destruct programing at bay, he's collecting coins?<eos> What happens when he gets them all? Impossible.
Valerie said the babies want to stay where the magic is.<eos> And right now, that magic is in your blood, which they're getting a steady stream of.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Well, Valerie's plan is to channel enough magic outside of your body so that the babies are drawn to it.<eos> That way they don't resist when the doctor tries to pull them out.
Are they okay?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Babies are healthy.<eos> They're with Alaric.<eos> He took them to the nursery to get them checked out.
The head worked for a Jhosep Balzan?<eos> I've never heard of him.<eos> Yeah, he's a supplier of all manner of contraband on the island.<eos> If the people you're looking for are still in Cuba,<eos> Balzan is protecting them.
Let's cross-reference former and current matadors with criminal records that fit the profile.<eos> The festival employees are almost completely accounted for, and we have confirmed the alibis for all the matadors currently in Pamplona.<eos> Jack?<eos> Our unsub has a very narrow comfort zone, yet the crowds all but guarantee he is not holding his victims here.<eos> Yeah, but he needs time to torture them, so he's holding them somewhere. Yeah, we know he's mobile.
But I don't know how to be a lieutenant, no one would believe it.<eos> It's easy. There's one basic rule you always have to follow.<eos> Make people believe you always know everything.<eos> But what if you don't know things?<eos> You get a private to do them. If he messes up, you blame him.
What's your local bishop going to have to say about that?<eos> He's not gonna like it.<eos> But do you know how much the pharmaceutical companies charge for just one of those pills?<eos> $40 or $50.<eos> And most insurance won't cover them.
And most insurance won't cover them.<eos> That's robbery.<eos> So you and Charlotte decided to strike a blow against Big Pharma.<eos> We can make pills every bit as good as the real thing for under five dollars each.<eos> Assuming you sold them to a distributor for ten, $15 a pill, you would have raked in about... 100 grand a batch?
I was the smartest engineer in that entire place.<eos> That's why I worked the ballistic missile team.<eos> And Ryan worked on bombs?<eos> Munitions.<eos> I don't know how many times I have to tell you we don't call them bombs.
My people see anything they don't like, I don't care if it's a seagull too fat to fly...<eos> You don't need to threaten me anymore, Captain.<eos> I know how this is done.<eos> Chinese ships are on the move.<eos> I'm tracking them on sonar, too.
I'm not exactly San Diego's most eligible bachelorette.<eos> That's not gonna be an issue.<eos> Seriously, my moms are cool.<eos> I just haven't told them that I'm seeing, like, anyone, so...<eos> But... but I want them to meet you, like, really meet you.
I hear the tip line has been filling up.<eos> The tip line crazies?<eos> Oh, God...<eos> So, these victims aren't even dead?<eos> Major didn't kill them?
I've never shot anyone, unlike my opponent, and since I don't own a gun I don't see how I ever could.<eos> My opponent obviously has much more experience with deadly weapons.<eos> Now, I'm not saying that we need to take away anyone's guns, but we do need tougher regulation.<eos> Look, Brenda, the answer is simple.<eos> We need to keep guns out of the hands of those who would use them to harm and kill innocent people.
What were you planning on doing with the pictures you took?<eos> The world needs to see the danger he is to all of us.<eos> And what about the gold coins?<eos> Those are worth more than $12,000.<eos> They belong to the church. I was taking them to the bank.
You take out a fucking ad!<eos> Oh, you know how this goes, Liz.<eos> I'll be slotted and then it will all blow over.<eos> Well, you better bloody hope so, 'cause Kaz is revving' up the women,<eos> - and they all think you betrayed them.
- They don't press the button.<eos> - If Tasha hadn't have pressed it,<eos> - Rules are rules. - she would've been rap...<eos> They're not your rules.<eos> - You just inherited them.
Of course not, Lord Hades.<eos> These interlopers must be punished, starting with the man who murdered you and dared to go back on a deal with me.<eos> But how am I supposed to defeat the Dark One?<eos> Check out the arrows.<eos> I think you'll find them up to the task.
Ask her again.<eos> We need to know exactly what she saw.<eos> It's La Mojana.<eos> It's a local legend.<eos> A woman that changes shape, takes people into the jungle and eats them.
It was "the" date, and I wanted it to be perfect.<eos> God, why does everybody always disappoint me?<eos> Because that's life, Gabi.<eos> People disappoint.<eos> They... they don't mean to, but it happens, and you forgive them.
Did I?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We have some missing persons photos we'd like you to take a look at.<eos> Hmm, so young.<eos> I...don't imagine that's what they looked like when their killer encountered them.
So, I just wanted to say...<eos> This is Beckett. All right, guys.<eos> What do we got?<eos> Right now, our victim is a John Doe.<eos> There's no phone or I.D. on the victim, but we scanned his prints and we're running them now.
- According to Dr. Gould, Emil was turning over a new leaf, possibly shutting down Men Now, which must have made you quite angry.<eos> Angry enough to kill.<eos> No, you have this all wrong. Emil wasn't going anywhere.<eos> Dr. Gould was very precise about the words Emil used. Yeah, well,<eos> I can quote them, too, because I wrote them.
Uh, sort of.<eos> I-I followed the signal to a remote terminal, but the problem is, the line was still hooked to a routing station.<eos> So, the killer could have accessed the feed from virtually anywhere?<eos> Yeah, and that's not the worst of it.<eos> The cameras were still transmitting when I found them, which means the killer could have been watching when Booth and Brennan came to the house.
That doesn't make sense.<eos> Those are drugs you would use if you wanted someone to die a relatively peaceful death.<eos> Our killer drilled holes into his victims.<eos> It's completely random.<eos> First, he brutally tortures his victims. Then he shows compassion in killing them.
We know it's a long shot, Mr. Chandler, but my wife's life depended on it.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I remember her. I can't make any promises, but I'll go have a look.<eos> How am I supposed to find one picture... from the thousands and thousands I've taken of her?<eos> Thank God I digitized them all.
All right, well, when was the last time you saw him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Two days ago, maybe three?<eos> Mrs. Nieves, it was raining earlier today, and those boots are still wet.<eos> Someone other than your husband leave them here?
What is this, fan mail?<eos> Oh, not exactly.<eos> Remember I went on "good morning america" A while back and offered a reward for proof Of anyone who knew what happened to me<eos> During those eight weeks I disappeared? But, castle, those letters are over a year old, And we've already proven<eos> Why are you re-reading them?
Hear, hear. Easy, now, let's not forget we're still talking about people here.<eos> Well, I don't know what calls you're taking, McMillan, but some days, I feel like I'm working animal control.<eos> At least you can spay and neuter an animal.<eos> Uh, are you listening to yourselves?<eos> People respond to us based on how we treat them.
We've been tracking Karume's men.<eos> Zoom in on that group of women.<eos> It's Jada.<eos> You think she's with Karume by choice?<eos> Karume takes women prisoners, uses them as sex slaves.
What?<eos> As long as I have this scar, Rayna will hunt me.<eos> This isn't about just you and me anymore.<eos> There's kids involved.<eos> I'm not gonna put them in danger, which means that I can't be with my girlfriend as long as Rayna is alive.
You've got to resign.<eos> We have no other options.<eos> The President can't go to Congress with a bailout right now.<eos> In the fallout of the Great Depression,<eos> FDR closed all the banks for a bank holiday, and then he reopened them in stages when they were reported to being sound.
Avery, I am so sorry.<eos> I don't want apologies.<eos> I want answers.<eos> Well, once Python left it behind, it must've sat for months, eavesdropping on our network traffic.<eos> Every time someone logged into a station, it-it captured their credentials and used them to inject malware.
He was using that house to do so.<eos> Launa shows up to confront him, they wrestle over the gun.<eos> All right, so our victim started out as our perp.<eos> Well, the good news is we were able to figure out whose prints were on the champagne glasses.<eos> Now, lab matched them back to a Natalie Jacobs.
What?<eos> The second that you crumple up a food bag, it becomes a garbage bag.<eos> It's the same bag.<eos> Then you eat them.<eos> I don't want them.
My god! How did you get all those tapes on a lawn mower's salary?<eos> They got this catalog filled with albums, and they just give you 12 tapes for a penny.<eos> That deal defies all reason.<eos> I know.<eos> I got them all...
Anthony Balsamo, you old son of a gun.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Why don't you come around anymore?<eos> 'Cause your beautiful daughter broke up with me.<eos> Ah, women... Who can understand them?
Perhaps.<eos> But, in truth, I do think the time has come for me to retire.<eos> - It's so clever of you to find gardenias.<eos> - It wasn't easy, Ma'am.<eos> Lord Melbourne grows them at Brocket Hall, but...
Are you crazy?<eos> !<eos> They're Florentine leather!<eos> Ay, Manny, that's what we just told you.<eos> We got them in Chinatown.
Or myself.<eos> And then I'd remember that what he was doing to me was nothing compared to what I did to him.<eos> All those people in those meetings are all tormented in the same way.<eos> The same sorry, not sorry, the same anger and remorse. Both at the people who've harmed them and at the people they've harmed.<eos> When you take both lists and you lay them side by side, you put the aggrieved up against the aggressors, the the weird thing is, it's the same names on both lists.
Uh, Dr. Dreessen, this is Dr. Masters.<eos> - You already know Dr. Leveau. - A pleasure.<eos> Of course.<eos> Dr. Masters and I have been going over the current patient files.<eos> It might be most useful if we review them all together. Let's begin.
Fresh meat!<eos> Lewis gets away again!<eos> Hey, where are my shoes?<eos> Up there, fool.<eos> Who put them up there?
Hey, Virgil, there's something wrong with our apartment, and we'd really appreciate it if you just came down and...<eos> Hey, are those my headphones?<eos> No proof.<eos> They say "Neal" on the side.<eos> I had them custom made, but the package never got delivered.
The man was a castle squire who disappeared a few days ago.<eos> It was only when we dug him up we discovered the other body.<eos> The woman was highborn.<eos> Previous victims were left to be discovered.<eos> He's hiding them, burying them beneath the castle.
"My darling Delilah, you've ignited my soul..."<eos> What?<eos> That's actually very romantic.<eos> Where'd your roses go?<eos> I gave them to McGee.
He put this in my pocket before he went out there.<eos> The gun wasn't loaded.<eos> -He said someone had planted the guns.<eos> -That's a lie.<eos> We went through the registers where he bought them.
Perhaps the artist did not see these women as human beings.<eos> Perhaps they were nothing more than objet de perverted animal desire.<eos> Uh, well... that's not the traditional reading.<eos> But anyone else?<eos> Perhaps he only saw them as tools.
Whoa, whoa.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Getting what I came for.<eos> I want answers.<eos> Well, there's no one in there to give them to you, man.
We need to understand the intricacies of how these young women are being moved.<eos> Otherwise the body count will become a hell of a lot more than just these three.<eos> I say we stop them before they get on the plane.<eos> Now, when Laura was that age, she was highly impressionable.<eos> And if you threaten them with calling their parents or harangue them with jail time, they'll talk!
You mean the sad people?<eos> The who?<eos> They're right behind you.<eos> They look sick.<eos> You don't see them?
What?<eos> How often have you fired a pistol?<eos> You must reconsider.<eos> Guns are terribly unreliable. They often misfire.<eos> Even our soldiers rarely use them in France.
- Mm-hmm. Bye.<eos> I see you've located some pages about you in Amy's journal.<eos> Have you read them?<eos> No, that would be a violation of her privacy.<eos> You leaked them to the whole school.
This is a problem between us.<eos> Stop avoiding it.<eos> "Seol, I sent that text to Oh Young Gon because I disliked you so much."<eos> "I didn't miss your calls because I was busy."<eos> "I was angry because of Baek In Ho, so I avoided them on purpose."
They're filming a commercial.<eos> No, with Vests.<eos> He just fired me.<eos> - What?<eos> Luisa asked me to replace some bottles and he saw me putting them back and now - he thinks I stole them.
We're in a crisis.<eos> It's our job to hold the country together.<eos> You sat with the President and wrote those policies.<eos> You didn't fight for them.<eos> If President Michener couldn't make them work, then Howard Oliver certainly can't.
There was a huge operation to test the code on PLCs here are Fort Meade and in Sandia, new Mexico.<eos> Remember during the Bush era when Libya turned over all the centrifuges?<eos> Those were the same models the Iranians got from A.Q. Khan.<eos> P1's.<eos> We took them to Oak Ridge and used them to test the code which demolished the insides.
-Ööö-ber.<eos> -Right.<eos> But it's the--<eos> -Ööö-ber.<eos> It's a service where people can request a ride and I will pick them up.
-You did not.<eos> -I didn't notice until we were leaving.<eos> She was walking as if she had shoes on.<eos> I mention it and she said,<eos> "I left them somewhere." How do you do that?
You said it. I didn't.<eos> Hi, Grandpa.<eos> Grandma, are my boxes still in the guest room?<eos> -Some.<eos> I gave a bunch of them to Berta.
God, I want you in my mouth.<eos> False alarm.<eos> It's just food porn.<eos> Loser.<eos> The Everclear software scans the subject's brainwaves and translates them into images.
It's not exactly a coveted position.<eos> - But, sir...<eos> - I have written to General Clinton informing him of my resignation and my request to be discharged back to England.<eos> I am done with the colonies, Wakefield.<eos> I do not understand them and perhaps never will.
Okay, we got a cellular antenna.<eos> It's possible that it detected Joel's phone as they approached the crossing here.<eos> According to the police report, the last two robberies took place at train crossings.<eos> The first two at dead ends.<eos> So the Flash Squad rerouted their victims, using that navigation app, then forced them to stop here, trapping them.
Call Krumitz. Raven just got us our first lead.<eos> Could help us identify the rest of the Flash Squad.<eos> They communicated through an e-mail account, but never actually sent any e-mails.<eos> Riley and her accomplices-- they shared log-in credentials for the same e-mail account, but they never sent e-mails to each other.<eos> They just wrote wrote drafts and then saved them.
Got it.<eos> I'm sending the address to you now.<eos> Clear!<eos> - Yeah, nothing back here. Okay, so, the motel manager says two girls paid cash.<eos> He did not get a good look at them.
They know that we're closing in on them.<eos> They won't draw attention to themselves. Yeah, but we don't even have a description.<eos> Whoa. Wait a second here.<eos> Now... the girls don't know that, though.<eos> You know what? You're right. As far as they know, Riley gave them up, and every cop on every corner could have their photo.
Of course not, Quill.<eos> I'm still mad about you taking me out on one date, making me pay, and never calling!<eos> (GRUNTING) How did you find us here?<eos> (GRUNTING) Thanos has spies everywhere.<eos> (GRUNTING) He will not have them here for much longer!
Yeah.<eos> Did you ever get violent with her?<eos> I didn't have to. The drugs took care of that.<eos> Why is it the FBI's problem how I treat my girls?<eos> It's this department's problem how you treat them.
Who's "we"?<eos> Who's your partner in L.A.?<eos> A genius.<eos> He believed in me.<eos> Took my visions, made them real.
I hope you're not gonna listen to him about volunteering for the study.<eos> I just thought I'd fill in the form, see if they take me.<eos> Oh, they'll take you.<eos> I've watched 877 couples have sex on the other side of the glass.<eos> Most of them I never saw again, so I can't say that I know what happened to them, but some, like Langham,
Someone had to help her do that.<eos> We have video footage of you outside of her cell yesterday, and it looks to me like you purposely blocked her view of the camera.<eos> Was that so she could slip you a letter?<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> The letters were all harmless. I read them.
He's got the beloved Russian puzzle game?<eos> Are you sure he doesn't have a case of the Super Mario Brothers?<eos> Well, there's a lot of people ahead of you, so why don't you take your boyfriend's boo boo and sit down?<eos> Fine.<eos> But he better not die, 'cause if he does, I'm gonna take those buttons and pin them to your sack.
I love Mary, you know? But after four kids, she's put on 60 pounds. She'd rather have a doughnut than me.<eos> So... I go to hookers.<eos> And I pick Irish girls, 'cause they remind me of Mary before she was... you know.<eos> You're sentimental.<eos> Well, there are these two particular lassies I like, and I've been seeing them kind of regular, so... it's got to be one of them.
We responded to a tip that underage girls would be at a sex party, and in attendance was Bronx ADA Winn, two assemblymen, a retired DA investigator, a councilman, and I'm sure that you recognize...<eos> Judge Wheeler.<eos> Why am I not surprised?<eos> What about the girls? Are they talking?<eos> Oh, no. Their pimps have them completely under control.
- They killed her.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You keep saying, "They," Nina.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - I told you from the beginning that all I wanted to do was save the girls, and you gave me your word you would protect them.
They're replacing them just as fast as we're taking them out.<eos> I'm glad you're all here.<eos> Take a look at this... sort of a Black Claw corporate structure.<eos> These are the top Black Claw operatives that we know of, alive or dead, listed based on their position in the organization.<eos> The blank spots are positions we know exist, but we don't yet know who's filling them.
Could be unconscious, like, maybe he doesn't even know he's doing it.<eos> It's guilt, man.<eos> That British douchebag just broomed a bunch of his crew.<eos> He subconsciously feels guilt.<eos> No, guilt makes you wash your fingers, not kiss them.
Just do not look away, even for a second.<eos> I know a girl who did teleprompter for Sting.<eos> She leaned down to scratch her ankle in the middle of "Fields of Gold."<eos> The lyrics started scrolling in Spanish.<eos> Sting sang them in Spanish.
I've probably stolen, like... 20 bikes.<eos> Really?<eos> What do you do with them?<eos> I just, like, use them and then I...<eos> Sometimes I put them back.
Just wanted to spend time with you.<eos> If there's anything you wanted to ask me, just fire away.<eos> Are they a nuisance?<eos> Oh, the boxes.<eos> Not if you keep on top of them.
Here you have enemies on all sides. Montreal is safe,<eos> It is immune from native attack; There are banks, There are warehouses with abundant coal to heat them.<eos> Men the hbc wouldn't have to feed or arm.<eos> You have stones, mr. Grant.<eos> But if you think I won't cut them off. And feed them to the ravens you're wrong.
They're the diamonds of social interaction - beautiful and strong but rare.<eos> Alright.<eos> Welcome, everyone.<eos> So our goal is to give the government a set of recommendations to reduce gun crime in the city - that's it.<eos> And the only way we can achieve that is by understanding who's illegally importing these prohibited guns, who's controlling them and how they're being circulated.
Did I, did I tell you my proposal for the recreation centre might be coming back into favour?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> You match what Bao Long was gonna pay for the land? No.<eos> A... report hit the press about the use of poker machines in NSW.<eos> Even though there were 300 less of them last year, $3 billion more got pumped through them.
I mean, if I learned anything from surviving the last serial killer who tried to kill us, it's that you always need a group of less attractive, less popular, less interesting people around for the killer to kill before you.<eos> Okay, that is genius.<eos> Which is why I'm the brains of this operation.<eos> Now let's hit the spa.<eos> These bedpans can wait until we find less attractive people around to clean them.
You call Ihab.<eos> You tell him you have Mrs. Al Fayeed.<eos> I will die before I betray Ihab Rashid.<eos> It says here your daughters' names are Suhail and Dina.<eos> I'm going to bring them both here.
You tell him you have Mrs. Al Fayeed.<eos> I will die before I betray Ihab Rashid.<eos> It says here your daughters' names are Suhail and Dina.<eos> I'm going to bring them both here.<eos> You can watch while my men rape them, and you'll watch me put a bullet in each of their brains before I put a bullet in yours.
- Why didn't you wake me?<eos> - Have you seen my keys? They...<eos> I got called in.<eos> Yeah, which is why I want to know why you didn't wake me.<eos> I had them in my hand when I walked in the door.
So it seems.<eos> We've got her, Jane. It's over.<eos> She's trying to get inside your head.<eos> Alice is a master manipulator, like Charles Manson or Jim Jones.<eos> She has the instinct of finding vulnerabilities and exploiting them.
But to actually hold an autopsy book...<eos> You'd be surprised how little protocols have changed.<eos> You know, I haven't found anything pertaining to this murder/suicide case.<eos> Have you?<eos> Imagine if the people who wrote these reports knew that we'd be studying them over a hundred years later.
He was sloppy... just dumped him in the dirt.<eos> Then the next two were planned more carefully.<eos> He waited for a funeral to come along so he could put the victims' bodies into the caskets.<eos> Decent theory.<eos> We know he was embalming them.
I provided him with some information in exchange for Storybrooke.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Storybrooke is mine now.<eos> And I brought some friends.<eos> You know, I've been looking for a place like this for quite some time... A land where all the world's lost and forgotten stories could play themselves out. And now that I have brought them here, that is exactly what they're going to do.
We need to get the FBI on this!<eos> They took my hockey stick!<eos> And... And some things from under my mattress!<eos> Your things aren't stolen, Schmoopers.<eos> I just took them all back.
Oh, my gosh!<eos> And then we can have those big turkey legs.<eos> - Oh, yeah!<eos> - I love them!<eos> - My kids love them!
I just said go smaller, didn't I?<eos> I don't want you on the field, Charles.<eos> I want you to work for me here in the front office.<eos> Lend your expertise.<eos> Obviously you're not short on opinions, and when you let them fly, they do make sense.
Not that it matters, since you're clearly not attracted to me.<eos> Was it the kissing you then running out of the room screaming?<eos> That was a hint.<eos> By the way, if you're looking for your shoes,<eos> I dropped them off.
Hurry before this spinal fluid goes bad.<eos> Now, that's a sentence you could go your whole life and never hear.<eos> Okay, let's get our bearings.<eos> If we're going the right way, there should be two peaks to the west.<eos> But we need a higher vantage point to see them.
Because your girlfriend is in a death spiral.<eos> Just fix it, okay?<eos> "Pencils down."<eos> We all remember those dreaded words from school.<eos> When you heard them, it meant you were out of time.
I didn't know you were standing there.<eos> I wasn't talking about you. Or us.<eos> Not that there's an us to even talk about. I just meant that...<eos> Dr. Vaziri, the cameras don't lie.<eos> Well, then why don't you be a decent human being and turn them off. Cam...
Babies are precious here.<eos> Well, babies are precious everywhere.<eos> Nevertheless, I expect half your patients come to you asking you to prevent conception.<eos> Since they licensed the pill, yes, although...<eos> Well, these women are poor and they are black, and they live in a society that is gradually stripping them of any dignities or freedoms that they ever had, so motherhood is everything. It's status, purpose, life itself and we have to help it to happen.
It's 1962!<eos> Oh, disgusting!<eos> I've just changed Doctor Myra's sheets.<eos> Apart from being helped to drink a little fluid, it's the only attention she'll accept.<eos> Put them in the basket over there.
There you go, chap.<eos> Oh, bless him.<eos> Three, two, one...<eos> JENNIFER: 'Not all gifts come tied in ribbons 'or at a special time of year.<eos> 'Some blessings surprise us, arriving unlabelled, 'and we embrace them in a blaze of joy.'
No.<eos> Because they've gone missing from the locked garage.<eos> Look, I just found out that my friend has cancer and it's a little hard for me to think about bikes right now.<eos> Okay?<eos> But I didn't take them.
What burner phone?<eos> Sit down here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> His, uh, keys, did you remember to do something with them?<eos> I tossed them in the gutter.
That could be why she's been here all this time.<eos> (Aria) 'It's too strange to be a coincidence.'<eos> The two people with the biggest ax to grind against us are-are teaming up to chop our alibi to bits.<eos> We'd know for sure it was them if someone had showed up at the apartment today.<eos> (Aria) 'Yeah, well, Toby's squad car' 'probably scared them away.'
Do you think Sirens could be real?<eos> To be honest, Bonnie, I...<eos> I don't know what to think anymore.<eos> I suppose every story has to start somewhere.<eos> "They bewitch everybody who approaches them.
It's funny coming from a guy working so hard to save his friend's life.<eos> I can live with Bonnie hating me, just as long as she lives.<eos> I got to go.<eos> I'm driving.<eos> If you're looking for the crossbow bolts, I moved them in with the Halloween decorations.
No, I do not want to see Stefan, okay?<eos> I just want to know.<eos> You left things unfinished.<eos> Oh, things are finished.<eos> He finished them when he just Ashlynn'd his way out of town three years ago.
Right.<eos> Packed you a little something, just if all your mumbo jumbo doesn't work.<eos> Now, Fergus was bright.<eos> Walked before his first birthday, but he hated pants.<eos> Hated them.
See if the eyewitness was solid.<eos> Since we're kicking tires, only two leaf fragments were found in Odell's car.<eos> After Tess and I drove back from the scene, leaves were all over the inside of her ride.<eos> So Odell brushed them off.<eos> Or maybe the cops planted them.
I am done. I have put up with this all afternoon, and I want my Sue back...<eos> happy Sue, sweet Sue.<eos> Well, sweet Sue can't save the arctic foxes, but angry Sue can, and they are first on mine and Jeremy's list, partly because that's where they come alphabetically but also because they need us.<eos> You know, you don't have to think things just 'cause your new boyfriend does.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You think I think things because a man thinks them?
Mass mole execution.<eos> How?<eos> Somebody turned those tunnels into a gas chamber.<eos> Well, it had to have been Davies.<eos> Davies must have known that the moles were following the sloth and took them out before they could create another sinkhole.
I went to work, brought love and light to kids, then I saw some things...<eos> Things I can never unsee.<eos> Hey, hey! You don't dump old fries.<eos> You marry them.<eos> But the customer licked the salt off and put them back on their plate.
I'm gonna hang onto this until I get my power cuffs back.<eos> What, your power cuffs?<eos> Your meta-human power-dampening cuffs?<eos> Those very ones, the ones that are missing all of a sudden.<eos> What... you think... you think I took them?
So now?<eos> The alloy is very specific with trace quantities containing dozens of different genetic markers, and I was able to nail the forensic evidence to coming within the past 4 years.<eos> What are you trying to tell me?<eos> This is gonna sound crazy, but so is Prometheus.<eos> I think that Prometheus has gotten his hands on the various arrows that you've used over the past 4 years, melted them down, and fashioned weapons out of them.
We're just...<eos> You mind taking your hands out of the bags, please? Yeah, we're just on a walk.<eos> - Just passing through. - Uhhuh.<eos> And the rocks?<eos> We leave them at every stop, lightening our physical substance...
If it but herald Death, the vision is divine.<eos> What's the matter? What's the matter?<eos> - Somebody has been in my room.<eos> - Somebody?<eos> Somebody has been through my things and not had the wit when they put them back to realise that everything was in a certain order.
Ooh, that sounds good.<eos> I don't know that I like living here anymore.<eos> Oh, yes, this picnic is so good.<eos> I'm starting to see some ants.<eos> Oh, I-I-I see them, too.
Tight.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> And, uh, getting those docs in line, isn't that?<eos> the chief resident's job anyway?<eos> Wonderful, the guy enforcing the rules is the one who's always breaking them.
Ms. Reese.<eos> You make it sound tawdry.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> At our age, there are very few men left, and people need companionship.<eos> I make them happy, they make me happy.
Well, I wanted to meet in person so there's no evidence we had this conversation, but... I'm conceding my win.<eos> I don't want those women.<eos> The book club is all yours.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I don't want them.
We wouldn't even be in this mess if the girls found out about the condoms at the same time we did.<eos> I get it.<eos> We just keep using the condoms until they notice the holes in them.<eos> No.<eos> We just redo the poker game, and this time we invite them.
- I'd throw my bra on the stage.<eos> - Please do that.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Listen...<eos> I, um... I am in this... kind of deep with you, so just... don't say these things if you don't mean them, okay?
Dead. We know.<eos> And it turns out the emails were sent from your computer, Emma.<eos> - That's ridiculous.<eos> I did not send those emails.<eos> I didn't say that you sent them, but they were sent from your IP address.
Do you know how long I've wanted to sleep in my own bed with my wife'?<eos> I didn't think you'd be ready to tackle the stairs for a while, Bob.<eos> It's amazing how once one thing goes your way, everything starts to go your way.<eos> Let's have fresh linen to celebrate.<eos> I only changed them two days ago.
We'd just be camping over the weekend.<eos> Half the class is going.<eos> I really, really want to go.<eos> Mom said to ask you, since there were girls coming. But...<eos> But Bobby's parents are chaperoning them, and I would never do anything to shame our family.
Olivia, could you empty out your pockets for me?<eos> Everything, please.<eos> I found these on the driver's side floor.<eos> I never found your dad's car keys.<eos> That's because he gave them to you, isn't it?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Strumble.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Oh, but I think you can.<eos> You see, I may be an old woman, but I have two very good assets.<eos> Please don't show them to me.
- No, he's not here for me.<eos> He's here for Thomas Shaw.<eos> That's it.<eos> Clay drummed up an obsession with the Iosavas to try and flush Shaw out into the open.<eos> Distribute false intercepts to a small circle of people and watch to see who leaks them.
That's it.<eos> Clay drummed up an obsession with the Iosavas to try and flush Shaw out into the open.<eos> Distribute false intercepts to a small circle of people and watch to see who leaks them.<eos> An eyewash.<eos> But the fake intercepts were so good that somebody at the Agency believed them. Decided to kidnap Iosava...
- Something bad happened. No!<eos> No! Gino!<eos> - OK, I think it's deep enough.<eos> - Move aside.<eos> (from "Gitanjali") "Thy world is weaving words in my mind, and thy joy is adding music to them.
Wait. What?<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God!<eos> I am freaking out.<eos> Where are the nannies?<eos> I gave them afternoon off.
Which would make it, what, seven miles?<eos> The tunnel must cut directly under the mountains.<eos> Right. But the walls are old.<eos> Centuries, at least.<eos> So who the hell built them?
I just need to do something.<eos> Caroline, if something happens to those girls....<eos> - I know. - Look, they shouldn't be living this life.<eos> I know!<eos> You know, when we get them back, I'm taking them away.
Two brothers.<eos> Two powerful, immortal vampires.<eos> I'll do it. Just let the girls go.<eos> I don't know how to protect my own children.<eos> Yes, you dou Take them someplace safe.
Besides, that's what I sirened Tammy's family for.<eos> Who wants to be alone on Christmas?<eos> Bring me your phone, Bonnie.<eos> It's really quite simple.<eos> I assess the evil in people, so if they are wicked, immoral, corrupt, foul, nefarious, et cetera, I kill them.
Your children need my help.<eos> My children are just fine.<eos> And you're never gonna come around them ever again. I have to.<eos> I need to fix what I started.<eos> I was giving them training, preparing them for Cade.
They asked you for help and you preyed on them?<eos> I was doing them a favor.<eos> What, by putting mandrake in their drinks?<eos> I thought it was an organic kind of roofie.<eos> I didn't know that it would kill them.
Let me get you some cash.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, babe.<eos> You got the keys?<eos> No, I gave them to Tony to make a set for Philip.
Uh, no, not when you're acting like a big gorilla, pushing people around and flinging your own poo.<eos> Okay, I think we can find some time to do that before I go.<eos> Yeah, what are bridesmaids for?<eos> Mmm, well, historically, they were decoys, so they would get kidnapped before the bride would.<eos> Uh, but their lime-green dresses always gave them away.
- I don't even like her scrambled eggs.<eos> Yours are better.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Don't tell her.<eos> Remember when we used to do them with cinnamon sugar?
The B...<eos> I went there.<eos> The archbishop sold it?<eos> What happened to the nuns?<eos> They shipped them off to assisted living.
Rescind all of my domestic policies.<eos> They're not working and people aren't happy.<eos> There's not much more they can take...<eos> You think you can waltz in here and leverage this crisis to muscle me?<eos> Look, when you closed the banks for a month and then reopened them with limited withdrawals, we supported you even though our people were up in arms.
No one's leaving.<eos> We already lost one man.<eos> I'm not gonna lose another.<eos> What do we do?<eos> I say we send the divers out again, we attach C-4 charges to each mine, we blow them up one by one.
Nick for Jess.<eos> Incoming knocking.<eos> Jess, have you seen... uh, uh, cherries?<eos> I'm so confused by your question, that I'm just going to answer it, uh, directly.<eos> Yes, I've seen them.
And I know where the gada is too.<eos> - We're going there now.<eos> - No, we're going to the gift shop now.<eos> They're fakes.<eos> We're gonna make copies and sell them to the tourists.
- Okay.<eos> Random patterns. They're in all the artefacts.<eos> - Um, um. - All of them.<eos> I made a drawing of the patterns...<eos> Jian connected them, he was bored, having fun.
Great.<eos> And I'm asking you to agree with me on details, Because clearly you can't come up with them on the spot like I can.<eos> You have to know your story.<eos> I always know my story.<eos> This is different. People ask follow-up questions. When you don't kill them in the first five minutes.
Oh, my God! Kieran!<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Where's what?<eos> - Where's the mask?<eos> - You really think I carve people up and hang them up like pieces of meat?
I can't get an uber to pick me up.<eos> I think my rating's too low.<eos> What's yours? Oh, bad.<eos> Apparently, they don't like it.<eos> When you call multiple companies, and make them race to pick you up.
She've always took an interest in our ventures before.<eos> Demelza has business elsewhere.<eos> You were born for this life, my dear.<eos> I like to think so.<eos> London is full of beauties, but you will outshine them all.
[CHEERING] First one. That's good.<eos> He's great.<eos> He's great going left and right.<eos> Amazing.<eos> To make sure that the M2- that wasn't on the lap board all by itself, we got the American to put other benchmark cars- we call them benchmark cars, he calls them communist- around the track, to see what's what.
What's going on? Hm?<eos> Oh, maybe it was those pills that you gave me.<eos> The sleeping pills?<eos> I told you to take those at the airport so you wouldn't freak out on the plane!<eos> I took them early so that I would not freak out in the Uber.
I'll wager that's the first time since this started that an animal actually saved someone's life.<eos> Keep your mouth shut.<eos> Seriously, how many people do the animals have to kill before you wake up?<eos> The animals are sick.<eos> When people are ill, you take them to the doctor.
Yes. The D.A. subpoenaed DeLuca's medical records and your personnel file.<eos> What now?<eos> What now?<eos> What now?<eos> You know, people come to this hospital so that we can help them.
Not hers.<eos> I wish I was as good as Mer at forgetting things.<eos> My life would be a lot easier if I was.<eos> Okay, she does not forget things.<eos> She buries them.
I just want to see Polly.<eos> Daniel, I'm gonna need to get a spinal x-ray.<eos> I can't feel my legs.<eos> Okay, I don't want you to be alarmed.<eos> No, no, I mean I haven't felt them for three years.
How have you been getting away with it for so long?<eos> Give me a break, Nolan.<eos> We just solved your case.<eos> I don't make the rules;<eos> I just follow them, which is more than I can say for you two.
Tonight, you will prove your worth, to yourself and to the brotherhood of Omega Theta!<eos> Quick Q. N.B.D.<eos> What do we do with the hands after we remove them?<eos> Do we each keep one?<eos> We incinerate them.
Does anybody remember how we got here?<eos> There was pizza.<eos> I remember the anchovies.<eos> You don't like anchovies.<eos> Which is why I remember them.
Many centuries ago the Oracle forged a prophecy cube and she saw herself within it.<eos> She was being murdered by one of her 33 high priestesses, though she couldn't see which one.<eos> So she forged new prophecy cubes, one for each of the priestesses, containing a vision of them dying at the hands of the person they married.<eos> So how did she link the prophecies?<eos> She married each of the priestesses, meaning that the Oracle became the person prophesied to kill each of them, meaning that they couldn't kill her, because otherwise she wouldn't be alive to kill them.
All we have to do is turn it on and...<eos> Scotland Yard will scoop him right up.<eos> If you can just get the keys from him, unlock the car, I can do the rest.<eos> Get the keys from him?<eos> He usually keeps them in his jacket pocket.
- Less than one percent.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Thank you. Yes.<eos> And do you know why?<eos> Because it's because of this exact conversation, because we don't believe our victims. We make them feel like they asked for it.
The problem was her hands.<eos> Her... her hands?<eos> Yeah, I mean, the MS, it... made them so gnarled that she... she couldn't open the pill bottle.<eos> She couldn't even swallow the pills.<eos> So, I... So I crushed them up for her and... Mixed them with yogurt.
You went to Linley's house?<eos> Patrick, I saw your criminal record.<eos> The last thing your family needs right now is for you to be in any more trouble.<eos> My family needs answers.<eos> I need answers, and you're not giving them to me.
It was...<eos> Like a South Sea, uh, kind of a sea goblin creature.<eos> Oh. It lives under the water, and at night it comes to the land to sleep.<eos> And it'll suck your bones out...<eos> Take them back to the ocean.
That level of violence definitely matches the Juarez M.O.<eos> I tracked down the serial numbers for the guns recovered at the scene.<eos> Three months before the massacre, they were recovered in a raid by the New York DEA.<eos> How does a Mexican cartel steal weapons from the New York DEA?<eos> - They don't. The DEA sold them.
Sweetheart, I bought two boxes from you half an hour ago.<eos> You've already done this side of the street.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Both of which you're going to take to the office with you tomorrow.<eos> If they stay in this house, I'll eat them all.
You are more Roman than they are.<eos> I know Gaius Vitellius cannot be trusted.<eos> But what they offer us is survival for our people.<eos> They offer us nothing.<eos> These lands are our birthright, yet Rome takes them.
Because I saw myself die in it.<eos> You were in the film?<eos> Yeah, I was in...<eos> I, saw myself... get executed.<eos> Then you know everything you need to know about the films, why we don't fucking watch them.
Right. Not your style.<eos> My boy, Eduardo, you recall?<eos> Lovely lad.<eos> Those long eyelashes of his.<eos> He'd bat them at you and that was it... you'd lose yourself in him.
He acts so smart.<eos> Why can't he be a man?<eos> I don't like men who are easy.<eos> They're worth more if they're hard to get.<eos> Women are only happy if they marry men who love them.
Not great.<eos> Well, these things always have a way of working out.<eos> You've had a turnaround.<eos> What are you doing over there?<eos> Well, you know how we couldn't compare the fingerprint on the syringe with Eddie Harp's fingerprints 'cause we didn't have them?
I'm sorry.<eos> If I'd known you'd be showing up here, I would've brought some lobsters.<eos> In exchange for the trout.<eos> They were delicious, by the way.<eos> I prepared them with an almond crust, a little lemon.
Whatever you saw in the woods unsettled you.<eos> So you barge in here, inappropriately.<eos> You are edgy and defensive, and you're demanding answers with the idea that it'll fix things, but it won't.<eos> These people, they came out of the woods.<eos> They poured out the ashes of my victims and flung them into the air.
Possibly Dutch?<eos> I met the guy once, okay?<eos> He didn't talk much.<eos> How does it work?<eos> I find the girls, I show them their head shots, they pick the ones that they want, and I send them to an audition.
And it's a future in which we are building cities.<eos> We humans love a target.<eos> We love to have something to shoot for, to aim for, and to build a plan to make happen.<eos> It's been the case over and over again, whether it's the colonization of a New World, the railroads, the opening up of the West.<eos> All these things are all impossible until we make them real.
Actually, I don't care.<eos> Bye.<eos> Go now.<eos> She had 24 confirmed sexual liaisons in and after college.<eos> You'll find them tabbed in yellow.
Don't you mean "Whip Me Harder"?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She's known for being kinky.<eos> She wines and dines women, then takes them home, and goes 50 Shades of Gay on 'em.
It's worth more than $11 million every month.<eos> Our, uh, immigration facilities are a disgrace.<eos> There are families kept there, uh, in horrible conditions.<eos> They're called "detention facilities," but they're really prisons for immigrants.<eos> Calling them "detention facility" doesn't make them not a prison.
I didn't grovel to Per Se.<eos> I groveled to Nathan.<eos> But I don't want to talk about what I did.<eos> I want to talk about what you did, because if you didn't file those motions then I might as well cancel dinner.<eos> I didn't just get them filed, I got the city attorney to put them on the top of the pile.
- Staring?<eos> Was it that obvious?<eos> Then I apologize.<eos> But I could tell there was something different about you, and that was before I saw those glass shoes of yours.<eos> Wherever did you get them?
Mrs. Peterson, I'm Laura Larson.<eos> Uh, Ben's wife.<eos> - From your husband's...<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> If you're here to get the keys to the house, they took them.
You know me as the reenactor playing the role of Shelby on My Roanoke Nightmare.<eos> And I know a lot of fans are always really surprised when they first hear me speak, because I have an English accent.<eos> Where are you taking us?<eos> Safety. Where do these tunnels lead?<eos> I thought the hillbillies built them.
She wanted to come because she's really hungry.<eos> I brought sausages.<eos> Oh, venison.<eos> Nice choice.<eos> Yeah, I chose them.
Nothing happened since, just so you know.<eos> It's just a memory of something beautiful.<eos> You never gave up something beautiful?<eos> Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.
Just go!<eos> Go, Sharad. Go on, Sharad!<eos> Ballistics have confirmed that the guns are British Army issue.<eos> Julie, you said that Stephan Milner had possible links with the military?<eos> So, Milner's contacts nick the guns, he ships them?
And I know you'll get those friends back.<eos> Oh, stop! Don't give me that look that makes me do things.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You found my things!<eos> I didn't find them.
- That's not the solution.<eos> - Well then, what is?<eos> The bad guys are running around everywhere with these high-tech weapons.<eos> I just think it's about time the good guys got some of our own.<eos> Alien guns are bad no matter who controls them.
It will be if I can get it working.<eos> This whole party...<eos> You set a trap for these guys.<eos> Yeah, a trap that will fail unless I can get this operational.<eos> Okay, so if the Black Body is at equilibrium with the alien weapons, then it will absorb the electromagnetic radiation and shut them down.
- Hack Lena anyway.<eos> - Duh.<eos> So what is this interview for, really?<eos> It's a puff piece.<eos> "Women of Power and the Mothers Who Molded Them."
You please me.<eos> I followed your advice.<eos> I spread rumours I would allow opium to be traded in return for a small tax.<eos> Now they come, all the greedy Europeans, with ship-loads of opium.<eos> They unload them, they will store them in warehouses, and then I will command my army to confiscate every last barrel.
What do you want to teach me now... teacher?<eos> Well, it seems you have forgotten the most important lesson of all.<eos> Never take what's mine.<eos> The shears.<eos> The pirate had them hidden, and now they're gone.
He's not a colleague.<eos> He was an operator who was pulling my strings, too.<eos> What is it you want me to do?<eos> Victor took these, last winter at my cottage, the first day we looked at it.<eos> I'd like you to move us to this area by the barn, and then take these rocks and put them here.
See this?<eos> Strangled. Stabbed.<eos> Look... Look at their faces.<eos> Do you see what he did?<eos> He didn't just kill these women. He made them suffer.
Strangled. Stabbed.<eos> Look... Look at their faces.<eos> Do you see what he did?<eos> He didn't just kill these women. He made them suffer.<eos> Someone made them suffer. And I intend to find out who before Gerald loses any more of his life.
Gosh.<eos> Remember, you were so obsessed with collecting those rocks.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Did you ever do anything with them?<eos> No, I never found them when we got home.
This is what I was afraid of.<eos> What's next?<eos> We hire somebody to do our taxes, cut the grass, remove asbestos from the ceiling? Maybe.<eos> If we could afford it, what's wrong with that?<eos> A family is supposed to do things for each other, not hire strangers to do them.
Oh, all right, everyone.<eos> Let's keep working on our projects.<eos> How did you know I was going to the Mountie Christmas Ball?<eos> Oh, my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The walls at the rowhouses are paper-thin, and your squeaky voice cuts through them like a knife.
- What do you mean, leaving?<eos> - Now he thinks they're after him, whoever he competes with in this sex business of his that I'm not supposed to know anything about.<eos> It was such a beautiful couple of days, imagining what could be.<eos> You're such a good man.<eos> You must want things, but, you don't take them.
You would just kill these frogs for fun?<eos> Yeah. 'Cause their bodies were just, like, blah. And we were just, like, blah!<eos> -Oh, my God.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> And then we would, like, dissect them and, like, see their body parts.
Quinn and Bishop might need our help.<eos> Actually, it's a two-and-a-half- hour drive in traffic.<eos> And Bishop and Quinn are totally capable agents who aren't always looking to "settle down," by the way. Wow.<eos> You know what, Nick, we gave them good leads.<eos> Let them follow up on them.
Bloody hell.<eos> You know about this?<eos> Yeah, it's me. Take it down.<eos> No, I'm not taking it down.<eos> There's someone luring people with that app, and then killing them. You shouldn't be on it yourself.
You bash innocent men and you throw them to their death.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Sally...<eos> I don't want anything to do with the cops. I don't want anything to do with Hammers.<eos> There's someone luring people with that app and then killing them.
I...<eos> No.<eos> It's true.<eos> Take it from someone who knows the difference.<eos> You must want things, but you just want them.
Now you're afraid of me.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.<eos> You think because I was in prison that I'm dangerous, that you're unsafe around me?<eos> I don't know what to think right now.<eos> Did you know that in Mexico, the cartels run the prisons, use them as power bases, information centers, factories for training soldiers and sicarios?
I just knew you'd come back.<eos> You know what they say about curiosity and cats and... getting killed? Who are you?<eos> I'm like you.<eos> Well, not physically.<eos> No, what I mean is the things you see, I see them too.
When was this?<eos> Well, when was he discovered?<eos> I see.<eos> Are you there now?<eos> I'd like very much to see things as you found them.
How do you know till you try?<eos> I bought new sheets.<eos> I mean, in case.<eos> I mean, I could have just washed them, but...<eos> I looked at them and I thought, "Well, they're not very nice."
I think we're getting closer to finding Jody.<eos> We are? Yeah.<eos> Glowworms.<eos> They're amazing creatures.<eos> Luciferin's the chemical that makes them illuminate.
Okay.<eos> After your dad died, did your mom still make you act like a family?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Dad made us have these family dinners.<eos> God, I hated them.
Okay, what if the ambo partners are really different?<eos> One is a wholesome good girl, and the other's rebellious and feisty and...<eos> They make out?<eos> They clash.<eos> But they ultimately realize that their differences make them great.
See? Look.<eos> Bump. It's all right.<eos> I'm very relaxed.<eos> Eventually, we pulled over for a cup of coffee and a bit more arguing about doors.<eos> Just because they had them in the 12th century on cathedrals, whatever, you don't need them now.
During Hurricane Sandy - an unverified Twitter account posted...<eos> - Oh, God!<eos> ...that the New York Stock Exchange was under water and teeming with sharks.<eos> News outlets actually carried the story.<eos> People will believe what we tell them to, and that tape will be ripped to shreds.
Okay.<eos> Yeah, that'd be great.<eos> Just sign here.<eos> Those are all for the Porter case?<eos> Where do you want them?
- That's just wrong.<eos> He makes all of us come here on Christmas Eve, just 'cause he doesn't have any family.<eos> Neither do we, now they all canceled. Hey.<eos> We have two little girls at my sister's house, you know.<eos> - Unless you want to leave them there.
I'm gonna go have a serious talk with our own Clarence Darrow.<eos> Detective Murphy used four psychological techniques to get Richard to make a false confession.<eos> You're gonna use 'em on me?<eos> No.<eos> You are gonna make Murphy acknowledge that he used each and every one of them in court.
Well, now.<eos> What do we have here?<eos> That's not the mark from the vaccine.<eos> You got something different.<eos> You stole the injectors, and you used them.
She knows we've arrested someone. - She just doesn't know who it is.<eos> - Then, she has nothing.<eos> She knows we're hiding something.<eos> Mr. President, we agreed not to tell the press anything until we have all the facts.<eos> Well, we have them now.
He appears to be a mission-oriented moral enforcer who may be forcing his victims to wear a cilice made of of burlap and fastened with barbed wire.<eos> What's a cilice?<eos> Originally it was a garment made of coarse cloth or animal hair, used in some religious traditions to induce pain or discomfort as a sign of repentance and atonement.<eos> He may be projecting his own sexual desires onto his victims.<eos> He's punishing them because he wants to have sex with them, but because of his upbringing, he can't or won't.
Another victim just turned up.<eos> Tate Orvis, Brooklyn software programmer. Showed up at Stuyvesant Memorial half hour ago.<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> Symptoms same as the chef.<eos> Well, we have to find out who all these people were before we can figure out who wanted them dead and why. At least we have a lead.
Yes, see that guys?<eos> Yeah, because they don't need us.<eos> They can be single now.<eos> 100 years ago, they couldn't be single.<eos> We had laws that wouldn't allow them to own property, or have a bank account, or get divorced, right?
Yeah, I need a Coke and some criss-cut fries.<eos> We're not serving those tonight.<eos> Don't toy with me, kid!<eos> I want some criss-cut fries now.<eos> Sir, we're not serving them tonight.
Israel desk for almost 20 years.<eos> She obviously knew something that I didn't.<eos> Well, did you ever ask her about it?<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> Ali picked them.
Well, it's not the kids who send out the Evites, Katie.<eos> - It's the moms.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And at the parties, the kids hang out with the kids and the moms hang out with the moms.<eos> And the moms know you can't stand them. Mm.
Katie, come on.<eos> You really want to be friends with those women?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But I want them to want to be friends with me.<eos> Up until now, I've been rejecting them.
Mostly because he's so excited to go back to work.<eos> - He got the all-clear?<eos> - Any day now.<eos> But what do I do about Catalina?<eos> I've been dropping subtle hints, and she is not picking up on them.
No way to trace them back to him, either.<eos> Actually, I think there is a way.<eos> I've seen those girls before.<eos> Where'd you get these?<eos> Damien Novak's wife found them on his laptop months ago.
Now, the only way to convince the people in this town you're innocent is to show them who you really are.<eos> Under stress, your brain finds relief in music.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Your testimony is gonna be a basic blues riff.<eos> We're gonna show them that you're a musician, an artist, and that you create things, not destroy them.
So, it's just gonna be me and the receipts.<eos> You haven't done those yet?<eos> Nick, our accountant needs them today.<eos> I know. It's the do date,<eos> So, I'm going to do them today.
So it isn't actually meat, it's some kind of fake meat?<eos> No, it's actually meat. It's 100% American beef. We just... grow it here in the lab instead of on a cow.<eos> You do see how those ideas don't go together.<eos> Well, muscle is made of cells, right?<eos> We harvest those cells humanely from living animals and replicate them here.
Oh.<eos> Then I count my blessings.<eos> Well, I embraced the opportunity to educate my olfactory palate, but... I must admit, it's not for everyone.<eos> I thought you said the table wasn't helpful anymore.<eos> I noticed that Shinwell hadn't sanded down the knife chips, but rather packed them with wood filler.
Once the M.E.'s given us the time of death, we'll be able to confirm the receptionist's timeline and check the security footage at Jamaica Station.<eos> Make sure she was there when she said she was, yeah?<eos> So Joan's identity was stolen by a doctor?<eos> She was running a pill mill.<eos> She stole the credentials of four doctors, including Watson's, and used them to sell opioid scripts.
Would you say there's a lot more going on, a lot more skill involved than jumping on a rollercoaster, going for a ride?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Grant.<eos> Tory right now is probably freezing his nuts off.<eos> I mean, like, literally freezing them off.
As I watch him walk off into the sunset, I realize now how happy I am not to have his job.<eos> Thanks, Mr. Printer-Fix-It-Man.<eos> All right, it turns out that printers are complicated beasts.<eos> It's not always their fault when they break.<eos> Does it make me hate them any less?
Taking jobs.<eos> See there?<eos> Drones aren't just annoying people.<eos> Check out this eagle who is taking names and kicking some serious drone butt.<eos> And, in fact, eagles are so innately anti-drone that crime fighters around the world are turning to them to take out criminally driven drones.
The Somali community is asking the men holding Paul and Rachel Chandler to release them.<eos> [music playing] [all singing in Somali]<eos> These pirates are criminals.<eos> They are armed gangs on the sea.<eos> And those plotting attacks must be stopped, and those who have carried them out must be brought to justice.
So it was very important to have them released.<eos> [Lotan speaking Arabic on loudspeaker]<eos> [Lotan speaking Hebrew] All Israeli Forces... Nine men and two bodies will exit the church.<eos> Hold your fire.<eos> We were only small, of course, and the coffins were heavy because we'd made them out of wood and other stuff.
But emails in the dump purporting to be from Noel Biderman's inbox reveal that the company not only knew they hosted escorts, they actively sought them.<eos> In one case it appeared that 2,500 escorts were emailed enticing them to join Arrangement Finders.<eos> When it worked they planned to contact 45,000 more.<eos> Some emails discussed the possibility of bringing foreign women to the US to work as sugar babies.<eos> And how the company would market them.
Girls.<eos> You did have fun upstairs.<eos> - What'd you find?<eos> - How many girls did you take here?<eos> What makes you think I would bring them here?
You know, you don't want this on you.<eos> I mean, 4 dead girls?<eos> God!<eos> Because you ran away?<eos> Because you left them?
What are you doing here?<eos> We wait for the big man.<eos> He bring us here.<eos> New girls come every few week.<eos> He bring them here, then... girls come and go as they buy.
So that's why you're quitting. You've met your match.<eos> Oh, no. No. This guy, he's way beyond me.<eos> I can't stop him, which begs a more important question.<eos> Is he really worth stopping?<eos> These victims, they were dying anyway. He's not killing them out of compulsion, or anger, or any... deviant psychosis or so.
Kevin, did you know that Whitey was an informant?<eos> No, I didn't know.<eos> I mean, he hated rats.<eos> We fuckin' buried rats, especially our own.<eos> I mean, I knew he had his connections in the FBI. I knew he had his sources. But I figured he was playing them like he did everybody else.
A thousand leagues along the equator.<eos> Where knowledge ended, speculation began.<eos> That's where the whales had gone to hide.<eos> As far from man as they could possibly go.<eos> But we hunted them down.
You may want to cover your ears.<eos> - Great.<eos> Now Ben, bring it on back.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, keep them covered.
- I've got her.<eos> Hold her up.<eos> The IT guys, they can't restore the footage of her walking in and out.<eos> Who left the room unattended?<eos> According to the computer, those doors were locked until security opened them.
Aren't they filled with fucking thousands of pages of mortgages?<eos> I read them.<eos> - You read them?<eos> - I read...<eos> Yes. No one reads them. Only the lawyers who put them together read them.
I told you we'd met before.<eos> If you don't remember, I can refer you to the entry...<eos> No.<eos> I remember.<eos> You hunted down the witches and brought them to justice.
Radar, sonar, aerial patrols all report no other vehicles have left this island since last night.<eos> That includes submarines.<eos> What about fishing boats leaving the mainland?<eos> The boats go out every morning at dawn.<eos> I saw them. How many of them are there?

You just walked around calling yourself "The Titty Whisperer."<eos> - I don't call boobs titties.<eos> - Of course.<eos> So where did they get it into their minds that you had whispered to any boobs or any titties?<eos> Because we had to whisper downstairs and everybody assumed there would be titties because you are the girl and I'm the guy and usually the girl takes her titties out and the guy usually touches them.
It's was 3 years ago.<eos> Look. I was going to tell you, but I needed to know if you would come first.<eos> Hey, look. Sam, I appreciate what you're trying to do man, but I uh.... - I don't this stuff to cure my nightmares okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> But visions like this aren't just going to go away unless we really hit them head on.
I sent this all to you guys 5 years ago.<eos> To The Globe?<eos> Who did you send it to?<eos> I don't wanna say who, but they said that they weren't interested.<eos> - But Phil, we did run a couple stories on you, I saw them in the clips...
I still don't know what we're doing here, and I haven't been inside a church since Jim's funeral, and I just... I don't...<eos> The suit's really uncomfortable! It's making my thighs all sweaty, and I don't understand what...<eos> And then we'll go through your vows.<eos> You've both written them by now, yes?<eos> We'll have them done by tomorrow, I promise.
Hey, I'm gonna take you out.<eos> Sort of like a little welcome to the neighborhood?<eos> I appreciate that, but you got.. You got kids at home.<eos> Yeah, but they live with their mother.<eos> I get to see them like once a month, you know how it is?
Yeah?<eos> Like what?<eos> What are you doing with my dad's boxers?<eos> Oh, they're your dad's?<eos> I found them in your stuff.
Oh la la.<eos> It's a festival.<eos> Where are these chicks in the winter?<eos> They work. They're in an office in Seville.<eos> In Paris, you don't see them.
I put in all her favorite things.<eos> All the things that would make her happy.<eos> And her favorite teddy bear.<eos> It was almost like the teddy bear died when she died.<eos> And then I took the suitcases out to the bay and I... put them in the water.
Oh what? You want kids who like the Yankees?<eos> Tony, please don't push me.<eos> All right.<eos> Dear Eilis, Thank you so much for the nylons.<eos> The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.
Traitor.<eos> Thor?<eos> I saw something in that dream.<eos> I need answers.<eos> I won't find them here.
Try to smile, Maria.<eos> It's good to exercise your facial muscles once a year.<eos> The Bloch-Bauers.<eos> I found these letters amongst my sister's belongings.<eos> Look, I've translated them for you, on the back.
I don't even think...<eos> Dude, you were the one who set the rules!<eos> You're the one who said that we had to be all freaking careful!<eos> I did.<eos> We all followed them, and kept each other accountable on every single one!
Actually, I don't think she trusts anybody, really.<eos> Least of all herself, which is probably a sign that she's become become someone who she doesn't really wanna be.<eos> And every day that goes by makes it harder to remember that she once was passionate, willful.<eos> She disapproves of those things.<eos> Now she fears them.
Do they have any idea what caused it all?<eos> There's rumors.<eos> There are theories, like mad theories, but...<eos> You guys have your bikes?<eos> No, our dad gave them to some kids at a school a while back.
What about little Jézureau?<eos> The kid at Valentin? Little Dougčre?<eos> That's different.<eos> We know that he's still having sex with consenting minors.<eos> But that he'd kill them?
Are there other broadcasts like this?<eos> There are at least three others like it.<eos> Now, this radio I have seen over with Jonas' things, along with this map.<eos> But Jonas found the pattern.<eos> Yet the families are only murdered after they leave the house where Bughuul found them.
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.<eos> Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.<eos> Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives?<eos> You must leave this.<eos> He chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him.
Stands Scotland where it did?<eos> Alas, poor country, it's almost afraid to know itself.<eos> It cannot be called our mother but our graves.<eos> What's our newest grief?<eos> Let not your ears despise my tongue which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard.
I can remember, I... I just kept thinking...<eos> "Who am I going to play with?"<eos> Because that's all we'd ever do.<eos> She... she taught me how to play.<eos> On rainy days, she'd take blankets, and she'd drape them over... tables and chairs and sofas, and... and she'd sit in there with me.
Joe!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Why you babies stopping back there?<eos> Let's add 20 push-ups.<eos> On my whistle, Joe's going to count them out.
You were snoring very loudly.<eos> That's just really not the most upsetting news right now.<eos> My father used to bring people here.<eos> Did he also make you dress like a slutty dolphin trainer?<eos> He'd starve them... torture them.
- So what?<eos> Half the girls in L.A. have fake boobs.<eos> Yeah, and I'm sure it's great for business.<eos> - I don't do porn!<eos> - Who paid for them? !
I'm thinking about not taking the meds.<eos> So you can slice yourself up like Talbott?<eos> They just don't seem to be working for me.<eos> What's real and in my head, is blurring.<eos> Caff, we've only been taking them for less than a week.
She just moved from New York to Chicago.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> They buy the cows when they're three days old,<eos> - put them in there. - Okay.<eos> And then Mary has to nurse them with, like, a little formula.
The benefits are listed there.<eos> But, basically, they're more sheer, softer, and more like silk to the touch, yet still very strong.<eos> So you can pull them down over and over?<eos> You can wear them quite a few times before they run or lose shape.<eos> Oh. - Do you wear them, Joan?
Perhaps the mountain?<eos> We call a search party?<eos> Yes, maybe it's better.<eos> We have to report them both.<eos> Do not we find them, we need reinforcements.
- In the mountains?<eos> - Yes.<eos> To Hvannalindir.<eos> Yes, but in the highlands.<eos> If we bring them there, they can survive the winter.
I know, but I just feel like, if I start seeing someone else or just even go on a date, that...<eos> I'll be admitting that it's over, and I-I...<eos> I don't want to do that.<eos> You know... these Mounds bars are delicious, but you have to eat them.<eos> If you just hold them in your hand hoping that you might get to eat them one day, they're going to melt.
I don't remember...<eos> Their faces or how they talked.<eos> Last night I was watching Lena while she was asleep.<eos> And I was thinking about all the thousands of little things That I'd done for her as her father.<eos> And I'd done them deliberately so that she would remember them When she grows up.
And he does it by giving in to faith which is an explosive combination.<eos> Because on the one hand, he goes too far, does awful things.<eos> On the other hand he can't live with the awful things he's done.<eos> So now... he can't find them in his head.<eos> - He can't find them?
" Dr Omalu. " You're in trouble, but you're not wrong.<eos> I'd like to talk with you.<eos> The NFL has known about this concussion crisis for years.<eos> And what you have there is the research... that forms the basis for the League's concussion guidelines.<eos> In this study, some academics put helmets on monkeys and shook them real hard. They threw dogs and pigs and human cadavers down elevator shafts.
Are you sure I can't talk you out of this?<eos> I've already got your boyfriend on my conscience, and I--<eos> I've been in scarier situations than abandoned streets with a bunch of Hazmats lurking around.<eos> There are worse things to be afraid of.<eos> You've seen them, haven't you?
- I am.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> When I want to be alone, like, to write, I really do want to be alone.<eos> I think if you dedicate yourself to anything, one facet of that is that it makes you very, very self-conscious.<eos> And you end up using people... wanting them around when you want them around... and then sending them away.
We don't have an old score to settle.<eos> Schneider just shot at me.<eos> He wants to clean up and go home.<eos> - Car keys?<eos> - I don't have them.
Well, I imagine it still all works the same, doesn't it?<eos> More or less.<eos> It's changed a bit over the years.<eos> I can't even tell you the things we're expected to do now.<eos> I only do them to be polite.
Yeah, right.<eos> Like that's gonna happen.<eos> Jude, why don't you tell Mr. Stevens what you told me, about what happened in the tent.<eos> So, um, that night, after bed check, we had some girls come into our tent and we played some games and stuff.<eos> Then we ending up making out with them and...
- Your services are no longer needed.<eos> - Excuse me? Let's keep it quiet, let's keep it cordial.<eos> - Thanks for all your work.<eos> - I'll get my things.<eos> I'll have them sent down to you in the lobby.
The next president of the United States, Richard Nixon!<eos> Bill Buckley says,<eos> "This election, it'll be decided on the issue of law and order."<eos> And he was right.<eos> What is on people's minds, what frightens them is the fear that a generation that, by the New Deal, was put into the middle class is now going to lose all of those gains.
I made a similar promise, only my good sense would make up for your misjudgment, sir. ~ My misjudg... my misjudgment?<eos> !<eos> ~ You gave me permission to speak freely, sir.<eos> Being armed to the teeth will not help you in the bush, sir.<eos> The natives have never seen what guns can do, so they do not fear them.
I think it's a huge mistake, sir.<eos> How is morale?<eos> Low.<eos> Private Buckley will carry his scars for months.<eos> The convicts will see them.
Plus, he O.D.'d on top of one of the Jennifers.<eos> That's the talk around town, anyway.<eos> And you know what? He's part owner in one of those companies that sends regular Joes up into space.<eos> So, the girls going into space?<eos> Almost... uh, we put them in that jet that makes them weightless.
Damaged.<eos> And we just dump them.<eos> I never thought of it like that.<eos> You know what's crazy, is that I sell these big, fancy cars.<eos> And the people that buy them, they feel so important, and immortal.
Michael Kelly severely bit his nails and his killer severed his fingers.<eos> Her killer targeted her face, her skin.<eos> The Internet's a place where you can create an illusion, show people only what you want them to see... but when reality didn't match up with what the killer saw on Flirtual, he punished them.<eos> He wants perfection. He's searching for it.<eos> And when people lied about their flaws, he killed them.
You have to fight those feelings.<eos> As soon as you let them in, they take root and take hold.<eos> You know, there are some...<eos> Schools of thought that say that it's better to acknowledge your fears, get them out in the open.<eos> You keep them bottled up inside, they turn into other things.
We all loved Gus' sense of humor.<eos> What about his concerns?<eos> Did you understand them?<eos> Understand them, yes.<eos> Did I share them? No.
Is there something wrong with that? No, it's just... Oppressed women kneeling at your feet, inhaling toxic fumes all day, all so you can look like a painted doll.<eos> Uh, they were masks, and they massage your hands and tell you you're beautiful. Who else does that?<eos> No one.<eos> Lennox, I have to say, I'm surprised you'd buy in to such a classist ritual.<eos> Your foot is in the hands of these women, but you're really stepping on their heads, keeping them down.
- Were your husband to hear...<eos> - I love my husband.<eos> I know what's said about me behind my back.<eos> Whispers of infidelities.<eos> My husband's heard them.
- I love my husband.<eos> I know what's said about me behind my back.<eos> Whispers of infidelities.<eos> My husband's heard them.<eos> And I suspect, given the look on your face, you've heard them, too.
What are you doing?<eos> David:<eos> Well, I'm gonna go to New York and um... see some people. Alexis:<eos> Oh! What people?<eos> You don't know them.
We anticipate a newcomer. And there is neither cake nor sweetmeats with which to welcome her!<eos> Well, that may very well be for a reason.<eos> We've all seen how you stuff the raw recruits with cake.<eos> They're hard to come by. We don't want you scaring 'em off!<eos> I should think that fibrous pottage you call All Bran would repel them more.
After all, what is love, if it cannot be acknowledged?<eos> Who could I turn to, if not you?<eos> Who would console me, if not you?<eos> You don't need me to console you.<eos> The words are in here and you know them in your heart as I do.
Of course, the little deaf and dumb lady.<eos> I shall dispatch her personal midwives.<eos> And how many times a day do you vomit?<eos> 20 or 30.<eos> Let me put a little Vaseline on your lips, Maureen, to soothe them.
It's been 48 SOLs since I planted the potatoes.<eos> So, now it's time to reap and re-sow.<eos> They grew even better than I expected.<eos> I now have 400 healthy potato plants.<eos> I dug them up, being careful to leave their plants alive.
Ma Chuang.<eos> Is there something wrong?<eos> Ready.<eos> On his right side, can you see the keys?<eos> Yes, I'm going to get them now.
I don't know.<eos> But, Liza, he is a little kinky.<eos> Kelsey, you can't let this guy degrade you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You just took your panties off in a coffee shop bathroom and sold them to a pervert on Craigslist.
Sort of cool, right?<eos> Like one of those old fairy tales.<eos> Fairy tales aren't really my thing.<eos> The bad guy, he never wins.<eos> I love them.
I'll take my chances sailing over taking on those ships.<eos> What? !<eos> I gave you an order.<eos> What is your fucking problem?<eos> The question you should be asking is where are his keys... and has he seen them since he took me away from my men?
Pam!<eos> Sir, maybe...<eos> You should shut your mouth, too.<eos> Now... put on your suits.<eos> Or we'll put them on for you.
You're an amazing writer, A.J.<eos> Mo, that is such an invasion of privacy.<eos> I don't even know what to think right now.<eos> Don't think.<eos> Listen. I thought your letters were so fantastic, I sent them to my cousin Lisa who works at the Huffington Post.
Look...<eos> The bank allows a 20,000 euro withdrawal without checking?<eos> - I'll call them tomorrow... - No, they called you.<eos> You said it was okay.<eos> I can imitate voices after hearing them just once, I do them exactly the same.
I mean... Sultans do have a nice life, don't they?<eos> All about Saverio has been already told, what's new to discover?<eos> His life is an open book...<eos> you can believe me, he was like a big brother to me.<eos> Yes, but... about the daughters... I counted them...
"In my fire, your ice will melt!"<eos> "Just undress"...<eos> --Women...<eos> Once you told me...<eos> "I never thought much about women..." "I never really understood them, I just do what they expect me to do..."
- Alan, tell me! What's going on?<eos> - Is everything alright?<eos> I'd like to get back to work.<eos> What do these carvings mean?<eos> Then why'd you run out of here as soon as you saw them?
- Is it like that for the children?<eos> - Of course.<eos> The children are the most free.<eos> I'm sorry you haven't found the answers you're looking for yet.<eos> I usually find them one way or another.
One thing..<eos> That I've learned that's true..<eos> Is that..<eos> If you don't make your own choices in life..<eos> The world will make them for you.
Have these landscapes always been there?<eos> I believe so.<eos> Well, why have magicians not been able to go about upon them?<eos> These roads were all closed, hidden behind mirrors.<eos> But now, something has occurred to open up them up again.
I'll take a rain check.<eos> Mm, so much rain.<eos> I'm sorry, baby.<eos> I am so behind.<eos> If you're looking for your smokes, don't bother. I chucked them.
Have they been made up?<eos> - It's happening right now.<eos> - Great.<eos> What about the curtains?<eos> Well, we always do that last. - Then Mama Ray double-checks them.
Here, take that.<eos> Are you all right? Yeah?<eos> Okay. We're ready. Let's go.<eos> So I take the tusks? Yeah, they're on board.<eos> I'll take them now.
No.<eos> I don't remember much.<eos> The words came to me blindly, like an animal instinct.<eos> I don't even know what I said.<eos> Whatever it was scared them off.
I should express surprise, but not complete bafflement.<eos> Note I said it was an oral tradition for the most part.<eos> There is one written example of the language.<eos> Relics of a sort.<eos> In a long-forgotten box deep in the archives of the British Museum, and I can't imagine anyone has looked at them in years.
Can you help me?<eos> I think I'm going to topple over.<eos> The shoes are awfully high.<eos> Yes...<eos> I picked them for that.
Oh, thank goodness.<eos> Well, we have had our share of patrons who felt lightheaded at the sight of our exhibits, but... we have never had anyone faint before.<eos> Are you all right, young lady?<eos> What happened to those security guards?<eos> Well, it's past closing. I... I sent them home.
This is my house and while you're under my roof you will abide by my rules!<eos> (Oh, God!<eos> ) D-Did Krystal Weedon give you these drugs?<eos> ~ She gave him these drugs!<eos> ~ I bought them all on my own.
He looks like a cross between my childhood Saint Bernards and a Cuban eeyore.<eos> He even bailed on teaching Stan's music class this week.<eos> Andy teaches music?<eos> He used to shake maracas in his stand-up act to punctuate any joke that didn't work.<eos> He shook them quite a lot.
Well, Brody and I got in this big argument after I said I didn't want to marry him.<eos> Why don't you want to marry Brody?<eos> - I have my reasons.<eos> - Well, they sound stupid.<eos> - You didn't even hear them.
- Come on! Move along! - Fuck!<eos> Wait.<eos> We shouldn't be on the floor.<eos> There might still be bedbugs.<eos> Then we'll both get them.
Frankly, I think we're selling ourselves a little short at 50 bucks a pop.<eos> I think we should shoot for the moon, and go for, like, 75, maybe.<eos> And the more we can get...<eos> Well, that means that I'll have to recruit more panty girls.<eos> Seriously, that's what you call them?
Just employees sexting and porn on their work computers, masturbating in the office.<eos> Just disgusting.<eos> - Disgusting!<eos> - Yeah, disgusting.<eos> Don't you think the people buying these panties would feel weird if they knew a bunch of felons made them?
- That's some nasty shit.<eos> - You know what's nasty?<eos> The cabbage that's been in there for two days.<eos> You are a pain in my ass... the both of you.<eos> If you fill them with warm sudsy--
- A little.<eos> I think it's perfect, babe.<eos> - What are you looking for?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> If you're looking for those cigarettes, I threw them out.
You know him pretty well, huh?<eos> I could say the same about you.<eos> - Could you? - Mm.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Some people, you can know them before you know about them.
Feelings ran high.<eos> They also ran high on the picket line, didn't they, love?<eos> For the benefit of the tape, DCI Stanhope is showing Michael Tennant photographs.<eos> Now, these were the last pictures taken by Carrie on the day she disappeared.<eos> We had them developed.
I was a baby.<eos> A lot of people came and tried, I think.<eos> Whatever they did, it went away.<eos> What happened to your sisters?<eos> My father made them move out to the keep, outside.
A lot of people came and tried, I think.<eos> Whatever they did, it went away.<eos> What happened to your sisters?<eos> My father made them move out to the keep, outside.<eos> None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them, especially at night.
What happened to your sisters?<eos> My father made them move out to the keep, outside.<eos> None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them, especially at night.<eos> They started to sound not like themselves.<eos> Did you ever see them?
Did you ever see them?<eos> Only once, at the end.<eos> They were covered with it.<eos> Their faces, their arms, they acted like animals.<eos> My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.
Only once, at the end.<eos> They were covered with it.<eos> Their faces, their arms, they acted like animals.<eos> My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.<eos> What did he do with them in the woods?
Why aren't the morning shows earning more?"<eos> If you interview Survivor contestants instead of survivors of the genocide... your ad rates go up.<eos> Pretty soon we won't even run down our own stories because it's too expensive.<eos> We'll just...<eos> We'll just pay someone else to do it, then we'll read them on the air for show.
Prepaid.<eos> Fake name.<eos> Right, of course.<eos> How do we find him?<eos> The store's searching invoices for the last three days, And they're faxing them over right away.
A heart as big as the moon.<eos> Lost and then found.<eos> Is it true?<eos> I could say that God sent an angel down to instruct me or there was something divine about it... but there wasn't.<eos> The women just needed help and I helped them.
How does this look?<eos> Aw, it's so nice.<eos> She's gonna love it.<eos> Sure, his mom gets roses.<eos> When I want them, they're a "bouquet of severed plant genitals."
Hang on a second.<eos> What kind of cream pie are you talking about?<eos> What... kind of cream pie are you talking about?<eos> Cream pies.<eos> Everyone loves them.
How do you not know what a threat sounds like?<eos> - Oh, you mean the "lips" thing?<eos> - Yes, the "lips" thing.<eos> Charlie, he's got words in his lips- - I needed to get them out.<eos> I know the words are in his lips- - I saw them in there. Just let me... you know, let me coax them out.
What, I suppose you want me to...?<eos> Wait. Kirsten.<eos> The thing about being stitched... it made me feel things I've never felt before.<eos> When I was a little girl, I had to learn how to identify emotions by flash cards of human faces.<eos> But this time I felt them, and they were real.
Hey.<eos> How did I die?<eos> I've seen these stones before.<eos> I've seen them in South America.<eos> I saw them in Egypt. Stone.
These are beauties.<eos> Shall I be honest?<eos> I know I was probably the last on your list.<eos> I'm an outsider to you, but I think I know where these rocks came from.<eos> Out of Mumbai, I'm guessing, and I know who's going to come looking for them.
Help yourself to some boiled peanuts.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Too much salt.<eos> First week I was here, I asked one of the stewards if I could have some boiled peanuts.<eos> I used to eat them all the time as a kid, and I'll be damned if there hasn't been a full bowl of peanuts here every day since.
And so he went rogue.<eos> Without telling anybody, he flipped things around... so that Kennedy was facing west towards the New Frontier, the future.<eos> Now, the mint struck about 3000 of these before they figured it out. They canned the guy.<eos> About 1000 of them made it out into general circulation.<eos> They managed to get most of them back, melt them down.
See you later.<eos> But isn't it even more powerful coming from me?<eos> It would ring hollow.<eos> The words must come from him.<eos> But no one will believe he means them, anyway.
But isn't it even more powerful coming from me?<eos> It would ring hollow.<eos> The words must come from him.<eos> But no one will believe he means them, anyway.<eos> Whether he means them doesn't matter. The fact that he says them shows respect for our laws.
I'll look out for him.<eos> Appreciate that.<eos> You guys picked a hell of a time to shoot the breeze.<eos> Apparently, the storms are getting dangerously close together.<eos> NOAA's monitoring them every second.
So, I just spoke with the chief of police.<eos> Layla took full responsibility for her actions.<eos> No charges are being filed.<eos> She didn't say where she got the pills?<eos> Says she brought them from home.
Of course I know it is, okay?<eos> Tons of exposure for you, lots of money for both of us.<eos> Then what's the problem?<eos> Let me tell you about Jade.<eos> She uses people until she doesn't need them anymore, [scoffs] And then she throws them away like they're nothing.
I'm guessing you also know what people are feeling...<eos> - Whether they're happy, sad, jealous?<eos> - Yes. That's because your brain mimics emotional reactions, too.<eos> We all make micro-facial expressions that telegraph what we're feeling.<eos> Most people can't perceive them, but a synesthete unconsciously picks up on them.
I'll need your advice.<eos> Mr Crabb.<eos> Sorry to trouble you, might you still have those magazines?<eos> For the female help? Yes.<eos> Yes, I'll get them now.
I'm deeply sorry, John.<eos> What did you want?<eos> Just wanted to give you a report on the twins.<eos> Some good news for a change.<eos> Dr. Chickering and I examined them this morning.
This is their last day as a sideshow attraction and you their last audience.<eos> This is no magic trick.<eos> No illusion.<eos> No sleight of hand.<eos> It is scientific knowledge and rigorous experimentation that will finally allow these two young ladies to live the humane life of which fate has so far robbed them.
Their mother, when she was with child, was attacked by a bear.<eos> The girls, even in their mother's womb, instinctively knew that to survive they should cling to one another.<eos> They held on so tight, and this was the result.<eos> The birth was so excruciating, it killed their mother.<eos> Their father died of shock upon seeing them.
He doesn't care about the accident.<eos> All he's trying to do is shake us down, exactly like he did at his last four jobs.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> His last four lawsuits.<eos> Did you think we wouldn't find out about them just because the records were sealed?
You better be.<eos> And the side better be my side.<eos> Okay, sure, of course.<eos> So where are Kevin and the girls?<eos> We started fighting and then he took them to the park, because they come first. Always.
I can't get up.<eos> Help.<eos> I need help.<eos> You been taking your meds?<eos> Have you been giving them to me?
I'm not absolutely sure they ever actually found the ring.<eos> You really are the most extraordinarily stupid creature<eos> I've ever worked with, Cyrus.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> And I suppose, when Daedalus rendezvoused with his troops and led them back to Minos' camp, you considered that a coincidence also.
Are you sure?<eos> Or, uh... this one.<eos> It's one of these two.<eos> You have no keys?<eos> He left them back at the pawnshop.
Maybe you drank too much.<eos> Why do you have to be so tough on the ladies, Gary?<eos> Why do you have to treat them the way that you do?<eos> The thing about girls, man, is their job is swallowing cock.<eos> Since they're just inherently lazy... someone has to be the guy to keep them... Keep them motivated.
Nazis are occupying France, but the war is coming to an end.<eos> Burt Lancaster plays this French Resistance guy.<eos> There's this SS colonel, Paul Scofield.<eos> He wants to keep all the great works of art.<eos> He puts them all on a train and he hires a shit ton of guards, and they're going to ride this thing all the way to Berlin.
- on putting them all on the city payroll.<eos> - Yeah, imagine that.<eos> Patronage-- appointing friends, not enemies to important posts.<eos> I mean, when you're mayor, Nick, I expect a cushy board job, too.<eos> His IDA appointees giving tax breaks to fat-cat developers who don't deserve them.
- I do indeed.<eos> The lamb must be newly slaughtered.<eos> The organs cooked the same day.<eos> I always oversee this process personally.<eos> We construct fairy tales and we accept them.
But I didn't tell him anything he shouldn't have known.<eos> What about Rosalie's Selfridge shares?<eos> Have you been selling them?<eos> As Rosalie's husband, I'm entitled to buy or sell on her behalf.<eos> Lord Loxley bought them.
Daniel: What is normal behavior?<eos> I mean, sometimes it's just a matter of common sense.<eos> If you wash your hands before dinner, you have good hygiene.<eos> You wash them 12 times in a row after touching a doorknob...
You sure?<eos> Howard's a pinhead, but he's not the pinhead.<eos> - Why don't...<eos> - Go to a white neighborhood, and use one colored family to drive a wedge into it, and then when all the white families head for the hills,<eos> Gene steps in and buys all the houses cheap, and then sells them back at a huge markup to the only people who will buy:
Okay, children, come on.<eos> Follow Uncle Creepy.<eos> This way, we're leaving.<eos> Okay, where will we go?<eos> Well, we'll stack the girls into the car like Lincoln Logs and take them to wherever your equivalent of Disneyland is.
I'll get you the damn sub.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> You're right. But we're beyond that now, aren't we?<eos> I heard you kidnapped seven Pakistani girls and locked them up in the US Embassy?
I mean, with everything that's going on with the baby... you're sort of family now.<eos> What baby?<eos> And who the hell are you, anyway?<eos> So, let me get this straight.<eos> You want to keep the girls here, and then let Raja come in and parade them around on TV, and turn them into political pawns?
There are no impossible combinations.<eos> Catherette's mouth, your mouth, the sparrow, wood, cat.<eos> Lucien hangs...<eos> To hang!<eos> Hangings turn upon me, I've fused them with two mouths.
I kept cochlear gardens as a young man to attract fireflies.<eos> Their larvae would devour many times their own body weight in snails.<eos> Fuel... to power a transformation into a delicate creature of such beauty.<eos> To the misfortune of the snail.<eos> Snails follow their nature as surely as those that eat them.
Chez katia is a very reputable boutique.<eos> Yes, and chez katia sends you a beautiful pair of shoes In the wrong size.<eos> You love them, so you will go to chez katia And you will buy the right size.<eos> But while you're there, mademoiselle... [ imitates french accent ] maybe you could buy all ze shoes And give us all ze money.<eos> [ laughs ] Well, if it is a ploy, it's going to work, 'cause I'm gonna stop and exchange them
And everyone in this room.<eos> Except you?<eos> And my niece, Alice, who has done you no harm?<eos> All the women of your house are heretics.<eos> The plague will rot them all.
She's still worried about what Mrs Craine said.<eos> That it's a house of death here.<eos> These experts... Load of old rubbish, aren't they?<eos> Joe Watson asked for his ashes to be scattered at Highbury.<eos> His son didn't even pick them up from the funeral parlour.
That it's a house of death here.<eos> These experts... Load of old rubbish, aren't they?<eos> Joe Watson asked for his ashes to be scattered at Highbury.<eos> His son didn't even pick them up from the funeral parlour.<eos> So we take them to Highbury and he leaves us alone?
Why was I made a magician if not for this?<eos> Sir!<eos> Miss!<eos> What have you learnt?<eos> Is it true that he has turned people into glass and thrown stones at them?
She stayed around long enough to ruin our lives and pass on her fucked-up genes.<eos> You're worried about your brother?<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe he'll still be okay.<eos> Because, you know, my dad's got hemorrhoids and I got them too, but way less bad.
And I think it was more of a cry for help than an actual attempt, though.<eos> I know it sounds depressing, but, you know really, the kid just got some bruises on his fourth chin.<eos> No, no, no, it's just...<eos> I miss my girls, you know, that's it.<eos> - Hey, do you mind if I call them?
Neuroses, anxiety, a painful past, like many.<eos> Guilt.<eos> Guilt over what?<eos> Ben had a weakness for young women.<eos> Paying for them, more specifically.
How long had he been seeing you?<eos> About three years.<eos> Was he making any progress, his therapy?<eos> I like to think so.<eos> His relapses were less frequent, and he didn't compound them with further damaging behavior.
It shows the holding company's assets.<eos> These are all land parcels in that corridor.<eos> Valley poisoned by mine runoff.<eos> There was some kind of buy/sell deal upon death.<eos> I mean, they just repurchased Caspere's shares for pennies and redistributed them. Motive.
We cannot afford to wait that long.<eos> Our lives, our empire, stand on the brink.<eos> You'll be ready later today.<eos> What?<eos> If your Bronze Bull fails to breach the gate by sundown, you will watch as my priests pull the entrails from your stomach and fry them in goose fat.
I need to know what's going on with my kids.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look, she only told me because I promised I wouldn't tell you.<eos> Our kids are so lucky to have two parents who care so much about them, parents who want to know what's going on in their lives so they can act before something comes along that they can't fix.
Fisk...<eos> Fisk!<eos> Fisk, answer me!<eos> Tell our friends to roll the tape.<eos> ...authorities ask that you contact them immediately.
That's just rude.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> Stars aren't scared of success.<eos> They're not always the most talented or the most beautiful, but they're hungry.<eos> That's what separates them from the nobodies.
I do.<eos> I have my own kind of faith.<eos> Blue religion.<eos> Arthur Delacroix's bones came out of the ground for a reason.<eos> They came out of the ground for me to find them so I can put some part of this right.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> I just have to find my keys here, they're...<eos> They are here, somewhere.<eos> Right.<eos> Can't you just leave them in your coat pocket like a normal dad?
Because you're on probation.<eos> And that means I can't talk to people?<eos> No. Jared is your supervisor, okay?<eos> He makes the rules.<eos> You need to follow them.
Thank you.<eos> Go.<eos> Save her, and maybe God will forgive you.<eos> I climbed down the mountain and onto the desert floor, and I ran as fast as I could, searching everywhere.<eos> I tore strips of my blue scarf and tied them to the bushes so I could find my way back.
We were together, breaking bread as a family for the first time.<eos> Did Aziza know that Eleazar was her father?<eos> But they had a special bond.<eos> I hear you make the finest arrows, Aziza, and shoot even better.<eos> I test them for Adir.
Xanthippe?<eos> She's home already?<eos> Are her friends with her?<eos> They're so mean and cool.<eos> Sometimes I look at them at Barney's from behind a pillar.
This is not a visitor, it's the Queen.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Do as he says.<eos> How dare you defy me!<eos> Open the doors or we'll kill you and open them ourselves.
You can go now.<eos> Yeah, her leaving did not make this feel less gay.<eos> So you're the Rape Walker.<eos> Word's getting around that you're a real gentleman with the coeds.<eos> Walking them home...
I think they were planning something special, for the wanderer's return.<eos> Can you sort out the wine?<eos> We've nothing cold.<eos> Here's the thing, there's only three bottles of the '87, but I thought a glass each, for the toasts.<eos> Are you sure, if you're saving them?
He's handpicking who to set up.<eos> First a black hat known for selling zero-days, then a deviant pyromaniac compelled to start fires, and now a revenge arsonist to make a public statement.<eos> Meanwhile, P.E. has done nothing to spread the word about unplugging these printers.<eos> Can you believe there were nine of them on the third floor of this building? Yeah.<eos> I had them unplugged, of course, but...
Killing them all?<eos> The first small bond to the killer itches and stings like a leech.<eos> Like you, Will... he needs a family to escape what's inside him.<eos> You know a fair amount about how these families died.<eos> How they lived is how he chooses them.
It's nice to know there's still a few good guys left in the world.<eos> There better be.<eos> I, uh... I have a sister.<eos> Lorelei, have you thought about filing a complaint?<eos> This happens to so many women at school, and nobody takes them seriously.
That looks bad.<eos> That's right.<eos> We're family.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Remember when your pops had a tab here, and we used to come in and get the chocolate bars and then we sell them on the street for 50 cents apiece. Remember that?
She went out, after she put your girls to bed.<eos> - They're asleep?<eos> It's only seven o'clock.<eos> - They were exhausted!<eos> What are you doing to them?
- So, you wanted to talk to me about something?<eos> -Yeah, I...<eos> I just think that the kids are very confused.<eos> Why?<eos> What have you been doing to them?
-Yeah, I...<eos> I just think that the kids are very confused.<eos> Why?<eos> What have you been doing to them?<eos> I haven't been doing anything to them.
I just think that the kids are very confused.<eos> Why?<eos> What have you been doing to them?<eos> I haven't been doing anything to them.<eos> They weren't confused when I dropped them off at your place.
Then there's breakfast and dinner every day.<eos> Cello practice every day.<eos> Reading them to sleep for an hour every day.<eos> Don't tell me their lives are chaotic!<eos> Well, I'm glad you feed them regularly.
Colette said she wanted to live with you.<eos> Just, Colette?<eos> What about Clio?<eos> Did Clio?<eos> Well, what did you, what did you tell them?
What?<eos> No, she's gonna...<eos> She'll just run out of here.<eos> We're not monsters!<eos> We don't tie people up and hold them captive against their will.
Un-tape her hands, too.<eos> What?<eos> No, she's gonna...<eos> - She'll just run out of here. - We're not monsters!<eos> We don't tie people up and hold them captive against their will.
- Yeah.<eos> Hi.<eos> They have awesome snacks in here.<eos> You should try some.<eos> I-I would, but, they said you ate them all.
The Iron Sisters.<eos> Arkham Bridge.<eos> The towers, they're called, uh, Mary and Betty?<eos> Mmm.<eos> I remember, as a kid, we used to call them that, but... Right.
Please.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> This way, Ms. Mooney.<eos> Who chose these people?<eos> Where'd you get them from?
I lied.<eos> The chopper.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Fish!<eos> He abducts young, single, attractive women and he keeps them, sometimes for a week, sometimes for months.
Bruce, don't forget your cookie.<eos> Now...<eos> I'm going to tell you something, and I'd appreciate if you kept your face perfectly still.<eos> There's cameras everywhere.<eos> I know because I put them there.
- Uh... - Now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> You're sure... the guns are there?<eos> Butch placed them himself.
Does that mean you found it?<eos> I figured you'd visit me again.<eos> I spoke to Gordon.<eos> I think we should discuss your visions.<eos> Specifically, I'd like to discuss how you used them to convince Skye to run off and rescue Lincoln.
I can't tell if you're being arrogant or ignorant.<eos> Both, I imagine.<eos> Your line of work requires support...<eos> People who care about your well-being, who'll be there to stitch up your wounds.<eos> If I allow people to get close to me, I'm putting them in danger.
I had to fight hard just to keep my wits.<eos> Are you saying that Zeus is trying to drive you mad to help you see more clearly?<eos> It doesn't make sense, does it?<eos> On the contrary, it makes complete sense.<eos> The most powerful things are buried so deep inside us that we would never accept them, unless we let go.
The night was the night, the same night as that epic walk.<eos> When you lost your car keys and then we just wandered.<eos> Yes.<eos> Forever.<eos> I didn't lose them.
- Okay.<eos> Hey, Jake?<eos> Just so you know, the night of the epic walk...<eos> Mm-hmm?<eos> I actually knew that you didn't lose your keys because I felt them in your pocket.
Hey, you're home.<eos> Uh, quick question, do you remember when you bought those blue shoes?<eos> Was it a Tuesday or a Wednesday?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - Think, though... you schedule everything... and I remember you brought them home around the time that I went to the movies with Slutty Crystal.
There's a push to sell off the properties, settle the debt and dissolve the company.<eos> Sounds reasonable.<eos> It's not reasonable, Luisa.<eos> I'm going there to change their mind.<eos> Dad had multiple offers through the years, and he turned them all down.
And if we don't?<eos> You will all freeze.<eos> Or burn.<eos> I heard about your guns.<eos> I also heard that you lost them.
But there were no stingers in the body and no dead bees in the car.<eos> A honeybee can only deposit .1 milligrams of apitoxin when it releases its stinger.<eos> And yet, Ms. Kang was found with enough venom in her system to kill a herd of elephants.<eos> It appears not only is a meta-human controlling these bees but also increasing their toxicity.<eos> Bees communicate by releasing pheromones. Maybe this meta's controlling them through secretion?
Claire!<eos> ~ Hey! Did you see a man and woman come down just now?<eos> ~ No, mate.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Checking the cameras. Ashworth turned them off.
Have you phoned Mark?<eos> I haven't got my mobile, I ran out cos of you.<eos> So I'll call him. Just take it slow.<eos> ~ Were you having contractions before your waters broke?<eos> ~ Get off me. Been having them for days on and off. Midwife kept saying they were Braxton Hicks.
That through choice?<eos> What is this, a police interview?<eos> Just conversation.<eos> Well...<eos> Things were complicated and I made... I made them more so.
Marilyn: How old were you when you started to hear the voices?<eos> Gladys: You're hearing them now, aren't you?<eos> Well, not all the time.<eos> Gladys:<eos> Marilyn: Well, did grandmother have them too?
Reagan likes jelly beans. He's got the hair of a Greek God.<eos> What's not to like?<eos> Well, I care about the issues.<eos> There's only one issue that matters in this race, and that's taxes.<eos> Mondale specifically said he would raise them.
Gemini?<eos> He didn't even try to hide them among the other strings.<eos> Different murder weapon, too.<eos> No gaff.<eos> This time, he bludgeoned them to death with a marble sculpture.
It would help if we knew what they were talking about, but obviously, that's impossible.<eos> This is gonna sound crazy... but maybe the plants can help us.<eos> Thanks to the wealth of digital recordings that Winthrop has been leaving for us, Sara and I requisitioned every audio analysis program on the planet.<eos> Including one that listens to plants?<eos> This one tracks minute vibrations of all sorts of different objects in a space, and analyzes the sounds that created them.
All right, the room is now safe for the faint of heart.<eos> Okay.<eos> It takes a special kind of asshole to do this.<eos> Oh, God, Morales, where are her hands?<eos> I cut them off and put them in the rehydrating solution.
And you're not of this time, are you?<eos> You or Ichabod Crane.<eos> No, we are not.<eos> Did you find any of the creatures?<eos> Jenny and Hawley are looking for them.
Yes, why be polite to a lowly secretary?<eos> Were you just rude to Pam?<eos> I'm rude to everybody.<eos> Did you get Hope's meds?<eos> Pam picked them up.
I'm hard on myself.<eos> But I wasn't about to give up on those girls, because I, or whoever was down in that bunker, had them in there since 1998, getting ready for the Rapture.<eos> And you know how long it takes ladies to get ready.<eos> This one.<eos> Pfft. My point is, what if I had let them out and then the Rapture happened, like, two days later?
Gentlemen, as some of you may know, we will be sending nightly video packages to over 30 countries.<eos> The scale of this operation is...<eos> You were filming us? From where?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> We've taken the cameras out of the courtroom and we've hidden them.
I need to change out of my uniform.<eos> I couldn't write at all to begin with.<eos> Not for the first month.<eos> But after that, I sent three letters.<eos> My mother posted them.
They burnt him Norwich.<eos> Your barrister friend will recant and he'll be released.<eos> And if he doesn't?<eos> Then he's a fool.<eos> People should say whatever will keep them alive.
Come on, okay, I wasn't his target, all right?<eos> In fact, it was like he didn't have a target at all.<eos> Yeah, but just the fact that it was on that street in our neighborhood, it might mean that whoever hired Bob and Carol is closing in on us.<eos> Or it might mean that you were trying to avoid your mom's sisters.<eos> I am not avoiding them.
I guess someone didn't enjoy their first night in jail.<eos> So let me ask you something.<eos> How could you do it?<eos> Just walk out on your wife and kids and never look back?<eos> You were married, what, 10 years, witnessed the birth of your daughters, watched them grow up.
You mustn't touch it without gloves.<eos> Rembrandt used extracts of lead and poison oak oil to treat his canvases.<eos> Touch it with your bare hands, and you'll get a nasty rash.<eos> When we were questioning Julian, he was rubbing his hands. I thought it was a nervous tick.<eos> But he was scratching them raw because of contact dermatitis.
And that was only the first of her deeply twisted lies.<eos> Very kind of you to check on me, but completely unnecessary.<eos> My brother's right. I need to be home under a doctor's care.<eos> No, I think that's the last place you should be.<eos> Louise, those pills you're taking, your family doctor sends them to you?
And I also have visions.<eos> Well, that's not surprising, given the location of the mass.<eos> Pressure on the ventral temporal lobe can cause visual hallucinations.<eos> It ain't a tumor that's causing her visions, mate.<eos> She-she's been having them a long time, trust me.
She's one of our best new students.<eos> Thank you.<eos> According to the saying, when a child dies, an angel will take the child in her arms and fly her over all the places she loved best, so she can see them one last time before she goes to heaven.<eos> That's what I had in mind with this aerial point of view.<eos> And then I wanted to catch the sunlight flaring off the windows because it obscures the reflection of the viewer who's looking down at them.
That's not true, tom, I couldn't quit you.<eos> I mean, surely Arnold doesn't eat bread.<eos> So fit. You're just gonna get fat for arnold now?<eos> It's the same amount to love, it's just spread thinner!<eos> There were doughnuts at the office today, and I didn't touch them.
I'll forgive you very sincerely... If you clean the kitchen.<eos> These pills couldn't look any less alike. How is this supposed to trick her?<eos> -Just tell her we took ours already.<eos> Then what was the point of me going to the pharmacy again If she's not even gonna see them.<eos> I had to get them to check out the back.
These pills couldn't look any less alike. How is this supposed to trick her?<eos> -Just tell her we took ours already.<eos> Then what was the point of me going to the pharmacy again If she's not even gonna see them.<eos> I had to get them to check out the back.<eos> You have to pay for them.
- I'm so happy.<eos> - Yes. Me, too.<eos> - Mmm... - Me, too.<eos> So, okay, these girls are all up in your nuts... and then what?<eos> Well, then I look them in the eyes and I said... thank you very much...
It's a party.<eos> We should...<eos> Buckle some swash or, you know, whatever.<eos> I'm hardly a hero.<eos> The fairies were only in the hat because I put them there.
- Oh. - I'm Abeo.<eos> Cool accent, Abeo.<eos> Where you from?<eos> Nigeria, where one follows the rules or life gets very sad.<eos> Well, here in America, when random rules are changed without warning, we ignore them with a thing called a protest.
Previously on The Fosters...<eos> We had some girls come into our tent and we ended up making out with them.
- Couldn't we go looking for her?<eos> - No. Absolutely not.<eos> You most certainly cannot. That's a horrible part of town.<eos> It's not just prostitution, there's a major gang presence, and Kiara's not... The girls working there are not working for themselves.<eos> They have pimps, who have them brainwashed and on drugs.
Okay.<eos> Oh, and I need you home by 7:00 because I'm making lamb chops.<eos> Lamb chops? Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I got them at the store that sells food past the sell-by date.
You stopped yourself.<eos> She went to find us a room, and I saw these...<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I saw these two girls in a hot tub and I was turned on, and I was staring at them.
Thank you. Yeah, thanks for not charging us extra for that duck sauce.<eos> Everything is complimentary.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> What about the hoes?<eos> We call them consorts, and what they choose to do is their business.
He also called in sick yesterday when Strauss was killed.<eos> Who?<eos> Peter Collins.<eos> What's-- what's going on?<eos> Peter, stand up slowly, hands where I can see them.
What the hell is going on today?<eos> Emma, your mother and I realized that we needed to take a step back from our crusade.<eos> The truth is, we've been going about this all wrong.<eos> When we knew those women back in the enchanted forest, they were villains.<eos> And ever since they set foot in this town, that is exactly how we've treated them.
Perhaps you two aren't as valiant as we thought.<eos> David, there it is.<eos> - Maleficent's ashes.<eos> We did it.<eos> We stopped them. URSULA:
Yeah, well, try looking through his bedroom. - Oh. You win.<eos> - All right, so there was a newspaper, few days worth of clothes and hotel soaps.<eos> Oh, he always did that.<eos> He'd, uh, collect them and put, like, money and gum, and make these little bags, and keep them in his car,<eos> - give them to the homeless. - Tells us he's been traveling.
He's right.<eos> You're no better.<eos> It's not the place to eat potato chips.<eos> It's you.<eos> You gave them to me.
He went through surgery, he must be awake now.<eos> It's self-defense.<eos> So it was self-defense.<eos> I remember the chips now.<eos> So you're the one I gave them to in the waiting room.
It's self-defense.<eos> So it was self-defense.<eos> I remember the chips now.<eos> So you're the one I gave them to in the waiting room.<eos> An old woman gave them to me saying.
So what do we know?<eos> Cara Nolan was with Pete Corday right before he was killed.<eos> And now both she and her sister are missing.<eos> You think Corday's killer has the girls?<eos> If they saw his face, maybe he took them to keep them quiet.
Maybe this was a... a crime of opportunity.<eos> Well, I looked at all the surveillance video from the mall.<eos> Cara and Lexi left through the west doors, but they were alone.<eos> Okay, but that doesn't mean that the kidnapper wasn't already following them, right?<eos> I mean, he could have been laying in wait outside, and then forced them into a car.
Thanks, I knocked down all the walls.<eos> Hate walls. These postcards are so cool.<eos> They kind of remind me a little bit of your drawing.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I collected them on the last road trip I took with my terminal dog... miss you, Betsy.
What... why?<eos> I... I need more bags.<eos> Mom, we just got arrested!<eos> You don't understand... I have to have the bags!<eos> - If I don't have them, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Uh... uh...<eos> Oh... Trey.<eos> You weren't eating those fries, were you?<eos> - Mm-mm. - Good, 'cause they're from last night.<eos> Someone left them on the floor in the bathroom.
No leads on Malcolm, but I got here as soon as I could.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He knows the truth about everything... Including Emily.<eos> Seems to me you could use all the help you can get.<eos> He kidnapped them.
In what way?<eos> I need olives, can you bring me olives?<eos> Not again.<eos> You did this a month ago.<eos> Then I brought them to you, and you acted like you hated them.
Once Melissa is pregnant, no more physical contact of any kind.<eos> And that includes sex?<eos> Yes.<eos> Phil, do you understand the rules?<eos> Not only do I understand them, I appreciate them.
"but I am and exciseman."<eos> "And if the King is losing revenues to bandits on the roads,"<eos> "I cannot be held responsible."<eos> "There is not a carriage from here to Paris"<eos> Now if the King's police cannot control the roads, then he cannot expect a King's taxman to ride on them!
I mean, we spent all that money that you got from the Armenians on that coke just so six hookers can get high all day.<eos> They understand the value of a solid business plan.<eos> - They're smart enough.<eos> - Hell, no.<eos> All they understand is coke makes them feel great.
Belikov's girls are coming in around 9:00 tonight on a ship loaded with coal briquettes.<eos> Are you with me here, Donovan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Coal briquettes, I heard.<eos> When you get the girls, take your time bringing them to your car. Get them inside, close the door.
I'm afraid I don't like, uh, either of those options, Ray Ray.<eos> Fuck you. Let's go.<eos> They don't want me to go, Ray. You know why?<eos> Because I make them feel good.<eos> You don't make people feel good. You make them feel small and shitty.
Yeah.<eos> - Brother.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Surely you can read your own hand.<eos> Sometimes, I get the letters confused when I look at them.
Tom wanted to know exactly who she was talking to, and so he wanted to tap her phone.<eos> When I reported that day to Miscavige, I reported it, like, "I mean, he wants to tap her phone."<eos> He said, "God damn it, get it done."<eos> And so I arranged, through the Scientology's consigliere, to get a private investigator who physically installed a wiretap on her home.<eos> And those tapes would come in, and I forwarded them to Dave Miscavige.
Come on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't think you need riding lessons anymore.<eos> Doesn't mean I won't ask for them.
Oh, my gosh, of course.<eos> We'd love to.<eos> It will take a little child-care juggling, but we can swing it.<eos> You know, worst comes to worst, we'll just bring the little monkeys with us<eos> - and keep them locked in the rental car.
They're coming for Kellogg.<eos> Alec, listen to me. Tell Carlos and get the hell out of there.<eos> Brad's here. I don't think it's a friendly visit.<eos> Check the cameras.<eos> He's blacked them out. Some device.
- You ask a lot of questions.<eos> - I'm sorry. I'm just curious.<eos> I am not prying maliciously.<eos> Please, feel free to ask me anything you like.<eos> Well, I have worn those shoes, working out, but I've never really thought of them as business attire.
I'd bet good money Sarah's his new captive.<eos> He must have figured out that it's a lot easier to abduct a single woman so you don't have to kill the husband first. Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> I want you to run a full background investigation on both women.<eos> We need to know what they have in common if we're gonna figure out who abducted them.
You're never there for me. You're a terrible girlfriend. But you're a wonderful poet.<eos> I'm not a wonderful poet, I'm an academic. An unemployed one.<eos> You should send your new poems to your editor.<eos> She's got dementia.<eos> She might actually like them.
Precisely.<eos> Now you truly understand your oath and the responsibilities that you must bear alone.<eos> And never misuse for personal gain.<eos> We're talking patriotism, not politics.<eos> In times of crisis, we take our hatchets, and we bury them... into the backs of our real enemies.
Okay, here's how we're doing this.<eos> Mr. Agos.<eos> Please accept my apologies on behalf of this court for the egregious and overzealous prosecution you've suffered.<eos> I know these words don't make up for the last six months of your life... no words ever can... but they're all I have.<eos> And so I will use them now.
Please, I just... I just put that back.<eos> Where are the pills?<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Pouchy wants them back.
Maybe because she's not who she says she is.<eos> Just hang on a minute, and I can explain.<eos> What's to explain? I know who you are. You're a bounty hunter who tracks lost and stolen pieces of art for massive rewards, right?<eos> And based on the warrants out for your arrest in Athens and Budapest, it's clear you don't have a problem bending the law.<eos> Look, this isn't just a payday for me, all right? I track these pieces down, and I return them to their rightful owners.
Swan, you couldn't have known that she'd drop that tracking device.<eos> Yeah, but I let her talk me into thinking kidnapping him was a good idea.<eos> If anything happens to that kid, it's my fault.<eos> Uh, the tracks end here.<eos> Looks like the rain washed them away.
No.<eos> At least I can promise you... You won't die alone.<eos> Too little, too late.<eos> Then you're gonna change things.<eos> Return them to the way they were.
Well, I... am Powers Division. And you just threatened a police officer with the use of powers.<eos> Welcome to the big time.<eos> He got us when we were young, Christian.<eos> When we wanted so much, we needed answers.<eos> And he had them.
Well, then today... you might want to buy into more than Adlard's pool, it being one of your luckier ones.<eos> What?<eos> Who's the one witness we have never been able to question?<eos> The one whose every road leads to Johnny fucking Royalle.<eos> It's not often we get to meet our heroes in real life, but these young women you see here, they are all with us tonight to share their story and to meet the woman who inspired them.

Тук.Отиди в града. It's okay.<eos> Spencer, call me as soon as you get this.<eos> I want you to cancel your flight home.<eos> I brought you some magazines.<eos> But they took them.
Then we start early.<eos> Pick me up at dawn.<eos> Actually, can we make it 7:00?<eos> Since Diane works at the IRS, she offered to pull our victims' tax records.<eos> She's dropping them off tomorrow.
And you're wasting time.<eos> To be continued.<eos> Both of you.<eos> I was looking through your victims' tax filings, and I noticed something in the log.<eos> Someone has already viewed them from outside the agency.
He said they have money and jewelry lying around.<eos> And we drove by, and he showed me the house, and yeah, I believed him.<eos> But when I got in there, they didn't have nothing.<eos> I found the gun,<eos> I woke those bitches up, and marched them down in the living room, and I gave them a choice.
Should we go over it again?<eos> We met at the warehouse.<eos> We said hello to Shandor and the guys, and then we went to the cabin, and we got blasted.<eos> Let's say we ordered a couple of strippers. No.<eos> We'll say Roman sent them up.
They worked out on each other.<eos> - Roman brought 'em, and then...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Roman wasn't there.<eos> He sent them up.
How can I be of assistance?<eos> We have some conflicting hypotheses about the terrorist attack, which we were hoping you could help clarify.<eos> You can have a seat here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The terrorists had RPGs, yet they didn't use them.
I fried them all.<eos> You fried them...<eos> I had a lot of failures.<eos> I'm sorry, boss.<eos> But I sold them all.
Thanks, Maureen.<eos> Same time tomorrow.<eos> Wait, you're paying her to teach him the maracas?<eos> For your information, sir, the maracas are a deceiving instrument to play.<eos> Okay, no disrespect, but babies play them.
It's similar in size and texture to an American quarter.<eos> There were similar coins found on his counter.<eos> As you can see, they're also mixed in with American currency.<eos> Now, these coins are the very opposite of collectible.<eos> It's most likely he received them mistakenly as change in a Russian neighborhood.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Hang on!<eos> I got a key, ya skimpnuts.<eos> Oh yeah, me, too.<eos> Why do you have keys to her apartment?<eos> Ron gave them to us, when they were doing that weird open-house thing.
We're awfully close to the road.<eos> What are you so worried about?<eos> What we're doing is illegal!<eos> I just don't like doing things that are illegal.<eos> Well, so we just... Just dump them on the ground?
Okay, then what happens to your case, Sherlock?<eos> All right.<eos> It's time for your meds.<eos> Maybe it'll make the Martians go away.<eos> Nope. Not taking them.
And they took my baby from me prematurely.<eos> He had accelerated growth.<eos> But I really thought he was dead.<eos> And now your grown half-alien son is our perp.<eos> He's getting these women pregnant, which is, in fact, killing them.
I need to get in here.<eos> I need the spores.<eos> What's the code?<eos> The spores are gone.<eos> They took them to produce the virus.
And in another twist, Kelsey Richter, daughter of suspected terrorist JD Richter and circuit court judge Dorothy Richter, was taken into custody today...<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - under the Loyalty Act.<eos> So the seven beautiful sisters were playing in the meadow, and then along came... a hunter... named Orion.<eos> And Orion wanted the sisters all to himself, so he chased them to the ends of the earth.
And if you hurt him, he'll fight.<eos> But he doesn't want war, or destruction.<eos> He dreams of a family.<eos> Of safety.<eos> Of a place where he can... settle among people he's never known... as if he's known them his whole life.
That's one.<eos> That SUV on my birthday.<eos> Katherine wrapped my car around a light post. That's 3.<eos> They really didn't give us many fries, did they? Yeah, they did.<eos> You just ate them all.
Lovely morning, isn't it?<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> I found your saucers.<eos> I was just looking for some big cups.<eos> Oh, I think you found them.
You're not obliged to say anything, but anything you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.<eos> No-one hurts my staff and gets away with it.<eos> If you saw anything or anyone, I'm begging you, come forward.<eos> None of that mumbo jumbo, am I clear?<eos> The only way stones can kill someone is when somebody's holding them.
- We just have to - walk down the staircase...<eos> I'm not walking anywhere!<eos> Holy head of hair.<eos> What happened to your underwear?<eos> I took them off after my water broke.
You have ten seconds to disperse.<eos> After that, everyone here will receive Saturday detention for a month.<eos> Is he for real?<eos> I know you all hate these new rules.<eos> A real politician would get up here and tell you they hate them too, but I won't pander, especially when that's not how I feel.
- We will respond in 360-500 days... !"<eos> - Isn't she great?<eos> She can't just walk all over the people of the city like the Jolly Green Giant.<eos> Jolly Green Giant...<eos> He doesn't stomp on people. He encourages them to eat their vegetables.
- Yeah.<eos> I gotta say, when we were back in the Academy, you were not the one I would have voted most likely to end up at 1PP.<eos> Tragically tamed by City Hall.<eos> How much do you miss those book club nights?<eos> I would probably miss them more if I remembered them.
And where did he get the gun?<eos> The guys had it.<eos> Someone could've die.<eos> Have you given him his medications?<eos> No, he's not good when he takes them.
I feel elated to know. Because it enables me to understand the man to whom I'm married.<eos> Eva...<eos> Yes.<eos> Eva, no one should have to do the things that you had to do for me.<eos> But you did them, faithfully, compassionately and without hesitation.
Look who's beating themselves up now.<eos> Come on.<eos> You didn't know you were tracking a beast, no one did.<eos> I didn't even know there were beasts left anymore.<eos> I thought your father got rid of them all.
- Cherries with garlic and salt.<eos> Really.<eos> The cherries are no good on their own.<eos> They taste spiky.<eos> The garlic makes them smooth, F major seven.
Tell the train to go, Jürgen!<eos> Now!<eos> Or I swear, I'll shoot you!<eos> There are too many guards.<eos> The explosion will draw them away.
Remember, the more sororities you list, the better your chances of getting a bid.<eos> So, how did it go with Lambda?<eos> I think it went well.<eos> I liked all the girls, and they seemed to like me.<eos> So, you're gonna put them down first?
I started doing research for the book.<eos> So I traveled around in the Nordic region to interview people and to search for recipes, and to find and document cultural occurrences within the realm of food.<eos> There are so many things that I found during these trips that I didn't know existed, that has in some way influenced what we do now in the restaurant.<eos> There's one dish that we do, which is a little quail's egg rolled in ash. And that comes from something that I found on Iceland.<eos> In the spring, they will take wild ducks' eggs and they will put them in boxes, which they fill with ash.
So I went there, I found it, I ate it, and documented it for the book.<eos> And two years later, ended up on the menu.<eos> Not at all as the dish in Iceland, but I can clearly see the link to that particular moment when I found that.<eos> The only way for traditions in food to be kept alive is to let them adapt.<eos> Because, if you keep them in museum, they will eventually die out.
And they're not fresh.<eos> They're from last autumn, and they've been stored in some way, and that adds layers of complexity to the dishes.<eos> To choose to be hyper-seasonal, and hyper-local, and just use what's there, when you're covered with and you're in pitch blackness, is a kind of crazy, Magnus-style suicide mission for a chef.<eos> I got an introduction to the world of preserving foods, because some of the techniques were used when I grew up.<eos> If you want to have potatoes in March, well, then you better harvest some potatoes in August and put them in your root cellar.
Here's your check.<eos> I didn't charge you for the fries, 'cause I ate them.
Rico looks good.<eos> I think he got another tattoo.<eos> Look, when Owen gets here, should we still be alive, please let me do the talking.<eos> Kittens aside, Owen can help us.<eos> A venture capitalist buys companies and turns them around.
You think Tony did it?<eos> You don't?<eos> Tony wasn't the one who attacked me.<eos> Did the, uh... voices tell you that?<eos> Actually, uh... I haven't heard them since the last time I saw you.
Did she admit that it was a con the bullshit custody suit, the ex?<eos> Or did you discover that on your own?<eos> I know you've been through a lot and there's not a person in this town who doesn't know that and I'm sorry for it.<eos> Grief. It twists people up.<eos> Makes monsters out of them sometimes.
Do you remember that moment?<eos> The Tin Man comes over.<eos> "What happened?" And he's like,<eos> "Well, first they tore my arms off<eos> "and they threw them over there!
The Tin Man comes over.<eos> "What happened?" And he's like,<eos> "Well, first they tore my arms off<eos> "and they threw them over there!<eos> And then they tore my legs off and they threw them over there!"
All right, let him- Just let him do another one.<eos> Okay, action! "What happened?"<eos> "Well, first they tore my arms off<eos> "and they threw them over there!<eos> "And then they tore my legs off. They threw them over there!"
Both their throats cut.<eos> Seven down, two to go.<eos> It's weird.<eos> How has nobody seen these monks till now?<eos> A, they're killing people and carrying them across town, and B, they're monks.
No, bitch.<eos> No.<eos> You have to relax.<eos> I Want you to look at these people.<eos> Do you see them?
- Yes.<eos> - OK.<eos> Come back in with me.<eos> Recreational drugs?<eos> Did anyone move the bags or touch them or open them?
My job is to find who killed him, not start a witch hunt, and you need to trust me.<eos> When I came home this morning, there was a bag in the kitchen.<eos> I hadn't seen it before.<eos> There was vials and syringes.<eos> I don't know why Eric had them, but they're not his.
I mean, this distinct color and this labeling... this is somebody's brand. Hmm.<eos> Somebody who's seen a little too much Breaking Bad.<eos> Miss that show.<eos> Just one vial of this stuff fetches a steep take on the street.<eos> So if Kutzler wasn't taking drugs, maybe he was selling them?
He may be preying on loner types.<eos> It looks like they both have ligature marks on their wrists and ankles.<eos> Which means he has a secure secondary location where he holds them captive.<eos> So he could be testing how much torture his victims can take.<eos> And then when he's done with his fun, if things don't go as planned, he silences them permanently by slitting their throats.
Do you know Barack Obama?<eos> ~ No, I don't. ~ Do you know his daughters?<eos> I know Sasha but I don't know Malia.<eos> How do you know them if you don't know Barack Obama?<eos> I don't know them.

Don't you realise what you're doing?<eos> You can't play God, Julián.<eos> You can't break the rules.<eos> But what stupid rules?<eos> The Ministry always breaks them when it serves them.
Never here.<eos> The ground bones are good for curing the evil eye.<eos> If you say so...<eos> Have you found anything of interest?<eos> There are footprints, but they covered them.
Catherine, who alone was told, And the person who put them there.<eos> You killed them.<eos> How could you do such a thing? Why?<eos> I didn't, I swear.<eos> The babies were dead when I found them.
You are good.<eos> And now Betty and that crew of cronies of hers, They're waiting outside, waiting for me to serve them chicken salad.<eos> Oh, my God, what is the deal with you guys and the chicken salad?<eos> You know, women like Betty Gilbert, you know what they do?<eos> They sit back and wait for other people to take risks, and then they judge them.
But they weren't.<eos> - What am I looking at?<eos> - Camera logs.<eos> All the cameras were operating nonstop that night... see?<eos> What if someone manually switched them off?
I'm the assistant curator of mammals here.<eos> Your problem concerns zebras.<eos> More specifically, the complete lack thereof.<eos> You've managed to lose track of your zebras?<eos> Someone broke in here and took them last night. Two females.
Did we settle on "Felipe"?<eos> Phil.<eos> Honey, what are you doing?<eos> One second.<eos> So, I have 20 fur coats in my closet, but I'm the only one of my friends who even wears them anymore, so you tell me who's endangered.
You think she's lying?<eos> Go down to her building, see if anyone else saw Cole Whitfield there last night.<eos> And let's look into Mr. Whitfield, find out what else he's hiding from us.<eos> All right.<eos> What's in the bags, Cole, and where are you taking them?
Where do you get the money?<eos> Donations from my church.<eos> Come on, it's a cash business.<eos> The pimps deliver the girls at the beginning of the night.<eos> When the night's over, they take them home.
See if he can.<eos> - Yo, what's up?<eos> - You sold us out.<eos> - It wasn't me...<eos> - Not a word. We'll cut your balls off, salt them, and feed them to the seagulls, you understand?
Because... They're sexy, like tattoos.<eos> Tattoos are fake.<eos> They're what you'd like to be, you make them up.<eos> But scars are real.<eos> You don't choose them, they're your life.
How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?<eos> As a fact, I do, Excellency.<eos> You have not been paid.<eos> If you have 8 pesos... You robbed them from the women refugees.<eos> And if you robbed them, you raped them also.
No, that's illegal.<eos> I... i don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I do.<eos> This message is for the people who are holding sophie troy.<eos> We have received your demands and we are taking them very seriously.
'And by the time James had pulled him out...'<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Action!<eos> '..our four cows had wandered off.'<eos> Sitrep - we found four cows and we lost them.
Beyond that, and they'll be too far apart to communicate. Oh.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> We're in range in three, two... Go, Sylvester!<eos> Reprogramming new coordinates now...<eos> It's not accepting them.
You've saved her life, if anyone has.<eos> I'm glad no one blames me for encouraging her to work.<eos> - We like strong women. - Do you?<eos> I can assure you.<eos> We like them very much indeed.
- In a moment.<eos> I just want to put the hair dryer back upstairs.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> - I've decided to move into the farm. - You won't regret it.<eos> I've decided a lot of things, but I won't tell you all of them now.
That's seven years of my life I'd like to get back.<eos> There she is!<eos> Oh, man.<eos> That's when pointies meant something.<eos> Ha. Now you see them everywhere.
And my daughters started getting the symptoms...<eos> She begged me to put them out of their misery b-b-before it became...<eos> And I did it.<eos> With my own bare hands.<eos> I smothered them in their sleep.
What she means is, we wish to speak to someone about the adorable cupcake T-shirts in the window.<eos> Or, we will be about to rumble.<eos> I'm just working here till I get my PhD in the Eco-Social Dynamics of Western Civilization.<eos> So, forever?<eos> Those T-shirts are our design and we need to know why they're here and who knocked them off.
These ladies are interested in your T-shirts.<eos> Aren't they cute?<eos> So cute.<eos> Yeah, super cute.<eos> We designed them.
Aren't they cute?<eos> So cute.<eos> Yeah, super cute.<eos> We designed them.<eos> Yeah, we designed them.
Hey. This book's okay.<eos> I don't know what'll happen to Juliette.<eos> Don't make the same mistake I did.<eos> Don't leave the people you love.<eos> Even if that puts them in danger.
- Good.<eos> Let's keep it that way.<eos> And what if those murders back in the 1800s were Wesen-related?<eos> Jack didn't pick his victims because they were prostitutes.<eos> He picked them because they were Wesen.
What do you mean?<eos> For Jerry Tyson.<eos> They're like clones.<eos> They're blond and pretty, just the way Tyson likes them.<eos> Nieman finds these poor women, lost souls that no one is gonna miss, and she remakes them.
For Jerry Tyson.<eos> They're like clones.<eos> They're blond and pretty, just the way Tyson likes them.<eos> Nieman finds these poor women, lost souls that no one is gonna miss, and she remakes them.<eos> She grooms them for 3XK.
Trust me.<eos> Just because you're too pussy to fight for your own life,<eos> - doesn't mean the rest of us are. - Jesus Christ.<eos> You think I like being a puppet, with a hand shoved up my ass?<eos> These people, Grace, there's no bringing them down.
"Bless me, father, for I have sinned," is usual.<eos> Right. Good.<eos> Yeah. So, that, and...<eos> So, the women.<eos> And this is not something that I'm proud of, but I let them think that we have more of a future than we do, you know?
Whoa, whoa. If I granted access to my clients' personal information, it would be a betrayal of their trust.<eos> - Trust?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hello. Really?<eos> Do you think that your female clientele is gonna trust you when they find out that you've been setting them up with murder suspects?
"Why?"<eos> I'm a terrible choice.<eos> I just got elected.<eos> That's why I'm asking you.<eos> This town has a way of taking people and turning them into politicians.
I'm learning... how to forgive.<eos> But...<eos> - it's hard.<eos> - I know. Giving up on people... doesn't change anything.<eos> It doesn't make them better people.
He certainly had a different view on it than we do.<eos> He had dementia.<eos> I mean, he was confused.<eos> He doesn't look confused here.<eos> Their mothers turned them against Charmaine.
And the older one, I can't tell her what to do.<eos> And she's only 12.<eos> Eight.<eos> See what I mean?<eos> But the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them.
We'll get you a location.<eos> Could be just like a summer retreat. Wouldn't have to live there.<eos> Wisconsin again?<eos> Actual bald eagles flying around.<eos> The smell of cheese curds doesn't scare them away.
~ What?<eos> Was it an "Oh, no, whoops" pregnant like me, or was it a "Let's make a baby" pregnant like normal people?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Look, as big as this is, I had a life before you.<eos> Yeah, I knew you fucked other women, ~ I just didn't know you fucked babies into them.
It makes no logical sense, but I wouldn't.<eos> This is getting us nowhere.<eos> The puncture wound to the lateral aspect of the femoral neck suggests the victim was injected.<eos> But the tox screen came back negative.<eos> We should check again because I'm obviously seeing things incorrectly or not seeing them at all.
He sure seemed like a murderer to me. But I guess guilt is in the eye of the beholder.<eos> Everything's in the eye of the beholder.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why... why would Molly degrade herself for drugs and not take them?<eos> Maybe she was saving them for later?
Everything's in the eye of the beholder.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why... why would Molly degrade herself for drugs and not take them?<eos> Maybe she was saving them for later?<eos> Nah, we would've found them-- we didn't find them anywhere.
It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why... why would Molly degrade herself for drugs and not take them?<eos> Maybe she was saving them for later?<eos> Nah, we would've found them-- we didn't find them anywhere.<eos> So, she got them for a friend?
Maybe she was saving them for later?<eos> Nah, we would've found them-- we didn't find them anywhere.<eos> So, she got them for a friend?<eos> Right.<eos> No friends. Okay, so maybe she got them to make friends?
He used to call me his flower.<eos> When my first son was born, it was winter.<eos> There were no blooms to be had.<eos> He gave me six dozen roses. Made of the purest white silk.<eos> Over the years, I have given them to those who have done me some service.
We quickly eliminated - the Pinafores and Alley of the dolls... - Yes!<eos> In the tradition of Red Sox/Yankees, Ali/Frazier, it all came down to the Britney Spares vs. Martin and his merry men.<eos> That's what I'm talking about!<eos> The tension was building...<eos> Could somebody please take these fries before I eat them all?
The point is that Agent Richards got a parking infringement 15 minutes after she left her office.<eos> I also managed to find her cell.<eos> It's off and the GPS says it's inside the car.<eos> Okay, how about credit cards?<eos> I mean, it's only been a few hours, but she hasn't even used them.
I'm looking forward to a nice cup of tea and put my feet in the wardrobe.<eos> I hope there's room for one more.<eos> I'll always make room for you, my friend.<eos> At least I've never come back from a wedding with a set of cuttlery on my purse.<eos> They were wedding favours, Liam. Everyone was taking them.
Don't you read?<eos> Money is the root of all evil.<eos> Those guns, that's something special.<eos> Well, then we have a little bit a situation here.<eos> You want to keep the guns and I'm not leaving until I get them back. (chuckles)
Actually, he learned two!<eos> Play him the other one.<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> Are those my shoes?<eos> I found them in the box of donations.
But they do have one thing in common.<eos> They're all recently divorced and living alone.<eos> Safe and easy targets.<eos> So two divorced women is a coincidence. Three is a pattern.<eos> That must be how he's choosing them.
These license plates are from all over.<eos> He didn't just steal tags from the VW bus. Each day he's got a new one.<eos> That's a serious forensic countermeasure.<eos> He's taking a risk stealing all these tags.<eos> Where's he getting them from?
You were chosen long ago.<eos> Whoever chose will be disappointed.<eos> I am no magician. Then buy these two spells from me.<eos> They'll get you started.<eos> I got them from a great magician in London.
The Springfield PD is on the case.<eos> Ah, yeah.<eos> Uh, well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.<eos> High-end barbeques like yours are easy pickings.<eos> Smokeheads grab them at night, clean them up. Next thing you know, it's cooking another family's hot dogs.
Wait, are they saying something?<eos> The dark, the sword, the forsaken, the temple.<eos> These words actually rewrite the synaptic connections in your brain.<eos> They're coordinates.<eos> Someone is deliberately getting people killed and turning them into transmitters.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the ripple effect.<eos> Maybe it will mean that the universe will be ruled by cats or something, in the future.<eos> But the way I see it, even a ghastly future is better than no future at all.<eos> You robbed those people of their deaths.<eos> Made them nothing more than a message in a bottle.
A few.<eos> But I'm not proud of it.<eos> Ah, we've all dabbled.<eos> No, I don't... I mean,<eos> I'm not proud of how I treated them.
Cleveland, let me tell you something.<eos> (quietly): You're absolutely (bleep) right.<eos> Well, time to put on my spaghetti hat!<eos> I just never feel happy.<eos> I strive for these things, and I get them, but at the end of the day, I still don't feel fulfilled. Hmm.
-And I can?<eos> -Yes, please.<eos> Please do this for me.<eos> What are the rules?<eos> If I'm gonna referee, I should at least know them.
I-I read them sometimes.<eos> Who am I kidding?<eos> All the time.<eos> I've actually read them all.<eos> Wow, I don't think that I've read them all.
Until Francis knows?<eos> Until we're discovered and it's too late to run for our lives, Mary?<eos> Run where?<eos> Ridley's man McNabb is certain that a spy took my letters.<eos> Francis doesn't have them.
So then we tried them with luminescence.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> I always like this bit.<eos> How do you do that?<eos> Certain materials have the ability to change visible wavelengths into longer invisible reflective ones if you shine a luminescent infrared light at them.
They were written to your mum.<eos> 20 years ago.<eos> I found them.<eos> Hidden away after she died.<eos> I'd like you to read them.
- My mother.<eos> I didn't touch her.<eos> - Morten?<eos> - I must have my pills right now.<eos> I don't have them here, but we can go out together and find them.
She's lying.<eos> Saga Norén, Malmo Police.<eos> What was it you wanted to show me?<eos> The brand marks.<eos> I cleaned them and examined them more thoroughly.
Come.<eos> The investigation of the basement is finished.<eos> This was found in the room where Holst found Jeanette.<eos> Seven rooms are furnished.<eos> You can surely recognize them.
Of course I am.<eos> My son humiliated me at my own retirement party.<eos> Because you didn't actually retire.<eos> What do you know?<eos> I talked to the ladies you used to work with when I invited them to your retirement party.
Max is clearly so upset by all this that she's lost her mind.<eos> The one time I really needed her, anyway.<eos> Hi, Maria.<eos> How will your company's reputation recover from doing business with a man who held three women in his apartment against their will?<eos> Look, people do terrible things. And they do them wearing shirts.
~ A man in Pentonville Prison pushed me down the stairs.<eos> ~ Why?<eos> I don't believe he ever offered a reason.<eos> Mr Edalji, those letters, I would greatly like to see them.<eos> My father has them still at the vicarage.
So, what do you want from me?<eos> I want to find out who killed your father.<eos> If what you're saying is true, why aren't the police asking questions?<eos> Because they're afraid of the answers.<eos> ~ The letters your father received - ~ For the last time, I never saw them.
I want to find out who killed your father.<eos> If what you're saying is true, why aren't the police asking questions?<eos> Because they're afraid of the answers.<eos> ~ The letters your father received - ~ For the last time, I never saw them.<eos> Never showed them to me.
I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Hi, Ryan.<eos> It's been a while since my last meeting.<eos> Uh, I had over 18 months of sobriety, but I started drinking again, and I've hurt people that I love.<eos> Uh, I've driven them away because I didn't think I deserved them, but I want to change.
So, do I need to do anything for Dad's dedication ceremony Sunday?<eos> Derek and Martha have it all covered.<eos> It's really nice of the town to do this. It is.<eos> It's a nice way to say thank you.<eos> Letting people know how much we appreciate them is important.
Got it.<eos> Could you do me a favor today?<eos> - Well, I made too many pies, and could you take the extras down to the cafe?<eos> I spoke to Stephanie, she could use them, her delivery person shorted her.<eos> Lucky you baked them.
But also reckless.<eos> Destroy it. Why?<eos> Creating new Indogenes would turn Defiance against us.<eos> We are Omec.<eos> We feed upon the lesser races. We do not fear them.
Get him, Lee!<eos> Whoops! Oh, Yoko, there was an act of God and your Sea-Monkeys got tipped on the floor.<eos> They were my only friends, Germaine.<eos> That is what happens when you get emotionally attached to plankton, Yoko.<eos> Maybe they're holding their breath till I find them.
Yeah, well, he's stockpiling.<eos> Easier to get away with a crime when no one knows you're doing it.<eos> Then why leave his mark after killing the woman?<eos> Grand finale.<eos> If Malik digitizes these tapes and releases them, we're gonna be dealing with... media frenzy, public panic.
Christine and Eva work for Aktaion.<eos> I have proof.<eos> I know.<eos> They told me, Julia.<eos> They used them.
So you murdered her?<eos> !<eos> And now you're gonna murder the whole town? !<eos> These people are sick.<eos> When we get out of here, the government will quarantine them.
- Ah!<eos> Oh, she misses you like a limb, Cookie. Yeah, I don't miss that hell house, but I sure miss those girls; my girls; those women.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, they were like true sisters to me.<eos> You know what would mean the world to them, Cookie?
That has to be depressing.<eos> - You work in a morgue.<eos> - I find peace in that.<eos> I bring closure to people.<eos> Yeah, when you're not killing them.
A stressor like that, it's no surprise he eventually snapped.<eos> He didn't care about his other victims.<eos> Why did he take the time to bury those two?<eos> It was probably before his psychotic break became full-blown.<eos> He knew them personally.
A Beth, or Elizabeth, Laws.<eos> She were a skinhead.<eos> How could I be a racist?<eos> There's a shoebox on the kitchen table with some letters in it.<eos> I'd like you to read them.
Well, well, well, what do we have here?<eos> You mean here in my notebook?<eos> I looked into the baby masks the perps were wearing, and no stores in the tri-state area sell them.<eos> Reminds me of a murder I worked a few years back.<eos> Perp always wore these weird masks We couldn't figure out where he bought them.
Pacemaker.<eos> I'm actually not gonna correct you on that.<eos> Guys, I really need this to go well.<eos> My girls are on the wait list for their preschool and it's twice as tough to get in with twins.<eos> Why don't you just get one of them in and then let them take turns going to school every other day?
I found 4 murders with the same M.O.<eos> Each victim in all 6 cases had a stalker who attended a love and sex addiction support group.<eos> So we've got a serial killer out there.<eos> All of these men were accused of stalking their ex-wives, girlfriends, or past relationships, the most recent being Pam Tyler, who survived her attack, but Francine Johnson was not so fortunate, nor the 4 other cases I've uncovered<eos> with great similarity, murders where we presumed the women to be killed by the men who were stalking them.
Where are you?<eos> Hey, remember when we used to pile up the leaves?<eos> Remember when we used to jump in all the leaves?<eos> Yeah there was...<eos> We used to pile them up.
Like, maybe the clothes you were wearing?<eos> Anything like that?<eos> Um, actually, one of the guys handed me my panties back before class that Monday, just to humiliate me.<eos> And you kept them?<eos> I shoved them in my backpack, and then I threw them in my drawer when I got home.
Clearly, what had happened is that the mob had gotten to some of the witnesses and gotten them to flip their stories.<eos> It is difficult to imagine the paralyzing fear expressed by nearly every witness in this case at the prospect of testifying against a man as ruthless and as violent as Lucky Luciano.<eos> Lucky Luciano is the ruler of the most powerful criminal organization this city, this country, has ever known.<eos> These witnesses were abused and exploited young women who were coerced into selling their bodies to satisfy the lusts of depraved men, while Lucky Luciano and his gang got rich off of it.<eos> My office acted only to protect these women so that they could tell the truth and escape the horrific life Lucky Luciano had subjected them to.
State-sponsored murder?<eos> Malcolm!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - It has protected American lives.<eos> Well, now it's taking them.
- Hmm? 'Cause you did not need to know that, because you're amazing.<eos> And you took care of business.<eos> My little baby. As sophisticated viewers, I think you know where this is heading.<eos> Now, as I said, I hate surprises.<eos> But Bow loves them, so maybe she'll be cool with this.
Thanks, James.<eos> And can you hold on to them for me?<eos> Okay, ah, kay.<eos> When did you decide it was okay to ignore calls from the mayor?<eos> I'm not ignoring them.
I don't tolerate violations. Mrs. Harris...<eos> Please, call me Crystal.<eos> We're fucking the same man, might as well get chummy.<eos> Mrs. Harris, I have rules too.<eos> And if a client follows them, he gets to see me. Period.
I mean, it's not like we were gonna take over the firm.<eos> We could.<eos> I've recorded Mr. Culpepper's views on different cultures.<eos> Chinese new year alone could get us the firm and two of his cars.<eos> Ironically, with cars, he prefers them foreign.
Are they gone?<eos> Looks like you have some explaining to do, sport.<eos> Hey, have you seen my phone?<eos> I had cigarettes in here.<eos> Maybe you smoked them while you were out sleepwalking.
- Excuse me. I've got to record this. - Okay.<eos> We're gonna go ahead and get started.<eos> Thank you.<eos> On behalf of me and Sam and Loretta And John and Erika, We are so grateful for y'all coming out to support our girls so we can get them back to that beautiful choir real soon.<eos> If Taylor and Violet and Evie are out there, we're gonna find them.
I've got this terrible feeling that it's more than just a coincidence.<eos> I have so many questions.<eos> And it's not just that.<eos> My pills.<eos> At first, I thought I'd lost them, but now I'm convinced that somebody stole them from my room.
And grab a bottle of olive oil.<eos> And, John, I'm glad you called.<eos> It's like Judge Thorne said, right?<eos> In times of crisis, we take our hatchets.<eos> And bury them in the backs of our real enemies.
But I can't wait for them to reveal a master plan because, by then, everyone I care about will be dead.<eos> But Gabriel made me realize I have something everybody wants.<eos> Maybe the people in New Delphi want it too.<eos> You can't find the keys, can you? Yeah, I can find them.<eos> I hide them.
Issue the AMBER Alert with the girls' pictures and the description of the van.<eos> Anything in the girls' email accounts?<eos> This is really discombobulated.<eos> I've got no text data or calls from the cell phone company servers for either of the girls.<eos> Ok, so whoever took them planned this and got rid of their texts.
Yeah, something's wrong.<eos> What's Markayla's relationship with Meg like?<eos> Best friends.<eos> Inseparable.<eos> Do you think someone kidnapped them?
You know, I watch this game when I can't fix a problem, and Zoe is a problem that I can't solve.<eos> I don't know what is in that crate.<eos> I've checked the armories. Nothing's missing.<eos> Okay, I need a list from you.<eos> All the condemned structures in this city, I want soldiers to search them.
I heard a rather interesting story the other day, and I thought you'd appreciate it.<eos> Hello to you, too.<eos> Apparently there's been a rash of high-end car thefts around the city. Nice.<eos> Well, not "thefts" so much as borrowings, I suppose.<eos> The perpetrator breaks into the vehicles and then just moves them a short distance.
Pelham. P-E-L-H-A-M?<eos> H-A-M.<eos> Got him, charged with three different homicides, all on Long Island. Yeah, two years ago.<eos> Vics were all women in their early 20s.<eos> It says here, he broke into their houses, tortured them and then killed them.
Look, Richard, I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> A virgin's blood is like a '66 Romanée-Conti.<eos> Elegant, but complex.<eos> And there's a cage full of those right there.<eos> We sell the girls, we follow them to the boss's hideout, then we let them go.
It's gone.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> I'd like to make another stop.<eos> The phone lines terminate in modem banks at Westgroup.<eos> They switched them over, so now when you dial in, the same number you've always dialed, you get WestNet instead of Mutiny.
Dr. Brent's not running anywhere.<eos> In addition to that wound, she's also bleeding internally.<eos> Now, if we were at home, I could help her, but...<eos> We should be helping our own people in La Jolla. These aid missions, they're getting too dangerous.<eos> Which makes them all the more important.
You start to realize you can put almost anything almost anywhere.<eos> You know when it comes right down to it we're all just sticks and holes.<eos> It's time your friend Stewart became Captain Lipinski again.<eos> Well congratulations on your promotion.<eos> Cool, so just give all the lammies you have and I'll throw them away.
Um, why don't we meet at The Brew in one hour?<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Hey, Aria wanted me to pick up something for her.<eos> What did you do with his ashes?<eos> Your mother scattered them on the lake.
Maybe you should figure that one out.<eos> I like.<eos> Are, uh, dolls your thing?<eos> No.<eos> Actually, I find them pretty creepy but, um.... it's this new thing I'm trying.
- What?<eos> Isn't that what we we're all thinking?<eos> No.<eos> What is in those bags?<eos> And why are they moving them in the middle of the night?
Arkady has many friends here.<eos> Friends that profit more when he's not in custody.<eos> On a better note...<eos> Eric has the names of the ships carrying the stolen oil.<eos> The Navy is en route to intercept and secure them.
A very good question. I um... I just need... this book.<eos> Do you like oysters, Robert?<eos> Oysters?<eos> I don't... really know. I don't think I've ever tried one.<eos> I love them.
I-I-I can't remember anything new.<eos> I keep coming up with the same images.<eos> Let's look at this another way.<eos> Perhaps the images came to you for a reason.<eos> - Something triggered them.
Hi.<eos> Your face was on my wall for all of middle school.<eos> Oh, thanks, that's sweet.<eos> He's not our guy.<eos> My boy Frankie here, he might love racecars, but he's not using them to rob jewelry stores.
Mum says the girls wrote me letters every week or so,<eos> ~ saying what they'd been up to. ~ That's right.<eos> ~ I'd like to see those.<eos> ~ Yeah, yeah.<eos> I've kept them all safe.
People running, screaming, dying.<eos> And one word carved like a desperate message.<eos> "Croatoan."<eos> The lost colony in North Carolina.<eos> We think that something came out of the void through a thinny in North Carolina and wiped out all those people, erased them all from the face of the earth.
- Right, kid? - [chuckles]<eos> And you can't tell from looking at me, though.<eos> You never let 'em see you sweat.<eos> That's... I got these damn sweat glands.<eos> As soon as I can have them removed, I will get that surgery.
Robert:<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Sophia.<eos> I can't take my meds on an empty stomach.<eos> And God forbid I don't take them everyday at the exact same time.
Here, check all you like.<eos> Just don't take Aumea's side over mine again, OK?<eos> OK.<eos> Where are my keys?<eos> Has someone taken them?
I did.<eos> For every case you've ever done since you started here.<eos> That was a lot of paperwork.<eos> It is.<eos> You wanted to sign off on all my motions, and I wanted to be thorough, make sure you saw all of them.
Behind the mask and glasses lies a devious mind.<eos> All right, Adam and boy whose name I can't remember.<eos> Give me the swords.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Why? You quit, so I'm returning them.
Wait, what?<eos> Why? You quit, so I'm returning them.<eos> But they're used.<eos> I spoke to the manager at Herman's sports.<eos> He's a total hard-ass. He won't take them back.
Just saves you going through the whole thing.<eos> And I assume you'd rather I didn't mention it?<eos> Is that OK?<eos> I'd love to open a restaurant one day.<eos> We'd serve just two things, but do them really well, like... ..lamb and carrots.
- Yeah, sure.<eos> - You know where it is, don't you?<eos> Down the corridor, on the right.<eos> - Yep, I know.<eos> - If you put them in the dishwasher...
It says that the pain had got too much, and she couldn't carry on.<eos> But, then, why didn't she tell us. She did. Yes, but...<eos> We knew she was suffering, there just wasn't anything that we could do to help.<eos> How did she get the pills?<eos> In the note, she talks about storing them up for a long time, pretending to take them and saving them.
My husband is not a general.<eos> My son, God bless him, is not one either.<eos> I understand your work in Africa involved negotiating with arms dealers, mercenaries.<eos> We need weapons.<eos> We need experienced soldiers to train our troops and a general to lead them.
Oh, wow, really?<eos> It's like a circus act, and you have so many choads, you have to keep them in the air.<eos> Oh, my goodness. Look at all the choads this guy has.<eos> Oh, look at him go.<eos> (imitates gargling) And then you light the choads on fire, you'll just keep putting them out in your mouth like... (imitates gulping)
'Cause now, I'm going to call every investment banker I know and tell them to pass on your offer, because Mike Ross can't be trusted.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> This is Harvey's last three income statements and I found them sitting in the copy machine.
I'd like to propose a change to the current compensation formula.<eos> How many partners do you have in your pocket if we put your proposal to a vote?<eos> I can get 45%.<eos> I'm gonna get you the difference.<eos> This is Harvey's last three income statements, and I found them sitting in the copy machine.
Expanding his club.<eos> You see anything shady in your time over there?<eos> It's a strip club.<eos> (antonio) these guys traffic eastern european women Against their will across the canadian border Through an indian reservation.<eos> They force them into work-- It's a kind of indentured servitude.
- I'm good.<eos> - How's your old man?<eos> He's, uh... eh, you know him. He's the same.<eos> I could tell you some stories.<eos> Yeah, I've heard them all.
Could you pass me that wine, please, Mae<eos> -Yi? Although... [clears throat, chuckles] I must say, I have a very clear, specific memory of Alex's bottle.<eos> Oh, yes, that was a bizarre phase.<eos> Can we please talk about something else?<eos> When Alex was a kid, he used to take these empty soda bottles, and he'd put them all around his room, and then during the night, instead of taking the ten steps or so that he'd have to go to the bathroom,
Look, no, there must be some mistake.<eos> There is no mistake, ma'am.<eos> Now, can you tell me what's going on in there?<eos> He... he's just trying to find his... keys.<eos> He's always losing them.
Yeah, and we're haemorrhaging cash.<eos> Not any more.<eos> I found some pearls at Dries' place.<eos> Thought they might help me clear my debt back home.<eos> So you stole them?
Let me go!<eos> Look, I swear you'll get the pearls.<eos> Well, you better hand them over now, cos when Ihaka gets here, he'll cut you open.<eos> Hold him.<eos> Cos this oil will make you shit them out.
And a car crash. And a shooting.<eos> You might be immortal.<eos> You mastered one of the most exclusive specialties basically overnight, and then you took Herman's job and her eyesight.<eos> Okay, that's... that's just...<eos> You have screwed dozens of interns, and you got them all fired.
Hold up, man.<eos> Hold up. Your people got it off a lot for a long damn time.<eos> Don't you think we deserve a run at it for a while until we figure it out?<eos> I don't know about that, but I know the rules are clear.<eos> Well, you know, I-I wish someone would explain them to me, because the way I see it, like most rules, they only work against people who look like me.
I got it, I got it.<eos> Angie. All right?<eos> She's queen of the Sunset Strip.<eos> She knows all these chicks out here, man.<eos> Look, if your girls are out here, Angie will know them.
And I stepped on the curb, and Dr. C turned to me and said,<eos> "Your shoes are too squeaky. I want you to spend the rest of the day in a wheelchair."<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm so embarrassed. I feel like such a fool.<eos> [shoes squeaking] Actually, I found them in a field. It's like a high-pitched...
True dat.<eos> Haley, you look as yummy as ever.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's going on?<eos> So, I'm designing t-shirts now, and I'm trying to get the stores to sell them.
It just means time... .. a little time.<eos> But that's not the sort of thing you could ever understand, is it?<eos> - What do you think of the towers?<eos> - I love them.<eos> - Then why are you ignoring them?
Oh, I totally know what that is, but I'm gonna Google it in case someone else doesn't.<eos> Sorry. The clown archetype that we recognize today actually leads back to a 16th Century stage tradition called commedia Dell'arte, where actors wore masks to resemble their characters.<eos> The pulcinella was the trickster character, usually without a voice.<eos> He used a horn to make funny noises.<eos> Maybe the victims tricked him and he's remaking them in death how he saw them in life.
That-- oh, God, that is-- that is terrible.<eos> I just wanted to wait a little while before we talked.<eos> I'm from Atlanta.<eos> I'm a forensic psychiatrist.<eos> The state employed me to determine if certain people who did very bad things would do them again if they were released from prison.
You know what?<eos> I think it's a terrible idea.<eos> She'll be bored out of her mind.<eos> It'll be a nice change for her.<eos> I've been to those things a thousand times before, I find them so vulgar.
We will do your harsh deed.<eos> Leave within the hour.<eos> Wait for Pryce's caravan off the pond trail to the south of Heaven's Eye.<eos> And what of the prisoners?<eos> I will draft the bondage letters to Lady Love, and she will sign them.
I do worry about him.<eos> There's no money in it.<eos> Not really.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about these nuisance postcards.<eos> I gave them to Graham.
A place like this says it is, and it's close, but people still built this place.<eos> And if you can hack the right person, all of a sudden, you have a piece of powerful malware.<eos> People always make the best exploits.<eos> I've never found it hard to hack most people.<eos> If you listen to them, watch them, their vulnerabilities are like a neon sign screwed into their heads.
She was.<eos> Now, she's a drunk.<eos> Thanks, but I already talked to a lawyer, and even if I stopped this guy from selling those shirts, it would take months.<eos> So, I'm destined to see my work bastardized on the chests of freshmen girls all year.<eos> Yeah. Sometimes I wonder what these girls would think if their moms saw them wearing these shirts.
Stop monitoring my every move!<eos> Just tell me why you need a refill.<eos> Those pills should've lasted you another week.<eos> Because I ran out, okay?<eos> I lost them and I needed some more. It's none of your business anyway!
Is it a sin to say the oath and not believe it?<eos> Well, it is a sin to lie, but what don't you believe?<eos> Well, you met my moms.<eos> They're married.<eos> Would the church accept them?
- A guide to what?<eos> You were right, Kate.<eos> I do need to feed.<eos> But what was I gonna do, be a tired old vampire from the pulps?<eos> Leaping on innocent souls in dark rooms and biting them in a vaguely sexual way?
Really?<eos> I kind of thought it was classy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Those girls were barely older than Bay and Daphne.<eos> And all those men oggling them...
What are you doing?<eos> Get away from him, Lee.<eos> You were the Family Liaison Officer.<eos> Jo gave you a set of keys to her house, didn't she? While you were there.<eos> Did you ever give them to anyone?
That has to be depressing.<eos> - You work in a morgue.<eos> - I find peace in that.<eos> I bring closure to people.<eos> - Yeah, when you're not killing them.
They paid by credit card.<eos> You want me to see if my boss can get copies of the receipts from that night?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - All right, I'll ask him.<eos> I mean... I mean, I-I know he has them.
My husband has been doing this for years.<eos> Did he do it again this morning, or try to?<eos> No.<eos> But I thought that while the police were looking for the man who attacked him on Monday, that maybe I could put a stop to it for good.<eos> You see, Tom was taking some boxes from his home office, and that while he was putting them in the trunk, his back would be turned long enough for me to...
All right. Come on.<eos> Let's get this thing going.<eos> I believe you both wrote your own vows.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> I wrote them down and gave them to Violet to hold.
Then what do you say we do it together?<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna end up hating each other.<eos> If I'm lucky, I'm gonna fight with him about a lot of things.<eos> Why not start with a fight where we're both on the same side?<eos> This is Harvey's last three income statements, and I found them sitting in the copy machine.
It's the best in the state.<eos> I have always loved this place.<eos> It's quiet, out of the way. From those tables over there, you can see anyone coming a long way off.<eos> Which is why you never sit at the counter. Mm.<eos> Keep your hands where I can see them.
Nevins' place is being surveilled 24-7.<eos> And as it is, Joe and Jenny may end up before a grand jury once Nevins is indicted.<eos> Not to mention, if we keep sticking our nose in, we'll blow this whole case for Danny.<eos> Lieutenant, you know I understand your bind, and I, more than anyone, know what it means to be pulled between two worlds, but if we do not stop these monsters... we cannot risk moving Miss Jenny anywhere,<eos> These creatures will not stop until we stop them.
You know, old people, you know, uh-- [laughs]<eos> Old people and traffic--ah!<eos> (brekke) we are very happy to be the only place That makes official deep-dish pizza In the chicago style.<eos> I visited chicago a few years ago, Uh, to see how this was made.<eos> Eh, it requires a very special deep-dish pan to make. So I bought these pans. I brought them home with me.
Oh, he's a witch.<eos> The day he chose was Fete de Kado.<eos> That's the day that every witch gives a gift to the city in the hopes that the city gives one back.<eos> Now, Axeman's idea of a gift was not murdering people for a day, and in return, look, this city threw him the greatest party it has ever seen.<eos> Wait, so what you're saying is, while frat boys celebrate an ax murderer, the witches are having their version of Christmas, which makes them all easy pickings for whoever our killer is.
Then maybe he brought her up here.<eos> That's enough!<eos> No one brought her here.<eos> When she was young, we used to rent a cabin up in Maple Canyon.<eos> Caught trout and cook them on the skewer.
You know, this seems a little shady.<eos> Right, yeah, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office?<eos> You ever hear about Wall Street, Morty?<eos> Y-you know what those guys do in their fancy boardrooms?<eos> They take their balls and they dip them in cocaine and wipe them all over each other.
- It's the god of creation and rebirth.<eos> Also known as a Reaper bug.<eos> But there isn't a giant beetle wandering round out there.<eos> No, it must get inside people. Like a parasite.<eos> Control them in some way.
- What?<eos> - The batteries in the remote died.<eos> - Did you check the junk drawer?<eos> Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.<eos> I'm gonna take them out of the smoke detector.
And our savings is basically toast.<eos> And now Jackie?<eos> Shhh!<eos> Tell you what? Why don't I build an addition, that way when Tim gets out of prison, we can have your strung out, paroled brother move in.<eos> I want to teach our children that when people are in trouble, you help them.
Everything that I thought I wanted.<eos> Gone.<eos> All of it.<eos> So you faked the robbery to cover your tracks?<eos> Grabbed his belongings and tossed them a few blocks away?
Then you start tomorrow. I'd like to propose a change To the current compensation formula.<eos> How many partners do you have in your pocket If we put your proposal to a vote?<eos> I can get 45%.<eos> I'm gonna get you the difference.<eos> This is Harvey's last three income statements, And I found them sitting in the copy machine.
I will.<eos> Eight judges were killed in the last two months.<eos> Now they are targeting lawyers, even clerks.<eos> Anyone who supports the Iraqi transitional government.<eos> I've brought up your concerns to the first secretary on a number of occasions, and he's taken them up the chain.
Stop it, stop it, Lois!<eos> No!<eos> I'm so sick of your crap.<eos> Why do you always do these stupid things?<eos> And why do you always announce them to me before you do them?
'Tis not just the wind that bothers me.<eos> Tension mounts belowdecks, and unlike water, it can only seep up.<eos> Mr. Carver, your wife's gums are gingival.<eos> They're like paper.<eos> I could put my finger through them.
It's amazing the damage we can do as parents, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This kind of looks like Marilyn if you squint and pound five beers.<eos> Marilyn is Mom.<eos> The drugs, the victims that he targets, the way he kills them.
The cops knew where and when to hit us.<eos> I'm not a rat.<eos> It's time to cut loose ends.<eos> Let's see if you can do better.<eos> The victims that he targets, the way he kills them.
Let me know if something pops up?<eos> You think that's the key?<eos> The killer drives different high-end cars?<eos> Now if I can figure out why, it might just get me something.<eos> Well, we know he's probably stealing them, 'cause a guy like this isn't buying them.
It doesn't matter.<eos> We just need to find her.<eos> Navarro, go to the strip club.<eos> See if you can identify any of the girls Junior was turning out.<eos> Alyssa knew about them, maybe they know about her.
For no reason?<eos> This is what we're going to do.<eos> We'll get new pills.<eos> Real pills from a different doctor.<eos> You can keep them on you at all...
This is what we're going to do.<eos> We'll get new pills.<eos> Real pills from a different doctor.<eos> You can keep them on you at all...<eos> Unless they switch them before they give them to you.
We'll get new pills.<eos> Real pills from a different doctor.<eos> You can keep them on you at all...<eos> Unless they switch them before they give them to you.<eos> I'll get them illegally.
When... people... who go to the zoo also visit... .. museums.<eos> They watch animated movies. Buy children's clothes. And donate... to animal charities.<eos> Convert our entire online history into numbers, and a visit to the zoo... looks... like this.<eos> A coded message looks... .. like this.<eos> The 9/11 terrorists used innocent words, but they didn't use them like the rest of us.
What is suspect is what's been taken from them.<eos> Are there enough missing pages to create a manual?<eos> Rough estimate: 20 to 25 pages.<eos> So where are the pages now?<eos> Shima wouldn't keep them in his cell.
- Dementia.<eos> She have a good heart, but she wanted to go out for the day, like a field trip, and we don't do that.<eos> But she don't take no for an answer, so she swallowed the money.<eos> What do you mean she swallowed the money?<eos> She took a bunch of coins and swallowed them.
he was always making comments about my dating life.<eos> I would sometimes meet girls and get numbers.<eos> he must have followed me, seen the girls I talked to, and doubled back on them.<eos> right, and murdered them out of revenge, just to make you out as a serial killer, right?<eos> well and I know you're the professional here, but, I would theorize that he killed them because they rejected him.
My secret... mix a bit of eye shadow in with your foundation...<eos> - To highlight the apples of your cheeks, the contours of your eyes, and the slope of your neckline.<eos> Really?<eos> I never heard of that.<eos> Some women mix primer in with their foundation, but I think that makes them look like the living dead.
Ilyana will tell me nothing.<eos> We were ambushed, by Russians.<eos> Why did you make me transport girls?<eos> Screwed up everything.<eos> Crazy FBI guy looking for them.
I'm moving as fast as I can.<eos> Got him. He's on the basement level.<eos> He's walking toward the west elevators.<eos> Colfax, I need those plans!<eos> Pulling them up now.
Through unimaginable pain and fighting battles of their own, these two courageous ladies found the strength to inspire hundreds of children with cancer to be strong.<eos> I'm Ryan Clarke, NBC News, New York.<eos> They did some pretty incredible things together, especially for the sick kids.<eos> Read books, brought art supplies, put on plays.<eos> The hospital invited them to a ribbon cutting ceremony for a new children's play facility.
As long as I get what I want, I don't give a damn about the rest.<eos> And you of all people should understand that.<eos> Everything I did, I did for you.<eos> Well, you see, that's your problem, Swan.<eos> You're so afraid of losing the people that you love that you push them away.
Wait, what's the deal with Las Vegas, New Mexico?<eos> The same exact type of robbery-homicide took place there 6 years ago.<eos> At that time it was at a place called the Burger Corral and there were 4 victims.<eos> Teenagers.<eos> They sexually assaulted the girls, then shot them execution style, robbed the place, and then burned it down to the ground.
He killed ten innocent people this morning.<eos> Good guys don't do that.<eos> You don't think good people ever do terrible things?<eos> I think terrible people do terrible things.<eos> And the good people stop them.
Right.<eos> Ah hey, Citizen Z? We need you to transmit the GPS coordinates again.<eos> Last time the transmission was breaking up. We didn't get them all.<eos> Repeat. Re-transmit GPS coordinates. Over.<eos> Yeah, roger that. I'll send them as soon as I can find them.
That's a dumb plan.<eos> Okay, if you don't like my theory, give me another one.<eos> - Wait.<eos> These wounds...<eos> I've seen them before.
How are we seeing it as an act of aggression?<eos> Exactly.<eos> It's under the radar.<eos> It's cheap.<eos> And for the cost of one weather station, China gets complete access to our satellite communications, and quite possibly shares them with our adversaries on the Arctic Council, who, as you pointed out, didn't exactly protest this thing in the first place.
Our John Doe washed up on shore six weeks ago.<eos> Okay.<eos> So whoever the killer is dumps the body, gun and the keys in the water at the same time.<eos> Right.<eos> And these things stay there until Ben Lahinea finds them this morning.
He won't be dragged in on these ridiculous accusations.<eos> He'll die first.<eos> Please, don't let my husband get killed out there.<eos> While you were hunting seals, I reexamined Petty Officer Granier.<eos> I found these skin cells on his wrist. I assumed they were his, but analyzed them just to make sure.
Now text the address and then hack the ministry of defense to get the specs of that plant.<eos> Okay, I just sent the address.<eos> And I will get you those specs in a bit.<eos> Uh, no, I-I need it now, pal.<eos> You will get them before you arrive.
Yewll?<eos> She's not coming. Neither am I.<eos> Aw, come on.<eos> This ship is full of intelligent people.<eos> I won't let them die.
I didn't want to know.<eos> I met him at a coffee shop downtown for five minutes.<eos> He needed some letters transcribed into wila.<eos> He gave me a key to a P.O. box near the mall.<eos> He'd leave the letters inside, I'd pick them up once a week, transcribe them, take them back the next day.
Who knew?<eos> Your mind starts to crave more.<eos> So, I poked around.<eos> I started e-mailing back and forth with some very interesting people.<eos> There's Nina, who has some truly fascinating ideas about why quantum particles change form when someone observes them.
Did I miss classes?<eos> Yes. But that's because I was working two jobs.<eos> And I always got notes from somebody when I couldn't make it.<eos> - What about the books?<eos> - We'd get PDF versions, print them out, pass them around.
It's in the sleeve of my black moto jacket.<eos> - Did you borrow it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I didn't ask you 'cause I thought that would make things weird.<eos> It must be nice to have a place to go, a job where people look up to you, even though you look down on them.
Hey, you got those mandibular fragments ready for me?<eos> I wish, but the only thing these fish are pooping is poop.<eos> Why is this one separated from the others?<eos> Well, he's my Guinea pig.<eos> I'm thinking that if these fish aren't gonna defecate the bones, maybe they'll regurgitate them.
I wish, but the only thing these fish are pooping is poop.<eos> Why is this one separated from the others?<eos> Well, he's my Guinea pig.<eos> I'm thinking that if these fish aren't gonna defecate the bones, maybe they'll regurgitate them.<eos> Interesting. Well, I just fed them some octocoral diterpenoid to speed up the process, and...
Well, actually, the story's too long.<eos> Plus, it's best told over dinner.<eos> Wow. I mean, I was thinking like a bonfire, north beach, cold beer,<eos> I could snorkel out, catch us some lobster.<eos> Oh, so you're actually gonna swim out and catch them, too?
What's up?<eos> I found the shoes.<eos> Suede and strappy in black.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I picked them up on approval.
Oh, I love that organization!<eos> It's the one with the... thing and the... people who need the stuff.<eos> Uh, actually, we help families in need build houses.<eos> So do I!<eos> And after I build four houses, I replace them with a hotel.
Well, he was correct.<eos> What do we win?<eos> W... nobody wins anything.<eos> These trivia questions are supposed to be for her.<eos> Kermit, if you want to know the answers, why don't you just look them up on your phone?
It appears at some point during the torture, the killer staples his eyelids open.<eos> That is sadistic.<eos> It might be symbolic.<eos> The victims could have turned a blind eye to something that affected the unsub.<eos> And now he's punishing them for it.
You found Halmi?<eos> The victims were cryogenically frozen by some nutjob billionaire named Crispin Crandall.<eos> Frozen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where is he keeping them?
I'm gettin' splinters in my keister!<eos> How come I got stuck sharing a disguise with Groot?<eos> I am Groot.<eos> Because I could only get my hands on four Nova Corps uniforms, and they don't exactly make them in rodent size.
Eyes all red. Yeah.<eos> No! Ravi needs me.<eos> But we have to celebrate soon.<eos> And I have zombie questions. Okay?<eos> I mean, I wrote them down. They're a few pages.
Mrs Joy, I saw a little girl, recorded on video, pawed and manipulated, made to partake in things I cannot unsee.<eos> I cannot bleach from my mind, Mrs Joy.<eos> You need to speak about this, for your soul, if for nothing else.<eos> Men like that, you think you be rid of 'em, but you'll never be.<eos> And the other people, did you know them?
Barry's running the pharmacy now. Oh!<eos> Yeah, my dad, he retired three years ago.<eos> Business is good. Ahh.<eos> Your dad always wanted to hand over the reins to you.<eos> I'm sure he's glad that you took them.
Steven Ulrich.<eos> Priors for distribution, agg assault.<eos> Been linked to a few missing girls.<eos> Now Vice likes him for involuntary servitude and sex trafficking.<eos> He holds on to girls until they're worn out, then trades them to networks across the country.
You were hazing her.<eos> If she cracks under the pressure of an emergent surgery, she does not belong in this program.<eos> Blake was at the top of her class at Dillard.<eos> Her references were impeccable.<eos> I checked them myself.
All I needed was a little fresh air to get the blood flowing to the proper areas...<eos> I think we should focus on the bones.<eos> Yeah. Good idea.<eos> Come on.<eos> The sooner we find these bones and clean them for Dr. B., the sooner we can solve this case.
Chicago PD!<eos> Chicago PD!<eos> Put your hands up where I can see them now! Don't move!<eos> Keep your hands where I can see them!<eos> Keep your hands where I can see them.
So a monster did this to Petty Officer Benton?<eos> Dragged him down to the water.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> By stealing his shoes?<eos> No. No, he would've wanted me to have them.
I just need to put paper booties on the bird.<eos> Why are the gourds naked?<eos> Where are their overalls?<eos> Cute, right?<eos> [Laughs] Someone had put them on some potatoes or something.
- You'll be fine.<eos> - I know. As soon as I can find the...<eos> Bailey, there's nothing you need in those binders.<eos> Okay, you just have to take things as they come.<eos> But you won't see them until they're right here.
Oh, my God.<eos> Did I just say "boobs"?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you did.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I mean, I'm not sorry that you have them. I'm sorry, uh...
You should hear his life story. All right.<eos> Ready to do some work?<eos> __<eos> _<eos> I got John Doe files from every morgue that would send them to me.
"back off."<eos> Weird thing is, right after that, he just went quiet. Been off the map ever since.<eos> Raised in foster homes, so no next of kin listed.<eos> Anything else connect the victims?<eos> He finds them online, that's how he makes contact.
Nancy goes where she pleases.<eos> See much of Bill Sikes these days?<eos> Sikes?<eos> He looked after your girls from time to time.<eos> Delivered them where they had to go.
What am I looking at?<eos> They're Frye combat boots, like yours.<eos> - Popular shoe.<eos> - Yeah, but not with climbers.<eos> He ties them like yours too.
I'm also gonna treat you like the trained agents that you are.<eos> - OK?<eos> - OK.<eos> OK, so, there's 80 NZT pills out there still.<eos> Whoever has them might be using them to do some NZT-type stuff.
Are you looking at him?<eos> Yes, I'm looking at him right now.<eos> He needs vitamins before bed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Watch him take them.
- Baby drums and then Mummy and Me.<eos> God, I hate them saying that.<eos> And then probably go and get a coffee with Sam.<eos> Talk about the other mums in the group.<eos> Sam calls them "mombies".
They're not in the system.<eos> They are the system.<eos> Yeah, not really following.<eos> There are bad people in this world.<eos> We put them in cages, expect them to change, they never do.
Arrest who?<eos> Mr. Boss's thugs.<eos> The guys buying the guns.<eos> Where are the guns?<eos> Did the police take them?
Been three weeks since Vivian died. Somebody's been out here.<eos> There's tracks in the dust.<eos> Also, this succulent is still alive.<eos> It doesn't require much water, but it does require light.<eos> Hmm. These shades must have been open until someone closed them recently.
Fewer cards to send out at Christmas.<eos> Why do you hate cops so much?<eos> No, man.<eos> I've been around enough crime scenes to know how you guys work.<eos> Have you been around so many crime scenes because you're the one who made them?
$1,800?<eos> Okay, I know it's a little steep, but look how cool this place is.<eos> - Yeah, that won't matter if nobody shows up.<eos> - Why would nobody show up?<eos> Because the parties won't be underground anymore, which makes them awesome.
Yeah.<eos> They have the turtle pies that you like...<eos> In bulk.<eos> I do love those.<eos> And I know those VHS tapes are hard to get, - but they have them there.
You need to rest.<eos> I will find her.<eos> I'm not following you anymore. I've lost track of where we've checked.<eos> Hey, where ya going?<eos> Okay, yes. You found them.
You're a voice of authority.<eos> You can gain the trust of the jury and help us frame this case in plain language, but only if you dispel these accusations against you.<eos> - Those accusations are unrelated and invented from whole cloth.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> If you don't clear them up before the Maddox case goes to trial, you're worthless to us as a witness.
I should've known it was you.<eos> I was really just the middle man.<eos> The Chinese were greedy.<eos> So I just took the guns.<eos> I sold them to very motivated buyers.
- It's a news alert.<eos> It's about a battle that happened in some<eos> Ukrainian city... Marr... upol. - What about it?<eos> - Says<eos> "Ukraine, aided by American advisors, overwhelmed the Russian forces and beat them back in a decisive blow to Russia."
Thank you for watching the house while we're gone.<eos> I don't know when we'll be back.<eos> Here.<eos> I put these things together for you.<eos> She'd want you to have them.
- I told her that I would help her.<eos> I heard the voices, too.<eos> They tell you the most wonderful, awful things.<eos> You're gonna hear them, too, little girl.<eos> You'll hear them soon enough because she's coming to get you, too.
That's my girl.<eos> I think this is it, guys!<eos> Does anyone have anything they want to say?<eos> Donnie?<eos> I'm the one who licks the icing off the Pop-Tarts every morning and puts them back in the box.
Dad didn't teach us.<eos> Henry hated bicycles.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> He considered them predatory.
That was unnecessary.<eos> Then talk to me, otherwise how can I understand?<eos> Perhaps you can't.<eos> I sent you some poems a while ago.<eos> I don't know if you got them.
Bloody blooming right it's jolly well high time.<eos> You look smashing.<eos> - Those bleeding pills are rubbish.<eos> - I super-hate those pills.<eos> I only took them because you told me to.
Your dirty, little secret is that you want answers just as bad as I do.<eos> But you don't have the stomach to get 'em.<eos> Alex, we all want answers!<eos> Okay?<eos> We all want them, but not like this. Not like this, please?
Viktor Dragovic.<eos> Ex-Serbian national, now working in Russia.<eos> Thank you for coming in late.<eos> Dragovic made a fortune in hotels and gambling in Eastern Europe and Asia. But he's also a major player in what I consider the most despicable endeavor on Planet E, human trafficking.<eos> Dragovic kidnaps young girls in South East Asia, runs them through Europe then sells them all over the globe.
Far be it from me to pull you away from your simple thatch cottage<eos> - to the big city.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You probably didn't even own shoes, did you?<eos> - Who can afford them?
Pretty please.<eos> ICE took them off some beer cans inside their hotel room.<eos> Should I have these?<eos> No.<eos> Then why'd you give them to me?
Thank God they put you here and not back in prison.<eos> Yeah, well, it ain't prison, but they still won't let me leave.<eos> I mean, why the hell did they pick me up for marks anyway?<eos> That's the wrong question.<eos> Why do you have them?
She can't help, not really help.<eos> Not the way I do.<eos> I see it, Ben, your pain.<eos> You're so full of emotions.<eos> I can see them in your face.
- Where is my family?<eos> Where is my family? !<eos> - You don't have a family.<eos> You don't have a family.<eos> My lab, the lab where I work not extending people's lives, but making them older, faster, then recording and implanting learned behavior...
You're late.<eos> -Doggone trains are so slow, sir.<eos> Don't you realise Oscorp is now responsible for the entire city's energy supply?<eos> I submitted a lot of designs for the power grid and they used a lot of them, and I noticed that and those power grids were designed by me.<eos> You designed them?
- Wow.<eos> - No, it's pretty easy.<eos> Yeah, for you, maybe.<eos> Humans have always looked to the stars.<eos> Instruct their way of life, consult them.
We turn it on during the day.<eos> We do all this during the day, so no one is disturbed.<eos> We set up a street light out there, turn it on and leave it on.<eos> This is on. - On all the time.<eos> Then we take some small cameras and we rig them to the trees.
We have a few cameras in the office...<eos> They're so small like you wouldn't even...<eos> - They're real tiny cameras.<eos> - So small.<eos> And we rig them to the trees and just let them roll.
They're so small like you wouldn't even...<eos> - They're real tiny cameras.<eos> - So small.<eos> And we rig them to the trees and just let them roll.<eos> Let them roll. Nobody goes out there, starts and stops them. Nothing.
Haven't been around.<eos> Duh, say you like her shoes.<eos> I like your shoes.<eos> They, they work.<eos> I can't believe you noticed them. I got them on sale. They pretty much go with everything.
Do you mind?<eos> No, go ahead.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I put some things in your luggage.<eos> I don't want Gary to find them.
Dad, where are these pages?<eos> I don't...<eos> Hey, don't go foggy on me now.<eos> This is the most important thing.<eos> I didn't lose them.
I don't...<eos> Hey, don't go foggy on me now.<eos> This is the most important thing.<eos> I didn't lose them.<eos> Somebody took them.
Absolutely, we need that song.<eos> I don't know, James. If you two don't get together, then every song and every film and every book I've ever heard, seen, and read are wrong.<eos> It's different for us.<eos> She makes songs.<eos> She writes them.
- Lights!<eos> - I do.<eos> Lights!<eos> Too bright.<eos> I'll turn them off.
Where is she from?<eos> Florida.<eos> It's amazing, she just showed up on my doorstep.<eos> I get this sense that I'm working through something by hiring her.<eos> People don't just enter our lives randomly, we call them.
It's not wet. It's just... damp. Just leave it on.<eos> It'll dry faster that way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Even the cards are old.<eos> I've had them a long time.
Fifteen minutes after it turns on, it wants to plug into Wall Street?<eos> Get faster?<eos> More powerful? Does that sound like Will to you?<eos> How do you explain these images?<eos> Stock footage. Pinn could have accessed them from any one of the cores we took from the lab.
Is all this based on Pinn?<eos> We've moved well beyond that now.<eos> Paul has been blind since birth.<eos> The nanotechnology targets the damaged cells...<eos> And repairs and regenerates them.
It's rainwater.<eos> - It's in the rain.<eos> - Keep watching.<eos> Everywhere it can, it builds copies of itself.<eos> The particles join the air currents which carry them all over the surface of the planet.
It's closer to spring than fall, they... they're supposed to be flying north. And they were going south.<eos> Did he mention any of his theories about what he thinks might be going on?<eos> I was at his bar last night, he had some pretty crazy ideas.<eos> Those are just stories, Donny.<eos> And people have been telling them around here for a long time.
Aye.<eos> He's killed himself.<eos> I used to go round there when I was a kid. You know, stay there.<eos> Well, they were nice, like, kind, you know, helped me out.<eos> He was on these pills for his nerves, like. He took them all at once.
Are they Super-Twat's?<eos> Her name is Andie.<eos> She's not entirely sure.<eos> So we are dealing with a 20-year-old... who isn't sure where she leaves her undies?<eos> If they're not Andie's, that means that they're Amy's... and she left them there for me to find.
Amber's been gone a very long time.<eos> There's a chance she's not coming back.<eos> You realise that, don't you?<eos> What will we do with all her things?<eos> We'll pack them up...put them somewhere safe.
I mean, in a medical, scientific way.<eos> Let me perform the autopsy.<eos> What good would it do?<eos> I'm actually really good at what I do.<eos> If there are clues in this body that will lead to someone else and not you, I'm the only person who's going to find them.
Look I've got the marks.<eos> They're a bit faded but, we had a falling out.<eos> You went dark.<eos> It's a dark business Barney, don't pretend you're not in it.<eos> The baddest survive, those are the rules, I didn't make them up.
- Hey.<eos> Sorry, my hand was just recharging.<eos> The captain's really getting on me about the hydrogen tanks.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If I'd known you'd needed those, I would have gotten them for you.
Don't leave.<eos> Let's stay.<eos> Just a night cap. Just a night cap?<eos> The tanks, maybe 9:30 tomorrow.<eos> I think the captain would like them by then, just so you know.
I need to know.<eos> Okay, Father.<eos> What you got?<eos> Military files.<eos> DOD sent them over.
- I just need one strike.<eos> Have you seen the pants on that guy over there?<eos> - Go on.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> Did you end up keeping the shoes or you gave them back or...?
- Good luck. - Yes.<eos> So... See you soon, Bob.<eos> Yes!<eos> So, do you have a special technique?<eos> Yes, I put the strawberries in a damp cloth and then I rub them ever so gently.
They pay up front for it, take it someplace civilized and sell it.<eos> The Guthries?<eos> Mate, no offense, but the faster we get this loaded, the faster I can get up the hill and into the arms of my sweet, sweet Charlotte.<eos> Your recipes?<eos> I left them with our captain for safekeeping, but I don't see them with the rest of the journals.
- Where is Mr. Cuddy?<eos> - I'm unmarried.<eos> What's the job?<eos> Three women in this country have lost their mind... their husbands can't care for them properly.<eos> You and I are gonna take them back across the river to Iowa.
You have been a long time coming, Mr. Briggs,<eos> I am relieved you're here. I'm...<eos> I'm sorry Reverend Carter isn't.<eos> He is out burying a beloved member of our congregation.<eos> Just a minute, I thought a woman named Cuddy was bringing them.
Sit down!<eos> Safe from our own panic.<eos> It is the biggest threat on this plane right now. .<eos> Now, I'm going to ask the flight attendants to do a head count.<eos> Whatever happened to those people, we will find them.
Fresh off a stint and looking for a new start.<eos> Wait, you did time?<eos> Seven months at Otisville.<eos> It was actually one of my better business ideas.<eos> What I'd do was I would send out these fake invoices to all the big companies, and if it was under a thousand bucks, they wouldn't check them out.
Take them off!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> They're going to kill him.<eos> They're going to take his balls, cut them off his body, and put them in his ears.
- Oh yeah, motherfucker?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You like the shoes?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How about I put them back on and I fucking kick your ass until both shoes are shitty?
When Matt went to visit Greg...<eos> You said that he was screaming.<eos> Screaming about what?<eos> He said he could hear these voices.<eos> He called them otherworldly voices.
Do you ever feel like you don't write your own songs?<eos> Hm? - Like they were given to you?<eos> - By who?<eos> God?<eos> - What if he takes them away?
It ranks words by their usage, particularly articles like "the"<eos> and prepositions like "of" and "to"...<eos> Words that might seem inconsequential but, in fact, leave an authorial fingerprint on most any work.<eos> So, by taking a sampling of legal motions written by Stroh and comparing them to motions authored by Reyes...<eos> You can prove Stroh wrote them.
Virginia, I'm as unhappy with the situation as you are.<eos> Are you taking diet pills?<eos> I'm selling them.<eos> Holding on to them for a friend? No.<eos> I am selling them.
The terms of my employment The terms between you and me are changing now.<eos> You will clear my exam room, and you will never get near it again.<eos> You will authorize Mrs Johnson's hiring starting tomorrow morning.<eos> Let me tell you how it works with secretaries.<eos> You don't promote them to lofty positions above their pay grade, or give them titles like "research assistant."
What we do in this room does not make a damn bit of difference to anybody but us.<eos> It will.<eos> You can say that, but--<eos> We are not gonna find the cure for dysfunction in an exam room. We're not.<eos> We can diagnose individual conditions, we can rule out underlying issues, but we're not gonna find answers pairing impotent men with prostitutes, wives with husbands whose sexual techniques have made them frigid.
Your deposition is coming up quick, Lee Anne, and we need to have every angle covered.<eos> The interrogatory the city attorney sent, the questionnaire you filled out after you filed suit.<eos> I remember.<eos> Look over your answers.<eos> Roy has them.
Oh, please, I've flatlined three times, dear.<eos> The flu is like a flea fart in a hurricane to me. Oh.<eos> What can I do you for?<eos> Well, as you know, I'm a huge fan of the Girlfriends dolls.<eos> I've collected them since I was a kid. And since the office is so shorthanded,
And you won't understand the meaning of the term until you've been played with by me.<eos> Where are the girls?<eos> They're not going anywhere.<eos> Did you kill them?<eos> No, Seth, I did not kill them.
Especially when you're lying through your teeth every minute of every day.<eos> I've been to see Ronnie Porter.<eos> You weren't harassed, you weren't defamed.<eos> You've been planning this whole thing since the beginning, even the drugs.<eos> You took them yourself.
Sorry?<eos> The next time one of your songs gets rejected, you can throw yourself a pity party for exactly three minutes.<eos> And then you need to haul your ass up and start writing another one.<eos> 'Cause your songs are really good.<eos> And I don't care that a bunch of yahoos rejected them.
It won't be over until they're extinct or we are.<eos> And what we have to do is prepare everyone for that inevitability.<eos> Lead them!<eos> And we lead them by attending the Jubilee.<eos> People need a release from the stress of this city, but more important, they need something to inspire them.
- Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Margaux.<eos> Um, I wanted to say thank you for the donation and for accepting my invitation.<eos> Since I'm covering the summer parties and now you're the one throwing them, it seemed necessary.
But he told you to go, so you went.<eos> And all those abusive things he said to you?<eos> That's what makes you feel like the world is ending.<eos> Because instead of ignoring those things, you... you believe them.<eos> You absorb them.
He takes the pictures for the company newsletter.<eos> Yes, I love "Herb's blurbs."<eos> Well...<eos> Here come the doors!<eos> Usually all the good places have them!
How did that go?<eos> Pretty hellish, actually.<eos> I was going to take her to find some tiles at Ann Sacks...<eos> Right, and then we had to go all the way - to the other...<eos> - And we didn't even end up getting them.
He shouldn't be rattled.<eos> He's a pain in the ass.<eos> - You knew about this? - No.<eos> But I'm tired of him costing me money.<eos> We all set those stipulations, and he signed them.
Give me your number, and I'll text you the address.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, this is...<eos> The mouldings are so beautiful.<eos> I got them wholesale, but still they're crazy expensive.
I can't believe Sheldon would just sell off that fish.<eos> I can't believe you actually caught a fish.<eos> Well, I also caught poison oak, poison ivy, and a mysterious rash that reoccurs every summer.<eos> I thought you loved those trips. Oh, I hated those trips!<eos> Dad and Sheldon loved them.
Goodbye, medical license.<eos> Goodbye, timeshare yacht.<eos> Well, Ryan, I did manage to secure your alimony.<eos> Maybe you could study and actually become a real doctor.<eos> Oh, yeah, blood, needles, people peeing into cups and handing them to me. That sounds like my thing.
I was saving her guests the disappointment.<eos> - What? - No-one wants to sit next - to a clergyman at supper.<eos> - Not every clergyman is you!<eos> The girls from school will be there.<eos> I thought you avoided them as a matter of principle?
The world keeps turning but Grantchester stays the same.<eos> Why I had to get away.<eos> ~ How did you know the sisters?<eos> ~ I went to school with them.<eos> Snow White and Rose Red, that's what we used to call them.
Smile, agents.<eos> You're on-camera.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We believe Tish is involved with a group that's selling illegal weapons and that they're being stored here.<eos> Here? Yes, and we're gonna find them.
I'm sorry. I don't have the address.<eos> - Really?<eos> - In between addresses, apparently.<eos> And... and the medical records would state that, would they?<eos> If you were to show them to us, which you're not going to do.
Yes...<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Did you see them being born?<eos> Did you see those little white babies come out of her juicy black pussy?<eos> Because I think she stole them.
Grappling hooks?<eos> Grappling hooks?<eos> Seems to me they should just go through.<eos> I mean, the people that built this jail were nice enough to put doors in the walls.<eos> Why don't they just use them?
His receipts show that someone named Josef Rosales sold him $50,000 worth of diamonds 2 weeks ago, including several Australian pinks.<eos> Who's Rosales?<eos> Uh, he's a vendor at a traveling gem show.<eos> It -- it's a, uh, gem market that travels from city to city.<eos> Vendors buy gems in large quantities and then sell them at the show to retailers like Joubert. And where's this gem show now?
Yesterday they kidnapped another 20 Nigerian girls on their way to a soccer game.<eos> They killed the coach, the bus driver, hijacked the bus.<eos> They've released videos demanding a ransom from the west.<eos> If it is not received within 24 hours, they're going to sell the girls into slavery.<eos> That was four hours ago, and I'm sure I don't have to tell you what they've probably already done to them.
Kinky.<eos> I remember these. What?<eos> 100 years ago, the human faction waged a war against the voodoo queens.<eos> They had a trader spell these manacles.<eos> You slap them on a witch, they can't do magic as long as they're on.
Following the tracks was easy once I found my way out here. But what I can't figure is how you got so far out of Salem leaving so few tracks and traces between here and there.<eos> I am a silly thing, and in a fit of petulance, I-I ran into these woods without thinking where I was going or how late it was... Until it was too late.<eos> Without leaving any tracks out of Salem.<eos> It... it rained briefly while I was... Wandering.<eos> Perhaps that washed away my tracks, or perhaps you just didn't find them.
Before you answer that, Josh, I'd like you to think about this.<eos> All this cash was ordered in advance from the bank.<eos> The serial numbers are in order.<eos> And the five missing bills...<eos> Lina gave them to me after she left the hotel.
Could you, uh, just hold the fort for me for a second?<eos> I really got to take this call.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Gunnar?<eos> See, I know about all the calls. I saw them on his phone.
You sending my girls to boarding school now?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, I would just appreciate, in the future, if you're gonna have a conversation with them about their education, that I be a part of that.<eos> Now, hold on a second.<eos> It came up randomly last week when I took them to dinner with colt and sage.
♪ To the line of fire... ♪<eos> That's what I like to see.<eos> 10 songs in 3 weeks?<eos> Looks like Miranda is interested in a couple I sent over to her.<eos> Oh. Well, she better snap them up fast. I think my well's running dry.
- Okay.<eos> What time are we starting again tomorrow?<eos> 8:00 A.M.<eos> I think I'm gonna grab a quick shower. You care to join me?<eos> Uh, no, I'm gonna check on the girls, get them to bed.
Right, but this barium swallow will allow us to check your esophagus and stomach for any obstruction so you can avoid death.<eos> Annie, we still haven't received your medical records.<eos> Would you mind calling your previous doctor to see if they can send them now?<eos> That's weird.<eos> The office said they would send them over this morning.
I may be able to find more details, if you want.<eos> No, that's all right.<eos> Thank you for looking into it.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Joan, this is none of my business, I know... But these things always sound worse when you hear them secondhand.
But what none of the neighbors would see is what a guy like him is like when no one is watching.<eos> So desperate to be aggressive, dominant.<eos> Yeah, this one surprises me.<eos> I mean, his fantasies were innocent enough.<eos> Managed them all these years.
I mean, his fantasies were innocent enough.<eos> Managed them all these years.<eos> What was it that made him snap and kill 3 people?<eos> Wait.<eos> You think I killed them?
This is certain, Leila.<eos> So what do I do?<eos> I wait until tomorrow.<eos> Maybe these clouds will bring a storm.<eos> Or maybe something will happen to clear them.
- Of course. I can record this... so I won't miss the finale. Then I'm all yours.<eos> Can I have some money ?<eos> I want to buy some chips.<eos> Okay, perfect.<eos> Pull them out with this and put them there.
Well, she just got out of the hospital.<eos> She almost overdosed, okay, she just can't be trusted.<eos> She just lost her mom.<eos> Everyone suffers losses.<eos> It's how we handle them that says everything about a person.
The weather was quite mild.<eos> Watched an episode of "Bones" on the treadmill.<eos> Then I broke out some new bath products I've been meaning to try.<eos> Yeah, it was Rosemary...<eos> Henry says maintaining eye contact makes people think you're listening to them, even if what you're really thinking about is whether or not Jay and Beyoncé have a pre-nup.
No, that's wrong, that's impossible.<eos> The rain will not fall.<eos> Oh? Why won't it?<eos> The clouds will burn.<eos> And who'll burn them?
You want some help?<eos> I'm handy.<eos> You are helping.<eos> You're here.<eos> When they know you have whatever it is, that makes you good at these solo missions, they can't send you on enough of them.
- You know how they have those rotating hot dogs.<eos> Yeah, but I told her to stay home and finish her paper.<eos> - Well, nobody told me.<eos> - I told you.<eos> Honey, there's no point in telling me things if I don't hear them.
Really? Mm-mm. Because I remember a very interesting incident with some church ladies, you and a garbage bag.<eos> That was a decade ago, okay?<eos> Okay, I did, at one point, harbor an irrational fear of rodents.<eos> But people change, all right?<eos> They face their fears, and in facing them, overcome them.
OK.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> It's funny, you only really know what someone thinks of you, when you know what lies they've told you.<eos> You say you've seen wonders, you've seen amazing things, and you kept them secret. From me.
Why did you lie?<eos> Those things, you know what they are.<eos> Exit strategy, of sorts.<eos> How did you know I was lying?<eos> I've had a lot of faces, I find them easy to read.
Same deal: lots of jobs, no employees.<eos> Oh, they have employees.<eos> They're just not paying most of them.<eos> When I was at the Bureau, we looked into groups who were bringing young women into the country illegally, mostly through Eastern Europe.<eos> They get them here, take their papers and force them to work for nothing.
Just over here getting my snack on.<eos> - Mm. - These chips are amazing.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> My roommate Brendan's a freegan.<eos> He just picked them out of the dumpster this afternoon.
Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't even want them.<eos> I got freaked out by that guy from the accident, and when I saw the pills...<eos> I flushed them down the sink as soon as I got home, I swear.
Copy that.<eos> Alex.<eos> That's Richardson.<eos> It's still inside these walls.<eos> My mom used to have them.
I need you to put something into their house.<eos> - Put something?<eos> - Some papers.<eos> I need you to...<eos> To make it look like Lancefield hid them.
Oh, shit.<eos> Are you...<eos> - This is just work.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> I need you to put some papers into their house. To make it look like Lancefield hid them.
She is an English subject first.<eos> And she was brought here for fear she was being held prisoner by my brother.<eos> Now she will have assured ye that that is not the case, and by right, must be returned to me for protection.<eos> I'm afraid further questions have arisen.<eos> Well... Ye won't be asking them on MacKenzie land.
And that's a pretty big coincidence. No, no.<eos> I would never help steal girls.<eos> Who said anything about these girls being stolen?<eos> It's the clear implication, isn't it?<eos> Obviously they weren't murdered on the premises, and you're still looking for them, so it must mean they were kidnapped, which is why my client provides valet service, to encourage safety.
You're miserable here.<eos> And I'm making you miserable, too.<eos> I'll wire you if I discover anything.<eos> Write me letters...<eos> Not too rude, in case mother opens them.
How did you get your start? Eyeball courier.<eos> What?<eos> Eyeball courier.<eos> Eyeball courier?<eos> In med school, when there were local accidents that involved a fatality, I would be called in to harvest the corneas and pack them in a special cooler to be sent for transplant.
Okay.<eos> Mama.<eos> Mama was twiddling with your nannies.<eos> [Laughs] Yeah.<eos> I thought it was because I disapproved of them.
I don't understand.<eos> I love her.<eos> And I miss her.<eos> And I want to try to win her back, and I need these things to make that happen.<eos> Then you have them.
Right.<eos> What if it's too late?<eos> You know, I have these shoes at the bottom of my closet.<eos> They're this pair of 2-inch heels, Navy blue, and the toe and the heel are caked in dirt.<eos> I see them every morning, but I don't... I don't put them on, not anymore.
That you needed a bigger saw to get through his dingus?<eos> No, his body is so physically massive that we didn't have enough anesthesia on hand.<eos> He needs a much larger dose.<eos> Psst... psst...<eos> Jake. Sometimes I can't tell my twin baby girls apart, so I call them both "boo-boo."
About 600.<eos> Thousand?<eos> 600.<eos> What are your monthly expenses?<eos> I wrote them all down there for you.
And, evidently, it's still going on today.<eos> If you create a list of the things that the tobacco industry did to stall or to fight off public health actions that would curtail smoking, the food companies are doing every single one.<eos> Paying scientists to do studies that favour industry positions, paying money to professional organisations, like heart-related and cancer-related organisations, putting out deceptive statements in the press, characterising science that doesn't work out for industry as 'junk science'.<eos> There's a very long list of these things.<eos> The tobacco industry did them all and the food industry is doing them all.
Sometimes men are tempted by money and power.<eos> And they forget what end they're serving.<eos> Casper Dougherty, Jimmy O, and now Connor Malone.<eos> Connor was using your war in Oakland to drum up some new customers.<eos> Reaching out to the people Marks promised guns to. Selling them directly. Pocketing the profits.
It's how Collins structured it.<eos> He planted a Trojan horse he knew would be triggered once Happy ran the system test.<eos> General, I'm sorry to say there's a third step.<eos> We need analog antennas.<eos> We've got them at the base. But that's a half an hour away.
Okay.<eos> - You left them? - I left them.<eos> How do you misplace...<eos> You left your balls in Thailand?<eos> I misplaced them in Bangkok.
I didn't care about playing with my friends. I just wanted to be around horses, so... Um, so I...<eos> Ray took me on, real young. I started working at the stable, training all the time, basically.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's sort of like... like me with cars.<eos> I... I always loved them.
You want to break out of who you are and try new things.<eos> Well, I do too.<eos> I think... I think most people do.<eos> It's just, you know, they don't know how.<eos> I want to create a program, an app, I guess, that helps people figure out what makes them happy.
What kind of delusion?<eos> Bugs.<eos> We need to deliver the profile.<eos> We believe the unsub we're looking for suffers from delusional parasitosis, a condition in which the patient believes that he's being attacked or infested by bugs.<eos> He takes his victims and covers them in insects, cockroaches specifically.
I don't know whether to be embarrassed Or flattered that you noticed.<eos> Don't be embarrassed.<eos> Everyone wants their mom when they're sick.<eos> That's the thing about lies --<eos> Even if you're telling them for the right reasons, The person who usually winds up getting hurt is you.
It's the men looking into their pint pots, muttering darkly.<eos> They're the danger.<eos> You're a good friend, Margaret Boden.<eos> I've watched you grow into yourself, Grace.<eos> You've said things that I never even knew that I thought till I heard you say them.
No one thinks like you.<eos> No, everyone thinks like me.<eos> I'm really not looking to date anyone right now.<eos> Hmm. Are you not looking to date, or do you know that women find that irresistible?<eos> And then when you dump them, you can say, "I told you I wasn't into dating," so it's their fault?
It seems that they've run off, Sir.<eos> It was the girls you had charge of.<eos> Two whores!<eos> Where are they?<eos> They are my property and I will have them.
Come with us.<eos> It is too dangerous on your own.<eos> Jeremiah will not know where to find me.<eos> And your girls?<eos> Slotter has them.
I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry. No, I'm asking because I really do feel better and I wanna know why.<eos> Well, this woman that I was dating at Sean's... place of employment.<eos> Stripper at a strip club.<eos> Go on... ( sighs ) She stole Sean's ideas and then used them to take his job.
I'm glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn't be a good father to a girl.<eos> It wouldn't be good for me.<eos> Nothing weird. Wouldn't fuck it.<eos> I...<eos> I just don't get along with women. You know how it is. I don't want them in my house, and...
Ok.<eos> Uh... Where are you taking me, anyway?<eos> Does the concept of surprise mean something different in space?<eos> You should know I don't like surprises.<eos> I hate them, actually.
Just contagious.<eos> So what's up?<eos> Uh, well, ocean drive<eos> Is interviewing a couple of hotel owners for an article. Mm-hmm. Written questions that the magazine submits,<eos> But then we actually get to respond to. I've already done most of them, but there's one that
Why was Lord Sinderby in a panic?<eos> Why did Lady Rose take over?<eos> Why did your father pretend to know the visitor when he clearly did not?<eos> And why was Lady Sinderby in total ignorance throughout?<eos> Naturally, I'm not going to answer any of your questions, but I'm impressed you should ask them.
And all you'll be able to think about are the things you'd say to him if he was still here.<eos> Well, he's here now.<eos> It's funny to think that wherever you go, you'll be able to see the same stars as me.<eos> We'll both be looking at them at the same time.<eos> When I'm looking at them, you'll be able to see them too.
He poses as a minicab driver.<eos> He was one, according to his employment history.<eos> He used to be most things.<eos> It was Tommy's car Stephen recognised.<eos> He identifies his victims, picks them up outside Mayside and then he kills them.
He was one, according to his employment history.<eos> He used to be most things.<eos> It was Tommy's car Stephen recognised.<eos> He identifies his victims, picks them up outside Mayside and then he kills them.<eos> Yeah, but where does he take them?
After all these years, I thought you'd show more respect.<eos> Please, I beg you.<eos> It reminds me of what you were when I found you...<eos> With just those fairy tales your grandmother told you.<eos> You said you'd make them come true.
Christmas.<eos> Christmas Day, December 25th.<eos> You've heard of it ?<eos> No work today, so the bottles on the table.<eos> I know we didn't have decorations last year. But, er... I couldn't find them last year.
What daughter ?<eos> This is Beth's daughter.<eos> I want to see my daughter.<eos> May, go upstairs.<eos> If this is about those letters I threw them out before she saw them.
Like the others.<eos> All these women?<eos> Well Zina and Emmeline were my sister wives.<eos> And when Ammon went, we had each other and this place.<eos> These other women weren't so lucky 'til we found them.
so I walked with him to the kitchen.<eos> And Chip asked him to get some ice, so he went to the garage.<eos> And I went with him just to ask for him to give us another chance.<eos> And Toby said, um he said that he might have already met a girl that was his other chance and that, "maybe Wesley is your other chance."<eos> And I saw the scissors there, and I picked them up.

Oh, Jesus, Todd!<eos> - Read louder much?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Oh, sure, just drop Toaster Strudel crumbs all over the floor, why don't you?<eos> Guess I'll just clean them up myself, like always.
- Daddy?<eos> - Harper?<eos> Where do the stars go?<eos> Oh, they're still there.<eos> We just can't see them because the sun is shining. - Oh.
Rolled once landed here.<eos> Marshals are still sifting through the wreckage, but, so far, we have three dead, three unaccounted for.<eos> We're waiting for the prison manifest to confirm names.<eos> Any witnesses?<eos> The girls were making a pilgrimage to New Orleans when the bus nearly hit them head-on.
What a morning, huh?<eos> I was in the middle of my second soul cycle class when I got the news.<eos> - Can you imagine?<eos> - No.<eos> I was so excited, I rushed home, made love to my husband of 15 years, made a hot breakfast for my three wonderful girls, read to them, dropped them off at their elite private school,
Let's say he went to Hughes for help.<eos> That gives Hughes the perfect opportunity.<eos> Sam brings back the virus, thinking it's something to purify the water.<eos> Why would Hughes do that?<eos> He specializes in curing infectious diseases, not spreading them.
I mean, it's easy to be someone's girlfriend, but how many people can say that they're someone's muse?<eos> Not to be a downer, but throughout history, artists have put their muses on a pedestal.<eos> See?<eos> I love being on a pedestal.<eos> Until they get bored, and then they toss them aside like used gum.
Well, maybe that was because someone fucked with my meds.<eos> What?<eos> My pills.<eos> That I rely on.<eos> I'm wondering if someone tampered with them.
He slips in, chloroforms the maid, grabs Ember, no sign of B and E, nothing.<eos> Like a ghost.<eos> Like he had keys.<eos> Randall Milkie had a ritual.<eos> He'd dress the victims, kill them and do his little coin trick... whole thing took about eight hours.
You got boring. I got a conscience.<eos> Prey that begged for their lives, it was like... even if I used every part, like I taught you, I mean, it's still wrong.<eos> So, you walked away?<eos> I tried to protect people.<eos> Man, after so many years of gutting them.
You know, adult-onset allergy is a real thing.<eos> She also recently found out she's allergic to all metal that's not gold. Mm-hmm.<eos> And she's allergic to all seafood that's not very expensive lobster.<eos> She's a woman.<eos> All women have thicker folds in their brains, making them more manipulative by nature.
When you're in a witness's home, look out for where a freezer might be or may have been. And check the council for freezer collections, as well.<eos> - Cross-county? - Yeah.<eos> We need to be clever.<eos> 23 years ago is a long time.<eos> People remember the version of events they've told before, but we need to get them to look at things like they're looking at them for the first time.
We'll go in heavier.<eos> Take us along this time.<eos> We probably only got one more shot at a SCRAM.<eos> But we'll need heavier suits to reach the control room.<eos> Where do we find them?
He could be targeting any sexual behavior that he perceives as deviant or unwholesome.<eos> A closeted gay man.<eos> A jerk like Brubaker who violates his partner's trust.<eos> We need to find out how he learns the details of his victims' lives.<eos> And how he finds them in the first place.
I found another deleted text from Abel the truck driver.<eos> That gun we recovered... it's a prototype.<eos> Abel and Van Hess brought in 20 crates last week.<eos> That's 100 of those guns.<eos> And we've got no idea who's got them.
They won't find one.<eos> All the blood was drained from her body - before it was dumped here.<eos> - Uh... I hate to sound all "Silence of the Lambs," here, but she's got something in her mouth.<eos> Nylon.<eos> In the '60s, there was a serial killer who broke into women's homes. He strangled them with a stocking, and then he tied it into a bow.
Of my choosing.<eos> Nostradamus and the guards have been freed.<eos> You were brilliant.<eos> And he didn't ask to see the contents of the letters?<eos> I burned them before he could see they were forged.
The victim on top is breathing.<eos> I can't get a read on the one under him.<eos> There's not enough room to get down there and carry them up.<eos> Mills, we can lower you in upside down, get the victims handcuffed to some webbing,<eos> - we'll pull them up.
But... His mouth was sewn shut before he could say anything.<eos> Sewn shut by what?<eos> We had three stuffed monkeys:<eos> See no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil.<eos> I saw them on your mantle, with the same stitches as the victims.
♪ Of my days in the sun ♪ [whistling]<eos> ♪ Oh, no ♪<eos> So here are my tapes.<eos> You know, watch them in your own time. Just be careful, they are originals.<eos> You know, don't leave them near any large magnets.
But between brick-and-mortar and online stores, we got hundreds of vendors.<eos> Well, this explains how he got Cam's key, but not Garrett and Abby's.<eos> Uh, Abby never posted photos of her keys.<eos> A-and she was careful.<eos> It's not like she left them lying around.
Actually...<eos> Abby used to rent out her apartment online through a travel site.<eos> The people who stayed...<eos> how'd they get her keys?<eos> She'd leave them under a loose brick on her stoop.
The remains are on their way to the lab. All right, I'll take Little Miss, uh, Potty Mouth to Max's.<eos> Then I'll go to the office then.<eos> Okay. So, about the naughty words.<eos> Right? Are we clear?<eos> We don't use them in this house.
- And every satellite overhead.<eos> We're bathed in microwaves.<eos> - Weak ones.<eos> But now jody--<eos> She is soaking them all in And concentrating them into killer beams.
Look at these names...<eos> Did they give you the little cards to send out?<eos> Yeah, that's it! They're like a bad Valentine's card.<eos> "I love you so much it hurts...when I urinate."<eos> Yeah, I'm not sending the cards, I'm calling them.
Stay here in... in this?<eos> I can't believe you brought me here.<eos> I'll tell you where I'm gonna go... home, with my husband.<eos> Frank has two daughters.<eos> You think he's just gonna walk out on them?
Was this deliberate or an accident?<eos> Kind of both.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> I-it's not like I ever wanted to commit suicide.<eos> I took them in front of someone.
What's your point?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm just curious.<eos> Keep it that way.<eos> My point is guarded people keep things to themselves. Very few people truly get to know them.
I see how powerful you are.<eos> Do you?<eos> Now he's got the gun on Rollins.<eos> Where are the students?<eos> He moved them off camera.
Well, okay, I'll call Aubrey and see if we can get a team of divers to search for them.<eos> What-What was that noise, Dr. Hodgins? Oh, just confirming our data.<eos> You can never be too thorough.<eos> The divers found the arms under the bridge tied to the weight.<eos> The water kept them in good shape.
No.<eos> It's... it's the size.<eos> While I'm waiting for the arms to be cleaned, I reexamined the ribs.<eos> I found remodeled microfractures on the sternal rib ends bilaterally on ribs eight and six, and two additional fractures on the fourth rib on the right side.<eos> What caused them?
But it's just fish and ocean down there. Yeah!<eos> And I'm fine with that.<eos> I know how awesome I am.<eos> But see, Cleo's a thinker.<eos> She's clever and she has layers and thinks everyone should have them.
Well, why don't you mosey on over to the cantina and strap on a feed bag and get some fresh jitter juice in you?<eos> Yeah, I think we'll do that.<eos> Yeah, just as soon as we get on some fresh union suits.<eos> You found our victim's suitcases?<eos> Yes, sir... our BOLO got a hit on the homeless guy who took them from the subway.
Those really are a thing of beauty.<eos> Unfortunately, I shipped them all out yesterday.<eos> Plus, I can't take all the credit.<eos> Original specs came from HYDRA technology way back when.<eos> - Whitehall gave them to you?
Let's think. - Okay.<eos> Anything else we can't do when Jess is here.<eos> Look at that stretching.<eos> I don't want to... make this sound too creepy, but I want to own those girls.<eos> I wouldn't touch them. They'd want for nothing.
Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Can I, um... talk to you about last night?<eos> No, I want to talk to you about last night, because I said some things, um, that don't reflect how I really feel about you.<eos> Um... so I'd really appreciate it if you could strike them from the record.
Wonder what's taking, uh, Jess so long.<eos> Well, you know women.<eos> What's women?<eos> Am I right? "What's women?"<eos> I just don't know them like you know them, is my point. Uh-huh.
Yes, you did.<eos> Right over there.<eos> - Every time.<eos> - Yes, every time.<eos> I forgot them on the day of our first win, and it's worked ever since.
I cannot.<eos> Oh, the winter wind can blow me colder<eos> Oh, the summer's heat can parch me dry<eos> But I'll love these dark, dark hills forever<eos> And I won't leave them until I die
Then two more.<eos> What did you do?<eos> We didn't know they had children.<eos> Donald said the girls saw his face, so he had to kill 'em.<eos> I tucked them back into their sleeping bags, while he went out to take care of the husband.
People just give us their best food and wine, and ask nothing in return.<eos> I love being a queen.<eos> What are you telling these people?<eos> It's all right, they're like us.<eos> And I promised that we would take them to Amiens.
Where'd you find them?<eos> Well, I...<eos> Axl: Brick, don't answer that!<eos> For the love of God, dad, stop asking him questions.<eos> I just mean... the point is you got them back, so, uh, who cares about anything else, right?
Aw, Mom.<eos> We now return to My Dinner with Andre the Giant.<eos> I could never give up my electric blanket; it's cold in New York City.<eos> You may argue that this is a waste of energy, but to me, it's worth the comfort because, let's face it, the world is an abrasive place.<eos> I have maybe hours to live, and you're wasting them.
I think that's what's best.<eos> The fort of San Cristobal ... held off the Dutch, the English, the Americans.<eos> But apparently, not the aliens.<eos> Looks like your buddy Diego drew those plans.<eos> He got them from the city archives.
The narrow quarters reduce Hydra's numerical advantage.<eos> Sounds perfect.<eos> Other than the fact that Hydra's drill will be all the way down in the basement.<eos> - What about the comms?<eos> - Hydra scans for them.
I ran the numbers.<eos> No recent activity.<eos> Did we ever find those cards?<eos> No, not in his hospital locker, or in his apartment, or on his body.<eos> Hmm, maybe the killer took them.
- Hang a right at the next block.<eos> We can cut them off on seventh.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - I know these streets better than you.<eos> I built some of them.
Nuktuk, I mean, bolin, There's only one thing for you to do If you want to save the avatar<eos> I'm not really sure if I like "fearsome."<eos> I mean, evil squared might be better.<eos> Whatever. You have to assemble the fightingest airbender army Of all time!<eos> But it turns out the airbender recruits are a sorry lot, So bolin brings them to a secret mountaintop training facility Where he teaches them the ancient art of dodging fruit
Kanan...<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> Hera.<eos> Look.<eos> There were more crates, but someone's dragged them away.
- No.<eos> - Well, who else knows about this place?<eos> - Not sure.<eos> This base was abandoned years ago, after the Clone Wars.<eos> Besides, why drag them?
Several times, yes. I would walk in to find a rock lying on the floor...<eos> - Bill.<eos> - And shards of glass everywhere.<eos> Did you pay someone to fix your windows, or did you do it yourself?<eos> Of course I didn't fix them.
- Believe what you want.<eos> - And you could see how to gain entry into his house!<eos> - I did not throw rocks - through George's window!<eos> Mr. O'Hara, did you wear gloves when you threw the rocks through the window?<eos> Because Mr. George saved the rocks, and we're having them printed right now.
I told my wife that I wanted to quit.<eos> Finally, in 1961, I guess that's when ... I guess they were on the verge of just closing it all down.<eos> Believe it or not, some of our favorite heroes and their beloved alter egos may have never existed had it not been for the creativity and boldness of Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Stan Lee.<eos> Stan had been in the business for 20-some-odd years, and he was looking to get out.<eos> Sanderson: Stan himself says he was embarrassed to tell people, when he met them, that he was working in comics.
You know who said that?<eos> Joe Biden.<eos> I don't think he said that.<eos> He has said those words.<eos> Maybe not in that order, but he has said them.
Parental gin and tonics at 11:00, followed by ritualistic screaming and yelling at 11:30, and tearful apologies by halftime.<eos> I think I'm just gonna stay put and whip up a batch of my chards for the potluck.<eos> Chards-- as in greens?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Brody clan serves them as an appetizer.
"Lion with wings"... where's the problem?<eos> That's not misfit. That's just awesome.<eos> Guys...<eos> If he were a real lion with wings, he wouldn't hang out at the north pole.<eos> He'd be flying around Africa, picking up gazelles and eating them.
There better be some left.<eos> No, it's just...<eos> Christmas is so overwhelming.<eos> What is the point of it all?<eos> I get the ladder, I climb up, I drag down all the decorations, I put them out everywhere.
No, it's just...<eos> Christmas is so overwhelming.<eos> What is the point of it all?<eos> I get the ladder, I climb up, I drag down all the decorations, I put them out everywhere.<eos> Week or two later, pack them up, lug them back up the ladder, put them away again.
Doc's still... working on the body, but he did send these over.<eos> The stab wounds in the suit line up perfectly with the stab wounds in Kern's back.<eos> So clearly he was wearing this when he was attacked.<eos> Do we know why he was wearing it?<eos> Yeah, I found some similar suits online and a site dedicated to those who wear them.
Check it out.<eos> Jason had access to Shelly's account.<eos> He was the one writing those reviews.<eos> This just took a turn.<eos> He took them without her knowledge.
Hunt?<eos> Uh, anyone?<eos> Fetal surgery is a new field.<eos> The few of us who are practicing it are basically inventing it as we go along.<eos> The things I know, the things I scribble down in the margins, no one has them.
Okay, first off, Mom, I'm wearing gloves.<eos> Deeks, people died here.<eos> Not from this food.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> If you have to know-- they're mine, and I got them in a vending machine.
Whoever he is, he's not in our system.<eos> Other than the fake passport, There's no paper trail to follow on colin cavendish.<eos> What did you get off the body?<eos> We found small flakes of gold in the neck wound.<eos> We've sent them for a metallurgy test.
You're the completely inexperienced girl who fucked our new conductor in order to worm her way into the oboe section past hundreds of far more qualified musicians.<eos> I did not sleep with the conductor.<eos> Oh, darling, please.<eos> I had tits once.<eos> I just didn't play my oboe with them.
I like to improvise.<eos> I always think I like to do things as though I'm... I'm playing jazz.<eos> Try this, try that.<eos> Okay, the sneakers from Home Shopping.<eos> I design them and I sell them.
Hunter:<eos> Where you been? I have searched high and low, but no condoms.<eos> No problem. Turns out S.T.I.s are on the rise in the geriatric ward.<eos> They have a huge container of them at the nurses' station.<eos> They're basically giving them away like mints at a Chinese restaurant.
Sounds like he was a good resource.<eos> He showed you where the mailboxes were, right?<eos> Yeah, but he also told us how he brought down a snail-smuggling ring.<eos> For an hour.<eos> Yeah, he showed us all these pictures of the snails, and he called them "the littlest victims."
And it was here... In the sacred place where the women went to bleed during the full moon, that I came to know the secrets and wisdom and love of my mothers.<eos> Four half-sisters born of the same father... a cruel and stingy man named Laban, who cursed the gods for only giving him daughters.<eos> His oldest, my mother, Leah, was strong and capable and splendidly arrogant.<eos> My aunt, Rachel, possessed a beauty as powerful as it was unearthly, and she wielded it like a sword.<eos> My aunts, Zilpah and Bilhah, were Laban's daughters by a slave-wife, and were given to Jacob as part of Leah and Rachel's dowries, although he never treated them as lesser wives.
Goodbye, mother. Mm.<eos> While Reuben and Jacob left us to petition the king for some land, I helped Werenro, my grandmother's slave.<eos> This way.<eos> These things you seek, they are not far.<eos> You must endure, and I promise you will find them.
Did I take you then and there? No.<eos> I went to your father and agreed to his terms before I could marry you.<eos> Believe me... the waiting was agony, but I did it, out of respect for him, and for you.<eos> And because it was your custom.<eos> But if you'd been from a different tribe, with your own traditions, I would've honored them.
Sure.<eos> - I've never thought about that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I don't think about those things.<eos> I actually find them quite idiotic.
Charlie and The Revenge of the Hot Nerd.<eos> Monica, this is incredible.<eos> I'm watching the Bengals game live, the picture's amazing, there's no lag, and...<eos> I'm stealing all these games, aren't I?<eos> Well, technically you're just borrowing them from a kid who paid for them in Cuba.
As soon as they're done digging, we'll bring in a car jack.<eos> Car jack's a brute tool.<eos> We need something sensitive enough to exert the exact amount of force required.<eos> The rocks are so unstable.<eos> We disturb them too much, one will collapse after the other, like dominoes.
You're bringing down the party.<eos> - Can I get something strong?<eos> - Beat it, sea world.<eos> - Oh, connie, are you putting up More cameras in my cabin?<eos> - No, I'm taking them down.
- Can I get something strong?<eos> - Beat it, sea world.<eos> - Oh, connie, are you putting up More cameras in my cabin?<eos> - No, I'm taking them down.<eos> I'm putting them up in amber's cabin. Sorry, ethel.

I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN TO ATLANTA. OR MILWAUKEE.<eos> THIS IS CRAZY.<eos> - AND YOU CAN PROVE THAT?<eos> - HOW DO I PROVE I WAS NEVER IN A CITY I WAS NEVER IN?<eos> AND I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THESE GIRLS. NEVER SEEN THEM.
I mean, I have to, right?<eos> You don't have to.<eos> You do.<eos> I think there's still some eggs in the fridge if you're hungry.<eos> There is. I bought them.
I never knew I could cook one of these<eos> Pete, what did I tell you about stopping over uninvited?<eos> No, it's okay. I invited him.<eos> He just wanted to say thank you for renting out your apartment to him.<eos> (Peter) Dude, I already feel like more of an adult. Today I went out and bought curtains, and I closed them before I... See?
Now.<eos> Right thumbprint.<eos> Five minutes, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Comenzamos en cinco minutos, señoras y señores.<eos> We agreed on new guidelines for U.S. oil companies sharing drilling rights, and he's not saying one way or another on free elections, - which means he's not ruling them out.
He's 110-years-old.<eos> There's loads of old photos and stuff from India in his house.<eos> Now, English families during the Raj, they all employed a local woman to look after their children.<eos> Then sailing back here from India, when they docked, the nannies were all laid off.<eos> Left in London, to wait for another job to take them home.
Mindy! - Hey, Jessica.<eos> I heard you cleared out your entryway, and you found $5,000 in uncashed paychecks.<eos> Very cool.<eos> - Yeah, it was hell. But my therapist says,<eos> "you do not need 12 broken printers, and you're not gonna give them to your kids someday."
Anger Management 2x81 Charlie The Terrible, Horrible, No Good Very Bad Thanksgiving<eos> - Happy Thanksgiving.<eos> - Happy Thanksgiving.<eos> I made maple-glazed sweet potatoes.<eos> My friend Sarah described them as "yumazing."
I can't believe what a bitch she is.<eos> The toxic energy of hating Topaz is really very bad for you, Viva.<eos> She's so much more evil than I realised.<eos> I really wanted hair extensions, Viva.<eos> I've wanted them all my life.
Well, Detective Rosa Diaz has left.<eos> Hmm.<eos> The only food left in the whole room is your stupid herring.<eos> Oh, so we're talking now?<eos> Well, I guess so, since words came out of my mouth and you heard them.
Look at all these boxes of shoes.<eos> It's like Christmas or any other day when I buy myself a lot of shoes.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> I'm trying them on.<eos> Yes, they're beautiful, but I also designed them to be uncomfortable.
Operates out of greater New York.<eos> He lost his left eye in a shoot-out with a rival a few years ago.<eos> The height and weight are both right.<eos> Given everything you've uncovered about the officer that was killed, I got to think he's your guy.<eos> Buros acquires guns in the States, then sells them to the Zeta cartel in Mexico.
We know a very large stash of his weapons was seized less than a month ago.<eos> What if he'd already made arrangements to transport them?<eos> Furthermore, what if his customers were not the kind of people to be kept waiting?<eos> A drug cartel in Veracruz, for example.<eos> He's left fibers at two separate crime scenes. He's practically shedding them.
He's left fibers at two separate crime scenes. He's practically shedding them.<eos> I submit he's been working furiously to create hidey-holes for the NYPD's guns.<eos> He's been carving up cushions before he even committed the robbery.<eos> Maybe that's because the weapon's mode of transportation has a very strict departure time.<eos> Well, he can't be sending them in small planes, obviously. Not if he's hiding them in sofas.
We pinged it to get your location.<eos> Cuffs are too tight, man.<eos> You noticed. Good.<eos> They belonged to Casey Hatem, the cop you murdered in Queens the other night.<eos> Get used to them; you're gonna be wearing them a lot.
As leader, I had no choice, and believe me, it's a responsibility that...<eos> It unsettles me but I've got to leave a man in the field.<eos> Now, that is a bit of a worry, to be honest, because the Porsche 928 was notorious for having very complicated electrics, and for having a lot of electrical gremlins once it got beyond a certain age.<eos> Yeah, Jeremy's chances of fixing that car?<eos> He did once wire his own speakers, in the sense that he plugged them in at the back of stereo, at home, you know, when you get the little plugs, left and right.
I'm just... I'm in a foul mood.<eos> If we don't get a last-minute reprieve, we're on the street.<eos> Which is ironic, considering that's where most of our patients live.<eos> Okay, there must be other options for us.<eos> I've exhausted most of them.
But about Cha Yoon Hee. Is she related to this case?<eos> No.<eos> Just leave Yoon Hee alone.<eos> Where are Cha Yoon Hee's things?<eos> You took them with you.
This... Why do you have my wedding ring?<eos> I left it at the pawn shop.<eos> I got them back.<eos> You said wedding rings are important to you.<eos> I thought you'd cry if someone else bought them.
During the copying process, something very important can happen.<eos> Sometimes, mistakes creep in.<eos> They're called mutations.<eos> Let's have a look at these two bases here.<eos> The two prongs that hold them together are subatomic particles. They're protons.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.<eos> Sure, but he had to die in the first place.<eos> There's not a planet in our solar system that could sustain life... and the nearest star's over a thousand years away.<eos> That doesn't even qualify as futile.<eos> Where'd you send them?
We're...<eos> We're here.<eos> So the lost communications came through.<eos> - How?<eos> - The relay on this side cached them.
Do you remember those?<eos> - In the department store?<eos> - Yeah, and that's when I first heard. The Four Freshmen and immediately my mind just...<eos> - I mean, it's... - Like magic.<eos> Something happened and... so I listened to those harmonies and study them after school, and I would teach them to my brothers.
- Yeah, and that's when I first heard. The Four Freshmen and immediately my mind just...<eos> - I mean, it's... - Like magic.<eos> Something happened and... so I listened to those harmonies and study them after school, and I would teach them to my brothers.<eos> And we'd all sing.<eos> And then I would teach them to my parents and we'd all be sitting around singing. My brothers and my parents and everybody.
- What's this?<eos> - It's a map.<eos> Russia and Mongolia.<eos> Just, I want you to go there one day and write something.<eos> Anyway, I found them exceedingly special.
Russia and Mongolia.<eos> Just, I want you to go there one day and write something.<eos> Anyway, I found them exceedingly special.<eos> I found them uniquely you.<eos> I found them... most like you.
What's so special about these swords?<eos> What do they do?<eos> It depends.<eos> On what?<eos> Who uses them.
POLICEMAN 1:<eos> - Sir.<eos> Show me where those girls...<eos> They in the woods?<eos> You put them in the woods?
Come over here to this counter. Come on.<eos> Top drawer.<eos> Open it.<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Put them on.
What's the lesson to be learned here?<eos> Never trust a Vulcan.<eos> Now, see, you can't even answer the question.<eos> You lied. On an official report, you lied.<eos> You think the rules don't apply to you 'cause you disagree with them.
And now, now we feast!<eos> That's a lot of witches.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go down around the other side.<eos> Push them into the middle, get them away from the kids.
Thanks, honey.<eos> - Got the arrows?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Remember the arrows?<eos> Yeah, yeah, Eddie, we got them!
Well, isn't it scary, or doesn't it worry you to have all these items right in your home?<eos> That's why we have a priest that comes by once a month to bless the room.<eos> Well, the way I see it is: It's safer for these things to be in here than out there.<eos> It's kind of like keeping guns off the street.<eos> Why not just throw them in an incinerator? Destroy them.
Good.<eos> What's in the bottle?<eos> Holy water.<eos> Presence of religious icons will get a reaction from anything unholy.<eos> Sort of pisses them off.
So you can see them?<eos> Well, shouldn't you both be shocked or something?<eos> I think if I saw someone with horns, I'd piss down my leg.<eos> Well, they're kinda hard to remember.<eos> I mean, every time I look away from you for a second... I kinda forget that you even have them.
Wait, what?<eos> The horns.<eos> These horns.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Wait, can't you see them?
What the hell makes you say that?<eos> Well, you know, ever since we were kids I kind of assumed you maybe had to act so tough 'cause you were ashamed of yourself?<eos> Was I right?<eos> When I was a kid, I used to shoplift gay porno mags from the drug store.<eos> And my dad found them under my bed and he cracked me with his belt.
Whoa.<eos> All right.<eos> How'd you know all of these guns were gonna be here?<eos> It's a Chechen hangout.<eos> Owner doesn't like guns in the club, so these bozos leave them in their cars.
- Is it so? I thought it should be night.<eos> Not much past 4:00.<eos> When I am sad, the hours seem long.<eos> What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?<eos> I lack the thing which, if I had it, would make them short.
And so I asked him, you know, "Do you have any last requests?"<eos> And he looked me right in the eye, and he asked me if I could hold him.<eos> That's what he said to me.<eos> He goes, "Can you hold me?"<eos> I had both my legs then, and I used them to kick the shit out of him.
Hands in the air, Spring Roll.<eos> Empty the register and don't do anything stupid.<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey, where are your security cameras?<eos> - We don't have them.
Marcus, I know I made you a promise, but I can't keep being someone I'm not.<eos> When I see evil, I have to stop it.<eos> Mindy, what you did to those girls at school was unacceptable.<eos> - You could have really hurt them.<eos> - You're right, I could have, but instead I sent them home with tummy-aches.
A lot.<eos> Then I am surprised she published it, Adriana hated me, wanted him all for herself, did not even want to share him with her father.<eos> You know what happened to him?<eos> A few months before the Revolution he went to Amadeu and asked for stronger painkillers for his back.<eos> Adriana came every week to the pharmacy for the pills, but he never took them; he ordered them.
No more relevant questions, I'll bid you all a good morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Tough questions.<eos> - I've heard worse.<eos> - You ducked them like a pro.
Thank you so much, Mr. Washington.<eos> Good luck.<eos> It's not your fault, John.<eos> This person... they lied about everything.<eos> But just because the lies are shocking and they attract a lot of attention... it doesn't necessarily make them true.
Thank you.<eos> So how do you feel about guns?<eos> How do you feel about them?<eos> I can take them or leave them.<eos> Yeah, but if you leave them and somebody pulls one on you, well, there you are...
Yeah. But one condition, I ain't hooking no more.<eos> Long as I get the money, I don't care.<eos> Now listen, no fucking drugs.<eos> I want a clean house.<eos> I hear anything like that going on with them...
I offered to open up a formal dialogue, with Buck house.<eos> I begged you to give me a preview so we could build some firewall before the shelling began.<eos> You keep telling me everything's going to be alright.<eos> But it's not alright, it's all wrong.<eos> I've been trying to reopen doors and you've shut them.
"Dear Theodore Twombly..."<eos> Actually, I sent it from you.<eos> "Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters.<eos> Twice, actually.<eos> I was so moved by them, I shared them with my wife when I got home.
You getting a contact high?<eos> You gonna be all seizuring out on me?<eos> I don't get seizures.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> What do you call them again?
- You're deader than death!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey! - You're gonna wish you were dead.<eos> I saw your dad leave this morning.<eos> I'll tear your guts out and feed them to the rats.
Amazing!<eos> Well done.<eos> The vertical position of a sphere.<eos> I've brought you the valuations of the furniture and paintings.<eos> Cast your eye over them carefully, because you'll have to authorise them.
Blue.<eos> They are on a blue key-ring.<eos> And your mind starts to think about the last time you remember them.<eos> I'm trying to walk and they're in my pocket.<eos> And I want you to picture them in your pocket exactly as they were before you lifted them out andyouplacedthemsomewhere.
St. Pancras please.<eos> You must think I'm stalking you.<eos> No, I just think you've put yourself under a lot of pressure.<eos> To be honest, I'm not here to look for my keys.<eos> I found them, thank you.
And so you wouldn't be wrong Bein' free with me<eos> On my own<eos> And I held my own<eos> Still I rattled your bones<eos> I said some awful things and I take them back
Yeah, its no wonder in the history of Miss America pagent Miss Montana's never won. It's, like, the worst selection ever!<eos> Every night in his sitting room father took off his boots and muttered some cryptic statement after raising a glass of whiskey up to his lips precisely every 45 seconds.<eos> You can't get horseshit from a cricket.<eos> Crickets and insects, were my mother's specialty.<eos> Dr. Claire had spent most of her adult life studying tiny creatures with a magnifying glass, and then classifying them into species and subspecies.
But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.<eos> "Born of eternal night<eos> "the Dark Elves come to steal away the light."<eos> I know these stories.<eos> Mother told them to us as children.
How many countries actually have nuclear weapons?<eos> Nine.<eos> Which, I think, begins to point-out the fundamental flaw in the concern.<eos> We won't get rid of nuclear weapons by forgetting how to make them.<eos> We will get rid of nuclear weapons by deciding we don't want them around anymore.
Mendez is many things, but merciful is not one of them.<eos> He'll skin you alive for laying your hands on me.<eos> I'm his cereza, his virgin.<eos> Mendez isn't who you think he is.<eos> The terrible things he did, he did them for the greater good.
Firearms?<eos> Firearms!<eos> That's the one I was secretly hoping for.<eos> I'm okay with most kinds of violence, but not gang violence.<eos> Before we deliver these weapons, we're going to disable them so they can never be used.
They generally broadcast artificially generated voices reading streams of numbers, words, letters, backwards music, or cryptic electronic code.<eos> They're in a wide variety of languages, and the voices are usually female for some reason.<eos> Sometimes it sounds like a child.<eos> And how long have you been hearing them for?<eos> Well, the shortwave community's been finding them for decades now.
I want to maybe talk to people that he knew on campus.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Hey, Professor.<eos> I pulled those boxes we were talking about.<eos> Just let me know where you want them. Okay.
You're a merchant.<eos> You're business is prosperous.<eos> For you, life is sweet.<eos> What effort did you make to obtain justice?<eos> I see that your heart is rancorous. That you're dragging all these people into a war that doesn't concern them.
Halle...<eos> I can't, I can't, I can't do this!<eos> No, no. I can't...<eos> I can't remember any of my lines.<eos> Just say them the way we rehearsed them last week and you'll be terrific.
-No, neither would any good husband.<eos> Tie her down.<eos> She mustn't scratch the boils.<eos> They must burst by themselves.<eos> Why can't we just cut them out?
What's happening up there at paradise?<eos> Who are those old lezzos, eh? Who knows them?<eos> Oh, they're an odd bunch, aren't they, eh?<eos> Oh, yeah, see?<eos> You do know them, eh?
Okay.<eos> All right, just... just give me a second.<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> All right, give him the keys, Taylor.<eos> I don't know where I put them.
The footprints are not hers.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - My dog ​​tag.<eos> - You're no dog<eos> - Soldiers have them.
No wonder she went crazy.<eos> But how did you know?<eos> She was long gone.<eos> When I was at school, she sent me letters.<eos> I still got them.
But now I can spend two hours in brutal heat with a cup of this cold, refreshing lemonade and just pour it in the dirt.<eos> Ah, come on, Daniels!<eos> You ran Bear Stearns, for God's sake!<eos> I was like this. Just like this.<eos> Then I went to the desert to seek answers, and now I have them.
First, George Sr. sweated out his acolytes' defenses...<eos> Ah, come on, Daniels!<eos> You ran Bear Stearns, for God's sake!<eos> I was like this.<eos> Then I went to the desert to seek answers, and now I have them.
Uh, not so good.<eos> I've been keeping the bees in my apartment.<eos> I was using my magic smoke on them.<eos> And my bees are dropping like flies, and I need them to fly like bees.<eos> And so I've got them out at a bee hospital, which is not cheap, which is another reason
What the fuck?<eos> Get in.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Where'd you get the keys?<eos> I got them on the way out.
But I went to Indian Hills to learn and be with my peers... but I was always self-conscious that I wasn't, you know, as good-looking as other people.<eos> And now you're a star.<eos> Yeah-On my Facebook page recently...<eos> I had over 800 friend requests.<eos> I accepted them all. I mean, I didn't even look at them.
You could do better.<eos> You actually work with these humans every day, and you never even thought about eating one of them?<eos> Not even this fat one? !<eos> Ah...!<eos> You break my cover, then I will rip your balls off and sell them to a certain butcher we know.
- I mean, I'm a Christian, but I've learned to not believe those things we're told in those old books.<eos> You have to read between the lines and decipher, because, in reality, hell is here.<eos> This world that we walk around in, that we live in every day, is hell.<eos> We have invisible flames around us.<eos> You can't see them, but we all have invisible flames around us.
- I'm not stealing it, you asshole.<eos> This is my car.<eos> - What?<eos> - You probably don't understand this because you're a criminal.<eos> Things in this world belong to people before people like you take them.
Unless you want to drown in your own blood.<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> That was poor planning.<eos> My sister carries the weapons.<eos> I'm better with them.
Since we are right by the exit sign, I step on the gas from 50, the urban speed limit, to 110, the freeway speed limit.<eos> It would have been ideal for him if I hadn't accelerated. But it doesn't say anywhere that I'm not allowed to.<eos> So he had no other chance but to accelerate even more.<eos> I only went up to 110, and I saw the children.<eos> He was doing at least 140 and did not see them. And here's where the impact took place.
Sta)'-<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> But what about these beers, man?<eos> If we don't drink them, they'll be onto us, and I'm not sure I'm ready for beer yet.<eos> Wait, let's just dump them when no one's looking, then act like we're drunk.
Come on, Counselor.<eos> Hundreds of girls, thousands, most likely.<eos> Follow the money.<eos> If you have so much cash that you're insulating your house with ii, and you've bought all the clothes, and the cars, and the guns you can find a place to put, and you're morally depraved beyond all human recognition, what then do you do with your money?<eos> Why do they kill them?
Not allowed to ask questions.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Tonight it's my game show.<eos> Okay?<eos> I know you know the rules. But I've changed them.
- How much longer to the ruins?<eos> Oh, they were closed.<eos> - Yeah. - We...<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're gonna catch them on the way back when we're going to the airport.
Balzac wrote a book before breakfast, so, what am I doing?<eos> - Women don't think that way as much. - You don't think so?<eos> No.<eos> We have much less to compare ourselves to maybe.<eos> Women who achieve anything, first time you hear about them, they're in their 50s.
Don't give me this put upon housewife bullshit. Okay?<eos> This is not the '50s.<eos> Sorry to ruin your perfect little narrative of oppression with the truth... But I am the one who's at home dealing with the bullshit.<eos> - You're at work until 6:30. - Six o'clock.<eos> You take the girls to school, I pick them up. That's fair.
The summer when I was about ten, one of the older boys who I depended on to kind of be a protector, his name was Michael Schwerner.<eos> In the summer of '64, I learned that Mickey had been in Mississippi registering voters.<eos> And he and two other people who had been with him registering voters were... were tortured and murdered.<eos> And when I heard that my protector had been murdered by the real bullies... I think it changed my life.<eos> I had to protect people from the bullies, the people who would beat them up economically or the people who would subject them and their families to real harm.
Start with your heel, roll to your toe.<eos> - Keep Da Vinci's counsel, but enhance it.<eos> There.<eos> What is it?<eos> They don't like their graves being violated, so they cover them in sand and letters to alert them of mischief.
Making this mutinous attack by local police force that much more troubling.<eos> Hi, Eric.<eos> It's Melissa again.<eos> Look, I know this is hard, but we're really trying to get the rest of this stuff sorted out and it would be a really big help if you could come pick up your things, soon.<eos> I mean if you don't want them, I can get rid of them, but...
Go!<eos> Out with it.<eos> You have the look of having eaten something distasteful.<eos> If we can speak freely anywhere, it's here in our family chapel.<eos> The Vatican often appears to know our strategies just as we employ them.
Man, you know I doubled back around to that bowl of licorice pastels.<eos> And when I returned, guess who was suspiciously gone.<eos> Man, you know, I, too, crave those licorice pastels. And I doubled back after you doubled back.<eos> Liar.<eos> I ate them all, sucker.
Man, you know, I, too, crave those licorice pastels. And I doubled back after you doubled back.<eos> Liar.<eos> I ate them all, sucker.<eos> Liar!<eos> You ate all of them but the black ones.
- Cos I invited you completely out of the blue.<eos> Well, I heard there were some good photos of me here.<eos> We don't actually know that yet - how good the photographs are.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Because I haven't developed them.
Listen, I've packed all your things, OK?<eos> We gotta get back home and get things rolling.<eos> OK?<eos> We can do this without Max.<eos> Get you writing songs again, and if you don't feel like it, we can get somebody to write them for you.
Good.<eos> Adrian? Is there something you'd like to say to Flora?<eos> I'm sorry that I allowed myself to be seduced.<eos> Repeatedly.<eos> Obviously, from this moment forward, when I ask you to do the windows, you will do them.
Stop, quiet.<eos> Listen, just please do not disperse the underwear bitches when I am in my room, ok?<eos> That's where they reset.<eos> They died there.<eos> Aidan killed them in the house?
Proud of you.<eos> (Laughs) No, no, I am.<eos> When we first met, I wasn't sure we'd get here.<eos> To be fair, the ladies weren't exactly swarming me back then.<eos> Yeah, well, you wouldn't let them.
Land in the Argentine.<eos> Slaughters his beef there.<eos> Refrigerates it to board his reefer ship. Ships it for sale - New York, the Continent, London.<eos> And once he got here, the way he liked to operate - he placed these personals, like the ones used by our missing girls.<eos> He responded to them also, met these girls, charmed them, drugged them took them off the streets.
House them in cargo cans for their shipping to South America.<eos> And... Well, there my knowledge finds its limit.<eos> There is much lies beyond those limits, Inspector.<eos> For one thing, where it is you imprison your cargo before its journey?<eos> For another, who it is keeps watch on them there?
OK, buddy. Let's do it.<eos> Offside!<eos> Offside!<eos> Now you see this?<eos> We're going to turn all those pieces of fabric into one of these nice bags, and then we're going to take it down to market, and we're gonna sell them for lots of money.
- And what about your unfinished business?<eos> - Oh, that's all sorted.<eos> Something about library books.<eos> No, I've had loads of doors appear.<eos> - I just turn them down.
Shawn, when we were thrown out of here, what part of "banned for life" did you misinterpret?<eos> I accept the fact that Shawn Spencer has been banned for life, however...<eos> Soupcan Sam has no such restrictions.<eos> No, no, no, Shawn.<eos> Not only do these people have guns, they hand them out to other people who hate you for ruining their "Rules and Regulations" sign.
- Thank you again.<eos> - Adios. Jeez, what's the rush?<eos> - Is that-- - Shh, shh.<eos> The stolen engraving plates.<eos> I came across them when I was looking for the bathroom.
- Adios. Jeez, what's the rush?<eos> - Is that-- - Shh, shh.<eos> The stolen engraving plates.<eos> I came across them when I was looking for the bathroom.<eos> Lamas didn't know that Pablo already had them.
Lamas didn't know that Pablo already had them.<eos> Wait, wait, you stole the engraving plates from Pablo Nunez?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> At first I was afraid to take them, but then I said, "What would Henry do in this situation?"<eos> So, I did it, I took them.
Look, this is not just some skip we're bagging.<eos> You know what happens when we deliver a mark, Acacia.<eos> Mmhmm... We get paid. I buy things.<eos> It's what we do, Tamz.<eos> We find people and we bring them in.
The soul is a treasure, the god within us.<eos> I'm going to give you a present.<eos> See these three medals?<eos> They think they're separate.<eos> Melt them down in an oven, and they will turn into a single drop.
Calm down, boy.<eos> - Look!<eos> - What is it?<eos> Medals!<eos> - Who gave them to you?
The Trewlove family heritage.<eos> The flying stars.<eos> Colonel, you asked for tea.<eos> They're so cold.<eos> Mum died in them, I don't want to wear them.
At the right price, most people will sell anything.<eos> Mr Masterson has great plans for the magazine.<eos> He'll never give you any freedom, Stanley, you realise, it will all change completely here.<eos> I'm not sure about that.<eos> If he suggests things we don't like, we won't do them.
I just popped out. Just to the all-night shop.<eos> Why?<eos> To get some headache pills.<eos> We have headache pills.<eos> Mummy keeps them up in the bathroom.
And so when he struck again he made sure that he did it right.<eos> Two professional women in their early 30s, killed in their own homes by strangulation.<eos> I mean, look, they could be sisters.<eos> The strangulation marks are different.<eos> Yes, the marks might be different but both of them have extensive petechial haemorrhages which indicates that he strangled them, released and then strangled again, over and over.
Well, that will go with the psychological rather than the physical torture.<eos> Maybe lower-paid white collar.<eos> Quasi-professional.<eos> Less qualified than these women.<eos> Perhaps he's an underachiever, or at least in his own eyes, and he selects victims that he feels inferior to and then dominates and humiliates them.
'If you are there, it is the police at the door.'<eos> 'I was hoping to speak with you 'to follow up on the incident that occurred on Friday.'<eos> 'Please ring when you get this message.' Why these women?<eos> Why professional women?<eos> What's he punishing them for?
Oh, sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> This fairytale was written by the Israeli police... based on true events. And like any fairytale... ours also begins with a wolf.<eos> The wolf is you, by the way. Our wolf is no different from the other wolves... except for his height, maybe. And like all the other wolves... he also likes to surprise little girls.<eos> But our cruel son of a bitch doesn't just swallow them.

Why?<eos> Because you talked to Thayer and...<eos> Emma?<eos> If you knew about the twins, why didn't you say anything?<eos> Because I'm protecting them.
You sure Mason has growing foods?<eos> I've got to go set up for Women and Wine. OK.<eos> Women and Wine is tonight?<eos> The men are playing poker, and Logan can go to Meredith's to be with the boys if he wants.<eos> Oh, can McKenna come watch the girls, just like, sit with them over at that, uh, Amanda's?
They did it in front of everyone!<eos> - Who?<eos> - The girls at the pool.<eos> Debs.<eos> They're pretty and boys notice them.
I, uh, trust there are no objections?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> Let's talk about the reviews.<eos> - Uh, remember I haven't read them.
We grab them by the tail and smash their heads... against the rocks.<eos> Later, we also kill animals that we don't have to.<eos> We catch a frog and nail it to a plank.<eos> We cut open its stomach.<eos> We catch butterflies and staple them on paper.
White roses, they are so beautiful!<eos> From Harry?<eos> Thank you, Fraser.<eos> Will you put them in water?<eos> I'll arrange them later.
When?<eos> After breakfast.<eos> You want the lights down so much, why don't you do it yourself?<eos> I put them up there.
Ryusei.<eos> Would you like me to teach you how to use the chopsticks?<eos> Look.<eos> Wait, watch how I do it.<eos> Move them like this.
Yeah, poor woman.<eos> My entire career, I've only delivered two stillborn babies.<eos> It's not something you ever forget.<eos> Well, do you remember another woman that gave birth to twins that day?<eos> She actually gave them up for adoption.
I appreciate the invite. I'm just... I'm gonna pass.<eos> Why are you even here, Levi?<eos> I-I don't know. I mean, me, I'm just trying to get my head straight, I'm trying to make a few changes.<eos> Why do you think you use?<eos> Because my mom died, my dad's a dick, the things I thought I should get, I didn't get them, and I'm pissed.
Comes in, but it's very rare.<eos> Well, he's the writer, right?<eos> Writes every word of the show.<eos> Sends us pages at the production office at all hours.<eos> Nobody knows where he's sending them from.
Finger to the right!<eos> Times have definitely changed.<eos> Lesbians, gays and immigrants in the army.<eos> Where are the grenades?<eos> I stuck them up my ass.
Where are the grenades?<eos> I stuck them up my ass.<eos> But that's alright- cause my dear brother has assfucked me all my life.<eos> I asked you where the grenades are!<eos> Where did you put them?
I stuck them up my ass.<eos> But that's alright- cause my dear brother has assfucked me all my life.<eos> I asked you where the grenades are!<eos> Where did you put them?<eos> Huh? I detonated them at the sandpit.
He got a couple of scratches, - but I'm sure he'll be able to pick coconuts next summer.<eos> For the last time: where's your brother?<eos> You can't fix these buildings.<eos> They're all moldy or collapsed.<eos> Let's get a loan and buy them back from the bank.

She would die that you're asking.<eos> She thinks nobody knows about us.<eos> Women have the incredible gift of being able to deny any reality.<eos> Listen, I was going to call you anyway and tell you not to read those pages.<eos> You know what, I finished them on the plane.
Please pray for him. I will.<eos> God bless you.<eos> God bless you. - Father.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's do this. Why don't we put our lists together? We'll split them up and work down.
Do you know where the spark plugs are, Lisa?<eos> The... the what?<eos> I have been trying to fix the car all morning, and I've now discovered that it's just the spark plugs.<eos> They're missing from the engine.<eos> Somebody's taken them.
Don't say that.<eos> Don't say what?<eos> No need to worry.<eos> Why not?<eos> Don't reassure people. Let them talk.
- So do moms, sometimes.<eos> Mom, please.<eos> Please, can't you babysit for me?<eos> All year long, I'm always there for you and your son Except for these two weeks...<eos> You won't take them away from me.
I know, but what's that smell?<eos> Clove?<eos> It's just beef.<eos> The applications?<eos> I didn't send them.
And at this point I can't think of anything but whatever the hell these tacos are doing to my bowels.<eos> So I make up my mind, fuck this.<eos> I've got to get off at the next stop or I'm going to lose it in my shorts in front of all these people.<eos> And exactly as I make this decision,<eos> Wesley leans his big-ass head over to me from across the aisle, and he says, really calm, I'm getting off at the next stop, and if you do too, I'm going to rip your fuckin' balls off and feed them to you.
There was no semen, there was no saliva.<eos> Elise Nichols died a virgin. - She stayed that way.<eos> - That's not how he's loving them. He wouldn't disrespect them that way!<eos> He doesn't want these girls to suffer.<eos> He kills them quickly and to his thinking, with mercy.
Somebody from the Baltimore PD must've taken a picture with their phone and sold it - to Tattlecrime.<eos> - The photo was taken before the blood was put on ice.<eos> Dr. Gideon was still here.<eos> He has Freddie Lounds.<eos> You might be working out the emergency exits, or at least considering them.
Glue, butter...<eos> He sold the pelts on ebay or in town.<eos> He made pillows.<eos> No parts went to waste. Otherwise it was murder.<eos> He was feeding them to us. Wasn't he?
I dream more now than I used to.<eos> Your dreams were the one place you could be physically safe, relinquishing control, not anymore.<eos> I thought about zipping myself up into a sleeping bag before I go to sleep but...<eos> Have you determined how this angel maker is choosing his victims?<eos> He doesn't see people how everyone else sees them. He can tell if you're naughty or nice, or he thinks he can.
He's outside, giving a statement.<eos> Right, Laura.<eos> What time did you last see your daughters?<eos> Oh... about ten to five.<eos> I called up to them before I went out into the garden.
OK.<eos> With wrong-sized feet.<eos> Christ!<eos> What did she say?<eos> Laura, I need your permission to keep track of all your phone calls, mobile and land line, just in case one of your daughters or whoever's holding them tries to make contact. Typical.
There'll be a service, family only, but I've arranged for you guys to have some time after my parents leave.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's something else.<eos> The things we put in the casket with Ali, they're still missing.<eos> The state police think whoever opened the grave is keeping them as some kind of sick souvenirs.
You and your friend were in danger.<eos> Are you there now?<eos> Good.<eos> Hey. The plants have been calling out for you.<eos> I know, I heard them crying for me all the way down the hall.
Do we need your poetry?<eos> All we need is food and shelter and air and sex.<eos> The rest is optional.<eos> Words are optional.<eos> Yes, but you're using them now, aren't you?
It could be the best text by the most famous author.<eos> The solution might be to change your point of view.<eos> I don't get that.<eos> Things hide when they become familiar.<eos> But if you look at them from another angle, they might take on a new meaning.
- Did he die of heart disease?<eos> - Have you seen this place yet?<eos> - Let me show you around.<eos> Gabriel was strange... he didn't kill people who annoyed him, he didn't kill his next-door neighbour because the poodle snapped at him.<eos> He killed people because he deemed them too good for the world.
- Have you seen this place yet?<eos> - Let me show you around.<eos> Gabriel was strange... he didn't kill people who annoyed him, he didn't kill his next-door neighbour because the poodle snapped at him.<eos> He killed people because he deemed them too good for the world.<eos> He deemed them worthy to ascend...
Where's your sense of adventure now, kid?<eos> I believe it has been swallowed by my sphincter.<eos> Yours and mine both.<eos> I hate heights!<eos> I am not loving them either.
- Like stinging nettles and dock leaves.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Maybe there are antidote words.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> We're calling them "Shortcuts".
It is a bit of a surprise.<eos> We expected his frequency to be above average, but it is exactly average, to 10 decimal places.<eos> The time has come for you to learn some family history.<eos> So, why don't we tell them?<eos> Because the masses prefer not to be self-aware, which by choice, puts them on a level with all their cousins in the animal kingdom.
- Good morning, ladies.<eos> - Good morning, Mr Selfridge.<eos> Like the uniforms?<eos> Oh, yes, Mr Selfridge.<eos> Glad to hear it because I designed them myself.
♪ Main Title Theme ♪ The Crystal Method == sync, corrected by elderman ==<eos> ♪<eos> These are not in any way attractive...<eos> Look at the toenails.<eos> It's like somebody hit them with a hammer.
You did everything right.<eos> Nobody noticed.<eos> Is that why you made your sisters sick?<eos> I...<eos> I-I-I put P.C.P. in their food so that daddy would think they were using drugs and kick them out of the house.
Ducks.<eos> They're one of my favourite things, ducks.<eos> I mean, when you think about a duck, they're just so... chilled out.<eos> They're not chilled out.<eos> I've seen them fight.
Then I gave them one of his cards.<eos> This is his card?<eos> And they called that number?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then I never saw them again.
They even seemed to thrive for it.<eos> Girls who go to school see immediate benefits beyond the things they are learning.<eos> Being a student enhances their status in the community.<eos> It improves their health .<eos> It makes them safer.
Well, come on.<eos> 50% of sexual assaults in the world... are on girls under 15.<eos> 50%<eos> The risk of sexual assault is one reason... parents keep girls at home.<eos> Or, marry them off young.
No!<eos> I will not leave.<eos> We came so far to educate our girls so they can lead better lives.<eos> I will not give up now.<eos> School! What's the point if street thugs attack them?
In time, I saw that my father had been right all along.<eos> I was a fighter...brave!<eos> And words made for mighty weapons.<eos> I began writing poems.<eos> I recited them for all my schoolmates to hear.
I've been ducking her correspondence for weeks.<eos> Amanda Rosewater.<eos> You naughty girl.<eos> You haven't been responding to my letters.<eos> I haven't been ignoring them.
Irisa!<eos> Portions of McCawley's mining claims were deeded to the Irathients in perpetuity.<eos> It has since been determined by Mayor Datak Tarr that such claim is invalid, the Irathients not being the aboriginal inhabitants.<eos> A bold interpretation.<eos> This document strips Rafe McCawley of his gulanite mines and returns them to the city, who, by right of possession deeds the land to the Earth Republic.
Colonel Marsh?<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Our new mayor didn't waste any time.<eos> He seized the mines and turned them over to the Earth Republic.
Mum and Dad tried you on all sorts of pills and therapy, but still you tiptoed.<eos> Everyone knew I did that.<eos> Those special clogs.<eos> Do you remember those clogs?<eos> You wore them in the morning but after Mum dropped you off at the bus stop, you'd take them off, put them in your backpack, put on some pumps and be back on your toes by the time the coach pulled up.
Reckon he might be on to something.<eos> He's dangerous.<eos> He just wants us to be treated with respect.<eos> We killed people.<eos> We ate them.
I'm gonna try and find someone who can give me some real answers.<eos> Hank, come back here.<eos> Let's talk about this.<eos> He's not gonna stop searching for answers, Roland.<eos> What if he finds them?
But I think I might've found a guy I really like.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, hell, yeah!<eos> (Bottles rattle and clink) Which is why I came over here to give you each... (Bottle fizzes) A choice bottle of wine to say thank you.<eos> (Gasps) Then I remembered those choice bottles of wine I speak of... I stole them from that wine rack.
He saw my work as the foundation for his own crazy beliefs.<eos> What beliefs?<eos> That television wasn't just a common invention.<eos> That television was some kind of malevolent force.<eos> He took my theories and twisted them.
Still making no headway with Bobby?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm two weeks under with him, and all he wants to do is get under me. Ugh.<eos> Wait, is that what the birth control pills are for?<eos> I'm not taking them.
I've never...<eos> They're not.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I have not been down in that cellar, not for years.<eos> Well, fingerprints hang around for a long time, Joe, if nobody wipes them off.
Now, I think that's what you are and how you were able to hear what you did.<eos> Okay, right now you're making me feel more crazy, not less crazy.<eos> Yeah, I know how it sounds, but I'm telling you the truth.<eos> And if you somehow are connected to the barn, then maybe you can hear something that can help me find my friend Audrey, 'cause she must've fallen out of the barn at the same time as me, but I don't know where.<eos> After I was diagnosed, I started taking medicine, and... and it made the voices stop, and I haven't heard them since. That's okay.
Morgue.<eos> - Can I play?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Thanks to this generous donor, we've got first dibs on two prime femurs, two sweet tibias, and enough cartilage for a dozen transplants.<eos> So we harvest the bones and replace them with hockey sticks?
What did she eat?<eos> - Flies. - Ugh!<eos> Ha! Ha! Ha!<eos> Gross! Pretty fairies do not eat flies.<eos> Just grabbed them out of the air and tore 'em apart.
Uh, no.<eos> Well, you need to give them something positive.<eos> So, what have you got?<eos> To give our vocab a bit of a boost, we'll be practising some new words and phrases.<eos> Once you've copied the new phrases out, we'll be working them into a longer sentence.
I'm here to help you.<eos> Governor?<eos> Time's up.<eos> Uh, moving Toni into H3 has unsettled the women.<eos> It would unsettle them more if they knew she requested the move.
Do you want some help with that?<eos> Hey.<eos> Listen, I've decided.<eos> I'm going to take all of Raymond Chandler on the trains with me.<eos> I'll tear out the pages as I read them and throw them out the window.
I would ask you how you did it, but I know you wouldn't tell me, because I wouldn't tell you.<eos> What I will tell you is that during my time in the wilderness--<eos> - It was three days. - And nights.<eos> I endeavored to discover what perquisites you value most in this firm-- your beloved Bran bars.<eos> You're never going to have them.
Maybe.<eos> Is this my underwear?<eos> What?<eos> I found 'em under our bed, and it's not my brand.<eos> I bought them for you a year ago.
Is this my underwear?<eos> What?<eos> I found 'em under our bed, and it's not my brand.<eos> I bought them for you a year ago.<eos> Well, I've never seen them before.
I'm sure all of us can agree that we could always use another ally in the war against terrorism.<eos> Now, Travis Berta is a high value member so I expect Liber8 to make a move of some kind.<eos> Now with all due respect, I'm not sure that agent Cameron's considered all the variables in this case.<eos> I don't know, maybe she has and she's counting on them.<eos> I'd be surprised if you could find someone who understands them better, agent Gardiner... and I have a plan that will keep any of your concerns at a minimum.
We'll play.<eos> Five minutes!<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Mm, yeah.<eos> The reason I told those girls about you and Bradley is because I heard them talking about you, saying things like it was embarrassing how you just stared at Bradley all the time and how someone like her would never have
Did he explain why?<eos> He didn't offer, and I didn't ask.<eos> I just really wanted to see my dad's office again.<eos> The way he set it up, the way he left everything.<eos> My mom was so freaked out about the way he died, she took all his things and threw them away.
Bruce.<eos> Bruce Morrison.<eos> How old are your daughters, Mr. Morrison?<eos> 13 and 17.<eos> When was the last time you saw them?
No, wait.<eos> It was Monday.<eos> Sera has a study group, so it was more like 10:00.<eos> Sir, today is Wednesday.<eos> You haven't seen them since Monday?
You're right.<eos> The alter could have lost his temper, or it could have just been a horrible accident.<eos> But getting the girls out of the house was planned.<eos> He said he wanted to scare them and had a gun to do it.<eos> And then he drove them somewhere.
Warrior! - Prove it.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I can help you.<eos> Biologically speaking, young girls have a blood rite... that initiates them into adulthood, whether they are ready for it or not.
Why does everyone keep saying that?<eos> I just follow the sage words of Lucille lavinius Jeremiah Jones.<eos> Lucille and Cyrus were happily married for 62 years, and why is right in that first chapter.<eos> Instead of letting little annoyances turn to anger,<eos> Lucille turned them into positivity.
Well, that rules out vampirism. Is there any chance this guy works in the medical field?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> There are a few hesitation marks near the wound, and the hole in the artery shows a lot of bruising around it.<eos> I'd say it's amateur at best.<eos> All right, so we got an unsub who's picking his victims at random, sedates them, then bleeds them dry.
The body thinks the hand's still there.<eos> When it remembers it's not...<eos> I get a friendly reminder.<eos> What about your meds?<eos> Ah, I'm not taking them anymore.
- Then you lose a lot of money.<eos> I'm willing to double it.<eos> Go do what you do.<eos> My boys got the keys to the kingdom.<eos> I need you to get them back for me.
I went back to the original phone call.<eos> I'm willing to double it.<eos> Go do what you do.<eos> My boys down there have the keys to the kingdom.<eos> I need you to get them back for me.
Apologies, Dominus.<eos> I have prepared afternoon meal --<eos> I have appetite towards bloodier repast.<eos> Again, apologies. Yet I would also break needed words.<eos> Well, shatter them quickly, or see them to ground I once stood upon.
Despite command, my place is upon field of battle.<eos> As mine is forever by your side.<eos> The hour is upon us.<eos> I do not want to leave your arms.<eos> Nor I see you from them.
Before the Academy, I worked cleaning bathrooms in dive bars.<eos> I used to work for a crime-scene cleanup crew.<eos> Think you got me beat.<eos> Well, as much as I'd like to participate in writing your occupational resumes, I've got somewhere I got to be.<eos> Now, you want to take these handcuffs off or do you want me to pick them, like I did the last set? Sit your ass down.
- I came in early this morning.<eos> It's 6:00 AM.<eos> I'm moving back in with Lisa.<eos> I didn't really want anyone to see the bags.<eos> So would it be all right if I kept them here till the end of the day?
Thomas.<eos> Thomas?<eos> Yeah, Thomas.<eos> He's got keys from every place he's ever worked at.<eos> Sells them to any tea leaf who'll buy 'em.
My opinion isn't what matters here.<eos> It does to me.<eos> Should I do it?<eos> Well, there's a great number of things to consider, Raymond...<eos> And I'm sure you've considered them all.
Uh, this one's yours. I think I'm gonna keep it.<eos> Yeah, sure. I always loved it when you wore my shirts.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Intimate.<eos> Yeah, and... you looked really damn sexy in them.
Navid, it's no big deal, all right?<eos> It's just a little something we do for for our Cronus Society members to keep our grades up.<eos> Besides, you didn't have to use the answers if you didn't want to. Yeah, uh, :<eos> I couldn't help it.<eos> Okay, once I saw them scrolling across my phone, I couldn't get them out of my head.
I heard Mr. Draper's in there.<eos> No.<eos> - Did you get the pages?<eos> - No. Are you two rehearsing already?<eos> Call me when you see them.
Now, these wounds show signs of healing, but that one is fresh.<eos> How fresh?<eos> As early as last night.<eos> Now, these... sutures tell me that he sought medical help for this injury.<eos> Yes, I removed them, opened the wound and found these.
Dan's.<eos> We took the boat out the week before last.<eos> When we had the hot spell.<eos> It was me, Danny and Chloe, fishing about a mile offshore.<eos> We caught three sea bass, we took them back and we barbecued them.
We got the DNA evidence from New Rochelle, the blood from the burned car and, thanks to you, fingerprints.<eos> He's ours.<eos> I don't want you crossing any kind of line to do...<eos> This?<eos> Already deleted them from the network too.
- Detective.<eos> I'm emailing you the details of several lawsuits involving Logan Pierce.<eos> Plaintiffs with a history of violence, prior convictions.<eos> Uh, what exactly did you mean by "several lawsuits"?<eos> 200, but I've already prioritized them. And no, there's no need to thank me.
Everything is on there.<eos> Everything.<eos> So this is on my computer?<eos> Do I own these songs?<eos> Am I illegally downloading them?
That smell again.<eos> And the tongue's been mutilated.<eos> A Nazi Strangler?<eos> Miss, I'd be grateful if you kept your opinions to yourself.<eos> It's talk like that will make women hysterical as soon as somebody looks at them the wrong way.
My daughters are bookworms.<eos> What books do they like?<eos> I don't really know.<eos> They go to school far away from here.<eos> I don't get to see them too often.
Sea shanties?<eos> Are they drunk?<eos> They might be a bit over served.<eos> Well, that's because you over sewed them.<eos> Don't worry, I took your daddy's car keys and I put them where I put all drunks' keys. They're in my bra.
Wait, I want ushers.<eos> - Well, maybe next year.<eos> - This year.<eos> Let's give it six months.<eos> Now, I want them now.
I really want to give you a second chance, Kyle, but I have got to know what happened in Mexico. Nothing.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> Then why would they revoke your bail?<eos> When I was down there, I bought pills. All right?<eos> I didn't sell them.
Hey!<eos> Mama, what are they still doing up?<eos> I couldn't get them out of that damn fort.<eos> Mama, these pies look amazing.<eos> I baked them today with my one good arm.
Look, I like James as much as the next guy, but people are getting ganked here.<eos> Besides, Benny, Kate -- they were forced to be what they are.<eos> James chose this.<eos> Vics were all torn up pretty bad.<eos> Like someone shredded them with their bare hands. Like that could happen.
Well, we need to talk about that.<eos> I showed Dr. Kadar your photos.<eos> Those photos were locked up.<eos> You went into my desk?<eos> It's not important how I got them.
Maybe we should just cool it.<eos> Boys with money don't end up with the maid.<eos> You can't still be holding on to that.<eos> Henri made promises to me.<eos> I remember every single one of them.
You eat today?<eos> No.<eos> You want something hot?<eos> I got frozen patties from Costco.<eos> Can fry them up it'd just take a sec.
- You know what we're in for?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What's Serberus?<eos> - It's the world's biggest provider of mercenaries.<eos> Not only do they supply the arms, but they supply the men who use them.
We assumed that Bradovich and the others had abandoned it.<eos> Why didn't you file a missing persons report?<eos> They were adults. We weren't their parents.<eos> We assumed they'd run off.<eos> Besides, we have found, then and now, that the police rarely take church complaints seriously when we do file them.
Hi.<eos> Where did you get these dolls? They were a present.<eos> Mine's name is Aria.<eos> And that's Hanna, Spencer, Emily, and Mona.<eos> Who gave them to you?
Hey.<eos> You come to pay your final respects, Bum?<eos> Or does J.R. still owe you from some snoop job? I brought you a message.<eos> From J.R.<eos> Y'all want answers, and J.R. wanted you to have them.
Well, I've got to be there.<eos> I told June that I was gonna help get that music program funded.<eos> Well, we all make promises to our kids that we can't keep.<eos> You know what? I think it's kind of a good life lesson, right?<eos> We raise up their little expectations and then we just shatter them.
Not yet. No.<eos> But soon, I think.<eos> But there's nothing definite.<eos> Well, it takes time.<eos> I keep thinking about all the girls who come to this town, thinking they got talent, hoping someone will make them a star.
So you do know what's going on, don't you?<eos> - Maybe. - Well, good.<eos> Maybe you can help us stop it.<eos> Stop it?<eos> The cave brings things back it don't take them away.
- There.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You've never had visions before?<eos> - No.<eos> - I have them all the time.
It just flew away.<eos> How about those poems?<eos> Is that why you came?<eos> I don't have them here.<eos> Didn't you memorize them?
Duh, uh, I think--<eos> They think that because they are just trying to talk slowly that they're thinking all the time. That's an act.<eos> "People, when they close their eyes, their eyes travel into their body, and look around their own body."<eos> We may as well say stuff. That's how far they've gone.<eos> "When people turn 30, their arms fall off and they replace them with branches."
- And Lance--<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Keep the shiny side up, brother.<eos> You too, man.<eos> Oh, if you find more almonds, there's spiced almonds, just save them in a to-go container.
Back at you.<eos> Thanks for not letting on --<eos> Hey... Right back at you.<eos> Rules of the list, right?<eos> Never forget them.
Lieutenant McCoy, how are you feeling?<eos> My family's supposed to come in later for a visit if this works.<eos> You have two daughters, right?<eos> Nine and four.<eos> It's been so long since I've seen them.
No!<eos> No, no!<eos> That's our bedding!<eos> For fuck's sake, pack it in!<eos> Where did he put them?
Fine.<eos> He's not a suspect.<eos> What else do we have?<eos> Well, Rigsby's got Lucy's phone records.<eos> He's going through them.
Welcome to the house of pain.<eos> You're all fired!<eos> The uprising has begun.<eos> What is that ship doing in my city?<eos> I want answers and I want them now.
Door hole...<eos> Wait!<eos> I just remembered.<eos> My door-hole solution lies in one of tonight's scheduled graybles!<eos> Would you mind if I look through them to find it?
- You're worried about me?<eos> - We're worried you're not gonna make it.<eos> - To what? In general.<eos> You don't take care of yourself.<eos> I'll crumple vitamins and put them in your food.
Because you're practically an albino, and you have a belly.<eos> That's where you're wrong, Billy.<eos> Here comes '50s dad.<eos> Awesome. Women like their men's bodies with a bit of character.<eos> Makes them feel good.
Is my sister here yet?<eos> She is, but per the agreement your attorney made with the state, you won't be allowed to see her while you're here.<eos> Once you're inside, we'll prep you for surgery.<eos> We'll remove one kidney, and then transplant it into your sister.<eos> Do you understand these terms as I have explained them to you?
Stay on those senile pricks until the board meeting.<eos> Those eunuchs can't be trusted.<eos> - Don't worry, boss.<eos> - Yes, boss.<eos> If one of them tries to step out of the line... I'll chop their balls off and feed them to their kids.
No, we can never go back to the hatboxes.<eos> It's a point of pride.<eos> We have moved beyond the hatbox.<eos> So, you...<eos> Yeah, I have no idea where I put them.
Thank you very much.<eos> I just made it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here are the new keys for the gate.<eos> Don't lose them again.
Where are you all going?<eos> Come back here, you traitors!<eos> What do we hate?<eos> Cars.<eos> Why do we hate them?
Uh, I don't know.<eos> They just showed up.<eos> They were camping in the woods near the toll bridge.<eos> I was just as surprised to see them as you are.<eos> I don't like surprises, sheriff. I find them threatening.
We agreed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.<eos> Why don't you show me yours first.<eos> You think I just fell off the turnip truck?<eos> We exchange at the same time.<eos> How do I know you're not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
"Calm"?<eos> They're going to put a bullet in my head.<eos> I will not let that happen.<eos> You know what they do to people suspected of treason?<eos> They put them on a plane back to Russia, no discussions, no questions.
They're going to put a bullet in my head.<eos> I will not let that happen.<eos> You know what they do to people suspected of treason?<eos> They put them on a plane back to Russia, no discussions, no questions.<eos> They get them a trial and a lawyer, and they find them guilty.
Of course somebody knows.<eos> Listen, Nina. I'm on your side, okay?<eos> I am.<eos> But you need to think of me as a... As a wall that's protecting you, okay?<eos> On the other side of that wall are some very decent and freedom-loving folks, but their love of freedom makes them impatient.
- Yeah.<eos> Who topped herself, yeah.<eos> - You.<eos> - Now there's probably thousands of us.<eos> Unless Helena's killed them all.
One of those claw machines at Denny's?<eos> He must be good at that machine, 'cause it's hard to get something, you know.<eos> It's always lifting up, then it drops.<eos> Come on. Show me your tits.<eos> I want to see them.
Well, no shit.<eos> He's angry.<eos> All right. The Kwon girl.<eos> She was last seen three days before her time of death.<eos> So, it's possible that our killer's abducting his victims and holding them before he kills them.
Why?<eos> Inside joke. Yeah.<eos> You wouldn't get it.<eos> Try me.<eos> A couple of years ago, I stole Ryan's shoes and kept switching them for larger sizes.
He helped me.<eos> You did it, Bonnie. He's risen.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> I know you're angry with me, ok, but now you'll see, everything I did, all those lives lost, they weren't in vain.<eos> Silas is gonna bring them back.
You can talk about your kid, but I don't want to hear about your husband.<eos> I can talk about whatever I want.<eos> Can you help me look for my shoes while you do it?<eos> You want me to look for your shoes?<eos> I want you to crawl on your hands and knees until you find them.
Do we know anything more about this guy?<eos> I just got off the phone with Adam.<eos> Facial recognition was inconclusive.<eos> He ran his prints through AFIS, got nothing back.<eos> He's running them through Interpol now.
I'm crazy about you.<eos> There were certain things in my life I always wanted to keep to myself.<eos> For example, my secret for shiny hair, my ridiculous superstitions... and my birth control pills.<eos> How did he find them?<eos> I think I left them in the guest bath.
And he won't make me Regent, Edward, which is what we agreed.<eos> We agreed on nothing, brother.<eos> I said that I would think about it and yet you act as if you're entitled to it!<eos> 'Dear Anne, our campaign is a farce.<eos> 'King Louis has offered Edward terms of peace 'and he has taken them.
It's just a bunch of wilderness.<eos> You're missing something.<eos> The satellite image has two mountain ranges On either side of the blacked-out space.<eos> And on this map, there is only one.<eos> Looks like they pinched them together on the map, Made one range.
You never talk politics on a date.<eos> I mean on a coffee to help you?<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> I'll destroy the tapes. Yes.<eos> After we listen to all of them.
Isn't that crazy?<eos> I left.<eos> I went back to work.<eos> I'm gonna do the ads.<eos> I want to be open to new things, but I hate them.
- Or... "I really like scarves," isn't it?<eos> And I just... I'm just really into bones.<eos> - That's interesting.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Once you say you like bones, you will see them everywhere.
Tell them what we discussed.<eos> They're looking for a parchment that would allow them to decipher Crowley's half of the Demon Tablet without a Prophet.<eos> Awesome.<eos> The crypts were, uh, lost over time. Only those closest to Lucifer knew their whereabouts.<eos> Then how did Crowley find them?
Wait a second.<eos> You've been telling Crowley the location of Lucifer's crypts.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I needed a break from the constant torture.<eos> And I did visit them all during my time with Yellow Eyes.
What is it you're trying to pay for?<eos> These headphones.<eos> Yeah, we don't sell those.<eos> But you did two years ago.<eos> I borrowed them from you, when I didn't have the money, but I do now, so I want to settle my debt.
Chloe, enough.<eos> Stop pretending to be a novelist so you can badger Will for free stuff.<eos> I am not pretending.<eos> She's a talent, James.<eos> She's only given me two pages, but they're so amazing, I know them by heart.
Uh, Beaumont.<eos> Because I have...<eos> These.<eos> I spotted the medals just before I emptied the container into the truck.<eos> So whereabouts did you find them?
And then I came here.<eos> And I realized that, this whole time, I was just wandering around, everywhere, just looking for you.<eos> Leslie, do you want to say some stuff about Ben now?<eos> Okay, well, the first draft of my vows, which I wrote the day after we got engaged, clocked in at around 70 pages.<eos> But I don't have them with me today.
Mr. Jursic.<eos> Dr. Edison, what are you doing here?<eos> Forensics is my domain. Historical anthropology is yours.<eos> True, but the board wanted me to, um-<eos> They wanted me to back up your findings and perhaps... make them a bit more presentable for the film.
For 3 months I confided in you.<eos> I told you everything.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You told me that if wrote about my fantasies, they would go away.<eos> Instead you just took them from me.
And then soon after comes Freya.<eos> And once again my girls grow up.<eos> They practice magic.<eos> Then one way or another... they die by its hand... over and over... and over... and over.<eos> I've given birth to them and watched them die a dozen times and neither of them's ever lived past 30.
It's, like, 12 different colors right now.<eos> You can read auras? Especially with other w... family members.<eos> I'm very intuitive.<eos> I can read auras, too.<eos> Or at least I can see them.
"Screwing the babysitter.<eos> Snorted Daddy's fortune."<eos> Five in a row gets a prize.<eos> Becca started handing the cards out.<eos> I grabbed them from everyone.
- What?<eos> Eve used to work here on this farm and she actually stayed here.<eos> Well, that makes sense of the letters.<eos> What letters?<eos> I found them when I was going through Eve's stuff after she died.
I found them when I was going through Eve's stuff after she died.<eos> They were from a boy called Pip.<eos> Wasn't that Lucy's brother?<eos> When Tom mentioned him, the name rang a bell.<eos> I only glanced at them in London. But... I've called Dad and he's gonna send them.
- Out here? - Yeah.<eos> Where?<eos> Just yonder.<eos> That old wagon right there, just under the hay.<eos> You want me to get them?
Oh, well, that's gonna happen. Oh!<eos> My perfect angel!<eos> You got this.<eos> You know, Gloria, do you remember that chafing dish I lent you a couple months back that you returned with a chip in it?<eos> Every time that Luke comes over, he takes things out of the attic and leaves them just... everywhere!
So how'd it turn out?<eos> They're keeping the school open... with a few conditions.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - I'll pass that along to the girls.<eos> Or you can, the next time you see them. Which won't be for a few months... actually.
You'll love this.<eos> It's really creepy.<eos> The slasher left a plain, silver wedding band hidden in the mouths of each one of his victims.<eos> Yeah, and only three people knew.<eos> There was Doc Hubbard, the medical examiner who found them.
Now!<eos> Let go of each other's hair.<eos> Fine. Keep pulling each other's hair. But follow me to my office.<eos> Not my eyelash extensions. Please!<eos> I just got them sewn in.
And these kids can be as young as eight, working in the fields up to 12 hours a day?<eos> And the pesticides burn their skin.<eos> All on two dollars a day?<eos> I have T-shirts from here.<eos> I'm going to throw them away.
Sing it, sing the lyrics.<eos> I don't know the lyrics.<eos> It's not a ghost!<eos> The lyrics.<eos> I don't know them.
We are reopening the E.R.<eos> We will be a level-I trauma center again.<eos> That will be top priority once Owen Hunt is here to share his input.<eos> From now on, the foundation will follow our lead.<eos> We will tell them our decisions as we make them.
You're gonna fly me out of here. You haven't outlived your usefulness.<eos> You could never be me because I save lives.<eos> You take them.<eos> No, I live those lives better than real people ever could.<eos> I follow them and watch them waste what they have.
We don't have stars like that in the city.<eos> They're like little diamonds.<eos> Why does everybody love looking at the stars so much?<eos> Ooh, the stars.<eos> I hate them.
Jim, I swear to Christ.<eos> Okay, this has gotta stop.<eos> I gotta lose weight, all right?<eos> I paid for 10 sessions!<eos> Yeah, we used them all up.
Wanda, I got your message.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> No, Tom, nothing is all right.<eos> Our bees... gone.<eos> Okay, don't worry, we will find them.
Do you have a minute?<eos> I do.<eos> Uh... back before I came to Vegas, I worked up in San Francisco.<eos> I helped put away this guy-- true sociopath.<eos> He posed as a cop, pull women over at night, sadistically assault them.
- Yeah.<eos> - Where?<eos> Just yonder.<eos> That old wagon right there, just under the hay.<eos> You want me to get them?
Oh, so "Glade-iators," front and center.<eos> Someone you knew?<eos> My kid sister.<eos> Who, sadly, we lost six years ago.<eos> It's a reminder to hold the people we love close, 'cause you never know when you could lose them.
I tried that an hour ago.<eos> They didn't even blink.<eos> Oh. I looked around, by the way, but no sign of your dog tags.<eos> Oh, yeah, no worries. You know what?<eos> I probably just left them in my car.
Hey, JT, what's going on?<eos> You know how chemo can get rid of cancer cells, but also make you insanely sick?<eos> Well, these pills are like that times 1,000 for Vincent.<eos> He keeps taking them, they'll kill him in... two, three years, tops.<eos> But Gabe's been taking them since he was a kid.
I'm fine.<eos> Don't say "fine."<eos> That's what I say when I'm not fine.<eos> Yeah, I noticed.<eos> Okay, what if I just take them once a week, or a month.
In the process...<eos> In the process of locating her, Jerry Barber, a detective from this division, was killed in the line of duty.<eos> Okay, Perik's MO was he liked blondes, mid 20s.<eos> Picked them up as a cab driver. He drugged them.<eos> Kept them alive in his basement for 24 hours.
When I saw that picture, I mean, it was like a stab in my heart.<eos> Okay, look, you said yourself, we don't know for sure that something's happened to these girls.<eos> But we know what happened to one of them.<eos> All right, look, we-we have this information. We'll get it out to everybody.<eos> Now, if Angela's right and these girls are in danger, we'll find them.
Sad.<eos> You win a whole new identity, but you still can't resist being a thief.<eos> Look, I don't know how you guys found me, but I told the truth at Eddie's trial.<eos> He killed those girls.<eos> He was only trying to jack their car, but they fought him and pulled off his ski mask, and that's why he had to kill them.
I can make that money back in two nights.<eos> What I can't get back is my reputation, which would be ruined if this gets out.<eos> - And I've had enough bad press this year. - No.<eos> What about her credit cards?<eos> We've frozen all of them.
Enjoy that drink.<eos> It's a Mai Tai, made with Colombian rum.<eos> These stitches are gonna be pretty janky. You'll probably have a scar.<eos> Oh, scars are sexy.<eos> Depends on how you get them.
- And the cool is that it's all XXL, so I have room to grow into it.<eos> You're a terrifying individual.<eos> Oh, hey, Dave, you wanna throw your shirts in with mine?<eos> Oh, no, no, no. These-- these require special attention.<eos> In fact, sometimes I throw them on wet and run-dry them so they keep their shape.
Frigging confident and flirtatious. Dibs on that bloody fragrant blonde he's talking to.<eos> Why are you telling us?<eos> It's not who you tell.<eos> It's the act of saying it out loud that makes it legally binding.<eos> I don't make the bloody rules, love, but I will abide by them.
♪ bright, sunshiny day There's something I'd like to go over before we begin, Mr. Collins...<eos> Can I call you Marcus?<eos> Would that be all right?<eos> See, Marcus, you need to understand that pain is the only human process that is completely defined by the person experiencing it.<eos> Now, the more I do this, the more I learn that people are very different in how they red to the pain I put them through.
Warwick, I know it's you, so can you just come out now?<eos> Hiya.<eos> Were you letting down Ian's tyres?<eos> They were going down, yeah.<eos> Was that because you were letting them down?
What I want to tell you is that I have absolute faith in you.<eos> I trust you.<eos> I know you love me and Christine, and... I'm sorry I lost sight of that temporarily.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> You have your reasons, and when you can, you'll share them with me.
Not.<eos> He designed the sight.<eos> Has two notches.<eos> Here and here.<eos> He lined them up with the eye.
What's he saying?<eos> Something about a miracle, tears of blood.<eos> The shroud of Constantinople.<eos> Tears of blood, my friend.<eos> I shed them often, my lord.
- But cap...<eos> You heard the captain, Sykes.<eos> Please. Just do it.<eos> BUZZ: It's like I thought. She says the baseballs are out of order.<eos> He always kept them by the year they were signed.
So?<eos> So he was a book collector.<eos> A book collector with OCD.<eos> A habit like that would die hard.<eos> I'll start checking antique bookstores in the morning to see if Warburg contacted any of them.
You're too old for this.<eos> You make your own eggs.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> I'll teach you how.<eos> I know how. I just wanted you to make them.
Glen plaid.<eos> Is that a road?<eos> Wedding rings.<eos> - What? - Graham and Eleanor Ward.<eos> They didn't list them in their inventory of stolen items... watch, cufflinks, $100 in cash, fake pearls.
Wedding rings.<eos> - What? - Graham and Eleanor Ward.<eos> They didn't list them in their inventory of stolen items... watch, cufflinks, $100 in cash, fake pearls.<eos> No mention of wedding rings.<eos> Maybe that's because they didn't take them.
- What? - Graham and Eleanor Ward.<eos> They didn't list them in their inventory of stolen items... watch, cufflinks, $100 in cash, fake pearls.<eos> No mention of wedding rings.<eos> Maybe that's because they didn't take them.<eos> Maybe they weren't wearing them.
- (Chuckles) Yeah. (Chuckles)<eos> It's just you're not wearing wedding rings.<eos> So we wanted to make sure those weren't stolen as well.<eos> No, it's pure luck.<eos> Graham... he took them to be cleaned a couple days ago.
- (Minister) Noelle?<eos> - Oh... it gets me every time.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I know the words like the back of my hand, but somehow...<eos> I don't know, they just get more magical, you know, every time I hear them.
That must have been really hurtful, Abby.<eos> - You're kidding, right?<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> You know, in my practise, I learned that men are naturally really secretive animals.<eos> They take things back into their caves and they hide them.
Why?<eos> Well, they need a third to get a vote on unionizing.<eos> - That's not enough.<eos> - They know.<eos> You had a Department of Labor guy - out who educated them.
Well, that's what I do.<eos> Well, your son takes after you, too.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> He stopped what could have been a full-blown riot.<eos> People were freaking out, and he talked them down.
As far as we know, Julia was alone, but we'll check it out.<eos> She always bring her keys when she went running?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Always?<eos> She clipped them inside her jacket.
I told you the guy from Sears is coming to fix the washing machine tomorrow.<eos> Come on, it'll be fun.<eos> Like we're in the back of a van.<eos> Don't you have another set of sheets?<eos> Yeah, but your stilettos ripped them to shreds.
I'm not getting my hands dirty in that world.<eos> What, do you think I pay you to wear fancy suits, keep your hair combed and collect envelopes?<eos> Let's be clear.<eos> You will get your hands dirty as I say.<eos> And right now, I want them to get filthy.
You miss your old job at the I.R.S., don't you?<eos> I knew what to do there.<eos> What was that?<eos> People hide things.<eos> I find them.
Thank you, Caleb.<eos> You're welcome. I think.<eos> Hey, did you end up telling your mom that you took her pills?<eos> Had to.<eos> But did you tell her why you took them?
- Where is Spencer?<eos> I don't know. The call went straight to voice-mail.<eos> Ali was at the studio.<eos> Both masks came from the same place.<eos> Yeah, but we don't know how many there are or who has them... and if they got them from Ali or from this guy's studio.
This stuff sets up fast.<eos> So just... relax, sit back.<eos> You're doing fine.<eos> You were telling us about Alison.<eos> Alison ordered the masks, I made them and handed them over.
Did I miss a warning sign?"<eos> You talked to her on the day she died.<eos> Yes. Yes, I did.<eos> You know, some people, it's like...<eos> The air weighs more for them, pushes them down, wears them out.
Sorry that you think you know how to do everything.<eos> Sorry that you resent the fact that I know how to do business.<eos> Sorry that you think you know how to do business, and maybe that's why our first business failed.<eos> Sorry that you took two weed breaks every single day instead of making work calls, and maybe that's why our business failed.<eos> Sorry that I didn't take more weed breaks, because I really could have used them working with a know-it-all like you!
This is Dr. Tolcher.<eos> The scientist who developed the poison?<eos> Not just a poison.<eos> A nanotoxin.<eos> Microscopic particles that lie dormant in your blood until someone triggers them to release a toxin.
These two girls were sisters... they lived in my village...<eos> They had been kept hidden... because they were cursed, people said...<eos> They said that even dogs were scared of them.<eos> They said that even dogs were scared of them.<eos> I saw them just once...
Sell them at school?<eos> Don't talk about things you don't understand.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, what don't I understand, Mariana?<eos> I mean you stole your brother's pills, you sold them at school, and then you let your brother take the fall for you.
No.<eos> I would never.<eos> It's not in my interest.<eos> I expect you to do more than deny Crout's accusations.<eos> I expect you to contradict them.
They were donated.<eos> Donated to local clinics.<eos> Would have got there, but someone along the chain of command decided to put them back out on the market.<eos> Yeah, but that's how you're getting them!<eos> Except I'm buying them for a clinic they were supposed to go to in the first place.
What am I?<eos> The friggin' tour operator.<eos> Well, the cruise ships leave at midnight.<eos> I've got a house, OK, on the beach.<eos> Oh, right. I watch them go past.
Or I report you.<eos> Simple.<eos> The police came, they took the medicine.<eos> What?<eos> Barged in and carried them away.
We both want it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> They, uh... recover the bombs?<eos> NEST team found them hidden in a container headed for Iran via Africa.
They throw their nets, and the damn monkey still won't drop the sugar.<eos> What do they want the monkeys for?<eos> They give them scholarships to Sweden.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> How would I know what they want them for?
I especially remember the sweetness of things<eos> Then the war came<eos> Bombing came closer in the 70s<eos> I remember the first casualties, our fear, my child's sadness<eos> There are so many images in the world which play on a loop We think we have assimilated them because we saw them
Well, it's nearly impossible to figure out when he arrived and departed New York, but we should try.<eos> I'll collect all the public and private transport stuff.<eos> Garcia, I need Kevin to go through every single pixel of these photographs.<eos> This unsub gets off on taunting us.<eos> He's given us answers here. We just haven't found them yet.
Left hand!<eos> I was doing those girls a favor.<eos> Right.<eos> You lock 'em up, pimp 'em out. I'm sure their thank-you notes are in the mail, huh?<eos> They were starving in China before I helped them.
I mess everything good in my life up, and... we work as friends really well, and... and I don't wanna mess that up.<eos> You won't mess anything up.<eos> Last night, before the tree, you asked me a question.<eos> You wanted to hear me say the words.<eos> So I'm... Saying them right now.
I am always so proud of you.<eos> Matthew is just wastin' his time.<eos> He is changing lives, saving lives.<eos> I know you have been free for a while, but I cannot believe that any white man is gonna care about the words he's putting down on that paper.<eos> That is a strong possibility. But not putting those words down guarantees that no man, white or black, will ever read them.
And she looks just like me.<eos> So they're related to you... distant aunts, uncles.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> We get it, but... what doesn't make sense is that somebody doesn't want us to know about it.<eos> Last night we saw their graves, and then when we went back today, somebody had changed them out.
She's fine.<eos> Come to think of it, I am the one who set you guys up, aren't I?<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> I guess it wouldn't hurt if you got them a little sooner than they did.
She was just the same in real life.<eos> - Impossibly perfect.<eos> - Ah, found it.<eos> Rachel, I've started the tea, but the potatoes are being obstinate.<eos> I will beat them into submission.
I was out running.<eos> I got, uh, chafed, and so I had to stop to-- to make a little adjustment.<eos> - An adjustment.<eos> - Have you tried powder?<eos> You know, these girls say you approached them, exposed yourself, and made sexually suggestive comments.
- The kids wore them while they warmed up.<eos> The kids were really excited because she said the pads could tell if they were dehydrated.<eos> - How do they do that?<eos> - No idea.<eos> She gave the kids baggies, had them write their names on them, and she collected them before the game.
- How do they do that?<eos> - No idea.<eos> She gave the kids baggies, had them write their names on them, and she collected them before the game.<eos> She took back used helmet pads?<eos> Yeah, she's gonna analyze them and bring the results to the next game.
He wanted me to hang him by his sissy white neck and cut his balls off.<eos> Actually cut off his balls?<eos> Mm-hmm. How did it make you feel when he asked you to do that?<eos> I reasoned with him, I'm like, why would you want me to do that?<eos> So now, if you had this fantasy, and I cut them off and you have the urge again, what are you gonna do then?
Pilgrimages are often made to parks.<eos> Believers say they're closer to God in places like that.<eos> Maybe he believes they're surrogates for a woman who cheated on him or rejected him.<eos> Either way, the unsub participates in high-risk behavior.<eos> He abducts and controls the victims, takes them to secluded locations, rapes them and kills them, all within 12 hours.
Let's bag it and run the DNA. We're ready to give the profile.<eos> We believe that this unknown subject is a white male in his early 30s.<eos> Initially he targeted white, blond women in their 20s but is expanding his victim pool.<eos> His M.O. is to rape his victims and then shoot them in the heart.<eos> At the disposal site, he poses them as if they're praying.
But the center of our unsub's anger didn't bite off his head.<eos> No, but she hurt him so badly that she got into his brain.<eos> So he's flipping the script.<eos> He's completely taking it over.<eos> He basically sees the victims as the praying mantis out to destroy him, so before they can get to him, he rapes them, forces them to engage in cannibalism, thereby taking away their control of the situation.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.<eos> Because you knew it was cheating.<eos> No.<eos> A buddy in my S.A.T. prep group told me about the "smarties."<eos> It wasn't like I took them to get high or anything.
It wasn't like I took them to get high or anything.<eos> Okay, Nick.<eos> Did you take the pills from your mom?<eos> No. I swear.<eos> - Then where did you get them?
I heard him admit the murder meself.<eos> Please tell me you didn't kill Phinbar.<eos> The forger's a true artist.<eos> Where are my plates, O'Rourke?<eos> Them bastard cops grabbed them, along with our man Maguire.
The counterfeiter.<eos> Incarnate.<eos> And I've heard much about you, Captain Sullivan.<eos> Now, I know at this early hour you are understaffed and vulnerable. So let's play nice, shall we?<eos> I want my printing plates, and I want them now.
You know damn well.<eos> The plates your men stripped from Maguire last night.<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> When we picked up Francis He was carrying counterfeitin' plates.<eos> We processed them like any evidence.
The girls were still trying to make sense of Ali's grave robbing, so Hanna became my regular visitor at Radley.<eos> We thought you being in here was the end of it, and it's not.<eos> And you know that.<eos> The question is, how do you know?<eos> Hanna wanted answers, and I know she deserved them, but I couldn't give her what she needed.
It was real dusty, I couldn't quite figure what it... What it was, but it looked like some sort of a document.<eos> And then I found another picture. Of two children, like a first communion, something like that. With a candle and a Bible.<eos> Then the last thing that I noticed, was a piece of marble.<eos> There was no doubt in my mind that someone deliberately... Uh, had buried these things.<eos> I didn't want anything to happen to them, so I took them next door to our restaurant.

- I gotta go.<eos> - Okay, go fill the sink up with water.<eos> - Go, go!<eos> - Okay, okay, yeah.<eos> So I grabbed the candles, took them to the kitchen.
- Okay, go fill the sink up with water.<eos> - Go, go!<eos> - Okay, okay, yeah.<eos> So I grabbed the candles, took them to the kitchen.<eos> And put them in the sink with water.
Dude, those things were moist and chocolaty at the same time.<eos> Totally, totally.<eos> Guys, this isn't about the cakes.<eos> I know how good they are.<eos> I've had them, too.
What do you mean?<eos> It's a straight-up work of fiction.<eos> Fiction?<eos> All 1,800 pages of it.<eos> My source says that the investigation was never conducted, that someone just wrote the findings and handed them to the chair of the subcommittee.
Previously on Covert Affairs...<eos> I spent most of last night, getting up to speed on an arms dealer named Dion Stavros.<eos> Found out exactly where he's getting his weapons and to whom he's selling them.
Five stolen Stinger missiles.<eos> Forgive me, mademoiselle, but how does this fall under MI-6 purview?<eos> We've had eyes on Dion Stavros since he was dealing to the I.R.A.<eos> Now he sells to numerous terror groups operating within the U.K.<eos> So if weapons he owns have suddenly vanished, we'd like to know who has them.
Without Ben, you're nothing.<eos> You think you could take me, hmm?<eos> Come get me, you dago bastard.<eos> Gentlemen, we're not here to settle all your differences.<eos> We're here to assure Bunny that you won't settle them in his community, and to compensate his loss.
♪ words fail to tell a tale ♪ Hey, hey!<eos> That's a winner!<eos> ♪ Too exotic too be told ♪ I can always tell.<eos> You can order prints.<eos> My guy in the back does them up while you're having dessert.
Why isn't the CNI after him?<eos> He's Interpol's problem now, and we all know how long that's gonna take.<eos> - Where do we fit in?<eos> - You, Annie Walker, are going to Vienna to fit in with him.<eos> Find out where exactly he's getting his weapons and to whom he's selling them.
Uh, my... my mom gave me a lift.<eos> Great. I see we've moved into the comedy portion of your psychotic break.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was off my meds.<eos> Now I'm back on them. I'm good.
And my family has always hunted, and I've hunted pretty much everything that they allow us to hunt in the state of Maine. [Guns clicking]<eos> And I love it. [Gun clicking]<eos> Eric has a fairly extensive collection of guns.<eos> I don't like them in the house.<eos> I was just afraid with having children in the house, and I didn't want them there.
It's plenty comfortable. I'm famished.<eos> Apples aren't my thing.<eos> They were your favorite once upon a time.<eos> Yeah. They were.<eos> Get my ass beat if I ever ate them working on that plantation, even spoiled ones.
Mrs. Westen, you don't really want that cigarette, do you?<eos> You've been doing so well.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I hear you've been looking for answers.<eos> I am the man who has them. What do you want?
Best to meet it on its own terms. No.<eos> The world isn't awful.<eos> People are not awful.<eos> They want to be good.<eos> Something makes them bad, something breaks them down, makes them snap.
I don't know how to build my own cabin.<eos> Well, you seem like you do.<eos> You need to seem like you do.<eos> Midwestern.<eos> You used to steal your mother's pies when she put them out to cool.
All good.<eos> Okay, I'll talk to you later.<eos> We need to find those girls.<eos> Danny, do you still have their number?<eos> Yeah, but... I would not recommend them to anyone.
- Tucker, video camera ready? - Check.<eos> A place to hide?<eos> I was in charge of that.<eos> Closet.<eos> So we'll catch 'em stealing on tape, then turn them over to the police, and get Lola back.
Suspects?<eos> As in more than one?<eos> That is correct.<eos> Striations on the bullets suggest that three weapons were fired.<eos> I had ballistics run them through IBIS, but unfortunately no matches were found.
Hey.<eos> Hey, thanks for calling me back. Listen, I need a favor, okay?<eos> I'm gonna send you some letters.<eos> Uh, there may be a message embedded in them.<eos> I need cryptology to look them over.
I'm a free man.<eos> You gave up everything for me.<eos> Well, I didn't exactly give up everything.<eos> Hanna, your ex-husband bid up the share prices during the hostile takeover.<eos> Once we realized he'd pay anything for the shares, we sold them...
I'm working at the "Toledo Blade".<eos> I'm officially a journalist.<eos> Well, actually, an unpaid intern.<eos> Didn't like 80 people try out for that job? Mm-hmm.<eos> And I crushed them all.
When I was young, this used to be in the house in Kleinwalsertal.<eos> Oh, this used to be my favorite hiding place when Boris and I used to play hide-and-seek together.<eos> He was older than me, indulged me, playing games, making up ghost stories.<eos> Telling me German fairy tales.<eos> Not the way Boris told them.
Well, you look great.<eos> Why don't we make some tea, put our feet up and talk?<eos> Dan mailed our divorce papers to the hotel.<eos> Guess he's in a hurry to make it official.<eos> Room service delivered them with my morning coffee.
About 9:00 a.m. -- my usual pickup time.<eos> I come in every Wednesday and Sundays, uh, to collect the entrails.<eos> The what?<eos> The animal organs.<eos> Ah. After Max would, uh, dig them out and work his magic.
I, on the other hand, am the fun aunt, so I don't have to worry about that.<eos> - And here we go.<eos> - What?<eos> I missed these girls.<eos> I didn't get to see them grow up this time.
It was distributed by Pyrotechnic Engineering in Anacostia.<eos> You two, go, check it out.<eos> Boss, I got a problem.<eos> I lost my creds.<eos> I haven't seen them since last night.
He should never have said those things.<eos> What things?<eos> My husband and I had an argument a couple of years ago.<eos> Some things were said.<eos> Not all of them were meant, and... ..Alys overheard.
You're very talented.<eos> It's the first thing I ever wrote.<eos> You used to play that for Elisa?<eos> I've seen your letters, man.<eos> Did Elisa show them to you?
It's transmitted through cough, so the risk of you infecting them is minimal.<eos> -Are you a virus expert?<eos> -Yeah... It's a bacterium.<eos> Are you talking to yourself, Saga?<eos> Someone kidnaps five people, infects them with plague and puts them on a ship that goes aground.
- The woman died in March nine years ago.<eos> Esteem delivered it in the spring of 2000. It doesn't help.<eos> We had our 20th anniversary this spring.<eos> - There are 600-700 records.<eos> - Can we take them with us?
-Tea?<eos> -Thank you, dear.<eos> I think we still have a little seed cake.<eos> Two slices.<eos> Unless you fed them to your pigeons...
You can't keep disagreeing with me and pretend it's an agreement.<eos> - I agree.<eos> - Heh.<eos> Ethical issues are never obvious, and they never go away.<eos> That's why I raise them.
What's going on, Charlie?<eos> You know that woman that I talk about occasionally... Kate?<eos> Robot lady.<eos> Anyways, she's going out of town this weekend to have sex with a total scumbag.<eos> This guy promises women grant money for sex and then never gives them the grant.
Not much but whoever did this, sir, knew what they were doing.<eos> I don't care if they knew all four members of the Vengaboys.<eos> I'm the big man round here and I want them caught, and caught hard.<eos> Have you seen our crime statistics lately?<eos> No. Because someone stole them.
Jack knows what he's doing.<eos> That's your mother on What's My Line.<eos> Hope you like the taste of fists, funny man.<eos> Not as much as she does.<eos> Although she doesn't take them orally.
Angel's in the cosmetology program at Orson Beauty Academy.<eos> We share a parking lot and a cafeteria with them.<eos> Cool!<eos> Ooh, I really like your nails.<eos> Thanks, yeah, I posted them on Facebook, and so far I've gotten 16 likes.
This isn't charity.<eos> I take what I deserve.<eos> When those trollops are about to die soaked in their juicy fear, I...eat...their... livers!<eos> Because that's the only part of them still working to purify the body that they've trashed.<eos> Now, normally, I like them weaker, but let's just call this a hunter's exception, shall we?
Hotch: Previously on "criminal minds"...<eos> Two women were found in a park in Glendale, Arizona.<eos> Both of them were left in that prayer position.
Plans tonight?<eos> Me, you, my crib, turn my onesie into a twosie?<eos> Hey, was your dad a thief?<eos> No, he was a butcher in East Kilbride.<eos> Because he stole the stars and put them in your eyes.
I'll pop in to make sure you're showering properly, yeah?<eos> I'm joking!<eos> He's not joking, he's a sex man!<eos> Why are you in your pants?<eos> Oh, I needed to wash them as well. So easier if I keep them on, saves time.
If you want to find Cyrus, then I am your best bet... your only bet, actually.<eos> What did they do to you?<eos> Today... it was the giant rocks.<eos> Some of them as large as a man.<eos> He makes me move them from the bottom of the stone staircase to the top.
Off the record, I may have heard a thing or two.<eos> Though, sadly, that conduit to the US has closed.<eos> Nadira was found because someone leaked her real identity.<eos> We're bringing those women into protective custody, but to really protect them, we're gonna need to find out who's leaking their cover names.<eos> I'm the only one who knew them all, aside from the girls here.
Just not quite smart enough.<eos> So I finally managed to hack through the firewall, and it turns out the cyber mastermind stealing credit card numbers is an 11-year-old from Minneapolis.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was selling them to his friends so they could buy limited-edition sneakers.
Chip redecorated the room to improve the feng shui.<eos> He said our old furniture was blocking the flow of energy.<eos> I had my life's fart savings in that couch!<eos> And where are the drapes?<eos> Chip took them to make play clothes for the children.
You're wrong.<eos> Two days after the attack of my brother, I brought some friends to the place where it happened.<eos> I made sky lanterns.<eos> Cardboard, candle, paper balloon.<eos> We lit them and watched them float up, thinking of Lee.
This is ridiculous!<eos> Let me see!<eos> - I'm not wearing this.<eos> Well, for one thing...<eos> Your boobs look like you threw them in a grocery bag and swung them around the supermarket.
"the beef light of my loaf."<eos> what?<eos> no, no. why did i use this algorithm?<eos> we're only tracking people who use the stolen cards.<eos> they might not be the same as the ones who stole them.
Come on, buddy, it's not worth it.<eos> No fear!<eos> - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Why didn't you just throw them in the sink, you idiot.
Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough.<eos> I always got stuck on the first challenge-- trying to find someone to be on a team with me.<eos> I guess that story's more sad than funny.<eos> I love scavenger hunts.<eos> My friends and I had them all the time.
Then where's the coin?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Where is the coin?<eos> Why don't you look in your pockets?<eos> I slipped them in there earlier today.
Or Sarah, or Celine, or the other five girls?<eos> We found your cloud, Cameron.<eos> There's video of him having sex with eight passed-out women. - That was their fantasy.<eos> - And the g.H.B.?<eos> What about ripping their earrings out of their ear while you forced them to go down on you?
Okay.<eos> Okay, what?<eos> I'm going to do it.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Let's get a table, order a couple of ostrich steaks, send them back because they suck, and then go home and celebrate.
I love you and appreciate you.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Waxing's back.<eos> I love those smooth legs.<eos> Mm. Let me wrap them around you.
"If women will not dance<eos> "to the sound of my axe, I shall gladly make them dance with the other."<eos> Do you know a saxophone is called an axe?<eos> So he chopped women up 'cause they wouldn't be his groupies?<eos> Plus men who protected them.
Is it both at the same... (groans loudly)<eos> Come on.<eos> Balls!<eos> I-I don't understand what it is.<eos> I put my hands there. I'm waving them underneath the automatic faucet-- nothing's happening.
Our group really owes you one.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> What have you done?<eos> We don't understand what gave you this ability, but the reason you don't burn is because your blood platelets are fire-resistant.<eos> Which is why we're removing them.
And by that I mean, "What's the least I can do to help you."<eos> I'll have the burger with the fries.<eos> She'll have it with the salad.<eos> But I want the fries.<eos> Ah, you want them, but you don't need them.
Skin slippage says your victim's been in the water over 48 hours, held in place by those cinder blocks.<eos> Tao: Yeah, but the ropes came loose.<eos> Well, he was getting gassy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Talk about playing with a handicap. The boys collect golf balls from the lake twice a week, sir, and they sell them back to the pro shop for a dollar apiece.
All because he was lonely, right?<eos> Yeah, extremely deranged sexual urges, irrational fantasies, and psychopathic tendencies.<eos> Looks like the victim is in his mid-20s, but no one matching his description has been reported missing in the tri-state area.<eos> Well, it he's been arrested before, his prints will be in the database.<eos> The locals are running them now.
Moral vigilantism typically has its roots in repression and guilt.<eos> This generally manifests itself in low self-esteem and self-loathing.<eos> By punishing others, the unsub may also be punishing himself.<eos> He's also literally branding his victims.<eos> We're not sure why, but he's likely marking them as his own.
We're not just a bunch of reclusive data nerds.<eos> Our employees are as diverse as the work that we do here.<eos> And I swear, if I have to hear another crack about the Star Trek chairs...<eos> Oh, hey, look at those.<eos> Didn't even notice them.
You... You go and drink yourself.<eos> -(COINS CLATTERING) - If you have any mercy, you will walk down that street tonight and never come back!<eos> There are things we believe we cannot bear.<eos> But we can bear them.<eos> We do bear them.
Tomorrow's Sunday.<eos> Come by at 7:00. I'll have a pot roast in the oven, and we can talk about the things that we used to talk about...<eos> My job at the Smithsonian, the movies we've seen...<eos> Dad...<eos> Because the answers you are so desperate for, you're never gonna get them.
Barnes was going to kill that officer.<eos> I realize you're new at this, Agent Keen, but some rules don't have exceptions.<eos> And giving up your weapon, that happens to be top of the list.<eos> I am fully aware of our field regulations.<eos> And since you willfully ignored them, your actions will be subject to a formal review.
God, those shoes are beautiful.<eos> Oh, I think I can smell the leather through the glass.<eos> Can't you just try them on?<eos> No, I can't try them on.<eos> I try them on, I'm... I'm gonna buy 'em, and, I mean...
I actually have a job.<eos> Yes, thank you so much for doing this.<eos> This is way beyond the call of duty, and as a form of repayment, I would like to offer you a business opportunity.<eos> How would you like your own line of calf implants? People could have your calves in their body.<eos> We'd call them "The VD".
No, you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, look...<eos> The Chinamen people, they make these for 3 cents.<eos> The store sells them for what?
Right this way.<eos> Steve, thank you for joining us for our farewell powwow.<eos> No problem.<eos> I hope you like the beads.<eos> Oh, yes, wife bury them where sun don't shine.
The suspect's current status is not yet verified.<eos> The police are coordinating with various agencies to apprehend the suspect.<eos> Security check points are being set up around... around the city...<eos> I was born with a pair of balls...<eos> Still got them...
Excuse me, Professor Do Min Joon, it's I, Cheon Song Yi.<eos> I bought those shoes again, after going through a lot of trouble for them.<eos> I'm overlooking this matter this time because of the favor I owe you from last time.<eos> But please apologize to me sincerely at some point in time.<eos> I still really don't understand why you took them.
I'll either kill that bitch or kill myself!<eos> It's I, Cheon Song Yi.<eos> I bought those shoes again after going though a lot of trouble for them.<eos> I'm overlooking this matter this time because of the favor I owe you from last time, but please apologize sincerely at some point in time.<eos> I still don't really understand why you took them.
No, no, no, no.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Get me your hands in the air!<eos> Calm down. Calm down.<eos> Raise your hands so they can see them.
But due to budget cuts, it would have to begin in the third World markets of Kenya, Brazil and Russia.<eos> So I called because I wanted your advice on something, Mr. Marketing Award Winner.<eos> But you have to promise to keep it a secret from Bob.<eos> It's amazing how you Americans all believe in seat belts.<eos> In America, they advertise them really well.
That's what I'm talking about.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> -l started smoking again.<eos> -Yeah, I can see that.<eos> I don't know what the rules are, and I'm sure I'm breaking them but I really miss you.
- Lime marmalade.<eos> - A CD of our Rigoletto.<eos> How lovely.<eos> Yes, I know you have copies, but these are signed, so they're rather valuable.<eos> And I wrapped them myself.
So I was told.<eos> So we don't have to go through the...<eos> What were you looking at?<eos> These prints.<eos> I just told the President's mother how humorous I found them.
Cartoons, actually. Mocking them.<eos> Us.<eos> They put you in a room with...<eos> The mother tried to apologize.<eos> I told her I found them funny.
Probably more pissed I killed that dog than the girl?<eos> She was 12 years old.<eos> Wasn't my fault.<eos> After all these years, you got someplace to go?<eos> Yeah, I told my kids I'd take them roller skating.
Sometimes I like to imagine that I have this whole bottle of little blue pills.<eos> Why blue?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just like the color, I guess.<eos> And then, I take these little blue pills... and I line them up on the bed, one by one.
I just like the color, I guess.<eos> And then, I take these little blue pills... and I line them up on the bed, one by one.<eos> Jamie, why are you telling me this?<eos> I'm just making conversation, Derek.<eos> Then I take the pills... and I push them into my mouth.
- Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's your show, bro.<eos> Look at all these people.<eos> Oh, can't disappoint them.
Huh?<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ!<eos> Hey, guys, I just lost my keys.<eos> I had them right in this pocket.
Oh, yes!<eos> That's what I'm talking about, George!<eos> And we're back.<eos> Later in the show, we're going to be learning all about how these text messages are actually making our children stupider, and the statistics are terrifying.<eos> I've seen them and they are.
And... well, She had boobs in the like 4th grade...<eos> Mosquito bites.<eos> Promising.<eos> Go.<eos> And she let some of the guys feel them.
Put another tape in!<eos> Can you take her?<eos> I don't know why but the girls are terrible today.<eos> I heard it was pretty busy here.<eos> It's got them wound up.
Julie and the girls do back-ups.<eos> How do you feel about not singing lead?<eos> How do you feel about getting knocked out by a woman?<eos> Pretty embarrassed, I would imagine.<eos> The thing is, Gail, I pick the songs and I pick who sings them.
Dave, sure...and I might see that at a party or something and I like it.<eos> Alright, I like the design.<eos> I know some people up in China so I'll give them a call and I'll send them a photo or a sample two weeks later I've got 400 shirts on a boat.<eos> Okay now each shirt - it costs me a dollar fifty by the time it's landed.<eos> I take them out and sell them in the shops for twenty five.
I get it.<eos> Ibuprofen, Sergeant.<eos> It won't kill you.<eos> Figured that out on your own, huh?<eos> I used to get them, too.
Don't you think?<eos> We've stuck to the plan so far.<eos> I believe this will be the movie of the century.<eos> Yes.<eos> Tonight we'll get them dead drunk.
Bye.<eos> Hey, remember how much I loved Cinderella as a kid?<eos> What a sick fucking kid.<eos> It's a classic.<eos> It's what messes little girls up, because we all get obsessed with shoes and then we think that some guy is gonna come put them on our feet.
- Here, look at this.<eos> Look at this. Look.<eos> - Can this wait like five minutes?<eos> Now, this... this book reprints the last remaining five pages of Jonathan Hawthorne's diary.<eos> The witches, he refers to them as the Lords of Salem.
the serial killer has claim to yet another victim<eos> And what is becomes the most vicious crime spree in our city history this unpleasant series of violent murders has many stayings in doors and living in fear<eos> Good morning. I think we can share it this time<eos> The serial killer can traps his victims at home, business and work places<eos> And kills them however,it appears that he takes one victim from each crime scene,this people may be still alive or captive
I can translate it for you.<eos> You're kidding me?<eos> It's champagne.<eos> I don't make the rules.<eos> No, you enforce them which is worse.
Meaning a work of fiction? Meaning it's all bullshit?<eos> Hey, a story's a story.<eos> I'm just a feature reporter, so the fact that you think it happened is my story.<eos> You know, I don't remember leaving the house with any coins in my pocket.<eos> I think you could've slipped them to me.
We've got lots of wine.<eos> Cool. Bring me back a bottle.<eos> I will do.<eos> Not to get technical, but this guy is actually the first big break we've had since 9/11.<eos> To big breaks and the little people that make them happen.
Now, I just got to get his ass down here.<eos> Why are there gate guards there?<eos> We talked about this. No one is supposed to be there when my source arrives.<eos> You might have spooked him already.<eos> Well, procedures only work - if we follow them every time.
When I get back.<eos> But please know, I'm gonna start not doing those.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> As a sign.<eos> We've already established that chores are something I do, so my not doing them will be an early indicator.
Yeah, I remember.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> You take promises seriously, don't you?<eos> You're not flip about that, aren't you?<eos> Yeah. I take them seriously but...
Dora?<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> When you...<eos> When you read those words, when you copied them, did you ever stop to think about us?
Oh, I've done enough.<eos> Believe me.<eos> I've done what I can the best that I can.<eos> That's all you can ask of a person.<eos> No, my tragedy was that I loved words more than I loved the woman who inspired me to write them.
Υou didn't touch anything, did you?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, cousin.<eos> -Where's the money? -You play with chips<eos> -And who's got them?
I went by your house, but she's not there.<eos> - She's staying with you, right?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Every morning she makes me waffles and strawberries.<eos> Of course, she doesn't actually make the strawberries; She picks them from a tree in the garden.
Does Mitch know?<eos> Honestly, Tammy, when I see him, the things I want to say to him...<eos> It's better that I don't.<eos> These things that happen to us, they're not just bad luck.<eos> He looks for them. He finds them, and then he refuses to walk away.
Kevin, it's over.<eos> They don't understand.<eos> Nobody'll understand.<eos> I've seen people die.<eos> I've held them, looked into their eyes when the lights went out.
I know from experience, always challenge the DNA.<eos> But odds are you smoked these cigarettes.<eos> Then how did they end up inside Charlotte's apartment?<eos> Only one of two ways.<eos> You're either lying to me, and you left them, or whoever's framing you... They know what they're doing.
What happened to those cigarettes? What happened to them?<eos> Yeah, after the interrogation, what did you do with them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nothing?<eos> Somebody probably threw them away.
- Get on the ground!<eos> - Whoa, whoa! Put the gun down!<eos> I'm a policeman, all right?<eos> I said on the ground!<eos> Keep your hands where I can see them.
I think.<eos> Sweetheart?<eos> These letters, this is not you and Mom.<eos> Dad, this isn't you.<eos> Who do you think wrote them?
I took two or three other agents with me to go pick him up.<eos> So inside me, I started getting, you know, more and more aggressive, weird.<eos> I couldn't go on.<eos> We got the fingerprints and we got the palm prints.<eos> Within a few weeks, we would be sending them out to Interpol, to the embassies, to see if any of these fingerprints matched anything that they had on record.
-I know.<eos> Sören Laurin-Wall, his official title is Government Liaison Officer.<eos> But what he really does is fix women for parties.<eos> The girls give the doorman a cut.<eos> Laurin-Wall sends them to the rooms and the waiting men.
What, you just wanna take away something that matters to me?<eos> Did you even care about Dan?<eos> B., how many times can we fight like this?<eos> Aren't you sick of it?<eos> They say people keep fighting about the same things until it breaks them apart.
It's slim fit.<eos> People like their shirts tailored.<eos> Yeah, well, slim fit or not my dry cleaner keeps shrinking my shirts.<eos> They have one job to do and that's clean my shirts. Not clean them and then shrink them.<eos> You know, if I wanted to shrink them, I'd have Millie wash them.
You fucking move, you die!<eos> You stop moving right now!<eos> Keep your hands up.<eos> - I'm gonna murder every one of you motherfucking cocksucking pieces of shit!<eos> Keep your hands where I can see them.
Uh, well, it's very nice to meet you, Heather, Heather, and Heather.<eos> What?<eos> Cult film. Circa 1988.<eos> Your fashion sense? Meet 2011.<eos> And why don't you take those clown shoes back to whatever hobo you stole them off of and stop trying to mix outside your social circle.
'Hard copies.<eos> All of them? '<eos> Well, you heard the Prime Minister say he wanted a swift resolution to all this.<eos> 'Yes, but hard copies could take days.'<eos> Well, if you really think it'll take that long, send them by email.
Find him!<eos> NOW!<eos> Good Sir... a query--<eos> These chairs...<eos> Do you consider them to be of a good quality?
Okay.<eos> You are not going to be ignorant.<eos> You're going to study and you're going to learn.<eos> - About what?<eos> - People- what makes them tick, what makes them work, what's in the gut and the head.
Months to paint, a moment to burn.<eos> Cardinal Cesare Borgia, my Bonfire of the Vanities!<eos> Stand too close and your mozzetta will turn to fire.<eos> And you, Signor Machiavelli, have you brought your works to burn?<eos> Be sure, we will visit your house, seek them out, and consign them to the flames!
- Spot the convict. Cheers, man.<eos> It's contaminated.<eos> For a while, people came here and they looted through these buildings.<eos> They took these things, sold them on black market.<eos> People who bought them got sick not knowing they were contaminated by radiation.
Look, I told you, I was mugged.<eos> I never saw anybody attack that boy.<eos> The paramedics found you outside your door.<eos> - It must have been the same people.<eos> - I never saw them.
I do.<eos> Well, then I accept.<eos> Daddy.<eos> - Lemon, what are you doing?<eos> - Taking Mama's things to the church... - ... after you brought them all back.
Here.<eos> Finish your homework.<eos> Like I can concentrate in here.<eos> Real beauties?<eos> We rotate them out once a week.
Scott, what was in those boxes?<eos> Okay, what the hell kind of FBI guys are you?<eos> The kind that are trying to fix the mess you started. Now where'd your mom get these?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I found them in her safe.
Okay, so I called Pace and NYADA and they sent out out acceptance letters this week.<eos> Oh, my God, that's so exciting.<eos> And, like, totally terrifying.<eos> We need to make a pact.<eos> When we get our letters, we open them together, in the choir room.
How was the delivery to Tokyo?<eos> Not bad...<eos> Mothzilla got into the ship's closet, though.<eos> Can we please get new uniforms now, Professor?<eos> You said you would replace them a year ago.
Oh, I'm good!<eos> Who wants a piece of me?<eos> I'll try a bite!<eos> Having completed its perilous journey, the exhausted salmon enters the final phase of its life cycle.<eos> The female deposits her eggs and the male fertilizes them.
Let's go!<eos> We've got to get these moon rocks to the moon by moondown.<eos> Why are we bringing moon rocks to the moon?<eos> Oh, those lunar crybabies claim the rocks were stolen by the Apollo astronauts.<eos> They consider them part of their cultural heritage.
Sorry.<eos> I had that coming.<eos> It's not easy being a derby wife.<eos> The Wingnuts, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> And that bloodbath takes them to next week's finals against our reigning champions, the Murderflies.
Well? Speak up.<eos> You talk of important decisions, but as robots, you have no free will.<eos> Why pretend anything you do matters?<eos> Our decisions do matter.<eos> The fact that they're predetermined makes them no less important.
Have you taken your pills, Bamps?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Have you taken your pills?<eos> - Time again already?<eos> - I'll go get them for you.
In a way.<eos> Connecting to the neural network somehow disrupted our brains' normal electrical activity.<eos> Yeah, it makes sense.<eos> Whenever one of us was around, the i-fire's programming went haywire.<eos> Instead of sucking energy from heat sources, it ignited them.
What would we do without you?<eos> That's the weather vane.<eos> You're an artist.<eos> I'm a finder.<eos> You make beautiful things, I find them.
On the cobtrary, she was all for it.<eos> Someone taking an interest in her.<eos> I imagine she was flattered.<eos> I imagine she was.<eos> Now, if you've any more questions, you'll have to put them to me on the hoof.
I'm Javier, and Molly is the glasses!<eos> Don't mind Chloe.<eos> She's totes cray-cray. Don't say that either.<eos> When June said it, I thought it was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard, but somehow, reading it In this television script by... These three jews, It suddenly hit home.<eos> Sometimes, things don't click Until Hollywood really spells them out for you.
No one listens to me.<eos> But now that their secrets are out, they have to work through them so they can heal!<eos> Wait, that actually makes sense.<eos> Maybe because I was looking at US Weekly and not you.<eos> I heard the words, but I didn't see them coming out of a stupid fish's mouth. Say something else.
Kisses.<eos> It's Daddy. Come to Daddy. Come to...<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> Where... where are his eyes?<eos> He was blinded by the accident, so I removed his eyeballs and put them where his testicles used to be.
Not anymore. Tori brought doughnuts.<eos> What?<eos> No way!<eos> Doughnuts? !<eos> Yeah, but Tim ate them all.
- Really?<eos> Come on, Bert.<eos> It's for profit.<eos> Bombs are the perfect product.<eos> They cost a fortune and you only use them once.
I don't understand.<eos> I've heard you say a lot worse things about advertising.<eos> The mighty theater punches its audience in the face with its subtle message.<eos> There's a challenge.<eos> Let me tell you, people buy things because it makes them feel better.
- Really?<eos> Come on, Bert.<eos> It's for profit.<eos> Bombs are the perfect product.<eos> They cost a fortune and you only use them once.
Oh, the things she'll never tell, like how long it took her to get ready or the reason she's smiling.<eos> A good-looking woman at a party.<eos> And where she got the incredible shoes.<eos> Another woman, not too catty, says, "I love your shoes.<eos> Where did you get them?"
I don't think it's that kind of atmosphere.<eos> You actually saying that with a straight face?<eos> You forget why you wrote that letter?<eos> Are you forgetting you said it would kill our business?<eos> So you think cigarettes are bad and so are the people who sell them?
Yeah, well, I feel like I haven't slept in forever.<eos> I mean, Joe gets up at 5:00 A.M.<eos> And does his 500 push-ups.<eos> I'm sure he doesn't do 500.<eos> Oh, yes he does and he counts them out in Italian.
Sure.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Being here, all this... reminds me of watching games with my dad.<eos> Your dad take you to a lot of games?<eos> No. Mostly we'd watch them on TV.
Don't split hairs.<eos> I'm in the habit of being precise.<eos> My profession requires it. So does mine.<eos> I have precisely no toes on my left foot.<eos> I lost them to gangrene, after six months up to my ankles in mud and rat piss in the trenches.
- I'm coming Jamilla!<eos> Give me a break'.<eos> Hustler!<eos> So when can I pick up my shoes?<eos> I'll bring them to you.
I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.<eos> Stay within one table length.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> Do your knucklebones bring you luck?<eos> Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace.
He rented an apartment that I own.<eos> Another reason for my call, really, I wanted to offer you a keepsake.<eos> I don't need anything.<eos> As you wish.<eos> I'll give them to Mayor Mills.
It's the one thing that's stayed consistent.<eos> Doc, can you run the security footage from both banks? Run them side by side?<eos> Okay.<eos> Both 45 to 50, no wedding rings, average looks... he picked them out specifically.<eos> He courted them.
But I can tell you it's fast, remarkably strong, and has the capacity to render its victims essentially helpless within seconds.<eos> So, you're saying we should be cautious? We get it.<eos> I'm saying you should be afraid.<eos> Be very afraid.<eos> Because in the natural world, predators with paralytic toxins use them to catch and eat their prey.
I'd rather face 1,000 swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.<eos> They are your guests under your protection.<eos> You asked them here.<eos> It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen.<eos> If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.
My father, my lord. Hmm.<eos> I taught my son Jaime to read.<eos> The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning.<eos> He couldn't make sense of the letters.<eos> He reversed them in his head.
The little gypsy girl will rot in jail.<eos> The U.S. Marshal will be disgraced.<eos> Your family might disappear altogether.<eos> Because, Walter, I hide things.<eos> And I hide them very well.
You know about that?<eos> Oh, Mr Poppy's told me. Right.<eos> Well, I'm afraid I had to put a stop to it.<eos> I thought there were baby auditions this morning.<eos> No, no, we cancelled them.
It's rather alarming to realise one's faculties are showing signs of crumbling away.<eos> What papers, may I ask?<eos> They related to the theory of dangerousness.<eos> The impossibility of measuring it.<eos> I took them home.
Nothing more I could do for him.<eos> I called Lisa and told her what I was planning.<eos> Bought gas at a local station, switched our clothes, left some of my blood and my license near the body.<eos> Took his dog tags.<eos> Thought maybe I'd get them to his sister one day.
OK, I'll call you later.<eos> DELIRIO NIGHTS<eos> How many times have we pointed fingers at other people because they are different?<eos> Different in way of thinking, way of walking, way of dressing, talking or loving.<eos> We mistreat other people because we consider them below us or less intelligent or because they have different skin color.
Yeah, you're right.<eos> Space is space.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will... I will... I will see them on the weekend.
A secret relationship he couldn't disclose... An illicit one.<eos> Maybe not that illit.<eos> Now no offense. But how many men do buy roses for hookers?<eos> I don't hook anymore.<eos> But they do buy them for girlfriends... Girlfriends they can't have under certain rules.
He said I was gonna have a car accident and I was gonna end up like this.<eos> So this guy predicted what would happen?<eos> Not exactly, but I guess exactly doesn't really matter now.<eos> We think it's possible that the man who attacked you also killed at least another two other people.<eos> Do you recognize either of them?
We were surprised to learn he was previously employed as a professor at MIT.<eos> Yeah. I could tell on the phone.<eos> But how does an advanced mathematics professor end up working for the TSA?<eos> I suppose he loses his mind.<eos> It'd be an understatement to say people here are driven but Neil put them all to shame.
in español.<eos> Wow, you're diabolical.<eos> ♪ Look what someone ♪ ♪ bought me. ♪<eos> Expensive new shoes.<eos> Ooh, who got them for you?
But, far as I can tell,<eos> Bridget is in the dark about what is going on over there.<eos> Did she find my box of Martin/Charles paperwork?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> If she'd found those papers, she would have taken them.
Bridget is in the dark about what is going on over there.<eos> Did she find my box of Martin/Charles paperwork?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> If she'd found those papers, she would have taken them.<eos> And you still have them?
Always thought this was the spookiest one-- even spookier than the death card.<eos> So it's one of yours?<eos> You do tarot readings here?<eos> There used to be a woman who did readings on the side.<eos> My boss liked the cards, so he gave them out as coupons.
[Des] What'd you say?<eos> I can't hear you over the siren.<eos> [Des] Oh no, that's weird.<eos> I thought they had the funny British sirens.<eos> [Tinny] They... phased them out.
[Mal] He says he'll meet?<eos> [Jake] It's a trap, you think?<eos> [Mal] Oh yeah, it's a trap.<eos> [Bruce] Ha ha. It's that PI. Good news.<eos> He found your plates and he's bringing them here.
Good day.<eos> That will be $1,000.<eos> Fine.<eos> So the creepy twins live in the building.<eos> But I haven't touched my chairs since someone or something put them on top of the table.
You know what's weird about this?<eos> Yeah, Phil's teeth.<eos> It's like he had them whitened or capped or something.<eos> No, these cars, they're very high-end automobiles.<eos> They're equipped with Lojack, GPS, tracking systems, but someone's stealing them;
We will not work with outsiders. We will protect Harlan.<eos> We will control every aspect of crime within its boundaries, protection, pills, robbing and gambling.<eos> We will be meticulous and we will be clean.<eos> No more smash-and-grabs and no more bad decisions.<eos> Now, as to the whores, well, my father ran them and he ran them well.
This is about the Zodiac, isn't it?<eos> I've been watching the news.<eos> Did Bob ever talk about his work?<eos> That's all he talked about.<eos> I tried to move his old boxes out, but he got so agitated, I had to bring them back.
She'll never forgive any of us.<eos> Victims of a sudden impact are some of the hardest to treat.<eos> It's not just the collision that injures them.<eos> It's everything after.<eos> The centrifugal force keeps them moving, tossing them from vehicles, throwing them through windshields, slamming their internal organs into the skeleton.
I have to talk to you.<eos> See, I have some bad news.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What is it?<eos> The bad news is that... That... You nuns are gonna be real busy making candles, 'cause me and Mary Margaret just sold them all.
It's gonna be amazing when you get it out on the water.<eos> I can't even remember the last time I was on it.<eos> Wh-what's this?<eos> If you sold all the candles, why are they still here, Leroy?<eos> I didn't sell them all.
If he should die, he threatens that everything he knows will be made public.<eos> This is a poultice of datura root.<eos> You need to change it every hour.<eos> It will bring down the swelling.<eos> Also, if you bruise the leaves and put them in a tea, they'll serve to induce sleep if he wakes.
Every moment that I'm gonna be with them, she's gonna be watching me and judging me.<eos> That sound like freedom to you?<eos> What can you tell us about the guns?<eos> Well, they're not mine.<eos> I'm holding them for somebody.
That sound like freedom to you?<eos> What can you tell us about the guns?<eos> Well, they're not mine.<eos> I'm holding them for somebody.<eos> Who are you holding them for?
Logged as evidence, documented, present at trial.<eos> And the guns would have been returned here.<eos> We keep the guns for two years.<eos> Department policy.<eos> Then we mark them for disposal.
She'll be right in, son.<eos> Should I also wash, the women's panties I found?<eos> Wha... What are you trying to say?<eos> Nothing, I'm just asking you if I should wash them.<eos> That would be nice, if you can find them.
Wha... What are you trying to say?<eos> Nothing, I'm just asking you if I should wash them.<eos> That would be nice, if you can find them.<eos> I can, in a minute.<eos> If you put them in the basket.
They're both rich.<eos> So what are you thinking, an extortion plot?<eos> Bricks of cash... probably from previous successes.<eos> He targets wealthy women, tries to put them in compromising situations...<eos> And then makes them pay their way out...
When's our culture gonna outgrow this wedding thing?<eos> You're anti-wedding, now?<eos> No, she's just pro-anti.<eos> No to everything you both said.<eos> Weddings are like little girls' tea parties, except the women are the stuffed animals, the men are making them talk, and they're not drinking tea, they're drinking antiquated gender roles.
A case we consulted on about 8 months ago.<eos> 12 victims over 5 years.<eos> He crosses racial and social lines, ages, too.<eos> Power assertive?<eos> Knocks them out with a date rape drug and binds them with piano wire.
Knocks them out with a date rape drug and binds them with piano wire.<eos> They wake up with no memory of the assault or how they got the permanent scar the wire leaves.<eos> So he's branding his victims.<eos> How does he dose them?<eos> Houston P.D. still isn't sure, 'cause, you know, date rape drugs metabolize quickly, and he's keeping them for 12 hours.
Ok, maybe that's his new primary motivation.<eos> He wants to stay hidden.<eos> But look at all the details we've learned about him already.<eos> The victims could have more clues to his identity locked away in their subconscious.<eos> So he kills them before we can unlock it.
Yes.<eos> All right, looks like Danny's four miles ahead of us.<eos> Make a left at the next light. All right.<eos> Kono, what do you got?<eos> So Peterson tapped into Danny and Rachel's voice mails and downloaded them onto his computer.
- Felt real good.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Did you notice anything strange about Sheila today?<eos> You mean the shoes?<eos> It looked like she stole them off a court jester.
You're the other half nobody knows about.<eos> The half that reads Neruda and Gil Scott-Heron.<eos> You wrote all j-J-Stryke's lyrics.<eos> You and your brother have the same vocal qualities.<eos> You recorded the new tracks, and then you leaked them to the pirate.
The half that reads Neruda and Gil Scott-Heron.<eos> You wrote all j-J-Stryke's lyrics.<eos> You and your brother have the same vocal qualities.<eos> You recorded the new tracks, and then you leaked them to the pirate.<eos> Then... You dropped them off here.
Do you smell smoke?<eos> Just lei go.<eos> Just go to sleep.<eos> I had a chance to avoid this.<eos> You had many chances, and you blew them all up.
Lux?<eos> Lux?<eos> Where are my lightsabers?<eos> Lux!<eos> Artoo, take a look around and see if you can find where Lux hid them.
There's a group of marauders that would like nothing more than to hijack my Master's cargo.<eos> So far, my men have been ineffective against them.<eos> They've arrived.<eos> No matter what happens, do not open this box.<eos> You make the rules. I follow them.
What if you broke the amount of paint up into two balloons?<eos> - Or five?<eos> - Thought of that.<eos> But then the balloons aren't heavy enough to break open when they land on someone.<eos> What if you didn't tie them closed?
- No, just...<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> No, no, whatever.<eos> - Where's the pots?<eos> - I'll get them out in a second.
- I can get it really... - Perfectly straight.<eos> "My mother, all through my childhood",<eos> "when I was saying something to her," "something important," "would move her lips as I was speaking"<eos> "so that she seemed to be saying under her breath" "the very words I was saying as I was saying them."<eos> "All she was really doing, of course, was mouthing my words" "a split second after I said them myself."
I'll say.<eos> That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you.<eos> I'm sorry. It's the alcohol talking.<eos> Go on.<eos> Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
There's that frontier spirit.<eos> Okay, Gaby.<eos> It's obvious you're not picking up my hints.<eos> No, I am.<eos> I'm just ignoring them.
I panicked.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And I'm left trying to explain to the girls why you ran away.<eos> They're asking me what the fuck went on, and all I've got is more lies for them.<eos> You wanted to see them, and then you do that to them, to me!
- I'll kill myself right away!<eos> - Come home, madam.<eos> Give me my pills, black woman!<eos> None left.<eos> If you want pills, get them from your daughter.
I told him stuff. Things I've never told anyone else.<eos> We started sleeping together.<eos> Just like that, he stopped calling me.<eos> He moved on to some other messed-up girl. He befriended her.<eos> I took some pills and washed them down with a bottle of vodka.
I wasn't coming on to him.<eos> What's your point?<eos> He knocks them all back.<eos> I think he might be gay.<eos> It's a tragedy you've never seen them!
What's going on?<eos> Me nan's dog. Bobby.<eos> He had his back legs amputated yesterday.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah, they just chopped them off, replaced them with a set of wheels.
Okay, I agreed to be there for Hank as a friend, setting up his business.<eos> Just until I leave.<eos> Divya, I don't think this is something that you can fix.<eos> All right, you know those shares that you sold to Evan?<eos> He used them as leverage.
How would I get myself into a position to take a peek through Jones' papers?<eos> No.<eos> The boss is as straight as an arrow.<eos> Then he'll have nothing to hide.<eos> But if, hypothetically, we were to take a look through his papers, where would we find them?
Shit!<eos> That's it, give me the pills.<eos> Very funny, Ryan. Here we go.<eos> Down the hatch.<eos> Whoa, you're going to take them all at once?
It's our government and church combined.<eos> The church runs the government.<eos> - Like the Vatican?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> They hand down the laws, and we follow them.
I'd have girls, parties, anything I ever wanted.<eos> See, my dad knows how people are.<eos> And how are they, Eddie?<eos> Everybody always wants something.<eos> All these girls just want my dad to make them a star.
She may be our killer's muse.<eos> Muse?<eos> Muse how?<eos> Well, he's dressing the victims up in her clothes.<eos> He's making them up to look like her.
Mrs. Kemp, do you recognize these women?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Should I?<eos> They were murdered.<eos> After that, the killer gave them a makeover.
They were murdered.<eos> After that, the killer gave them a makeover.<eos> Dyed her hair blonde, red lipstick, mascara.<eos> That's... horrible.<eos> Truly, but... why are you showing them to me?
We still hit the mother lode.<eos> Lucinda's dress, Lucinda's hair, the morphine.<eos> We got him.<eos> What about hair braids?<eos> Greg's running them now, along with the rest of the hair from Fitzgerald's studio.
Exactly.<eos> One of the most lucrative rackets in New York.<eos> More profitable than selling heroin or cocaine.<eos> You make fake cigarettes for 60 bucks a carton, you sell them to a local shop for $90.<eos> They turn around and sell them for $110.
Enjoy the company.<eos> Laters, yeah?<eos> We should have stayed a bit longer.<eos> What, anything to do with the nearly naked girls?<eos> We only booked them for an hour, someone should have made sure they get home safely.
She was arrested by Detective Inspector Fisk.<eos> - Sid Fisk?<eos> - You know him?<eos> Yeah, he's bent as a nine bob note.<eos> This is how he operates. He frames people and then bangs them up.
Illegal trespass.<eos> Up to 60 days in jail.<eos> There's one guard at the gate and there's cameras in the stalls with the horses.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Timo spent his boyhood picking up betting slips off the ground and selling them to idiots for 10 cents on the dollar.
At the time, my mother died and I was sent to live with my uncle.<eos> But he doesn't live here any more.<eos> You're too young to be an orphan, Sofia.<eos> Jofio, I brought the girls because their mother went to the doctor.<eos> I saw them, no problem.
Go away.<eos> Galya, the cops are on their way.<eos> I won't let anyone take them.<eos> See sense, woman, it's a sin!<eos> Nobody's taking them.
So I'm still running it now?<eos> Of course.<eos> Fine.<eos> The girls stay fired.<eos> I'm replacing them.
Well, clearly, I'm unpopular.<eos> That much is obvious.<eos> But I really don't think I've been out of bounds.<eos> I asked the sales girls to put their grievances in writing, which they did.<eos> Tommy reviewed them.
- What's the difference?<eos> - We have a soul, a heart and emotions.<eos> Anita was almost raped by a gang of kids today.<eos> God, I'm tired of this.<eos> We copy ourselves and dehumanize them, so that we can exploit them.
I need to get inside.<eos> Uh, studio's closed.<eos> Leave the door open and walk away.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then drop the keys and let me find them.
So, what's this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?<eos> How about calling her my wife?<eos> Wives don't take boys from their mothers.<eos> They do.<eos> That's why we marry them!
Why is there a banana in your DVD cabinet?<eos> Read the banana, Britta.<eos> "You are a lying junkie."<eos> I'm sure those words hurt.<eos> But you wouldn't be reading them if they weren't true.
Watch the gates!<eos> Fucking hell!<eos> Down, down!<eos> Well... Found the bleeding keys.<eos> My wife blames me. She's the one who loses them.
The panties are mine, okay?<eos> They're mine.<eos> They don't chafe like man pants.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Don't tell my wife. I only wear them on the road.
Yeah.<eos> Well, have Dr. Hodgins swab it.<eos> Oh, were you able to analyze the wound Mr. Abernathy discovered?<eos> Um, ow.<eos> Uh, I-I'm actually waiting for the bones because Hodgins is just swabbing them first.
So what, just gonna sit back and watch?<eos> I'm a cop. It's what we do.<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> The blast shot him clear of the fire, but it doesn't look good.<eos> So Stillman takes the guards' uniforms but leaves them alive.
I just stood in the garden, trying to stop myself from walking right inside.<eos> And did you?<eos> Stop yourself?<eos> It was one of those sentimental folk songs, I bet.<eos> I cannot bear them!
Will it? !<eos> Why is it so freezing in here?<eos> I don't know. Why don't you ask tuppence a bag?<eos> Jane left the doors open and refuses to close them.<eos> I'm not closing them because I did not leave them open...
No. Dr. Penny is gonna operate.<eos> It is time for a little open-hartz... ♪ Ding ♪<eos> Surgery. I'm gonna save that for another time and place.<eos> Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I am gonna take these two doors, and I'm going to put them back together like so.
I'm sorry.<eos> Would you look at that?<eos> Nature is throwing me a bone.<eos> Haverford Playbook move number two.<eos> Ladies love a guy waiting for them in the rain.
Relax, Ferran.<eos> Nobody will recognize us<eos> It's not exactly what you asked for, but it's happened before.<eos> A movie filming with cops and robbers coincides with a zarzuela like "La Generala" and we run out of uniforms.<eos> What do you need them for?
Can't you see I'm busy?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Who sells guns like this one?<eos> - You're the policeman.<eos> - Who sells them in Madrid?
# Kiss the girls!<eos> #<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Hellharmonic!<eos> # Here is the hive, where are the bees?<eos> Buzzing around where nobody sees them. #
I don't know.<eos> J.R. Thought he could get out of all of this by leaving town, so he put John Ross in charge.<eos> I'm just afraid he's gonna tear up this whole ranch digging for oil before he's done.<eos> I did this, Annie, by rushing it.<eos> I tried to make things better, and I made them worse.
If you won't hold up your end,<eos> Uh, t-the infirmary is downtown.<eos> I-it's now a facility known as Hester's Storage.<eos> These letters have been in my family for generations.<eos> Please be careful when you test them.
Sometimes half an hour, sometimes an hour.<eos> She started meeting with women in the tea rooms, see if they had any medical troubles.<eos> So she was running a clinic.<eos> Helping those women is hardly a crime.<eos> Depends what she helped them do.
You see, Mr Colgan is married.<eos> So it's possible someone might know of your regular tryst.<eos> We were always very discreet.<eos> And the keys?<eos> When I left for the storeroom, I left them on the hook.
Don't waste a trip.<eos> You can take Marigold's things back to her father.<eos> What things?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> The police have finished with them.
Who told you that?<eos> Your priest?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Doctor MacMillan.<eos> They used to grind up the roots of those purple ones and use them for poison arrows.
Luke and Haley used cookie sheets to clear a path through the marbles for me.<eos> Where are the marbles?<eos> Right here.<eos> Oh, Haley!<eos> I put glue on them so it doesn't happen again.
And I saw Ramon out on the lawn, yelling his head off.<eos> And then Sam came to the door and told Ramon to leave.<eos> Leave or he'd call the police.<eos> Ramon went back to his car, and he got these bottles of gas.<eos> He lit them, and he threw them on the porch.
Yeah, these aren't from target, people.<eos> And I wore these to my first chemo session.<eos> And six sessions later, I was in remission.<eos> Yep, they say it was the chemo, but I know it was the shoes.<eos> I mean, you might call these my "fuck me" shoes, but you know what I call them?
Grabbing Lloyd slows us down.<eos> They probably got electrodes hooked up to his brain right now.<eos> Yeah, unlikely.<eos> Well, then, to his nuts.<eos> If they can find them.
Whose room is this?<eos> It's reserved by a company called Garlin International.<eos> It's one of six rooms they booked on the floor.<eos> Yeah. All right.<eos> A lot of companies held rooms for the fund-raiser, but wound up not using them.
I want you to tell me what happened the day you killed my brother, and it'll be easier if you drive while we talk.<eos> That way, we don't have to look at each other.<eos> The bridal party was at the exact same after-hours club as the victim.<eos> Okay, didn't Jerry tell you to back off?<eos> New plan... we keep the girls here a little longer, and then we interview them as potential witnesses.
Has Lea contacted you today?<eos> No, actually, I-I haven't met either one of these girls.<eos> You just said you recognized them.<eos> Well, yes, of course.<eos> I recognize them from their photos.
No, actually, I-I haven't met either one of these girls.<eos> You just said you recognized them.<eos> Well, yes, of course.<eos> I recognize them from their photos.<eos> You see, detectives, we arranged for them to get their visas, and then we enroll them in an exchange program.
I recognize them from their photos.<eos> You see, detectives, we arranged for them to get their visas, and then we enroll them in an exchange program.<eos> Now, three months ago, these girls flew here from Dubrovnik.<eos> We sent a van over to Logan to pick them up.<eos> We couldn't find them.
I got no idea how to keep everyone alive.<eos> I miss your old man.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Tara found some letters.<eos> Maureen Ashby stuffed them in my gear.
He wrote to me incessantly, he even requested to visit me, which I allowed him do... twice.<eos> At the time, you see, I regarded him as a supporter.<eos> But looking back I realise now that it wasn't me he was obsessed with.<eos> He was obsessed with the women I was accused of having murdered.<eos> He certainly knew far more about them than I ever did.

Have you thought any more about telling the girls?<eos> I can't, not at the minute.<eos> Not with a job like this one.<eos> I hardly see them as it is, never mind -<eos> Why don't we try and organise a Sunday off together and take them for a meal and tell them?
And you?<eos> Picking up fascists.<eos> Oh, marvellous.<eos> Apparently, she did photographs... Artistic ones.<eos> I thought maybe if I found them, then...
It's acting of sorts.<eos> It costs if you want me just to be yours.<eos> Beats cigarette cards.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> Well, no-one makes them do it. - What?
Go to El Paradis tomorrow.<eos> Try and see if any of these girls work there?<eos> Maybe they'll talk.<eos> Who took these photographs?<eos> Who distributes them?
Of course, you may think the SLS is more technical, more spectacular, and that's true, it is.<eos> The engine is a masterpiece.<eos> The seven speed, double clutch gearbox is mounted at the back for better weight distribution.<eos> The prop shaft is made from carbon fibre and only weighs four kilograms.<eos> And all the little changes they've made to the suspension on the convertible are so successful they're applying them to the coupe as well.
The doves were just a drill.<eos> Everyone needs to be on their toes for my wedding year.<eos> I'm gonna be a nightmare.<eos> Wait, if that was a drill, did you kill those doves?<eos> No, I bought them at the dead-dove store.
The letters?<eos> I have news for you...<eos> they're not even on the ship.<eos> I'm not listening to you anymore.<eos> You're not gonna find them behind that door. Oh!
He and Victor think so much alike now they're like two pigs reaching for the same truffle.<eos> Put him on board the ship.<eos> Let him walk around in Victor's shoes for awhile...<eos> Let him think that it's his idea.<eos> He'll locate the Tesla letters... and he'll deliver them to us.
Since the spread of lyme disease, tick DNA has been catalogued down to the county.<eos> Might get you to where she was infested.<eos> My office and the NYPD are going after the person or persons responsible for this tragedy.<eos> But it's not just the killer we're putting on notice.<eos> It's the escort services in the back pages of papers like The Downtown Voice who pimp out these young women and mark them as easy prey.
Haley's mom got another call.<eos> Benson's with her now.<eos> So Haley could still be alive.<eos> The ME found ketamine in all the vics?<eos> Yeah, probably putting them in a K-hole.
Even though he'd signed to RCA the previous year, the record label hadn't raised Bowie's US profile at all.<eos> Tony's plan was to open an office in New York and use RCA's money to pretend David was already huge in America.<eos> Just as Bowie had pretended with Ziggy.<eos> Some old Warhol friends were drafted in to help.<eos> He had two bodyguards and he dressed them bodyguards in karate costumes.
How close was I to the same fate?<eos> Oh, hand me one of those zip ties on the table there, will you?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Fucking Christmas lights.<eos> Every year I put them up, and every year I wonder why I bothered.
The diameter's consistent with the mouth of a bottle-- say a bottle of Scotch shoved down his throat.<eos> As for pills, I found no solid remnants in his stomach.<eos> Well, how-how did the drugs get into his system, then?<eos> Henry tested the Scotch bottle and found toxic levels of alprazolam.<eos> So, somebody ground up the pills, dissolved them, spiked the drink...
There are codes, rules of social life to be respected if you don't want to end up in your neighbour's stomach.<eos> Concealment becomes an art for these octopi, capable of changing the colour and structure of their skin to deceive their attackers.<eos> Despite the risks of this collective existence, many species use the reef as a nursery.<eos> Of all the ocean, it is still the place that offers the best chance for raising a family.<eos> Cuttlefish protect their eggs by hiding them as deep as possible in the branches of the coral so that other fish cannot eat them.
It seems that the plankton, the base of all the food chains, is moving toward the polar region where the waters are still temperate.<eos> In 50 years, it has moved 1, 200 kilometres further northwards.<eos> This redistribution of plankton is already having an effect on marine life.<eos> Every year, cownose rays migrate between Brazil and the temperate zones in search of food.<eos> Every year, the journey takes them a little higher, a little further north.
And Holly?<eos> Thank you.<eos> How you feeling, Stuart?<eos> Where'd your boobies go?<eos> The booby monster took them.
Am I supposed to be sorry?<eos> No...<eos> Because I won't be sorry to you... So there's no need for you to be sorry to me either.<eos> What are you sorry to me about?<eos> The batteries in the mike... you took them out, didn't you?
Send me to Australia.<eos> From now on, think about the grace of your parents...<eos> And pull out everything that's buried deep inside all your hearts, and you'll take the time to write them a letter.<eos> Who it was that broke our parents so, and who made sagged our parents shoulders,<eos> The wrinkles on your parents' hands, the wrinkles on your parents' face, Who put them there?
- No.<eos> - Take another look.<eos> Look closer.<eos> Look at their faces.<eos> No, I don't know them.
- I think it looks nice.<eos> - Quite trendy.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Go and make sure no one sees me.<eos> I'll take them off.
Put that down.<eos> Put it down!<eos> I loved those girls, and I never knew why they all disappeared.<eos> Tell me,... what have I done?<eos> You poisoned them.
Look, I know how you're feeling, 'cause I've been right where you are.<eos> He has. In that exact chair, probably using that same fork.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You can't give up or give in.<eos> And stuffing your emotions with food ain't gonna make them go away.
You've got me for a daughter, what else do you need'?<eos> As you're not grateful for your mum, what do you want'?<eos> I don't want anything. I came to keep you company and you ask me to iron dad's undies.<eos> You know how fussy he is.<eos> As if anyone can see them.
Perhaps I could just... check your blood pressure?<eos> Your blood pressure's fine.<eos> It's nice to see you, father.<eos> Your roses look fantastic.<eos> I had them cut earlier this year.
It's nice to see you, father.<eos> Your roses look fantastic.<eos> I had them cut earlier this year.<eos> It's an experiment.<eos> Well, it paid off. I've never seen them looking any better.
My own son?<eos> Because the cuffs happen to look like mine?<eos> - We found your fingerprints on them.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> Unless - I suppose that someone could have stolen them from my office.
Why?<eos> I have three daughters, all right?<eos> I wouldn't want them being treated the way Jay treated women.<eos> How was that?<eos> Use them and toss them.
This is very important, a Range Rover does not just work in the countryside, it has to work in the city as well.<eos> And so must this.<eos> What I normally do in towns is going to the baker's.<eos> Morning. Have you got an iced finger?<eos> There are many regulations, as you would imagine, this being Britain, governing the use of mobility scooters and this meets almost all of them.
She was with me from the start. She believed in me.<eos> When she found out about the research results, she just said we should come forward. She wasn't threatening anyone.<eos> I told Darin, and he...<eos> Look, you have to understand, he's been my partner since college, okay?<eos> I just had some ideas. He turned them into a business.
No food, no water.<eos> I wanted to get outght, of there.<eos> The victim ID'd you.<eos> You had her credit cards when we arrested you.<eos> I told you that I found them in a dumpster.
I wasn't done with him.<eos> You actually think he's gonna tell you where she is?<eos> Remember that gear I brought to wipe the Black Box?<eos> I just used it to copy Ari's hard drive.<eos> If we want answers, we'll get them ourselves.
Fieldstone?<eos> Petrified potatoes?<eos> You want me to stick you with this again?<eos> Look, I didn't say those things because-- because I got shot, or... because I lost my mom, even though losing her made me realize how fast life can go.<eos> I said those things because I wanted you to hear them.
Once a SEAL, always a SEAL.<eos> You should know that, Agent Hanna.<eos> Protocol dictates there's a backup team ready to step in.<eos> It's a maze of tunnels.<eos> 16 months ago, these same six men took those tunnels and occupied them for four days.
They picked you for a reason.<eos> Janet, you're not--<eos> Look, I've been on the road doing comedy, standup for all these years because I can do that and then-- I make my own schedule and then I'm able to take my time with the kids<eos> so they're with me half the time, they're used to that, they need that.<eos> Louie, you'll see them on the weekends, you'll have them over the summer.
Janet, you're not--<eos> Look, I've been on the road doing comedy, standup for all these years because I can do that and then-- I make my own schedule and then I'm able to take my time with the kids<eos> so they're with me half the time, they're used to that, they need that.<eos> Louie, you'll see them on the weekends, you'll have them over the summer.<eos> Yes, you'll see them a lot less, but that's because you'll have a job.
It's not what I'm worried about. I'm worried about the felon part.<eos> Yeah, that's a reasonable concern.<eos> Okay, I'll get the shirt.<eos> I don't want this guy in my life.<eos> He was in prison. He steals things and hides them in his ass.
- Do you have a question?<eos> I need to talk to her.<eos> Well, I have reports to attend to and maybe a chance I shall eat dinner, so...<eos> I'm glad you were able to come to the classes.<eos> I hope you're finding them useful.
I can imagine what you're thinking, but I assure you I'm only the messenger.<eos> The bishop himself has determined that this experiment has run its course and would prefer that the hospital's resources be applied to other areas, effective immediately.<eos> What about the women who've been coming?<eos> They will have to seek their information elsewhere.<eos> You needn't bother with the chairs. The cleaning staff will move them out.
Threats?<eos> I mean, probably the machine just backfired.<eos> These threats, were they credible threats?<eos> Did you report them?<eos> Yeah. We logged them with the police.
Why are you rushing me?<eos> Dori, are we doing this or not?<eos> Oh, you're here.<eos> I don't know how long these pills are gonna last.<eos> I got them online from Mexico.
We're doing it, guys.<eos> We're officially doing road rules, man. - Mm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> - This is great.<eos> Do you guys know what this thing does to panties?<eos> Sops them, then drops them.
Gay men don't necessarily want to have sex with every guy they see.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> No, really.<eos> Come on Giles, you have to say that, but really? Well, it's like you with women.<eos> Do you want to bang them all?
It's smaller than the Maserati, much like Lincolnshire, so it is easier to park and it has a fantastic central command unit which not only tells you where you are and what you're listening to, but also,<eos> if you push this button here, how much G you're generating in the bends.<eos> Where the throttle is and how much brake you're using<eos> AND the condition of your tyres.<eos> What it should say is, "Very poor, because in the last corner you turned them all into smoke."
The prosecution now calls to the stand Elizabeth Clark.<eos> Yes, they were my shoes. I bought them a little over three months ago.<eos> And, Miss Clark, you're saying you loaned the shoes to the deceased, Chelsea Bartlett?<eos> I did.<eos> She liked them, and I wasn't wearing them that night.
Such a waste.<eos> You sound like you understand them.<eos> I understand their frustration.<eos> The corporations keep squeezing.<eos> How can an honest working man defend himself these days when the corporations hide their dirty practices behind a justice system that supports them.
And I knew that as long as Bill was alive...<eos> Brian wasn't gonna be able to put her death behind him, or ever be happy.<eos> I just wanted my brother to be happy, detective. That's all I ever wanted.<eos> Love, love hazelnuts.<eos> They don't put them in gift baskets anymore. I know.
lowfat turkey jerky... low-carb beer... 100-calorie snack pack...<eos> You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.<eos> Hey, I plan on leveling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.<eos> Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice, between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side. Well, we're always the good guys.<eos> In DD, we're lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we're the heroes, and Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly, and never hit them with a bat.
And if they do go out, it will close a door for me, so what I need you guys to do at Thanksgiving is to create an atmosphere that's as desexualized as possible.<eos> I think we can handle that.<eos> Count me out.<eos> My mom's dragging me to "angry lady" Thanksgiving.<eos> My aunts just sit around and bitch about how their men have done them wrong and let them down. - The guys aren't around?
Walter is not exactly the poster boy for mental health.<eos> Bipolar, doesn't take his meds.<eos> Another great combination, huh?<eos> Said he didn't like the way they "made him feel."<eos> Never mind how it made anyone else feel when he was off them.
I've seen him work the counter maybe twice.<eos> Okay, well, if the sales were bogus and Rich didn't know when the deal was gonna go down...<eos> He hid them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So where'd Richie boy hide them?
I can't stop thinking about the night... The night we were together?<eos> We were never together.<eos> The night we killed Winfred Haverford.<eos> I never felt such powerful sensations.<eos> And I know you feel them too, towards me.
All right.<eos> I don't know if this is related, but this Elkins woman... she was Mike's type.<eos> Type in what way?<eos> Here's how it worked with him.<eos> He'd... he'd go out and interview victims, and if he could end up helping them and they were, you know, an attractive woman, he'd... he'd talk them into a one-nighter.
And why someone would wanna take him.<eos> One of the first tests of his memory, I... I gave him these pages.<eos> Ma-na-ba-fa...<eos> Meaningless random syllables, four pages of them.<eos> I read them to him and he recited them back.
As a spy, your job is often to get people to break the rules.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's him.<eos> Here we go. You use their greed, their fear, or their rage to make them betray the things they value most.<eos> With a professional spy pushing them hard, most people abandon their principles.
Not if I do it first.<eos> I'll keep an eye on the jury.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> Morning!<eos> Wasn't sure how you liked your eggs, and so I scrambled them.
Eventually, the producers told us to stop arguing about wood and get on with the first challenge.<eos> A simple straight-line race from nought to 100 then back to nought again.<eos> Sadly, this led to another dispute.<eos> What do you mean, "a Le Mans start"?<eos> On go, we run to our cars, jump in, start them and drive off.
That Jake said he loved me.<eos> I didn't say it back, and I didn't know why.<eos> What I did know was why I loved ice cream.<eos> It was a delicious, comforting and cruel reminder of how cold I must have seemed when I left Jake hanging.<eos> But I never left my hoodies hanging because it was obvious I loved them.
I must wait upon my good lord here, I thank you, good Sir John.<eos> Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go.<eos> Will you sup with me, Master Gower?<eos> What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?<eos> Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool that taught them me.
I have wanted to order from this place for months, But I never called because the minimum is 30 bucks, Which is no problem if you're ordering for two!<eos> Um, listen, tyler, I-I need to talk to you about...<eos> Wait. Are we not hearing a team of smart horses counting upstairs?<eos> We are not, because I got your neighbor a pair of slippers.<eos> Nice guy... little confused by the free slippers, but... He's wearing them.
Do you think she went in there?<eos> Those are mine.<eos> You gave tweezers to a mental patient?<eos> Of course not!<eos> She probably stole them.
- Say you understand.<eos> - 30 seconds.<eos> Someone's gonna spill coffee on a button and broadcast that thing. - Get it off.<eos> - I've got a one-week contract. I don't have a lot to lose.<eos> I'm just glad nobody's invented a way to digitally store images and upload them onto a free website where anyone can see them.
I brought in six new corporate clients.<eos> Okay, and what is it you do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, you know, bonbons, bubble baths, naps, shoe shopping.<eos> Oh, that's right, you mediate. You take potentially lucrative lawsuits and try and settle them out of court.
But the ninhydrins brought up some useful prints on the paper.<eos> Okay.<eos> It sounds to me like after the shooting, our guy leaves the diner looking to dump the guns somewhere and sees the newspaper machine.<eos> For a buck in quarters, he's found a pretty good place to hide them.<eos> It's already Monday-- it's unlikely that anybody's going to buy the Sunday paper, so the guns stay put until the delivery guy hauls them away. Mm-hmm.
Where's Scott?<eos> Um, Kathy, he's gone.<eos> I mean, why... why can't I see him?<eos> Where are the ashes?<eos> The judge awarded them to his stepmother.
It was worth a shot.<eos> Jane.<eos> - Hey. Did the police find the ashes?<eos> - No. Caitlin didn't waste any time.<eos> She already dumped them.
- It was you. I was sitting right here.<eos> - Napoleon.<eos> Things worked out well for him.<eos> Weren't there girls standing here a minute ago?<eos> Yes, you scared them off with your WikiNerd pitch.
That means other people are going to want a piece of it, and trust me, that has a way of ending badly.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, um... Slow down and start from the beginning.<eos> What causes the anomalies?<eos> How do I stop them?
How do I stop them?<eos> You can't.<eos> They're a force of nature.<eos> You'll just end up making things worse if you...<eos> If you don't leave them alone.
What stars?<eos> Like the real stars.<eos> Not like the ones in the city.<eos> The ones... the ones in the desert that spread right across the sky.<eos> She promised me that we'd see them and that we'd see them together.
I'll discuss this with you later.<eos> Stefan?<eos> It's not his fault.<eos> It's just what he's been taught.<eos> A lot of people believe terrible things but that doesn't make them true.
Yeah, but she's talking about a time of serious trauma, on a night she climbed into bed with her dying mother.<eos> That plus her age, it's the perfect storm for a recovered memory.<eos> Wasn't that a huge therapy trend in the eighties?<eos> A lot of women manufactured memories of their fathers doing horrific things.<eos> And misguided therapists convinced them that their nightmares were real.
My father wrote letters to Maureen Ashby, telling her that he feared Clay would kill him for trying to get the club out of guns.<eos> He even told her he'd sabotage his bike.<eos> Clay killed my old man.<eos> Maureen put the letters in my bag when we left Belfast.<eos> Tara found them, gave them to Piney.
Oh, my God, right.<eos> Okay, so if I got, like, more skin or something, then I could, like, never do a bad thing in my life, and maybe I never have done a bad thing 'cause I have a lot of skin.<eos> That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is, given your... nontraditional life choices, you are surprisingly well-adjusted.<eos> Yeah, I'm well-adjusted, you know, because of my lack of traditions, and I'll adjust to that, and...<eos> I feel like you're mirroring my words, but you're not exactly understanding them.
So, Lutz.<eos> You thought I left you off the hook the other day?<eos> Well, you wish.<eos> I spent the whole night going through the garbage trying to find the perfect thing to humiliate you.<eos> Yeah, we know. We took photos of you and sold them to a garbage fetish website.
The single greatest threat to our clean water supply.<eos> Um... Well, that's not really my department,<eos> - But, um, we-- we do need new sources of energy...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And, uh, someone's gotta find them
Why have you come back?<eos> That's between me and Mrs Caleigh.<eos> You're disturbing the dead.<eos> That can't be helped, I'm afraid.<eos> If you care about your children, you'll take them home.
Detectives went over to Winnock's office.<eos> Somebody beat us to it, cleaned out his files.<eos> Still nothing on Kimball.<eos> Only five roads lead out of Vegas.<eos> We got eyes on all of them.
Tungsten mine is three miles away. And Bullhead City is here.<eos> Which is where the girls got on the truck.<eos> We know they were traveling on foot.<eos> And they couldn't have gotten more than a couple miles.<eos> So wherever the father was holding them had to be in the area,right?
Well, I wish I could do it for you.<eos> I wish you could have a normal life.<eos> I don't know what'll happen with Juliette. But don't make the same mistake I did.<eos> Don't leave the people you love.<eos> Even if that puts them in danger?
- And mine.<eos> For centuries, supernatural creatures have lived among us.<eos> They were vampires, werewolves, doppelgangers, witches.<eos> And even hybrids.<eos> There are those who protect them...
There are those who protect them...<eos> What's going on?<eos> We just need to ask you a few questions about your son.<eos> You have no idea what you're up against.<eos> And those who want them dead.
Anyway, I realized that things were done for Kyle and me.<eos> I'd thought about it a lot, and I went over to talk to him.<eos> Of course -- wouldn't you know it -- he was like, "No, I need to talk to you about something first."<eos> He proposed. It was beautiful.<eos> Kyle swept me right off my feet, and I never got them back underneath me till he walked out that door.
In our misery, we were on an intimate footing... with half of Scandinavia.<eos> It was terrible, and I cried and cried.<eos> And then on the airplane, you know... a colleague of mine was there... and I wrote letters to him how terrible this was... and he had to help me, and my letters were so bad... that later I asked him, "What did you do with the letters?"<eos> I said, on the airplane.<eos> He said, "I ate them because I didn't want anyone to see them."
- Except, of course, for little miss I'm-only-15-and-my- muscles-never-ache Wendy.<eos> I swear, I want to just lock her in the equipment cage and never let her out.<eos> We should put Jordan in there with her.<eos> Wasn't it interesting that Coach Mclntire knew all the choreography to our routines even though we never showed him?<eos> And who else saw them?
How could you know who I am?<eos> I mean, you're never even around?<eos> I don't think you care about me or Payson! You know what?<eos> Jordan was right about you.<eos> You use people, and then you throw them away.
well,now we have a bigger problem.<eos> Peck found the bug,and he just gave us the slip.<eos> Peck's cashed out his bank accounts.<eos> His credit cards are popping up at cheap hotels and liquor stores all over the city.<eos> He's probably handing them out to the homeless.
Clearly, the killer wanted to demean and objectify the thing that Cassandra loved most -- being a mermaid.<eos> Okay, now you're making fun.<eos> Okay, maybe just a little.<eos> No, it's like when you get a new pair of shoes delivered. You don't just throw them in the closet.<eos> You try them on first.
- Yeah, I'm serious. I've been in more old white women than osteoporosis.<eos> What?<eos> Gum job, man.<eos> Malloy, I found those chocolate bars you like, little buddy.<eos> They don't sell them around here, so, you know, I had to drive all the way to- 70% cacao?
I'll tell you anything to make it stop. You want secrets?<eos> I'll give you secrets.<eos> This couch... Is a failure. I hate golf.<eos> One time in college, I smoked a clove cigarette.<eos> I keep buying candles as gifts and keeping them for myself.
And talk Prentiss down off the ledge.<eos> Oh, my stomach doesn't feel so hot.<eos> I was in the middle of the best dream.<eos> I dreamt that I was at this exclusive salon getting my hair done.<eos> Ah, the psychotherapeutic benefits of dreams-- purging unpleasant images and replacing them with good ones.
What you doing?<eos> I just saw those little things, thought the girls might like them.<eos> It could wait till the weekend.<eos> I can act on impulse, can't I?<eos> Let them know I'm thinking about them.
I can act on impulse, can't I?<eos> Let them know I'm thinking about them.<eos> It just helps me to know when you're coming.<eos> Not to just turn up.<eos> I know that, but if they know that I'm thinking about them, then they know that... I love them. What's wrong with that?
Morning, Mum.<eos> See you, Mum.<eos> Bye.<eos> Dad?<eos> I know where there are some bottles at home if you want them.
I'm hungry.<eos> For the last time, no burgers yet.<eos> I've got ribs, and I've got beef cheek.<eos> Ron, where are my vegan soy patties?<eos> Oh, I gave them to the kids.
- You saved us tonight. Thank you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Okay, kids.<eos> I did lose your kids.<eos> I wasn't properly looking on, and I lost them.
Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> I should shoot you.<eos> But you need me.<eos> You want answers and I have them.
It all got me thinking. What if she does the same thing with guys? She always has a backup.<eos> I was her backup with Wyatt.<eos> Philip was her backup with me. But he wasn't into her, so she dropped him for Randy.<eos> I need more batteries for my not so tiny dancers.<eos> Of course you need batteries. You've been playing that for hours. You're going to wear them out.
Right.<eos> Sorry to bug you, but...<eos> It's okay. I get it.<eos> Now do you see all the joy these things bring, Virginia?<eos> And you wanted to take them down.
If I stumble across something, I will help out, but I don't go looking for it.<eos> Iris has two little sisters, and one of them is sick-- she can hardly breathe.<eos> So take her to the ER.<eos> They're here illegally.<eos> I take them to the ER, they'd get reported, they'd get sent home.
Stella.<eos> Always asking' dad, "when are you gonna bring...<eos> Stella?"<eos> You never said that once.<eos> He's always thinking things and then not saying them.
I was in a zone. It's like I knew right where he was going to put it - and boom...<eos> - Goes the dynamite!<eos> How did you know about that story? YouTube.<eos> They have a whole series of your greatest hits.<eos> I've seen them all.
I know that.<eos> But we can't refuse the Queen when she's granted us safe passage, can we?<eos> Where did you learn to juggle like that?<eos> Honestly, I didn't even know you could catch.<eos> Yes, well, I have many talents. You've failed to notice them, that's all. Come on, out with it.
'Cause I specifically said no banana!<eos> Well, if you said no banana, then there was not a banana in there.<eos> There were two bananas in the kitchen.<eos> If I go in there right now, are there still going to be two bananas?<eos> Vince ate them.
This place is trembling.<eos> Anyone who knows how to wrap the thread around the machine?<eos> Anyone who can use a wrapping machine?<eos> Why on earth have you brought these people here?<eos> Hasan picked them up.
We have a millionaire, a college kid, a grandfather and a man licensed to drive a bulldozer.<eos> - We're still searching for common enemies.<eos> - All right. Let's start with connections.<eos> Well, all four victims followed a Twitter account linked to the Office of Naval Intelligence.<eos> And that's what got them killed.
Lester?<eos> Ed, thanks.<eos> In dozens of major cities around the world, this morning's panic is trending towards spates of both individual and group suicides.<eos> Here in New York, there have been at least 16 separate incidents reported.<eos> Witnesses say in most cases an overwhelming depression gripped the victims and ultimately led them to take their own lives.
Look, I didn't know it. I just found out when I watched the video that I'd made out with your mother.<eos> Is it just me or is he saying the words "I made out with your mother" way more than he needs to?<eos> Yeah, I don't know why he's doing that.<eos> You know, I'm sure that he has brushed his teeth a whole bunch since then, sweetheart. And, also, the boobs that he grabbed, they're not even mine anymore.<eos> After the recall, your Uncle Andy turned them into an art piece for Nana.
You know that. I mean...<eos> You find something, which you won't, it won't be admissible.<eos> I can be back in two hours with another warrant for the house but her Prius is parked on the street, and the license plate matches the one on the warrant.<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> We lost them.
I'm doing everything to make us good again.<eos> I promise you, I'm doing everything.<eos> But work are calling me back in.<eos> Are my girls in there?<eos> I don't want you upsetting them.
- The nuclei of comets are... very fragile entities.<eos> If you had a chunk, you could probably break it easily in your hands.<eos> narrator: Up close, comets look like bland chunks of charcoal rather than supersized snowballs.<eos> They don't even remotely resemble the glowing orbs we see in our pitch-black skies.<eos> - We think that most comets are extremely dark on their surfaces, that the surfaces are covered with something kind of like barbecue soot, this really dark, black material that makes them very difficult to see. narrator:
Our spaceship now shadows NASA's EPOXl mission as it encounters Hartley 2, a fast-spinning comet that tumbles through space like a hyperactive cosmic peanut.<eos> - Hartley 2 is a smaller comet. It's only about a mile or so across, and so it's kind of a surprise that it's so active.<eos> It's putting off huge amounts of C02 and, actually, cyanide gas.<eos> And the question is, are all small comets active like this or only a few?<eos> And what makes them so active?
Take a run at her.<eos> How you holding up?<eos> I miss my daughters.<eos> Well, it's best that they stay out of town.<eos> You can join them, after the Grand Jury.
They spent the whole day, boss, and they can't tell just from these little things where they're transmitting to.<eos> You know, we should've left them on.<eos> Whoever planted these things is going to know that we're on to them.<eos> No, I need privacy in my own home.<eos> And who the hell did plant them?
Familicides by non-family members are rare.<eos> Now, we're looking for an unsub without a family who is envious and wants to destroy the very thing that he cannot have.<eos> He was raised in a dysfunctional family, which he lost or may have even murdered.<eos> These abductions were not random.<eos> He monitored the families on the Internet and picked them because their dynamics mirror his own, yet they project the appearance of perfection that he fantasizes about.
And as long as I have these lucky...<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no, don't freak out. Don't freak out.<eos> We'll get them.
I just got collect call from Oleg.<eos> She said we are closed.<eos> And who are you?<eos> I'm the last person you will see before you learn how to walk again.<eos> Stay away from Oleg, or I'll pull your intestines out through your nose and give them to her to wear as new necklace.
This old building sucks me so hard.<eos> Congratulations, ladies.<eos> This is your lucky night.<eos> Speaking of luck, here are your pearls.<eos> I found most of them, but I think Chestnut ate a few.
Aww, a year later you're still trying to get me to feel things.<eos> Do you wanna know the real reason I thought this necklace was so lucky?<eos> I was wearing it the day I met you.<eos> So, I'm gonna have some extras do you wanna make one for yourself?<eos> Nah, I've had plenty of pearl necklaces, and I find them more sticky than lucky.
I don't know; I don't care.<eos> I can't do this, Berta.<eos> It's just... it's too much. She just never stops.<eos> Yeah, I raised four daughters.<eos> The only thing that slows them down is jail and johnsons.
Well, the killer did exhibit a certain degree of tenderness.<eos> Oh, yeah, real tender, starting with tenderizing her head.<eos> Got a suspect ... Herbert Buckley.<eos> Served two years on an AB, released two months ago.<eos> He liked to hire hookers and make them pretend they were dolls.
Oh, yeah, real tender, starting with tenderizing her head.<eos> Got a suspect ... Herbert Buckley.<eos> Served two years on an AB, released two months ago.<eos> He liked to hire hookers and make them pretend they were dolls.<eos> And hit them in the head with a crowbar. Nice.
He scorched a lot of earth when he left for his island adventure.<eos> A little smoke damage here, but I wasn't totally unprepared.<eos> You knew he was gonna run?<eos> Something I've learned -- things get stolen, and people go away.<eos> Most of the time, you don't get them back.
Peaceful...<eos> And dead.<eos> These photos were taken in the same bed but it's not that bed.<eos> He lives here.<eos> But he must kill them there.
What, you thinking it was seized guns?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> BPD seizes close to a thousand guns a year.<eos> Good scam.<eos> Cops seize the guns, Paddy takes them from us.
Cops seize the guns, Paddy takes them from us.<eos> A million bucks right there if you can figure a way to get it out of here.<eos> How?<eos> They're logged in, weighed, and dropped into these barrels.<eos> Armored car takes them away to be melted down.
In case there's a hurricane.<eos> You are cooking a gigantic love feast for Nancy.<eos> Family love feast, and I called Elizabitch and she's cool to cover derby practice for tonight.<eos> The girls hate Elizabitch.<eos> She's always sticking them in the penalty box!
Yeah, it's like you get to learn the whole world again from scratch. Just...<eos> I have this three-seat tandem bike that I force them to ride.<eos> It has long streamers and it's pretty embarrassing, for them, not for me.<eos> When I was younger, I drove my bike into a park bench and had to get two fingers reattached. See?<eos> Yeah, I call them my Franken-fingers.
I'm sorry.<eos> I figured, since you're always coming to my pool.<eos> You didn't call me back.<eos> I needed to figure some things out.<eos> - Did you figure them out?
Good deed number 67, right on.<eos> Change the world one friend at a time.<eos> What's your plan, Colleen?<eos> Uh, well, I'm e-mailing my picture to some Japanese girls who have their Web site video on this phone.<eos> I told them if they're ever in Oregon, I will take them to our classic vinyl store and buy them an LP.
YOU'RE LYING.<eos> I WISH I WAS.<eos> WE KNOW ABOUT THE FINGERPRINTS, STEVIE.<eos> BINGHAM FOUND CAMERAS IN THE LIBRARY.<eos> WHO DO YOU THINK PUT THEM THERE?
Can you confirms the rumors that the womb--<eos> Oh, I'll confirm something for you.<eos> Womb Raider is a name that you gave him.<eos> I won't glorify him. I call him a murderer.<eos> Then exactly how is he killing them?
Tom said he would drive.<eos> He said he would drive you or take you? He...<eos> He probably meant on the bus.<eos> Tom knows all the bus routes.<eos> He has them all memorized.
Um, reflux is caused by things that we ingest, so have you made any changes to your diet, any new drugs?<eos> I am on a new mood stabilizer.<eos> Hmm, you should consider upping your dosage.<eos> I can take a look at your medications, if you like.<eos> Let me go get them.
- Or maybe Wesley just thinks it's happened.<eos> I mean, these aren't legitimate magazines, this is conspiracy-theory trash.<eos> - Might not matter.<eos> - No, if the boy's Troubled, what counts is what's real in his mind.<eos> - So Wesley's obsessed over these stories, and now he's reproducing them.
Just one of these little cuties gives the holder intense focus and a powerful drive to achieve any goal he sets.<eos> Cool.<eos> However, prolonged exposure can lead to violence... Uh, less cool.<eos> And ultimately insanity and/or stroke.<eos> I searched for them back in the '70s, but I was never able to find 'em.
Tell me everything you know about my mother,and I will give you this journal.<eos> All I can tell you is that your mother was the source of all of David's pain. Now...<eos> If you don't care to share his writings,that's your prerogative.<eos> But you're family now.<eos> And it's my hope that one day you will share them, if not out of respect for me,out of love for your father.
This place does my head in sometimes.<eos> So, did you find your trainers?<eos> No.<eos> Are you absolutely sure they were stolen, Jamie?<eos> Because, if you've just lost them or something, I won't be cross.
I'm sorry. I'm confused.<eos> What are you saying, exactly?<eos> You know what I'm saying.<eos> The blood on his trainers will be from a nosebleed.<eos> Because he tried to suggest Robert might've taken them.
Here we have the jewel in our crown, our computer block.<eos> Ooh, impressive!<eos> Reminds me of the set up we used to have before the damn things went missing last year.<eos> No doubt pilfered by some oik to help fund scratch cards and popcorn chicken.<eos> Oh, never mind. We soon replaced them - raffled off one of our Rembrandts.
How do I do that?<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> Well, nothing now.<eos> You know what he does to his victims.<eos> Well, he lures them off trains with trust, gets them alone, kills them.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Get your cupcake on because we're gonna get balled.<eos> Sophie, this is so generous of you to offer to buy us dresses for the gala. As much as my shoes love being in their place of birth--<eos> Your shoes were born here?<eos> Mine were born in China but I adopted them at Payless.
See the gold bits?<eos> We're wondering if you know where a custom load like that might come from.<eos> Well, it's not a custom load. It's a custom piece, gold-plated.<eos> The gold flakes are from the barrel-- they shoot out with the load.<eos> Who's using them?
We're wondering if you know where a custom load like that might come from.<eos> Well, it's not a custom load. It's a custom piece, gold-plated.<eos> The gold flakes are from the barrel-- they shoot out with the load.<eos> Who's using them?<eos> Most people don't use them; they're just for show.
- Why?<eos> What did I ever do to him?<eos> I just got here.<eos> But you knew it was going to happen.<eos> I want answers, and I want them now.
Yeah, but think about it.<eos> Those little wings would get crushed in a second.<eos> Unless...<eos> She likes to be on top.<eos> Maybe she uses them to hover.
See you on the softball field!<eos> Over here is our kitchen, where we make all our meals.<eos> And upstairs is where we sleep.<eos> What about your wives and families?<eos> Sometimes we don't see them for long periods of time.
♪<eos> In the middle of the night, she opens the drawer to find the preserved cat head from last week.<eos> She can feel the fish smothering her brain, and the magic scrubbing of their furry little heads across her skin is doing less and less good.<eos> And she decides this is because the little heads are of low quality, and she needs more of them.<eos> She needs more of them from higher pedigree cats, little heads with better hairdos and cleaner little ears and clearer eyes.
That's one sexy face.<eos> Check out those tits.<eos> Totally hot.<eos> She's gonna die soon anyway.<eos> No one will know if I touched them while she was still alive.
Men and women are wired differently.<eos> Men are visual, and women are, you know, smart.<eos> Hey, we're not only stimulated by dirty pictures. We're not that crude.<eos> If you're worried about me seeing your thighs, don't be.<eos> Last night I used them as earmuffs.
What the hell that asshole gonna show me that I ain't already seen, right? L.P.:<eos> You don't recall any case like that?<eos> Well, let me ask you, doctor, were there any cases that you did handle down here in which the ruling on manner of death gave you any concern?<eos> Nada.<eos> I have depositions for paying clients this afternoon, but if you still have calls to make tomorrow, I'll split them with you.
Don't tell me you were eyes-open napping again.<eos> Hey, movers are coming with my stuff on Saturday, okay?<eos> It's weird, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I've prepared the clams in the traditional manner, then I sampled them and subsequently disposed of them. You're welcome.
Pete.<eos> Could she?<eos> Not very much is known about the provenance of Magellan's Astrolabe.<eos> I myself know only a small piece of its history.<eos> But if there are answers to be had, we will find them in here.
Hope you're both happy.<eos> Edna, as the runner-up in the race for your heart, I would like to make a toast.<eos> My Dearest, let me be the first to offer you the hearty handshake that would've climaxed our own wedding day...<eos> Seymour, did you use my wig glue to patch your shoes again?<eos> I tied them together with used dental floss, as per your memo!
None, I don't think.<eos> What about Mr. Norris? Did he have a thing for Callie?<eos> Oh, you think Mr. Norris?<eos> He would ogle her.<eos> But he did that to all the women-- ogle them and, you know, cop a feel sometimes.
What if they did?<eos> Let's find out, shall we?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> It is?<eos> The safe deposit boxes are legal property of the individuals who rent them.
Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Father Schuck is a relentless taskmaster.<eos> You do understand my concerns?<eos> - We...<eos> - We share them.
Listen up!<eos> For all of you guys who don't know, this is Finn Hudson right here.<eos> I thought you joined the Army!<eos> I-I did, but...<eos> But things don't always work out the way you planned them to.
I was stupid to come back.<eos> Rachel's right, this isn't home anymore.<eos> "Watching the skill, the nuance," "this reviewer was forced to ask himself," 'Is this not how it felt Michaelangelo paint the *** chapel.<eos> 'And might the directing team of Mr. Hudson and Mr. Abrams be headed for careers at NASA? '<eos> "They should be, because last night "they plucked stars from the firmament "and named them Marley Rose and Ryder Lynn.
I...<eos> RYDER: Marley's got plans on Friday, dude.<eos> The football team's got an away game at Lawrence, and I asked her if she'd come cheer us on.<eos> See, Jake, it's funny.<eos> Girls don't like it when you make it seem like you're really into them and then totally blow them off.
Do you how many people I get letters from saying they've seen Hector?<eos> Psychics claiming they had a vision of Hector with his checkerboard backpack... pendejos!<eos> Did these letters contain any real information?<eos> Could we take a look at 'em?<eos> I throw them all out.
There's nothing that I love more than just getting out on the water with Dad, the freezing cold dawn, a couple of cold beers in hand.<eos> Having that one quick moment...<eos> Your dad doesn't drink.<eos> He's a Mormon. Well, we don't drink the beers, Courtney.<eos> You know, we just buy them to support American breweries.
Having that one quick moment...<eos> Your dad doesn't drink.<eos> He's a Mormon. Well, we don't drink the beers, Courtney.<eos> You know, we just buy them to support American breweries.<eos> Then we dump them in the lake.
I'm going back to the cartel for good.<eos> They respect me and think I'm a genius!<eos> Hey, genius.<eos> You just walked into the shitter.<eos> Steve, do you know where Woody hid my balls, I can't find them anywhere?
You just walked into the shitter.<eos> Steve, do you know where Woody hid my balls, I can't find them anywhere?<eos> Balls?<eos> What balls? I didn't take any balls.<eos> I didn't say you took them.
I won't take orders from this gutter trash.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Unless you want me to, master.<eos> I've already put the word out on the street to watch for the turtles. And when I find them,<eos> I'll peel them out of their shells and drop them at your feet.
What?<eos> You might just be havin' a good time with me.<eos> I love your sound.<eos> I wanna... I'm looking for a sound that's gonna... Snap people's heads around and...<eos> Hold them down till I let 'em go.
Unless Mr. Long Hair was raping her all over the house, they were screwing, Liv, in the shower, the hot tub, the laundry room.<eos> They even used the bed once in a while.<eos> It's a major renovation, Abby.<eos> It's his job to be everywhere. You ask Lonnie the stonemason, his boss had a long history of going the extra mile in his jobs to make the wives happy.<eos> He was screwing them left and right.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> All right?<eos> My relationships-- I've-<eos> - I've screwed them all up.
Look... are we straight?<eos> Cos I don't really like the way you've been slandering my name around for double-dealing teddies, when that's not even what happened.<eos> I'm sorry, Brandon.<eos> I didn't realise Charlie's boobs were so enormous!<eos> I can't believe I never noticed before, and when I saw them, I felt this jealousy stabbing me in the guts!
Viva likes a boy called Rocky, but Rocky's a dumb idiot who's always in trouble and only likes slags.<eos> So, I tried to advise her but she wasn't... Shut up!<eos> Amen.<eos> I didn't say that. She's got all my words mixed up.<eos> Whatever order you say them, those are harsh words.
I mean, I can sympathize, but killing for that might be a bit extreme.<eos> Yeah?<eos> So, what does any of this have to do with the party girls, Ruiz or the woman who killed him?<eos> Well, the girls were paid to switch the lighters.<eos> Ruiz probably tried to kill them - to tie up some loose ends.
I didn't think you were home.<eos> - Where did you get the keys?<eos> - Why aren't you at work?<eos> - Where did you get the keys?<eos> - Mom found them.
Hold on there.<eos> You're gonna love this one here.<eos> I got him, I got him.<eos> Bryan, I can't do this.<eos> Before I saw these noble creatures, I thought of them as meat, but now, looking in their eyes, I see their spirit.
So, you've prepared a gift that's under a hundred thousand won?<eos> No.<eos> They're even more expensive than the last pair.<eos> What exactly are you-<eos> So I purchased them on a 14-month installation plan.
What a talent!<eos> Finally, dinner.<eos> Well, I love this candlelight.<eos> It makes me look like I'm 14.<eos> Well, technically, the candles are cheating because we didn't make them ourselves.
I understand.<eos> You don't want them here.<eos> Sarnoff's bluffing.<eos> He doesn't have the goods yet.<eos> If he did, he would've released them already, so if no one else knew about the program, one of the names on that list is someone who's going to give him documentation of B-613 in the very near future,
Your life isn't here, Catherine.<eos> Half of it isn't.<eos> And I know, because in the other half,<eos> I have to lie to everyone. Act like I'm doing things I'm not, watch every word I say.<eos> Put up walls and then remember where I've put them.
Oh, are those your kids?<eos> They're so cute.<eos> They could be models. Thank you.<eos> I'm so proud of them.<eos> I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
So, I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan - was wearing these shoes--<eos> - Jim!<eos> - Who was messing with my van?<eos> - Nobody!<eos> - Jordan wore them for nobody? - No, no, no...
But you've never seen your own daughter dead on a slab.<eos> I appreciate your concern.<eos> I need to say goodbye.<eos> Janet was identified based on fingerprints and DNA.<eos> Her physical features, as you remember them, are gone.
I mean, I'll be back in the office.<eos> If you need me for an emergency, call me.<eos> - I'll be there-- - You know what?<eos> I don't know where the years went.<eos> 'Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don't even recognize them.
I'm not doing it.<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> I'm not doing it... - I got him these shirts.<eos> - Those are some nice shirts.<eos> I'm not wearing them to the dance!
No. No. No.<eos> You look nervous.<eos> This Netherworld... how bad is it?<eos> What's it like?<eos> It's like you're, um... lost, drifting in the dark, no one to talk to, nothing to do except think of all the people that you love and how you'll never see them again.
Y-You were canceling?<eos> Yes, just a scheduling logjam.<eos> Well, now that we're all here it seems only fair.<eos> All I wanted to do was to make women aware of breast cancer.<eos> And disrobing was making them aware?
Well, now that we're all here it seems only fair.<eos> All I wanted to do was to make women aware of breast cancer.<eos> And disrobing was making them aware?<eos> Would I do it that way again?<eos> No, but women needed to see something memorable, something to provoke them.
It's the ink.<eos> There's a jar of it in his cell, - where we kept him.<eos> - What happened?<eos> David... he went under a sleeping spell. Now he's trapped.<eos> We destroyed the wardrobe. Cora gathered the ashes. She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
Thanks.<eos> This is the last piece of facial tissue I found.<eos> Thank God.<eos> This is not why I went to art school.<eos> I'll start loading the images into the computer, and I'll piece them together, and then I will hurl.
I gotta find an apartment.<eos> Okay, so keep your eye out for a man, approximately six-foot-six, between 250 and 280 pounds, dark hair.<eos> I'm looking for him anywhere near Reese's place.<eos> Wouldn't imagine there would be that many surveillance cameras in the neighborhood.<eos> Yeah. You know, none of the artisanal shops even use them.
Booboozelas.<eos> The noisemaker from the South African World Cup?<eos> Exactly.<eos> That's pleasant.<eos> There are literally thousands of these just lying around, and I am going to repurpose them.
You drop it on the floor.<eos> You stand on it.<eos> You flatten it.<eos> The cigarettes that we found at the crime scene had been ground out.<eos> Victor Nardin put them out in an ashtray.
You stand on it.<eos> You flatten it.<eos> The cigarettes that we found at the crime scene had been ground out.<eos> Victor Nardin put them out in an ashtray.<eos> Someone took them from his hotel room, transported them to the crime scene, and they put the gun beneath the floorboards before they left.
I would also like to thank those of you who have put my husband in your prayers.<eos> Not only is my husband a religious man, he's a man who believes that hope has power.<eos> So... Having America pulling for him... Well, that just means the world to him.<eos> Now... About my husband's health...<eos> There have been rumors... Rumors that are not only hurtful to my family, they are hurtful to this country, so let me put them to rest.
Fine.<eos> I've technically cancelled an urban children's program.<eos> But what about this assault on my good name?<eos> Not so fast, you crone!<eos> I bought all the wheelchair ramps in this city. And I'm turning them into more profitable stairs.
Such an innocent face.<eos> What about me?<eos> Don't think it escaped the attention of Howard MacCallum that you came home that night with no keys.<eos> I was pissed.<eos> I left them in my room.
Let's play!<eos> Let me tell you about this cold, hard brother.<eos> While y'all trying to get by with your whiskey and cigarettes, guess what he's doing with his rations?<eos> - What's that? - What he doing?<eos> Trading them all for lingerie to spoil his old lady.
Or did you bust out?<eos> Very funny.<eos> Look, uh. I said some things.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> I didn't mean them.
Argentina claims its marines went ashore as a spearhead this morning... to capture key targets, including the capital, Port Stanley.<eos> Gentlemen, the Argentinian Junta... which is a fascist gang... has invaded our sovereign territory. This cannot be tolerated.<eos> May I make plain my negotiating position.<eos> I will not negotiate with criminals or thugs.<eos> The Falkland islands belong to Britain, and I want them back.
How would you handle... the situation of this guy we're trying to find?<eos> I told you, man.<eos> Would I put the nuts on a dresser and will be hitting with the spiked bat.<eos> With the daughters, I don't know.<eos> Exchange them for sons, I guess.
You stole my pills again<eos> I did not.<eos> Get out of my room.<eos> Then why do pills show up in dry-cleaning?<eos> Because you were too high to remember where you left them.
-I got his girlfriend, Sunshine.<eos> Good work, Erlik.<eos> -Show me them.<eos> -Downstairs.<eos> Dr. Zyal is prepping them as we speak.
But none of this matters, because you were still seeing dozens of women behind my back.<eos> Look, I was just doing what I needed to do to get by, okay?<eos> I was providing a service for these ladies, you know?<eos> Look, I was always a gentleman.<eos> I always treated them with the utmost respect. But I never ever cared for any of them.
You know the difference between a Maserati and a Range Rover?<eos> One is small, one is big, I guess.<eos> Okay.<eos> The other women.<eos> Had left with Louis. When you saw them again... did any of them ever have injuries or any of them beaten?
- "Reach for the sky!"<eos> What was that?<eos> Must be that immersive theatre.<eos> We got you surrounded!<eos> You and your entire family get your hands up where I can see them.
Give me the keys.<eos> Give me the fucking keys!<eos> Baby, I so love your tits!<eos> I hope so, lover.<eos> You paid for them.
All my girls are the same to me.<eos> I am equally fond of all of them.<eos> I love them like my own children.<eos> They are my livelihood, after all.<eos> I teach them and guide them about everything.
Custom calls me to it.<eos> What custom wills, in all things should we do it.<eos> What must I say?<eos> "Look, sir, my wounds.<eos> I got them in my country's service."
He should have showed us his marks of merit, - wounds received for his country.<eos> - Yes! - Why, I'm sure, so he did.<eos> - No, he didn't! No, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> No! No one saw them!
Open it.<eos> These.<eos> Take.<eos> Until this day I still don't know what happened to the women of the Qin Huai River.<eos> I never learned all of their names, and never saw them being taken away by the Japanese.
Take.<eos> Until this day I still don't know what happened to the women of the Qin Huai River.<eos> I never learned all of their names, and never saw them being taken away by the Japanese.<eos> So, I always imagine...<eos> I imagine myself standing by the large round window, watching them walk in once again.
And if that's gone, I'm not quite sure what's left.<eos> Did you know Norman brought pills the first night he stayed with me ?<eos> It obviously did the trick.<eos> They fell out of his pocket, and I didn't want it to be like that.<eos> So I swapped them.
That's all I ask ofyou.<eos> That's all.<eos> I'll agree on two conditions.<eos> The first is that you write the judges' considerations.<eos> I'll sign them, but you write them.
His words are for those of us who carry in our hearts desires, dreams, plans, but also worries, problems and fears.<eos> the unprecedented situation, the waiting, the length of which is unknown, but which asks us for a new heart, a new answer which God himself suggests in these words:<eos> humility, the wisdom to realize that we need God.<eos> We need His forgiveness, His patience.<eos> We need to show our wounds to Him, because He is the only one who can heal them.
- Is the day so young?<eos> - But new struck nine.<eos> Ay me! Benvolio, sad hours seem long.<eos> What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?<eos> Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Innkeeper!<eos> Billy!<eos> A fortnight?<eos> The maids love the romantic tragedies.<eos> Precisely why I avoid them.
You alone watch my plays and know them as mine.<eos> When I hear the applause the cheering of the audience, the hands clapping I know they are celebrating another man.<eos> But in that cacophony of sounds, I strained to hear two hands only.<eos> Yours.<eos> But hear them, I never did.
The Source of All Martial Arts ] [ GRAFFITI :<eos> Big brother, we are meeting with the foreigners tomorrow.<eos> What for? With proper funding, we can buy many machine guns and cannons.<eos> With it, we can take Zhengzhou.<eos> More guns is good, but useless if you don't fire them.
Go, we head to the city's east.<eos> I believe, General Song Hu will show more interest.<eos> Mr Peter, please wait.<eos> Brother, this gun is truly marvellous.<eos> If Song Hu takes them...
And he spends the remainder of his time... sailing through space in total bliss... and peace.<eos> Why... are you cleaning houses?<eos> I like to clean.<eos> Nobody likes to clean.<eos> Some people build houses, some people decorate them, some people clean them.
I could have said something but I didn't because I thought whatever image you had of me was better than who I was.<eos> What are we supposed to do with that?<eos> This can't be real.<eos> What are they doing with all these people?<eos> How long have they been collecting them?
No, thank you.<eos> We don't need to cultivate anything here.<eos> In summer, the flowers bloom, the bees buzz around, the birds sing.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said he eats them daily and there's no danger.
Little French bastards!<eos> They took your plimsolls, too.<eos> They're not plimsolls.<eos> I've never worn plimsolls in my life.<eos> They were penny loafers, and I bloody loved them!
I don't know what that is.<eos> Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over.<eos> Back then we had an Officer Torstensson.<eos> Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case.<eos> Taking out the files, studying them over and over.
Sit down, relax, have a drink.<eos> I like that part a lot.<eos> Having a chat when both of you know that one of you is going to die.<eos> And afterwards, I just get rid of them, far out at sea.<eos> Unlike my father, who left them scattered all over the place, like trophies.
It's War!<eos> We are at war with Germany!<eos> You hear?<eos> England is at war with Germany!<eos> They're going to ring the bells at 6:00, and then never ring them again until the war is over.
Case!<eos> Position!<eos> OFFICER 22 And fire!<eos> Valuables in the bucket, lads!<eos> If you live, you'll get them back!
And let them go.<eos> So you right wrongs because it's the right thing?<eos> I'm happy that you have decided to stay here and continue.<eos> We shouldn't have left the girls.<eos> Maybe you can help them.
Jill, this is Mike.<eos> Hello.<eos> So strange being on the other side of things.<eos> Having all the floor nurses stand over me.<eos> I trained some of them.
- What should I do with them?<eos> - I'll take the stockings.<eos> - And the shoes?<eos> - And the shoes!<eos> And you'll wear them when you walk out with Joe Mackins?
She's the murderer.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> How do you know?<eos> The girls were on the run and stayed in a bread and breakfast.<eos> The sadistic owner made them slaves.
Yeah. That commercial was on the Tv in the rec room.<eos> Well it's possible to read into Gabriel's behavior in any number of ways.<eos> But he remembered a commercial.<eos> Gabriel was watching Tv.<eos> Helen, the fact is the tumor has destroyed some of Gabriel's cognitive functions and the parts of the brain that operate them.
Where do you think Gabriel learned to be so moved by his music?<eos> Is that some big mystery?<eos> You're always going on about what your music reminds you of, as if you're the only one that has memories worth recalling.<eos> You know what those songs remind me of?<eos> The man who introduced me to them.
- Typical injuries from a car accident to both.<eos> - Internal bleeding is the cause of death.<eos> - Where are the peanuts?<eos> It says that there would be a bag of peanuts. Where is it?<eos> I have not eaten them.
Yes, it's true.<eos> I had girlfriends...<eos> quite a few, actually.<eos> I, too, took my fair share of ladies to the hen house.<eos> Literally, I did take them to the hen house.
I have bad news, Manny.<eos> This is not the biggest curve ball that life is going to throw you.<eos> Buddy, don't close yourself off from new things.<eos> I ever tell you the story about me and crab cakes?<eos> Thought I didn't like them, tried them, love them.
- Ow!<eos> Hello?<eos> Please tell me that you have my shoes.<eos> Why would I have your shoes?<eos> Because I left them at your uncles's house last night. What?
Because I left them at your uncles's house last night. What?<eos> How could you leave without your shoes?<eos> I go a lot of places without shoes.<eos> I'm not wearing shoes right now.<eos> Oh, wait. That's 'cause I left them at your uncles's house.
I thought as much.<eos> Nothing you did set it off, if that's what you're worried about.<eos> Hmmm, not worried.<eos> Are you trying to buy your statues back?<eos> I want them back for the chapel.
Nothing you did set it off, if that's what you're worried about.<eos> Hmmm, not worried.<eos> Are you trying to buy your statues back?<eos> I want them back for the chapel.<eos> Coop wants them back for his wedding.
It's different for different people.<eos> You've never taken anything before, so it shouldn't be long.<eos> How are you feeling right now?<eos> It's like... I'm on the edge of having 10 ideas all at once, only— maybe I don't have to have them.<eos> Like I could say "freeze" and walk right up to them and see if I want to let them in or not.
It's been two weeks, Gloria.<eos> I wanna get on with my life.<eos> I will prescribe what I think is best for you in your situation to get you clean.<eos> You're trying to buy your statues back?<eos> I want them back for the chapel,
I wanna get on with my life.<eos> I will prescribe what I think is best for you in your situation to get you clean.<eos> You're trying to buy your statues back?<eos> I want them back for the chapel,<eos> Coop wants them back for his wedding.
- Better.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Sorry for your loss.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I'll take the girls and keep them busy with X-rays and sugar until I hear from you.
We're done, all right? Carol, you're being booked attempted murder.<eos> I, uh, see it's not a good time.<eos> Paul, what are you doing here?<eos> You weren't answering my calls.<eos> Then again, maybe you didn't hear them.
We go to where he keeps his turkeys, I bet we find the bullet.<eos> Fire in the hole!<eos> Found this gun in your septic tank, and the bullet was right here.<eos> How could he do that to my girls?<eos> He was having an affair; he was cheating on them.
Well, we're still waiting for info from his bank, but I got his LUD's.<eos> Nothing last night, and only a few calls to his editor in the previous days.<eos> A reporter chasing down a story?<eos> No, there should be dozens of calls.<eos> Well, maybe he was making them from wherever he was staying.
Reveal yourself to the world.<eos> Put that suit on display and steal my thunder.<eos> What do you say?<eos> The suit doesn't make the hero.<eos> A hero's made in the moment by the choices that he makes and the reasons that he makes them.
Bart?<eos> Hey.<eos> They dared me to see how many TV remotes I could stick in my mouth.<eos> We've got to stop Mom from going out with those women.<eos> Something drove them apart once before.
I hope I look half as good as you when I give up.<eos> Such audacity!<eos> Grandma had hair like that when she went to sleep in her forever box.<eos> You can't listen to those women, Mom.<eos> Change threatens them.
No. No, I understand.<eos> I got too intense, you had to back off.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've gotten a lot better at that, you know.<eos> I've dated four different women since we broke up and I didn't tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.
And what happens if I do sign?<eos> Then we'll bring suit to JNL Pesticides.<eos> They were negligent.<eos> They could have disposed of their chlordane reserves properly.<eos> Instead they buried them near your groundwater.
What are you gonna do?<eos> You gonna make her one of your awesome mix-tapes?<eos> Those are amazing.<eos> Don't disrespect the mix-tape, OK?<eos> - First of all, your mom loves them.
Now we're faced with the same decision.<eos> And I'm arguing that we do exactly what he did.<eos> What sort of person does that make me?<eos> One who's asking the right questions.<eos> You don't think he grappled with them too?
Why?<eos> So they won't get lost.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Okay, you have to pay these.<eos> Good thing I didn't lose them.
Everything's good?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I was completely flustered.<eos> I came off like an idiot.<eos> I mean, at one point, for no reason, I just took off my shoes and held them in my hand.
What the hell.<eos> Friends.<eos> Ann Perkins.<eos> Chris Traeger.<eos> What's the point in doing 10,000 push-ups if you're gonna do them alone?
- Those were great guesses, I thought.<eos> - When you put your own clue in, you're not allowed to guess.<eos> You know that.<eos> - I bent the rules. - You didn't bend the rules.<eos> You broke them and that just ruins it for everyone, all right?
Fi, you were supposed to be at the airport.<eos> Yeah, well, we decided to stick around and watch the "experts" do their thing.<eos> What's happening out there?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> It looks like Kessler picked up on your radio frequencies and jammed them.
You're welcome.<eos> I'll take good care of him.<eos> There's a reason that everyone from 17th-century pirates to present-day drug smugglers have operated in the Caribbean.<eos> It's filled with tiny islands that are close to major ports but outside the reach of national laws.<eos> That said, the privacy that makes the islands great hiding places also makes them vulnerable.
And when they're gone, the conglomerate takes over the local wells, and no one makes a fuss.<eos> So you know their playbook.<eos> The files on all the outposts -- that's what I delivered to Vanderwall.<eos> Which outposts were they?<eos> W-well, I didn't memorize them.
- Larry, what?<eos> - They're not- they're not cold.<eos> - What? What's the big deal?<eos> - The chutzpah, man.<eos> - Do you want me to warm them up for you?
- Loved him.<eos> You know what?<eos> I should go say hello to him, shouldn't I?<eos> Yeah, that would be nice.<eos> I always think of nice things but I never act on them.
Perhaps something deeply intimate and personal?<eos> Well, there is this girl at school I like.<eos> Mm-hmm. And I rubbed my armpit on her locker.<eos> Okay.<eos> And as long as we're being honest, I should tell you that one time while I was wearing your underwear, I had an accident and threw them out.
I lost him.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about this place?<eos> Because it wasn't your time.<eos> Young people today don't want to hear the old stories. They don't respect what's sacred, what needs to be protected.<eos> Grandpa, just because I don't have visions doesn't mean I don't respect them.
The detector can tell you're impressed. You should be!<eos> Wha?<eos> The marvelous device, it's detecting a massive burst of anger from deep space!<eos> Flying bananas? Ha, ha.<eos> I will slice them on my morning fish porridge.
And I want to show up to check it out personally.<eos> So put me on your little guest list for me plus four, okay, papi?<eos> Cafe, mama.<eos> Dude, this is definitely doing something weird to my boobs.<eos> - Yeah, it's making them look large and perfect.
Oh, I am so hung over.<eos> You missed the best time last night, Ben.<eos> So what's the deal?<eos> What's going on with those espadrilles?<eos> We'll get them in when Pham fixes the strap problem.
It's over.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Eggs.<eos> Can I get you something?<eos> I forgot them at the store.
Do you know?<eos> Because I do.<eos> I lived through this.<eos> To be deceived by their father.<eos> I did not deceive them.
Now, you don't want to walk into that.<eos> Spoken like a man protecting his associates.<eos> Spoken like a man who doesn't want to see you get killed. Hey!<eos> Whoever Cutter took those pills from is gonna want them back.<eos> Now, you take them from Cutter, you're gonna have two sets of angry killers looking high and low for you and that oxy.
Open the door. - Please, sir.<eos> - Just let us out!<eos> Please open it!<eos> Where are the keys?<eos> Overmyer had them!
It's a watch.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Even in a shitstorm you come up smelling like a rose.<eos> What's your secret?<eos> You bend the rules and I just squeeze the shit out of them.
She read some notes I made.<eos> They were nothing. Just...<eos> Just a few ideas.<eos> - But about her?<eos> - She took them the wrong way.
This is me.<eos> That's you, and these are our kids.<eos> Oh, our daughter's so pretty.<eos> All little girls should be told how pretty they are.<eos> Should grow up knowing how much their mother loves them.
So Hanz goes to me, "Take these tabs..."<eos> Shut up.<eos> Be quiet, man, and listen to the fucking story!<eos> In about 10 minutes every man in the club had got one.<eos> As I'm handing them out I notice that the white color was coming off, like they were blue underneath.
As you come between my thighs,<eos> I feel your sperm rise up within me and fill me and flow out through my eyes.<eos> There are white tears, thick ones, coating my cheeks.<eos> My mouth is red, and the white tears trickle over it.<eos> I don't want to wipe them away.
I adore her, but... we don't have fun.<eos> I make her sad.<eos> But I'm very fond of her.<eos> I love whores.<eos> I find them wonderful.
He's going to come.<eos> I feel your sperm fill me up and flow out through my eyes.<eos> There are white tears, thick ones, coating my cheeks.<eos> My mouth is red, and the white tears trickle over it.<eos> I don't want to wipe them away.
I believed me too.<eos> Oh sick.<eos> Where'd the condom go?<eos> We're all Misogynists.<eos> I love women, I love them.
You see, I recently came across a similar job, as... a waitress, and I...<eos> And you turned it down?<eos> Well, I mean, I... I couldn't.<eos> I... I just can't go home and... face my children, knowing their mother works all day at taking tips and wearing a uniform, and mopping up crumbs.<eos> But you can face them just fine when there's nothing left to eat?
I wanna hear it.<eos> I need to hear it.<eos> No more talking.<eos> No! Don't hurt him!<eos> Anyone with a jeweler's loupe is gonna know that the stones are stolen and who you stole them from.
I'm gonna start by asking you some questions.<eos> Okay.<eos> I already answered all the questions on the form.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I looked at them, but I need to get a profile started on you.
Look, it's unlikely this Angel is not the real Angel... but we can't take any chances.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you take the peaches with you last night?<eos> No, I left them here.
Hey, what's up?<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you take the peaches with you last night?<eos> No, I left them here.<eos> I don't see them anywhere.
Hi.<eos> Did you take the peaches with you last night?<eos> No, I left them here.<eos> I don't see them anywhere.<eos> I didn't take them.
I've just been at Jenny's house.<eos> We had a super time.<eos> They're not our sort of people at all, though. Oh, aye?<eos> Do you know how they eat oranges?<eos> They just cut them in half and suck them!
Down.<eos> Clear the bar.<eos> Got the rope down, boys.<eos> Just clear the heads.<eos> Lucky they sewed them back.
And that concludes the reading of the will.<eos> Didn't even know he had it.<eos> Part of a deceased estate.<eos> The home of a very respectable woman, I believe.<eos> She used to take in native girls and try and make ladies of them so they could set a standard for the rest of their race.
♪ When I am through with you<eos> ♪ There won't be anything left<eos> There's only one way in and out of there.<eos> There's two guards.<eos> Yeah, we'll take them out, no problem.
- Have you seen him in a suit?<eos> - He's gonna keep his hair forever.<eos> I was mowing the yard without tennis shoes.<eos> And Ders came out with my tennis shoes.<eos> - He put them on my feet for me because I was having sciatica pain.
I suppose you do deserve some loving after those beautiful flowers you sent me.<eos> At the risk of going to bed frustrated... I didn't send you any flowers.<eos> You didn't?<eos> Then where did they come from?<eos> We pass by these people every day. But we never look at them.
My baby!<eos> Gaby!<eos> It's not Grace!<eos> Whoa. What are you doing to your roses?<eos> Pruning them.
Gaby!<eos> It's not Grace!<eos> Whoa. What are you doing to your roses?<eos> Pruning them.<eos> Looks like you're killing them.
-Where do you think you're going?<eos> -I'm going home. No.<eos> Gabby, you are sick.<eos> You need help.<eos> Look, you want me to take pills? I will take them.
It's my life's work, you know that.<eos> Of course, Szymon, yes.<eos> We can put it in the basement.<eos> It's dry there, like a dungeon.<eos> And no one will find it.
- It's quite a coin. - Yeah, it's a beauty.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> I'll go get it.<eos> Well, maybe after dinner.<eos> Let me go get it later.
For one thing, modern civilization is a scam.<eos> A sad, pointless charade built on lies.<eos> You have to have the courage to go your own way.<eos> Happiness is hard to come by.<eos> Sure as hell aren't gonna find it in some stupid gadget.
Uh, generally they're cleaner, okay?<eos> Roomier, you fit more passengers in there.<eos> I guess there's pros and cons to that in a pussy.<eos> You know, lovely pussy.<eos> Nobody's gonna mistake it for a Benz, though.
Uh-huh. But I figure we can get them down a bit.<eos> Now, wait.<eos> That's the way you bring the lobster?<eos> Apologies, sir.<eos> Why don't you bring it back, take off the claws, open it up.
"We're gonna need your underwear and nightgowns."<eos> - Who said that?<eos> - US Marshals.<eos> What would they want your underwear for?<eos> They're gonna sell it. They're gonna auction it off.
(ROARING)<eos> But what they didn't account for was the sword.<eos> Merlin stole his staff.<eos> He then forged the great sword, Excalibur, and destroyed the ancient tower.<eos> The sword was then passed to the Lady of the Lake, who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.
Even worse... The whole goddamn world knows I'm vulnerable.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, I know you are.<eos> Cut off his tongue.<eos> Make sure he doesn't ever use it again.
So look...<eos> My family... We have a lot of friends. So there's gonna be nowhere that you can go that we won't be able to find you.<eos> So I'm giving you one hour. One.<eos> Hang on to the box.<eos> I want you to keep it so it'll remind you of what happens when people think that they're smarter than me.
Fuck's sake.<eos> "Probably right enough, Mr Doyle."<eos> If you grovelled a bit more, we might not be going home in the buff.<eos> At least I have my dignity.<eos> Is that what you're calling it?
I need to take my tank off, though.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Is that even safe?<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> You can pass it to me when I'm through.
Life will be much better.<eos> Our seizure of church property has not been as lucrative as we hoped.<eos> Despite the crackdown, collectivisation is still slow.<eos> I've already started shipping the kulak leaders to Siberia, but resistance is strong and spreading.<eos> If we do not stop it, we could lose Ukraine.
Am I right?<eos> - But I made it for you....<eos> Good soup!<eos> I love the combination of gummy bears and meat!<eos> I'm gonna hold it in my mouth, because it's so good I don't want to swallow it. So.
You can use anything you want as long as you return it.<eos> This is Dr. Greiss, known for his famous confrontational therapy.<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> Oh, do you want to see my favorite thing?<eos> Doctor, your critics have been extremely vocal about this radical, what do you call it?
- Mycroft?<eos> He's fine.<eos> So, you're off now.<eos> I won't see you for a week?<eos> Just spending it at home.
And when I go in, sure enough, they have it.<eos> It's magic.<eos> And when I pass by the Double R, I say,<eos> "I wonder if they have a slice of cherry pie with my name on it."<eos> And when I come in, sure enough, you have it.
I enjoyed it.<eos> A lot.<eos> I liked it, too.<eos> You know, this cloak of... I don't know, bravado that you have...<eos> I know why you wear it.
Another reason to leave this city as quickly as possible.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Danny, the path will not remain open forever.<eos> If we miss it, it will be years before we can return.
I've been looking forward to this.<eos> Danny Rand.<eos> I need information.<eos> Why should I tell you anything?<eos> I'll cut off your head and feed it to the rats.
Go.<eos> - She's ready.<eos> - Yes, I can see.<eos> Er, anything more for the mail?<eos> Yes. In fact, why don't you leave that with me, Wellington? - We can drop it off on our way.
You've gone completely mad.<eos> Look, I'm 25.<eos> I can do whatever I want.<eos> Wear this.<eos> There's only one thing I want... er, but I won't ask for it.
I'll tell you what, take the BB gun for protection.<eos> - Oh... - Mmm, no, thank you.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> - Then take the flashlight.<eos> But if you do this, you got to do it right. - If you hold it from the front... - Uh-huh.
- you should lead with that. - I'm screwing up the pitch.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna jump in here.<eos> We're-we're a couple of crow enthusiasts who wanted to take the power and essence of a crow and-and we packed that into a delicious milk drink<eos> - that we invented, thus Fight Milk. - Yeah.<eos> I don't know what you guys are talking about right now, but I have heard of your stuff and Cerrone and Felder, they actually love it.
Hey, um... could you just help me with my necklace?<eos> I can never seem to get it off.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Here.<eos> - No, I... I want you to keep it.
Would you please tell the court what you see there?<eos> It's a newspaper article called: Not so terrible twos.<eos> And one of them is Mary Eileen Adler.<eos> Same name as your daugter. Born on the same day as your daughter. With a photograph.<eos> In your defense, you'd never recognize it.
- No.<eos> Then what did she do with all that time?<eos> She loved the mathematics.<eos> It was her passion.<eos> She preferred it to all other things.
Please.<eos> -It doesn't go with the outfit.<eos> -Not at all.<eos> Put the sword down, first of all.<eos> Promise me you'll protect it with your life.
Therefore..<eos> ...I am here to help.<eos> Unofficially, of course.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> If there's another weapon's facility, find it and destroy it.
You're a scientist,<eos> Forces formations mu Serbia is one of the best, But you're asking for something ridiculous,<eos> If I wanted to, you or dead Kseniya, So, you must first die,<eos> And nothing can hold me, You know you need our strength,<eos> But you will not get it,
No, you're not quitting school when you're this close.<eos> I don't have a choice. I have to pay bills, Jacob, so...<eos> Look, it'll take her at least six months to get a court date and we have some equity on the house.<eos> Yes.<eos> Use our equity line while we put it on the market.
"Brace, do you have any idea where I can find ma ain death warrant?"<eos> I may need to prove to a tribunal that the land was acquired by treaty and not by conquest.<eos> Tribunal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.
- When...<eos> - Oh.<eos> I'm going out, Lucy. I-I see the mailman.<eos> I'm gonna collect the mail.<eos> But he'll bring it in.
I know.<eos> Just focus on one thing.<eos> Focus on the dove.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can you hear it?
Wheeler tree sap.<eos> Some of my masks have moving parts.<eos> Grease things up, get them moving...<eos> Since you've stopped.<eos> I could leave your screams to the forest and the things that go bump in it. Stop!
My father's suite.<eos> They've made it mine.<eos> It's nice.<eos> When I was younger, I used to play with his crown.<eos> Put it on my head.
Snakehips Johnson played that night.<eos> It went on till five in the morning.<eos> I thought the Germans had banned this music.<eos> They have.<eos> They label it degenerate, but secretly they love it.
File numbers, etc, etc, etc.<eos> Should I check that with Standartenfuhrer, sir?<eos> I'm afraid, when asked, Dr Huth seemed disinclined to help your Harry.<eos> Shall we take the statement immediately?<eos> And do it in German, or Berlin will ignore it.
I'm curious.<eos> - Okay so I'm upstairs ... hooking up with the hottest girl in the class, Jan Deely.<eos> Do you realize you're coming off as like the world's biggest douchebag, right now, right?<eos> So Conner starts banging on the bathroom door, right.<eos> So I open it ... and blood's gushing from his mouth and he's screaming: "Your sister bite my fucking tongue off," right.
Or in a pinch... a telegram. You know I miss those.<eos> Dots and dashes, secret code.<eos> There was drama in there.<eos> Someone gave you an envelope, you got anticipation.<eos> What's in there? So you'd open it very slowly.
Can anybody give me an example of this?<eos> Anyone.<eos> Clay.<eos> - Yeah, an example would be like slang.<eos> - Mm-hmm. If somebody starts saying some word, eventually everybody's saying it.
Okay, ladies, let's go!<eos> Maybe you can't imagine what it feels like to be on the sidelines, Zach... like most of us are.<eos> You can't imagine why a little piece of paper could mean so much.<eos> Um, everybody, before you leave, we've added an anonymous class discussion bag to the racks.<eos> We're gonna check it every Friday and talk it over.
Oh, there...<eos> There's pictures of people eating poop in there!<eos> It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment.<eos> Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him...<eos> He won't have to ask for it, okay?
The continued pirate threat makes Captain Berringer a necessary, if temporary, evil.<eos> But I do not care for the idea of having him trampling through my affairs, encouraged by one scandal to search for more, which is why I secured an agreement from the governor that my informants would be held immune from any prosecution<eos> This will all pass soon enough... if we let it.<eos> My grandfather was a pirate of another sort.<eos> When he was a young man, he swindled a ship, hired it to privateers, and earned a share of their spoils for his trouble.
There isn't anything we can do about it at the moment.<eos> Isn't there?<eos> [ sighs ] Look, Billy's not stupid.<eos> He's almost certainly consolidated by now, intimidated or eliminated anyone who would challenge him or support me.<eos> He has control of the Underhill estate, control of the army that calls it home.
Oh, you don't like them?<eos> It's not that I don't like them.<eos> I don't like them, but that's not...<eos> The old way works just fine.<eos> Type out a report, send it via telex.
That means you guard my body.<eos> Is that not right?<eos> Not when you're robbing a bank.<eos> At the moment, my body is going to the bank.<eos> It's not robbing it.
Be nice.<eos> - I'll see you in Wisconsin.<eos> Good luck, Mad Sweeney.<eos> I'll see you back at the car.<eos> Just make sure he doesn't steal it, huh?
Cap's right.<eos> Nobody asked you, no-neck.<eos> The protomolecule.<eos> What are we going to do with it?<eos> Simple, we stick it on the end of a torpedo and we fire it into the sun.
Madam President, can you speak up?<eos> We can't hear you back here.<eos> We talked about our sons, the ones we lost in the war...<eos> Her John and... my Andrew...<eos> How they both did their best to serve our country and... face down fear, just as we must face it down here at home.
You can't really have expected anything different.<eos> Actually, I did.<eos> And I'd ask you to reconsider... advise you to.<eos> So this is your idea of advice?<eos> Does it really matter what we call it?
It would be the greatest honor of my career.<eos> I know you had your concerns about even coming on temporarily.<eos> I did, yeah.<eos> Can we agree to put those aside?<eos> Well, as a matter of fact, I'm on a train tonight to meet with Franny's case worker in the morning... A home visit, they call it.
Open the fucking door!<eos> From dozens of arrests made in connection with the assassination attempt on the President earlier this month.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> According to David Wellington, the President's Chief of Staff, those arrested include officials from all branches of government, including the Department of Defense, State, and the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Today, the President is sending a clear message to the American people, that our Democracy is strong and resilient and that we will do whatever it takes to defend it.
And why should those hands and eyes belong to you?<eos> Just consider me your vascular parachute. Oh.<eos> No wonder I have you on nights.<eos> All right, so what's the plan?<eos> We find the bleed, sew it up, save Charlie's arm. - And Plan "B"?
Did you move back to Mapleton?<eos> No.<eos> Still in Jarden.<eos> In our house.<eos> Anyone still call it Miracle?
But if what we need are permits so we can speak up for women like Inez, who's on trial for defending her own life, or if we ever hope to get a decent building instead of this dump, why not attempt an alliance?<eos> I mean, what are we afraid of?<eos> Wait.<eos> You support this idea, Jean?<eos> I don't see why we're dismissing it without consideration just because they have balls and we don't.
Bin-Khalid's people... They found us.<eos> They killed the rest of the squad.<eos> There was a flash drive containing a list of sleeper cells, along with all the codes to trigger their attacks.<eos> - Are you saying Grimes still has it?<eos> - He said he'll sell it to the terrorists if we don't give him want he wants.
They're gonna need your contacts, electronic files, anything you have that can help them find John.<eos> Henry, I did... What?<eos> It's over, Luis.<eos> It's John's life we're talking about... your sister's son.<eos> I have to think about my life and I'm not gonna spend the rest of it in prison.
- Wow. - True story, I was there.<eos> I don't think I bought myself a beer for the entire rest of the season.<eos> That's unbelievable.<eos> You know what? I do believe I have that game ball in my office. Signed by the entire '85 Royals team.<eos> Let me see if I can find it.
The painting is still the painting.<eos> But what we see is not what people saw hundreds of years ago.<eos> How we see changes.<eos> The same is true for our ears.<eos> The music of Mozart was not heard by the people of his time the way we hear it today.
My friends who got separated and I just...<eos> I can't let them fight The Beast on their own.<eos> You want me to come to Fillory with you?<eos> All right, so there might be a solution here, a weapon.<eos> It sounds like, if we could find it, we could use it to kill The Beast.
"He made sad noises while I sucked him off."<eos> And all of a sudden, she has something to write about.<eos> She has a story... she has an experience, okay?<eos> She has something that makes her different from every other creative writing undergrad that was bussed in from Virginia.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying about experience... the way people crave it and the way people use it?
Well, will you tickle my back?<eos> No.<eos> You know how they're shutting the N/R down at DeKalb?<eos> Reminds me of this time back when I was assistant to the transportation commissioner when... and they don't tell you this... they shut the B down, or let's just say they pretended to shut the B down,<eos> leaving it running only for the mayor and his homosexual friends. - Sorry.
Just plug it in?<eos> - That's it?<eos> - That's it.<eos> There's a terminal at the base of the echo tower.<eos> You jump over, take the box to the tower, plug it in and jump back in time for dinner.
Are you hungry?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> So, how does one become a museum curator?<eos> When one has to pay the rent.<eos> I majored in art history because I absolutely loved it, but I really didn't think it through in terms of careers.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Why, what was it?<eos> Drugs?<eos> Hey, I didn't look!<eos> Before you took it, was anyone else looking at it?
The question is, what happened outside those offices that stopped him from going inside?<eos> This is a map of all the gunshots on the body.<eos> What do the colors represent?<eos> Each color corresponds with one of the five shots. But it's still a little bit unclear.<eos> Now, what if you take this image and place it on top of an overhead view of the crime scene, and then map out the areas where the pellets hit the ground?
It doesn't matter.<eos> There's a body washed up on the beach in Newfoundland, Canada.<eos> A United States passport was found in the travel belt.<eos> Max used to buy this soda for the kids.<eos> He would mix it up with a little heavy cream, and he would call it a "grandpa milkshake."
So, it sounds like Ron was actually doing you a favor by firing Joey.<eos> He was.<eos> Ronny was a sweetheart. He just got caught up and taken for a ride.<eos> You got to be careful.<eos> This industry will eat you alive if you let it.
Immediately, would be preferable.<eos> Premonition? Yeah.<eos> The one with the screaming, and people killing each other?<eos> First we find Argent.<eos> I was saying that if we're talking about some sort of mythical creature that's so powerful the only safe place to put it is in the Wild Hunt, then we have a serious problem.
I even left five messages, but he, uh...<eos> What's this about?<eos> Oh, a human-interest story my editor's hired on.<eos> Local author reunited with his long-lost fiancee.<eos> They'd like to run it next weekend.
They both think that Mary Drake made this special delivery.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> I don't know what to think.<eos> I-I just...<eos> Mary wrote this letter that makes me cry every time I look at it.
You're offering me a deal?<eos> One you cannot dismiss.<eos> Alistair and his ilk loathed me because of my strength.<eos> Now they loathe you.<eos> Creatures such as they respect only one language, and I speak it fluently.
She's always talking like an American in the movies. Oh!<eos> Regina and Luca, eight.<eos> John and Kathryn, two.<eos> Plus our sweeping victory in Taboo.<eos> Okay, I know defeat when I see it.
I think we're done here.<eos> I'm not gonna get into an argument about...<eos> Oh, no, I just wanted the studies of, if this is true or, if it shows that.<eos> Any diet works.<eos> Any diet works if people follow it.
At the Westcliff Hotel.<eos> So you didn't see Gemma at all on Tuesday? - No.<eos> - I did.<eos> I watched the lunchtime boat come in while you were in the bathroom.<eos> Gemma got on and started arguing with the guy driving it.
You don't talk much, do you?<eos> Here, we go.<eos> Here.<eos> Yeah, the quota is 40 pound a day.<eos> If you don't make it, these nice men will whip you.
Presidents don't apologize, you moron.<eos> You can thank me later.<eos> Mr. President, people are dying!<eos> I teach.<eos> Tim knows this story all too well because I tell it all the time.
You know how to hide a $100 bill from a surgeon?<eos> You put it in the patient's chart.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Right?<eos> - Because they never check it.
That doesn't mean that one of them - was killing Wes.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Yes!<eos> 'Cause I'm about to have proof.<eos> Oliver kept a copy of Annalise's phone and has been going through it.
Uh, that's what I said.<eos> Like, verbatim.<eos> Dre, please.<eos> Bernice has the floor. I did some research online, and I found out this particular Givenchy hoodie is from two seasons ago.<eos> There's no way the Givenchy boutique would carry it.
Pregnant women can do it all.<eos> Meanwhile, I was realizing that Josh might not be wrong about paternity leave.<eos> I mean, I wasn't home after Junior was born.<eos> Have you seen my wand?<eos> I can't find it anywhere, and my spell book is useless without it.
And did you know that when babies are born, they resemble their fathers?<eos> It's Mother Nature's way of keeping the dads invested.<eos> I was disappointed when Eustace looked more like my brother, Eustace. Mm.<eos> Eustace!<eos> Look, Dre, if paternity leave was so great, why wouldn't everyone be taking it?
So all this is just a bunch of bullshit?<eos> Including the key?<eos> No, the key was real.<eos> And it means everything.<eos> But I actually never wanted you to find it.
Can you say profit sharing?<eos> Let's get down to brass tacks.<eos> Synergy has touched us once again.<eos> This moves the needle.<eos> Let's rescue it. And bring it to the supervisor.
Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Hey, no.<eos> Oh, oh, my God.<eos> Where'd you get that stuff?<eos> Can't say, but I'll share it with you if you do something for me.
Okay, I'm just supposed to pick up where he left off?<eos> I'm not a scientist. How am I supposed to do that?<eos> All of his research is still in those films.<eos> Okay? Slink says you just have to find the right reel, and it'll give us the instructions on how to make the cure.<eos> Okay, say I find it, then what?
An ugly part, but I don't think it will ever change.<eos> Technology certainly hasn't changed it.<eos> Guns. Railguns. Nuclear bombs.<eos> No weapon ever brings peace.<eos> No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it's doing, but they are using it anyway.
Yeah.<eos> Um... he's not gonna be able to make it.<eos> Class on a Saturday?<eos> What kinda class is that?<eos> It's LGBT sex ed, since they don't teach it in schools. Oh.
I think it was less than 48 hours later, organized a campaign to kick me out.<eos> Well, how was I supposed to know it wasn't a meth lab?<eos> You are... a force of nature.<eos> And, Sharon, there hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't woken up grateful for you, for your heart, and your wit, and your beauty, and your compassion.<eos> And Stef, I know I should've asked for your blessing before I popped the question, but I am... asking for it now.
- because he can't read.<eos> - What's that?<eos> It's the letter Emma wrote to Jesus.<eos> - What are you doing with it?<eos> - Emma didn't want anyone else finding it.
I don't think that will work.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> You said the hatch was titanium, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hydrochloric acid will turn it into Swiss cheese.
Not much more than he told you.<eos> Does he always carry it?<eos> No, he got it out to help you.<eos> Got it out from where?<eos> Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Mom, come on, that's not... That's not really a thing.<eos> I mean, like, it should be private.<eos> Well, in our family it's a thing.<eos> Simon's father started this tradition 13 years ago.<eos> And now we keep it alive in his memory.
Now, I just don't want you to think I'm hallucinating or anything.<eos> Okay. Go.<eos> You know those voices I'm hearing,<eos> I think this thing has taken the, I don't know, consciousness, some part of whatever it is makes us human.<eos> It's eating it, spitting it back out in some other configuration.
The Rocinante and James Holden have gone silent.<eos> Along with Fred Johnson, and the Martian government.<eos> So we will just have to be insightful on our own.<eos> Where are we on the impact site mission?<eos> We've commandeered a civilian survey vessel and are refitting it with our best sensors and probes.
Because you live like dogs!<eos> Never wash yourselves.<eos> Screw each other in the street, in the plain sight of children!<eos> I know.<eos> If the truth was easy to hear, everyone'd tell it.
Oi!<eos> - You're a fucking arsehole!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You got something to say, you Irish fucking cunt?<eos> They... swing oppression like a club and they call it the law.
He'd like for you to be part of the raid.<eos> Abolitionists.<eos> I heard massa using that word.<eos> I never knew what it meant, but I knew he didn't like it.<eos> And he always use it when he was talkin' 'bout a slave that got into trouble.
- I'll hold them off as much as I can.<eos> - Hold them off?<eos> You coming with us.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I may not want to bring violence into someone else's house, but I will be damned if they bring it into mine.
Discharge?<eos> The meatus is inflamed.<eos> Signs of discharge are evident.<eos> You have gonorrhea, sir.<eos> The boys call it "gleep" or "clap."
- Nice work, Harvey.<eos> Kathryn seems to be the only one who knows what the weapon is.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> Break in, see what I can find out.<eos> What do you think, she's keeping it on her fireplace mantel?
Maybe Lucius took it.<eos> - You're the only two with the combination, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> Lee has it, too.
And he's from the future?<eos> - Yup.<eos> - And I build a trap for him? - Me?<eos> - You.<eos> He wants to kill you before you build it.
Everyone else managed to get theirs in on time. It wouldn't be fair to the other students.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Completely understand that.<eos> But I really put so much work into this paper.<eos> Please, just consider taking a look at it.
When you tucked me in when I was little..<eos> When you dropped me off at school when I played baseball all those years.<eos> At my games alone thinking I didn't have a dad.<eos> You lied.<eos> You stole that part of my childhood from me and I'll never get it back.
As in I'm the only time sorceress in "Locked"<eos> in the US, in China, on Mars.<eos> Now I don't ever want to hear the name Xu Yifei ever again, okay?<eos> You didn't even want that part, remember?<eos> - Ida wanted it for you.
Anyway, according to this, the bell measurements are an exact match to what Dalton St. John wrote about.<eos> That's what Seline was looking for in 1883.<eos> Why would she care about our church bell?<eos> Peter Maxwell was the last one to have his hands on that witches' bell.<eos> Right up until he threw it off a bridge, some 20-odd years ago.
- Why?<eos> Wickery Bridge is where Elena's parents drove the car off the road.<eos> When the sheriffs dredged out the car, they found something else...<eos> The old charter bell.<eos> It was broken, but they saved it.
I mean, what were you thinking, anyway?<eos> - I was thinking about the parade.<eos> - What?<eos> The Founders Day parade.<eos> You know, the one where they put the charter bell on a float, and some rich guy rings it while two dumbasses stand on either side of him wearing moldy Civil War uniforms?
We got into a heated moment and threw something out the window.<eos> Maybe he should help you look for it, then.<eos> Oh, he took the morning off from work.<eos> Besides, he doesn't want me to have this thing, anyway.<eos> Honestly, I don't even know why I want it.
There's another way, you know.<eos> We can fight Sybil.<eos> Does this have something to do with that stupid metal ball?<eos> The striker is the final piece to the weapon.<eos> And if we use it, maybe we can break her influence over you.
You know what I want?<eos> I want to fix my brother, I want to get rid of the devil, and I want my future with Elena.<eos> But I am not becoming human while she sleeps for decades.<eos> You won't have to take the cure right away.<eos> Enzo will take it from Cade, and years from now, - you can take it from Enzo.
She snuck into our house?<eos> She's a villain.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Keep it on. We want her to see you wearing it.
No.<eos> No, no, Dean, it...<eos> It's not gonna happen, all right?<eos> Well, you just told me my whole life story.<eos> And I gotta be honest, man, I... I can feel it, slipping out of my head.
You are next in line, Ramiel.<eos> Prince of Hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.
Sorry, Castiel.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> There's a cure.<eos> There's always a cure, and we will find it. How?
Maybe a year or two now, and this last month, he's got worse.<eos> Can't you stop him?<eos> Why am I still having to think about clearing up after his shit even after I've thrown him out the house?<eos> I can't live in his pain.<eos> I put my energy into where people want it - my girls and people like Trish.
I mean, a black man killing another black man isn't sexy enough.<eos> What about your conscience?<eos> I mean, would it tell you anything different if the kid was a different color?<eos> They took my conscience a long time ago.<eos> Then take it back.
I want that gun.<eos> We're in the middle of the investigation.<eos> So are we.<eos> And federal trumps Mayberry.<eos> We'll turn it over as soon as we're done with that testing.
Okay, stop, Frankie.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thanks again for the soup.<eos> It was delicious.<eos> You're welcome, even though you don't deserve it.
Well, you had a lot going on, and people were really dying to see you with Lisbeth.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> Look, um... what people want is for the story to keep going.<eos> It's an addiction.<eos> And we feed it whether we like it or not.
I went after him all the way across the border into...<eos> Pay the fuck attention!<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I find him at his sister's house.<eos> And he comes at me with a hockey stick, and I see this bat and I grab it.
Congrats.<eos> Little bird tells you wrong.<eos> Oh, someone's here with a cake for you, Dr. Reid.<eos> They're very insistent.<eos> Well, tell them I'm in surgery, and I don't want it.
Now, given your ties to the community, I see no reason to deny you bond, which I set now at $2,500.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> Chuck bamboozled me again.<eos> That tape?<eos> He made sure that Ernie heard it, right?
Can we talk about your disease for a moment?<eos> I'd like everybody here to be on the same page about it.<eos> Of course.<eos> It is sometimes referred to as ehs, electromagnetic hypersensitivity.<eos> I describe it as an acute allergy to electromagnetism.
The extraction point is 6 miles away.<eos> If they're gonna be on our heels, there's no way we're gonna make it on foot.<eos> Maybe we don't have to.<eos> They're gonna blow the door.<eos> How about we blow it for them?
I really shouldn't be telling you this.<eos> What's your weekly rate?<eos> Uh, no one's ever asked me that before.<eos> Well, come up with one.<eos> Tell Kat what it is, and I'll pay it.
Now you're gonna help us find her.<eos> How did my team access the facility?<eos> You... programmed the servers to overheat, opening the vents.<eos> Which shut down the network.<eos> I want you to get it back up.
Wait.<eos> I, uh, talked to Scottie.<eos> She's fine, but she's on the run, doesn't really want us looking for her.<eos> Hargrave wants the network up.<eos> She wants it down.
I only know two other men ready to sacrifice their sons:<eos> The prophet Abraham and the one who done ordered that sacrifice.<eos> The Captain spoke of the conspiracy of the slave power.<eos> He shared my disdain for abolitionists who are unable to take direct action against it.<eos> that dust that wouldn't settle... he had it, too.
Profitin' off the bodies of others.<eos> Rapin' the bodies of others. Killin' the bodies of others.<eos> Those are all acts of war. Been that way since the dawn of man.<eos> And we ain't been callin' it that because there's a nationwide conspiracy workin' against us... a conspiracy, as the Captain called it, of slaveholders actively at war, workin' hard to make it seem the way of things.<eos> They pass it on to their sons and daughters. They strengthen it through government. They justify it through religion, callin' it Christianity.
- She go back inside,<eos> I lose my only chance.<eos> Listen to what you just said.<eos> Our only chance, only one we got.<eos> All right, we waste it now, this whole thing is over before it even begins.
We came here because you know she's workin' in the area.<eos> And if there was a map to all the safe houses on the Underground, maybe that would be a start.<eos> Actually... there is.<eos> I once heard a song.<eos> I was told it, came from a man who wrote it on a prison wall just before he died.
Did you find something?<eos> Not yet, but they're definitely hiding things.<eos> Remember our deal, Polly, if you don't find anything by Homecoming, it's over you're coming home.<eos> I just have to get into their bedroom.<eos> They protect it obsessively.
Okay.<eos> And nothing ever will.<eos> Unless you give me the green light.<eos> Got a print?<eos> Sending it now.
Go!<eos> Yeah...<eos> Got it.<eos> They say they're gettin' ready for the coming apocalypse, is all.<eos> They're causin' it, more like.
I understand.<eos> I sure understand what it is to be lonely, although I don't have a choice.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't need you to understand my life, Madeleine.<eos> I barely understand it myself.
Because I didn't have any proof.<eos> Sometimes I see mother when she's not really there, and sometimes I become her.<eos> Need a room for a few hours.<eos> Marion, you deserve the world.<eos> I want to be the guy who gives it to you.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's just...<eos> it's been a weird night.<eos> Totally.<eos> So, I'm in your room looking for your Bluetooth speaker, but I can't find it.
No one bothers you.<eos> No one tells you where to be or what to do.<eos> And at 40 grand a semester, they'll even hand you a diploma.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Yeah, they probably just e-mail it.
Thirty dollars an hour?<eos> He makes more than me?<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I'll get my pen.<eos> No, I'll get it on my way out, 'cause I am leaving.
Off to battle.<eos> Wish me well.<eos> - ♫ A cozy room ♫ - Oh, damn.<eos> Where are my shirts?<eos> This business of laundry: you wash a thing, then you have to wash it again and again and again and again.
The MG3, MG5 and all the MG11s are by the book.<eos> The MG6 initial disclosure is what I'd expect at this stage.<eos> But signal strength triangulation places Michael's mobile phone in the vicinity of his grandmother's nursing home and not the abduction of Hana Reznikova. Right.<eos> Well, we all know how this works.<eos> There's a chain of evidence, it starts with the investigating team, goes on to the Senior Investigating Officer, who presents it to the Crown Prosecutor.
Pats, what did the letter say?<eos> I haven't had the chance to read it.<eos> - Then read it now.<eos> - I'm trying to sleep.<eos> Besides, if I ignore it, then it might all go away.
Kiddies need somewhere to play, and now they've demolished the reservoir there's proper grass there and a little hut where they sell ice creams.<eos> I remember Tom saying something about it.<eos> Isn't there going to be a grand opening?<eos> Well, an opening.<eos> The Mayor's on his holidays, so I wouldn't call it grand.
Afternoon, Mr Spenlow.<eos> Reverend.<eos> Has this been made redundant?<eos> Well, we bought all this stuff for the little fella.<eos> And we want him to have it.
- Has anyone seen my cricket bat?<eos> - Under the pile in the hall?<eos> Which pile?<eos> There's quite a few to pick from.<eos> I'll get it for you.
More than that.<eos> I fought in Korea, thanks to National Service.<eos> My father never recovered from the things he saw in battle.<eos> He suffered terrible shellshock all of his life.<eos> Warfare's bad enough when you're in the middle of it. To have to keep replaying it in your mind...
Yeah, and I've decided the opportunity is in Missouri.<eos> - Okay, we understand... - It's simple. ...that this is... this is upsetting.<eos> Believe me, I get how hard this is.<eos> But we're a family, so we are... We're making this move as a family.<eos> We would prefer if you would... see it as an adventure.
Your father gave me this sword.<eos> Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf.<eos> But it's still Longclaw.<eos> Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros. But you are back. And it's been in your family for centuries.<eos> It's not right for me to have it.
Rita, you both deserve better.<eos> He fell for a fantasy.<eos> A cheap blonde on the make.<eos> None of this is real.<eos> Redemption is real, if you truly seek it.
Yeah?<eos> Well, let's give them a show.<eos> You ready to fly?<eos> First, you go off this building, then I'm gonna come find your family.<eos> I'm gonna lock them in a house, and then I'm gonna burn it to the ground!
Good to see you, Dad.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Pretty deece.<eos> Oh. Got this jacket today.<eos> Hoping to be buried in it.
It takes me a few seconds to realize that they're looking at me.<eos> One of the airport's radiation detectors thought I was carrying a dirty bomb.<eos> Were you?<eos> I was carrying this.<eos> I found it on the farm when I was a kid, right by the pond.
Don't wanna do it.<eos> Why not?<eos> Scarlett, it's just a song.<eos> You didn't have a problem when we cut it.<eos> We sang it every night on tour, and it didn't bother you.
Yes.<eos> Yes! I just love the music.<eos> Which means it has no context for you.<eos> - No meaning that sets it apart. - That's not true.<eos> You just have to listen to the music to know what sets it apart.
- I just listened to my session.<eos> And?<eos> So strange to hear me singing Rayna's song.<eos> Yeah, I can imagine.<eos> But you are singing it for her.
This looks nothing like Amelia Earhart's plane.<eos> Well, neither did hers till it was finished. All right.<eos> You hold the wing.<eos> - I am holding it.<eos> - Yeah, I know you're holding it, but just hold it nice and tight.
You're thirsty and you come to a saloon.<eos> Which is filled with some of the meanest-looking characters you ever saw.<eos> And they don't like you.<eos> What's gonna happen?<eos> Then the meanest-looking guy in the bar takes a bottle of Bud, and slides it all the way down to you while all the mean guys watch.
Yeah, thanks.<eos> This is the living room.<eos> And this is the kitchen.<eos> And over there is the room I share with my brother.<eos> I used to share it with my brother too. Do you want to see it?
What is happening here?<eos> Juliette stole Maddie's song.<eos> What song?<eos> What do you mean, stole?<eos> Travis Stroud gave it to Juliette to give it to Maddie. And she never did.
Sadie asking me to look into D.A. Russo to find the smoking gun of corruption that they're pinning the whole Brennan case on.<eos> Russo's squeaky clean, no scandals. No.<eos> What?<eos> You know that thing that Isaiah does with his right hand when he's really angry? Yeah.<eos> Now he's doing it with both hands.
Billy's DNA was not under them?<eos> I heard that, yeah.<eos> So is this exactly what. Billy's face looked like?<eos> Yes.<eos> Because if you're gonna use it as evidence, it should fairly and accurately depict the scratch. Sure.
It is not a lie.<eos> Mellie and I are partners.<eos> James... we may not be living the love story<eos> America wants to fantasize about, but that does not take away from the fact that the two of us are a match.<eos> We respect each other, we want the same thing, and we want it with the same intensity.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey, he said he's fine.<eos> Is that my robe?<eos> No. Yes. He said it feels like money.<eos> Just wash it when you're done.
My Olivia would have marched through that door and shoved that petition down your throat.<eos> That's my Olivia!<eos> But she's not here anymore.<eos> So I'm here instead.<eos> It's me marching through that door, me shoving that petition down your throat, me demanding you sign it.
And then what?<eos> And then we'll have it and Cortazar will help us understand it.<eos> And the nightmare starts over.<eos> No.<eos> If the Belt has the protomolecule, no one will ever use it against us again.
He still had the boots that he wore to the cemetery.<eos> The chisel that made dental identification impossible.<eos> Caddie was there for me, and if he could help me right now, he would.<eos> So where's this evidence?<eos> I assume you want me to place it somewhere it can be found, transfer any suspicion away from you.
Hurricanes come home.<eos> These are some of the boys who've flouted Hitler's air offensive.<eos> In due course they'll stop it altogether.
Got a letter this morning, Ada.<eos> Sorry, I forgot.<eos> I love you, dumpling.<eos> I'm not a dumpling.<eos> Stanislav's grandfather gave it to him.
Get you another coffee?<eos> Yeah. This time go easy on the fucking sugar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The shot shattered his shoulder blade.<eos> They're piecing it back together with screws and plates.
- Technicality.<eos> And Ortiz left a bomb behind in her father's house.<eos> - Maybe to blow her up.<eos> - The bomb was marked with blood that couldn't have been there from the gunshot wound.<eos> Why leave a bomb behind to kill your wife, and then do stuff to it that means we have to collect it as evidence?
This could all be over very quickly.<eos> Mike, where are we going?<eos> Inside. Inside. Watch your head.<eos> Ortiz is making bombs out of everything, and he's got a lot of C-4 left.<eos> If there's a bomb, the dog will smell it, I promise.
It was once a required course.<eos> Till it was outlawed.<eos> For good reason, I hear.<eos> Yes, well, it was a very messy situation.<eos> At the time, I thought it was right, but the professor who taught it disagreed.
Julian, yeah?<eos> Go!<eos> - 'He's the one planning this rally?<eos> ' - No, we never...<eos> 'They swing oppression like a club and they call it the law.'
I don't have a clear picture in my head at all.<eos> I rest my case.<eos> But you love that farm.<eos> I loved it when I was 50.<eos> But now that my body's 70... it doesn't matter how much I love it.
No!<eos> I can't.<eos> "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."<eos> My father had that quote framed and hung in our living room.<eos> I saw it every day.
Get in!<eos> You know where she is.<eos> Why?<eos> We thought we could get a bomb on that ship.<eos> We needed someone to detonate it during launch.
Oh, man, an Egg McMuffin and French fries?<eos> I love all-day breakfast.<eos> I can't wait to eat this whole bag.<eos> Well, some of that stuff's for me, but y-you go to town.<eos> Hey, I'm really sorry that I bailed on our trip to Bowdoin, but I called them, and I rescheduled our presentation, and we're gonna be doing it during Spring Fling.
With all the time and repairs I put into this ship, it's arguably more mine than yours.<eos> We just saved your life. Call it even.<eos> I know we've had our differences.<eos> But if you find the protomolecule on Ganymede Station...<eos> I sure as hell ain't gonna bring it back to you.
You know, maybe...<eos> - look.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the stick.<eos> So I think I should be the one who decides when not to use it.<eos> Well, there's no risk for you down here, so I don't see how it would hurt to put it away for a while...
- Look, just think of it as payback for Aunt Ada.<eos> - I guess. - The only problem is,<eos> Alpen are attracted to heavy sleepers, which I am not.<eos> Well, melatonin is the chemical in the brain that makes you sleep, right?<eos> That's why your brain produces it.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be sure to set up the cameras, so you have a view - of the whole room.<eos> - Got it.<eos> And the only way you're gonna be able to hear us is with this earbud, but don't put it in until you're in the room.
Eve.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Made more lovely by you saying the word "morning."<eos> I feel the dawn of a crystalline new day in your voice, and your hair is more exuberant than ever. I adore it.
Just try.<eos> We can't hide out here for the rest of our lives.<eos> We won't have to.<eos> This thing is gonna find us one way or another.<eos> And when it does I'm gonna kill it.
Maybe sort of an Achilles' heel type of thing.<eos> Specifically for Zerstoerer?<eos> No, it's more generically in reference to unstoppable evils...<eos> Zerstoerer-like dark forces of the universe that precipitate apocalyptic events.<eos> "When the beast appears invincible "and death the only fate to those who fight it, "only the Strength of One's Blood
You can expect to hear from my lawyers.<eos> Now get out of my way.<eos> You're not going anywhere. Sit down.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You can dish it out, but you can't take it, can you?
His reckless assault on a French prison?<eos> - Surely not?<eos> - Let's take some refreshment.<eos> The absolute futility of such an act!<eos> What does it say of the man who would attempt it?
Well, how about an easy one then? How old are you?<eos> You're eight years old?<eos> That's the same age as my boy.<eos> Hey, you wanna come see if you can show me where your parents' house is?<eos> How about you ride up the front of the police car, you can play the siren and when we see it, you can point it out?
How'd you get into this?<eos> You know, I never really had anything against coal mining, 'cause those are the only jobs.<eos> But then when they said they were gonna blow up Shay Mountain, I just couldn't watch that happen.<eos> I mean, this mountain is a part of me.<eos> I've seen it every day of my life.
It wasn't enough for you.<eos> It wasn't enough for you and Dad.<eos> You know, I used to believe that I was responsible for all the bad luck in this family.<eos> God knows we've had our share.<eos> But after your dad died, I thought that you were gonna be the one to escape it.
Jesus.<eos> It's giving me hives just thinking about it.<eos> - What else is in here?<eos> - I don't want to know.<eos> - That's why I don't open it. - Oh.
Did you think I wouldn't check up on you when all of a sudden, a queens legal clinic starts acting like a midtown law form.<eos> Well, I did.<eos> And if this goes to trial, he's the one I'm up against, and we all know what happened last time.<eos> - You wouldn't be here if that's all you wanted to tell me.<eos> - So why don't you give me a number, and I'll take it to my client.
If he can't handle it, he can't handle it.<eos> That's how it goes.<eos> - Then I wanna petition the court to sit at the table with him.<eos> - No. - We can ask for a special exemption, and- and I said no, all right?<eos> They will not Grant it, and that is not your place here.
- Cool.<eos> No hardcore porno.<eos> We had to make a "no hardcore porno" rule, because the last guy fried the computer.<eos> I'm not allowed to tell you his name.<eos> We call it the Dave Rogers rule.
Happy New Year!<eos> Please, say something.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I don't like how you're using this song to manipulate my feelings.<eos> I didn't ask them to play it.
I like your artwork.<eos> It's useless and impractical.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, Annie says that everything you see before you was inspired by that piece.<eos> So, she wanted me to bring it in as a gift to Sophia.
Raina!<eos> Front of your cells.<eos> Shut the fuck up for headcount.<eos> Move it, Teresi, or I'll put you in a wheelchair.<eos> You put a hand on me, it's the last time you'll see it.
One of the conditions is that I keep a low profile.<eos> They don't want you to testify.<eos> Because of Eli.<eos> So this job offer... is a payoff, is that what you're saying?<eos> Call it whatever you want, but it's a really good deal.
You guys zeroed in on me the moment I walked in here.<eos> You haven't believed a word I said.<eos> That... That lady cop. She was just setting a trap.<eos> No.<eos> And now here you are, springing it.
This silver phial was found in your rooms.<eos> Can you explain the contents?<eos> I can.<eos> It is powdered Satyrion root, from a rare exotic orchid.<eos> At court, the ladies call it "Fountain of Youth".
She's on a break right now.<eos> But I can answer any question you might have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My wife, kate, has this necklace, and, I think it was a gift from her mother.<eos> And, you know, anyways, she always wears it, but the clasp broke, in the accident.
You're in danger.<eos> I have so many memories of snow.<eos> My first time ice-skating on my neighbor's pond.<eos> A month stationed near the French Alps.<eos> But the truth is... this is the first time I've seen it.
- with less pain. - Yes.<eos> But their physical bodies will eventually give out because of it.<eos> Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.
And there are already two agents that fall into this category --<eos> Jemma Simmons and Daisy Johnson.<eos> The inhuman.<eos> She's hacked into the framework.<eos> The two are inside with memories intact, trying to dismantle it.
Margaret Wells, ha!<eos> Blimey, Mrs. Wells took her in.<eos> - Well, I never! - Miss Lacey.<eos> She didn't get the pox here, did she?<eos> I don't want it.
Once dependent, always dependent.<eos> When, um... when I was a little girl, I had this T-shirt with a little ballerina on it.<eos> I loved it because she had a tiara with a rhinestone and a tiny pink tutu made of tulle.<eos> I...<eos> God, I wore it everywhere.
No. Thank you.<eos> No, I just came by to bring Elena... my jacket.<eos> There you go.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll just put it on over this jacket.
Was there any signs of tampering?<eos> - Remote access?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> We've looked three times.<eos> He developed this machine, it only stands to reason he knows it better than us.
My story's about an eight-year-old kid from Lone Grove, Oklahoma whose dad was killed by a drunk driver.<eos> A boy who lost his mother to cancer... and ended up on the streets.<eos> The good news is is where you start... is just the beginning.<eos> Like a movie, your life is a story.<eos> Nobody gets to write it but you.
Can you not get a taxi?<eos> What...? Hang on a second, there's a man here who wants to have a quick word with you. Hold on a second.<eos> Sir, your wife is very drunk.<eos> We've had to remove her from our establishment, so now she's out on the streets like rubbish.<eos> So... come and get your rubbish and take it home and... you know, make love to it.
- Olaf.<eos> Olaf.<eos> Who knows where he came from?<eos> You put us in his care.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call it care.
Well, Georgie, it's... it's been a pleasure.<eos> You can deliver this love letter yourself.<eos> This is no love letter.<eos> It's a battle strategy.<eos> I wanted to ensure my men would receive it in the event of my death.
We both know that Winslow is not capable of keeping his mouth shut.<eos> It's my boyfriend and my best friend.<eos> Maybe the President and Alex are right.<eos> Supergirl has a responsibility to protect everyone.<eos> But all I think about is the fact that two people I love are trapped on that ship and if we destroy it... Then they're destroyed, too, and that... That will break my heart.
But I wanna get past the numbers, talk about the people, the participants and counselors that make the program work.<eos> You can drop the act.<eos> What act?<eos> I'm tough, but I'm fair.<eos> Give me a success story and I'll write it straight.
This is dish soap, vinegar, and water.<eos> Nothing to be afraid of.<eos> You spray it and you scrub it.<eos> Now, once the leaf is clean, then you wanna check its health, okay?<eos> If it's withered, we wanna cut it. We wanna put it in a bag.
He's in Miami at an endorsement appearance.<eos> It was booked before we knew what today would be, so...<eos> That's too bad.<eos> The opening, all the work you've put into it.<eos> Such a shame your husband has to miss it.
If I say I"m gonna work, then that"s what I'll do!<eos> Y"all need to start trusting me.<eos> - It"s not about trust.<eos> - We need to trust you?<eos> "I" m passing this land to the child of mine who needs it and loves it most."
The laws of physics!<eos> - You okay, Dad?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've got a new idea, though.<eos> This time, I'll throw it at an angle.
Now, go on.<eos> There's no discipline in this place.<eos> Headmaster will see you now.<eos> I shall not ask the details about why you were "sent down".<eos> I've been in the scholastic profession long enough to know that nobody enters it unless he has some very good reasons he is anxious to conceal.
Can you stand for me?<eos> Marcel, we've got five totems and we got four kids.<eos> Okay, so who's the other kid?<eos> Nice car.<eos> Hey, do you mind if I borrow it?
And... promise you... I will make this right.<eos> Then start by giving this to Marcel.<eos> D, I'm sorry.<eos> When I lost you, my world fell apart, and I went through all the stages.<eos> I went through my whole rage spiral. I took it out on Klaus, Elijah, and they deserved what they got. But, um... now that it's all said and done, and... and you're still gone, the, uh... the only thing that keeps me in check is a code that I had... when I was a kid.
We have a black friend.<eos> Maybe we send Donovan out there, make him our version of Chris Darden. No thanks.<eos> Being on camera ain't my thing.<eos> We should ask for a gag order.<eos> There's no way Judge Tapper will sign off on it.
Asking you in the nice way.<eos> Alright!<eos> I've never seen him.<eos> A couple of times, I've done a guy a favour. He comes in here...<eos> With an envelope or something and I stash it in a church. And I call another guy and let him know it's there. Go on.
Let's get her to read it to you.<eos> Her flight hasn't left yet.<eos> Uh, there's no time.<eos> Ah, yes, there is.<eos> You just need a fast car and somebody reckless to drive it.
What, are you waiting for a consensus?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> You tell ten people a baby died, they all cry.<eos> You tell ten people a joke?<eos> Four laugh, four don't, and two don't get it.
What kind of sickness is it?<eos> An endless agony of retching and shitting and hating every breath he takes.<eos> That's my sweet hope.<eos> I have seen her with my own eyes, Governor, out at night, on her own, whispering to the moon.<eos> If there is witchery and we do not suppress it, the King might doubt the governance of this place.
Uh, I wasn't looking at her, you know...<eos> "Well, uh, well, I wasn't lookin"...<eos> "I wasn't looking at the pussy.<eos> What do you mean?"<eos> - "I wasn't lookin' at it." - "What do you mean?"
And we--we had these two, uh, two--two gooks, these two gooks, these Vietnamese soldiers...<eos> Oh, oh, so sorry.<eos> Uh, prisoners slope motherfuckers, and and they was just sitting there.<eos> And one of them just pulls out a cigarette.<eos> And lights it.
I do.<eos> Come on!<eos> You are coming with me.<eos> I got the baby.<eos> So? We'll drop it off at your cousin's.
Oh, no good.<eos> No good.<eos> But don't worry. Your face is under there.<eos> And it's beautiful.<eos> I know you don't see it right now, but you will one day.
He will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked."<eos> Oh, I bet your feet are disgusting.<eos> You see, this is the thing about female prisoners.<eos> Men understand violence.<eos> They respect it.
Yes, but if we do, we cannot also know where that thing is.<eos> Does that sound logical to you?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> And according to my esteemed colleague, the particle does not exist at all until we observe it.
I go after crooked cops.<eos> Looks like we both won here, no?<eos> Come on, do we really need to go through this procession again?<eos> I hope your lawyer passed the bar and can build a defense without that box of blackmail.<eos> I wouldn't open it, sweetie.
No.<eos> Give me that fucking shit.<eos> No, stop it!<eos> Wait.<eos> Where do you keep it?
Half of Havana got drunk with my grandfather.<eos> Yeah, and slept with your mother.<eos> Well, that's part of our heritage down here.<eos> Deep sea fishing, you know?<eos> We learn it from our dads and they learn it from their dads.
I know you declined my help, but I had my Spanish guards go to Meaux, where they found young Gerard, here.<eos> Come.<eos> Tell the lord chancellor how you came to wear that.<eos> An older boy gave it to me.<eos> He said he didn't want it anymore.
Today's the day you get your tiny house, right?<eos> Yep. They're dropping it off at the property we bought and we're sleeping in it tonight.
No.<eos> It sucks.<eos> I haven't sold a single piece.<eos> It's another rejection.<eos> It's like the universe stepped in dog shit and is wiping it off on my life.
We're not here to kill you, Clarke.<eos> We're here to take your ship, a ship you restored to save your people, not mine.<eos> That ship is a backup plan.<eos> It'll hold 100 people tops.<eos> Then you won't mind if we take it.
Don't be silly, Bert.<eos> There's always something to be done.<eos> Orders from up on high.<eos> Now, be a chap, take it on the chin, and get back in your cell sharpish.<eos> I'm Vic Hill! I own this wing and every slag on it!
Think.<eos> Catholic!<eos> Mary, Mary.<eos> Now surely you've heard this rhyme.<eos> I know it not.
Aw, baby...<eos> Baby, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> I just grabbed the first thing I could find.<eos> It just needs to be taken out in the back, just a little bit.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna take it out in the back.
God of Goat Herding?<eos> Grapes?<eos> Oh, wait. Is it Manure?<eos> I bet you love coming here and fucking with mortals 'cause back home in god-land, you barely rank.<eos> Watch your mouth, or I'll slice out your tongue, and I'll eat it in front of you.
I've been in the scholastic profession long enough to know that nobody enters it unless he has some very good reasons he is anxious to conceal.
You have a strong compliance department.<eos> I was hoping that you might put on an internal investigation.<eos> Make it look like you're responding to my pressure.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because, after a year or so, when your investigation is over, my office signs off on it.
Studious.<eos> And a clerkship with you would...<eos> Slice that baby up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love the sound it makes when they carve it.
Right, this way.<eos> You've got to... I can't move it...<eos> I can't go that way! He's driving!<eos> I can't move it!<eos> Why don't we pick it...
- It's a good idea.<eos> - It isn't a good idea!<eos> Or, how's this for an idea?<eos> Let me just throw it out there.<eos> Why not take a cow, turn the middle of it into burgers and steaks, and then, instead of throwing the skin away, use it to cover the seats of your car?
My life is a miracle.<eos> And stitching little girls' eyes closed... What kind of miracle is that?<eos> Don't judge belief until you know where it came from.<eos> - The gods decreed.<eos> - The gods who ran this camp were using it as a training facility to impersonate humans.
- I don't even know where else I might've gone.<eos> - Do you remember how to drink?<eos> - Hearing about my woes makes you think "party?"<eos> - The toast isn't for that.<eos> Finally, my welcome home party. I'm not... really sure why we're doing it here, but...
The people on that ship were your friends, your family even, for a time.<eos> I understand that. None of them can possibly grasp what you must do now to save the House of Ishida.<eos> Not like I do.<eos> [MISAKI] Take my life if you will.<eos> I offer it gladly, knowing that what I did was for the good of the Empire.
One sec!<eos> Did you already try the purple one?<eos> I don't do purple!<eos> I hate the jacket.<eos> I love it.
You wanted to make up for burning The Theatre, then let's away.<eos> Do this for me, and all is mended.<eos> How could Will abandon us?<eos> This stupid fairy tale was his idea!<eos> We'll pull it off.
I can die a forgotten coward, or I can live to be celebrated and remembered.<eos> Before that regent even touched his sword, I slit his throat.<eos> Four of his bodyguards stormed into the room, I clipped them all.<eos> To this day, before every battle, fear visits me,<eos> but now I embrace it as a friend.
Where are you, Eddie?<eos> You're a denier.<eos> You're the son.<eos> What's behind the door?<eos> If you don't open it, you'll never escape it.
Found in a shipwreck off Scapa flow.<eos> 107 years old...<eos> Well, you know what, you take that bottle.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> But as for the protomolecule, sergeant Draper was witness to a game-changing technology, and there can't be peace if one of us has it and not the other.
It's a difficult job, it's a harder life.<eos> But it has to be a labor of love.<eos> And if you're not in it for the right reasons, it'll shorten your life span, I think.<eos> I don't know many people who want to get up at two o'clock in the morning just to come to work and, you know, grind it out for ten or 12 hours, and then go home.<eos> [man speaking in English] Somebody's got to light the fire, somebody's got to get the meat out, they've got to season it, they've got to cut it, make sure it's on the pit, and make sure it's cooked right... and that takes a lot of hours, and a lot of talent.
That doesn't mean she wouldn't see the wisdom of putting it on the market.<eos> Right now, things between us are so fragile, I'm afraid to pull even a single thread.<eos> Plus, if I floated selling the house, I'd have to tell her why, and I think it's best that she... doesn't know the full extent of things.<eos> How's couples therapy going?<eos> As excruciating as I remember it?
- So tell Axe that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'd love to make the hero call, stop Axe from losing money.<eos> Last time I tried, he fired me.<eos> So you want me to review it.
Cross the Hudson wearing rebel blue?<eos> Wandering where their commander scarpered off to?<eos> He had it coming.<eos> I know precisely who and what you are.<eos> Please, this is where we report the war, not wage it.
And, uh, what about you?<eos> Any third dates coming up?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> I am retired, sexually.<eos> Took the sock off the door and now I'm wearing it.
Although I can't imagine you having anything that I would possibly want.<eos> I mean, I'll swing by your apartment and take a look around, but uh...<eos> What else, what else?<eos> Oh, I brought you some heroin.<eos> Hopefully some kids won't walk by and eat it.
So I'm gonna write you that note.<eos> - Here you go, sweetheart.<eos> - I don't want that.<eos> But I thought that's why you came in here.<eos> I did, but I don't want it for a real reason.
Knew him personally.<eos> Well... enough to know he would've greatly appreciated your admiration, Master Wells.<eos> This metal disc, how is it connected to him?<eos> Washington ordered me to deliver a missive.<eos> When Banneker refused it, I followed him into his workshop.
There's no friggin' password.<eos> No password.<eos> Good deal.<eos> Just as I'm about to reach in and grab the last glazed donut,<eos> Joanna just knocks me out of the way and takes it!
That guy was assaulting her.<eos> Were you protecting Paul when you threw a bottle at him?<eos> It's probably similar to the bottle that you beat him to death with.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I threw it because I was upset about something else and took it out on the boy.
Because this bill has loopholes you could fly a plane through.<eos> Mr. President, we're just trying to figure out how to handle this development with Bowman.<eos> I just read the bill. I can see why it didn't get out of committee.<eos> The problem is, if you don't support the bill, you'll be branded a hypocrite who used the town hall for political purposes when you're really soft on guns.<eos> But if you do support it, you're opening yourself up to all sorts of criticism because of its flawed wording.
So, how did the hearing go?<eos> Honestly, I don't know.<eos> I think I represented myself well.<eos> Aaron thought I did. But it's a hard room to read.<eos> I'm sure you knocked it out of the park.
Caleb, he...<eos> No. He nearly botched the mission with Champe. He was so drunk the night that we were set to take Arnold.<eos> Simcoe has gotten into his head.<eos> As long as you treat him as a broken man, he will be broken.<eos> Give him your trust as a friend, and he will earn it back.
Uh, we just went to three different diners looking for your perfect egg cream.<eos> One had Hershey's syrup instead of Fox's.<eos> The other one didn't have any to-go cups.<eos> Sounds like a recap, not a question.<eos> My question is why, after we finally found your perfect egg cream that passed your egg cream litmus test, why, William... why are you not drinking it?
Furthermore, the hospital found nothing wrong with Farmer.<eos> He was discharged, which fits with the whole thing being a deliberate deception.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> Look, this is information you should have known earlier, DCI Huntley, far, far earlier, and in my view, the reason you didn't know it is because you were itching to charge this suspect, come what may.
Do you want to help me?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Then what help are you, man?<eos> This is a song about somebody I killed.<eos> If I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
We will have stories in common.<eos> Of course.<eos> Tell us a story of the Prince, Maggie.<eos> I did hear of...<eos> Um, once, you and your brother Edward caught a fox in the grounds, and sneaked it into the nursery.
Turn off the machine!<eos> Nice try.<eos> But did you really think we'd use the same word on your bratty brother that we used on the mill workeroaa? eea<eos> You will never find the word to save your brother.<eos> And you certainly won't find it in time to save Charles.
Blanket, perhaps?<eos> Thank you, no.<eos> I'm strangely never more uncomfortable than when I'm comfortable.<eos> It's the quiet moments that frighten me the most, I think.<eos> Women like us, we prefer the storm to the calm before it.
There's someone on the property.<eos> Go to the master bedroom.<eos> All right. I'm in the master.<eos> There's a safe.<eos> Do you see it?
Someone's at the door.<eos> All right.<eos> I want you to load the shotgun.<eos> Take a shell.<eos> Holding the brass end, push it into the loading flap until you hear a click.
- Yeah, great. Thank you.<eos> - Thanks again, man. - Great, yeah.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - Great. Need any help?<eos> - No, I got it. - All right.
You really should try Ginny's cheeseburger chowder.<eos> The ground Chuck and spices, the melted cheese...<eos> I highly recommend it for the inaugural balls.<eos> If you think you can maintain your immunity agreement by blackmailing the president-elect for allegedly taking illegal campaign contributions from Alexander kirk. You're not as smart as everyone says you are.<eos> Marlin, your boss made a campaign promise to me and I intend to make sure he keeps it.
Been working on my Paso doble.<eos> Fred Astaire, look out.<eos> Bobby's lost six pounds.<eos> Now, two million people may watch the inauguration, but the dance floor is all Miriam cares about.<eos> And my girl and I are gonna tear it up.
Why was he digging a hole?<eos> He was burying something.<eos> A wooden box.<eos> Beautiful carved thing, it was.<eos> Anyway, he clearly didn't want it, so I waited for him to go and then I dug it up.
Well, maybe you got a secret or two of your own.<eos> Maybe at the end of this, the law will be waiting for us down there and that's your plan?<eos> That sound about right?<eos> Look, if you don't trust me, that's fine. That's your choice.<eos> But the fact is, there's dynamite in there, and they're gonna use it.
Let's go.<eos> You helped them steal it, seriously wounding three security contractors, one of whom you hospitalized.<eos> Look, I did what I had to do.<eos> I gained the Farrells' trust.<eos> Do you know where they're storing it, at least?
What the hell happened to me?<eos> I promise, I'm going to tell you everything, but it's gonna have to be in person.<eos> Roman, look in your pocket.<eos> There's a coin in there, it's a very special coin.<eos> I gave it to you when we were little.
That's better.<eos> So long as you're not looking, it's okay.<eos> Do you want some of that pizza?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> We're not gonna eat it, so.
So long as you're not looking, it's okay.<eos> Do you want some of that pizza?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> We're not gonna eat it, so.<eos> If you're... if you're not gonna eat it, why did you order it?
Oh, no, it's fine.<eos> Well, Frank, I'm really sorry about that hose thing.<eos> Oh, no hard feelings.<eos> Shirt needed freshening anyway.<eos> I haven't washed it since we stopped to take pictures at Smokey-Top,
Mr. Sweeney. But... why?<eos> We can't put you on the stand knowing you will perjure yourself.<eos> You can only relate something that is true or potentially true.<eos> God, I love the law.<eos> And everybody takes it so seriously.
Ma'am, this is an active crime scene.<eos> Oh, it's okay. I work in an office.<eos> Where's Rutger's firearm?<eos> For safety, I removed Detective Hiss' weapon and placed it in my back pocket.<eos> Per police protocol, I will now remove the weapon, make sure it is unloaded, and place it on the counter.
Wouldn't want someone to incite another stabbing rampage, now, would we?<eos> Well, it's not my fault humans can't handle the divine.<eos> Besides, if I hadn't done that, we wouldn't have found out what that blade actually is.<eos> And you really think that this is the Flaming Sword?<eos> I thought Father destroyed it during my rebellion so I wouldn't use it against Him.
Is that one of those fancy little mailboxes?<eos> No, it's called a tiny house, but normal size people can live in them, too.<eos> Pop-Pop told us to be resourceful, so we took his advice.<eos> Yep, so we are homeowners now and real adults, and we don't need - to rely on anyone for anything. - Mm.<eos> - Where you gonna put it?
So maybe this is another Black Spring?<eos> I, uh... I spent six years in jail for doing some pretty awful things, so, if that was the case,<eos> I'd be the first one gone.<eos> What were you looking at?<eos> That gray shape out there, you see it?
I love that song.<eos> Mm, me, too.<eos> I find it comforting.<eos> My father would beat my mother.<eos> My sister would bring my brother and me into her room, and she'd play it, turn it up as loud as she could.
From the fridge to the trash.<eos> I am taking it on the chin today.<eos> There's even an awards ceremony at the Embassy Suites.<eos> The trophy is a crystal palm tree.<eos> We'll attach it to a necklace so you can wear it - when relatives come over. - Mm-hmm.
We're the only things standing between those monsters and home.<eos> If we run, they'll kill everyone.<eos> How can we possibly win?<eos> This blade... It's called hrunting.<eos> It was enchanted with light magic to ensure that whoever carries it into battle will be hailed a hero.
Do you know what it says?<eos> I don't.<eos> Dad?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I don't want to open it.
I still don't know what I'm looking for.<eos> Look, banishing Reynard had to take an insane amount of energy.<eos> So any sort of strange event or operation.<eos> Yeah, that's literally the definition of "news."<eos> We'll know it when we see it.
Ask yourself a question:<eos> What will a Magician need if dark days come?<eos> Answer: magic.<eos> But if it is gone, it is gone, you say.<eos> Not so, if you store it like a battery.
What?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Why do you have gasoline?<eos> Well, I'm not gonna pay Greenwich prices.<eos> So you keep it in a juice jug? ! Yeah.
Every supernatural encounter we've had leads back to dreyfuss.<eos> The Lincoln memorial.<eos> Dreyfuss enterprises had a contract to restore the statue before Lincoln's head went missing.<eos> The dyer house.<eos> Dreyfuss had applied for permits to drain the swamplands around it.
Yes, Master Wells.<eos> And if this piece of the Talisman resides in a crypt beneath the street, perhaps we can access it from below.<eos> Are you kidding? We barely escaped that Sphinx above ground. We'd be sitting ducks in those tunnels.<eos> Not if we provide a distraction from above.<eos> We can draw it out again, keep it occupied long enough for Crane and Diana to get into the crypt.
Their version was a fairy tale that highlighted the creature's deadliest trait.<eos> Its ability to adopt human form.<eos> Not only that, it would disguise itself as someone trusted, someone close to them.<eos> In the case of the pilgrims, the dead girl mercy Bradford's father, captain William Bradford.<eos> Ultimately, they subdued the creature, buried it in an underground chamber, sealed with an enchanted rock.
You said it burned down.<eos> Well, it did.<eos> Right before my eyes.<eos> The mint-glazed marrow reduction... my God, it was just so tasty.<eos> They source it from an organic whey-fed pork farm in the Hudson Valley.
The reason why Snart and I got on so well was we trusted one another.<eos> We were friends.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The spear could alter reality itself.<eos> We broke it into four separate pieces.
I will never stop fighting.<eos> Sure you will.<eos> Kill her.<eos> Get rid of that.<eos> But I will take this mask... so I can add it to my collection.
How did it look?<eos> Devonshire was beautiful, Lord.<eos> God be with you.<eos> What binds a man to his land?<eos> What power within allows him to give his life to preserve his land and the lives of the families who work it?
No, it's the beast.<eos> It's circling us, it's looking for a way in.<eos> It's getting stronger again.<eos> It's strong enough to feed.<eos> Every hour of sunlight that feeds it makes the world darker and the beast stronger.
If it helps, I do have a plan.<eos> It feeds on light but it homes in on sound.<eos> So what's going to happen?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Bit of noise, lure the beast here, Drive it back through the gate.
I don't know where she is, and I doubt anyone else will.<eos> He does.<eos> Shall we continue our tour?<eos> Oh, yeah. Sorry. I thought you'd be longer.<eos> Well, the line at the ladies' was epic. I decided to hold it.
It isn't.<eos> You could still get out.<eos> I dream about that. The life I had. Wishing I could get it back.<eos> I can help you.<eos> The WITSEC list, when we get it back, I can get you on it.
Looks like it's been placed.<eos> It's not old! It's like a brand-new shoe.<eos> Right...<eos> You haven't seen my keys, have you?<eos> I put it up on the wall anyway, see if anyone comes back for it.
Well, you don't know where its been.<eos> It could be covered in dog shit.<eos> It's brand-new, that's the whole point.<eos> Well, if it's brand-new, don't put it on the table, it's bad luck.<eos> All right, I just didn't want anyone stealing it.
They better. I think. Some of them.<eos> They know more words now but how they say words. The, um...<eos> The pronunciation? - Yes.<eos> It's very bad. - Yes.<eos> It's hard to learn new language when don't speak it all time.
Unfortunately for you, that included a certain admiral.<eos> Fortunate, it put me on the wagon.<eos> Unfortunate, it put Pride on the case, which is how I got my butt busted.<eos> I was this close to pulling off that sweet con, too.<eos> Still have a chance if we can pull it off on Garcia.
Nothing we talk about can get back to Katie.<eos> All right? You know my wife, you know my daughter.<eos> Now it's time for you to get to know me.<eos> For instance, one of my hobbies is I like to take walks in the woods and bury things in holes.<eos> Sometimes I take one thing, cut it up, and bury it in different holes.
When we spoke last week, you said you were going to end the affair.<eos> I'm ending it this weekend.<eos> We're going on a wine-tasting trip.<eos> And why does everyone insist on calling it an affair?<eos> - What would you call it?
- Why?<eos> - Let's not ask questions.<eos> - What happened to the pole?<eos> So I am very excited about exploring the burgeoning local Long Island wine scene with you guys.<eos> Some are calling it the new Napa.
- Hey, you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What happened to your ankle?<eos> I sprained it.
I lost the necklace.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait, so she lost it in one day?<eos> I know, I know, I know. I-I'm so sorry. I mean, we tore the entire house apart.<eos> If I find it, obviously, I'll call you.
Thank you.<eos> Wait, so she lost it in one day?<eos> I know, I know, I know. I-I'm so sorry. I mean, we tore the entire house apart.<eos> If I find it, obviously, I'll call you.<eos> Yeah, I'm not buying it.
Thank you.<eos> - [Phone beeps] - The U.S. Marshals will be down to pick up Damian Andrews and bring him back to the States.<eos> It's for the best.<eos> Yeah, Jamaican prison is probably not the best place for someone like Damian Andrews.<eos> He'd run it like a hotel.
We need his energy. - No.<eos> - You're born, huge energy;<eos> you die, bigger energy, especially a demigod.<eos> That is what we are after here, people, the energy.<eos> Right now, he's just a skin sack hiding it from us.
Because you're here.<eos> Is there a cure?<eos> There is.<eos> A slow treatment, which may cause discomfort over a period of time or a rapid remedy with instant effect.<eos> The slow treatment, will he be aware of it?
They kidnapped my brother.<eos> Okay?<eos> And they will kill him if I don't pay up.<eos> So let me help you, all right?<eos> But start by lowering this weapon before I take it and feed it to you.
It's "Westworld."<eos> Oh, wait a minute, Sarge.<eos> I don't have eyes on that room.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'll find it.
Coming up on the midday news, a couple in their 30s gets married without their dog being in the wedding.<eos> You're not gonna believe their story.<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> Are you going to open this door, or am I going to start killing people?<eos> I'm not opening it.
Let me count the ways.<eos> I love thee to the depth and breadth "and height my soul..."<eos> I'm gonna be late for school... Of course you are.<eos> All you need to do is slip this into Pastor Frank's jacket.<eos> When he finds it, he will know that it's from Miss Abigail, and it will absolutely melt his heart.
We didn't.<eos> This was one of a kind.<eos> Legend tells that it was created over a thousand years ago by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order.<eos> After his passing, the Jedi kept the saber in their temple.<eos> That was, until members of House Vizsla snuck in and liberated it.
- Was it... Positive?<eos> - No.<eos> It was real bad.<eos> - I made this saddle out of your sister.<eos> And now I'm going to put it on your back.
Yeah, listen, Schmidt, it's trash.<eos> Need I remind you that you started a petition to get Enya to play at the Super Bowl halftime show?<eos> You're misrepresenting my petition. Okay?<eos> I wanted her to play on the field during the fourth quarter.<eos> Schmidt, I bet I could make a fake EDM song and you couldn't tell it apart from a real one.
I can't open it. It's under emergency protocol.<eos> You need to use the combination lock.<eos> Set it to 3614.<eos> You're going to have to guide me.<eos> I can't see it from here - you can see it, right?
Stop talking about it.<eos> I loved it.<eos> Where'd she learn how to do hair?<eos> Eh, um... l-lots of salons where I'm from.<eos> Oh, so you understand us. You just don't speak it that well.
You know, 'cause you wanted... you wanted...<eos> Paint the house.<eos> Paint the house. Yes, we... did.<eos> Even though the majority of our house is already painted.<eos> We wanted our best friends to finish it.
I'm very sorry, President Dalton.<eos> This broken engagement is just another in a long line of betrayals.<eos> I can no longer see an end to the conflict until ECS is finished.<eos> When I was ten years old, my father was murdered by the Colombian government, gunned down in front of me and my sister for the crime of reporting the truth about state-sponsored corruption.<eos> I pledged my life then to this cause, and I will never abandon it.
Hey, here's something weird.<eos> I got a call from the CIA.<eos> They want me to come in for an Ex Post Facto Re-debrief regarding Black Dog Station.<eos> Well, I was in the CIA for 20 years and I've never heard of an Ex Post Facto Re-debrief.<eos> When they shut down the operation down they called it a "hotwash."
Fremont Jones, known as "Free."<eos> Ah, the graffiti artist, huh?<eos> I know his work; he's brilliant.<eos> Well, right now he doesn't have much hope.<eos> We used the DARPA foam to stop his internal bleeding, but when we remove it for surgery, he'll bleed out.
That seems more familiar.<eos> She could definitely become my dream woman.<eos> And Finch screwed this marriage up.<eos> Well maybe I can fix that, if I or things don't get out of control again.<eos> Well, if Finch is stuck with my old life, he's welcome to it.
She could definitely become my dream woman.<eos> And Finch screwed this marriage up.<eos> Well maybe I can fix that, if I or things don't get out of control again.<eos> Well, if Finch is stuck with my old life, he's welcome to it.<eos> I'd pity him, but I think he probably deserves it.
We're Librarians. We work for the Library.<eos> No, we're not. We're plumbers.<eos> Yeah. We keep magic from getting out to the world.<eos> It can be a very dangerous thing in the wrong hands.<eos> Of course, I would never keep it from you, my angel.
Half almond, half soy?<eos> No.<eos> Half milk, half fatter milk. Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> We stopped carrying cream.<eos> Nobody wants it, because it's very unhealthy for you.
I haven't seen this baseball glove in 30 years.<eos> - Takes you back, doesn't it?<eos> - Yeah. You probably have a lot of memories in this house.<eos> Sure do.<eos> Just so you know, when someone buys this place, they're gonna tear it down.
It turned our lips bright red.<eos> Yeah, it had so much sugar, we had to let you out to run alongside the car.<eos> I can't believe they have it.<eos> Shoot. They're all out.<eos> Well, I'll find it for you somewhere.
Hi, sweetie.<eos> Hello, Jessica.<eos> Those teeth I borrowed were from his private collection.<eos> He has spent years gathering teeth from powerful historical figures to put together the perfect mouth.<eos> He calls it "Mouth Brushmore."
What are you boys doing?<eos> We've had a dishwasher this whole time?<eos> Why haven't we been using it?<eos> Because this family doesn't believe in dishwashers.<eos> It was there when we moved in. We'll never use it.
Okay, fine!<eos> We're not house poor.<eos> - I lied.<eos> - Why would you say we're in financial trouble when we're not?<eos> Because I wanted us to buy this house, but I don't want us to enjoy it.
Although, pineapple cake does sound good.<eos> No.<eos> Pie is superior because it is filled with nutritious fruit.<eos> It is the healthiest dessert.<eos> In fact, pie is so good, dessert couldn't contain it.
Unless you got a better idea.<eos> Uh, what's this?<eos> The greatest day of my life! Can you believe it?<eos> We are now the proud owners of our very own microfiche machine.<eos> And just to be clear, this is mine, but I'm leaving it out for all of us so we can use it.
It snowed today.<eos> We cozied up in the reading nook with our beautiful boy and listened to classical music."<eos> I had a reading nook?<eos> I listened to classical music?<eos> You know, I've always loved classical music, but my "dad" calls it dentist music.
Bleach, Gibbs.<eos> Chemical test confirms that both the stanchion and the lifeline were cleaned with bleach-- which is odd, since Navy 101 is to never use bleach on a ship's weather decks, because...<eos> It's too corrosive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Someone would only use it if...
I am not an invalid. Ah.<eos> Okay.<eos> And this thing, this thing, I had this on low all day long.<eos> Did not cook.<eos> Put it up to high, that happens. Mm.
What I am doing is drifting. There's no denying that.<eos> Oh, yes! Yes!<eos> I've connected the steering wheel to my feet.<eos> This is a whole new feeling.<eos> This is not reacting to a slide, this is deliberately provoking it and keeping it right on the point.
I can't keep it.<eos> I won't know what to do with it. And... what would it mean?<eos> It means... that we loved each other for a while.<eos> How's... How's your shoulder?<eos> They said I'll only ever really feel it in the cold.
- You know that's the only bit we're going to use, don't you?<eos> THEY LAUGH I know when to pick me lines.<eos> Yeah, that's better.<eos> Once he experienced the fame, and all that comes with that,<eos> I think he was done with it.
THEY LAUGH I know when to pick me lines.<eos> Yeah, that's better.<eos> Once he experienced the fame, and all that comes with that,<eos> I think he was done with it.<eos> He was done with it.
# But now we'll make it... # So, I remember doing this interview with Tony Visconti.<eos> The interviewer asked us both, what was David's relationship to jazz music?<eos> Something like that, and Tony's response was that he thought that that influence had always been there in David's music, but it was just sort of underneath the surface, and that now, it was just, you know, out there.<eos> # Endless faith in hopeless deeds... # Of course, when this thing was released, there were all sorts of comments.<eos> Some people were just absolutely hating it, and some people were loving it, and some people didn't know what to think.
You are the author of the magnificent Don Quixote de La Mancha.<eos> You know, it took only three months To finish the first edition.<eos> Congratulations, I am convinced that the Your chronicle will have no comparisons.<eos> I'm not convinced.<eos> I think Lope would write it in Way closer to the queen's taste.
You know, my first time, I was 8.<eos> Dorset Bank.<eos> Smurf had me go to the guard and show him my, um, RoboCop action figure.<eos> And when he smiled, I threw a fistful of sand in his eyes.<eos> Smurf took his gun, gave it to me.
- Really?<eos> Was it was an RS?<eos> An SS? A Z/28?<eos> I only know that it was red.<eos> I want to find something connected to that car to give Sam so he'll always be reminded of it.
Negative.<eos> Negative.<eos> Right, it makes negative sense.<eos> I'm glad you agree.<eos> Ma'am, the issue is that the high compressor drum requires special MHE before we reroute it to the APOE.
And if he loses, he gets 25 to life?<eos> Do you remember anything more about how you got that cut?<eos> I'm trying, but I can't remember.<eos> And I'm not taking the offer.<eos> I understand what's at stake. I'm not taking it.
I'm listening.<eos> We have money... a lot of it.<eos> And we're willing to spend it in any way that makes our lives easier, including lining the right pockets in Caracas.<eos> I was just waiting to hear what your goal was.<eos> Even if I had that information, I wouldn't share it with two men who represent a firm that doesn't exist.
- You have to tell me where it is.<eos> - So you can tell him?<eos> No way!<eos> You'll find out when we get there.<eos> Not if Thrawn destroys it first.
What are you doing here?<eos> Same thing you are.<eos> You sold us all out.<eos> Rhysy.<eos> So we steal the car for you, we get pinched by the cops, you steal it from here and keep the $4 million for yourself.
I'm trying to help him get a job out here.<eos> Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> What, Leonard, please.<eos> I know an angry face when I see it.
He'd move heaven and earth to make it better.<eos> That's his job, isn't it?<eos> To make sure you're happy, at any cost?<eos> You're doing the face.<eos> Dad calls it your faraway face.
We could take a boat down the river.<eos> Sometimes I wonder if I'm afraid to be happy.<eos> Not sure I deserve it.<eos> Contentment is a gift, hard-won.<eos> I'd say you deserve it.
Bottom line, to engage in a relationship with someone so much younger, so much less mature, that represents damage.<eos> We're still two jurors short.<eos> Margaret and Kenny.<eos> Any progress on the timing of Susan's pregnancy?<eos> The vitamins are the only purchase indicator I could find, which puts it at three months.
I mean, you turn on the news, and we're all so divided.<eos> Yelling and pointing fingers;<eos> there's so much meanness out there.<eos> Stop looking for it.<eos> Who's looking for it?
Yeah?<eos> Yeah. We think he shot the guy to death.<eos> In a warehouse that they co-own. Watson texted me from the scene.<eos> Police have been searching for hours, still can't find a murder weapon.<eos> We don't find it, a jury might actually believe the story he's peddling about "some black guy" killing the partner then fleeing.
He's so... he can't function by himself."<eos> So my mother... she'd asked a bunch of her friends to sort of look in on him, and Astrid was one of them.<eos> So I called Astrid.<eos> I said, "Astrid", "will you take Warren... Make him some soup?<eos> "Go over there and look after him, because he's not gonna make it."
[Jacqueline] Exactly.<eos> You're making money off of people that hate you.<eos> It's like if I made money off brunettes.<eos> And think about it.<eos> When a fan buys a jersey, they keep it for life, but when a protester buys a jersey, they burn it and buy another one next week.
Reddington.<eos> Elizabeth, where are you?<eos> Asa hightower, the apothecary, we have him in custody, and we found his lab.<eos> Have you identified the toxin?<eos> The lab's working on it. Not yet, but they will.
The killer goes to Tendu's room, tries to enter.<eos> He's delayed by the security latch on the door.<eos> Fresh abrasions on the metal suggest that it was forcefully engaged and then defeated.<eos> Only, by that time, Tendu had escaped.<eos> So the guy comes up empty-handed, but he isn't ready to give up, so he finds the kid's club and he takes it back to Owen Tuchman's room.
That's why we work so well together.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> If I go down, so do you.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> You're not going to use it anyway.
At least he's finally being honest!<eos> OK.<eos> If it's honest you want... then open wide cos here it comes.<eos> I cannot play the guitar.<eos> I actively hate it.
If Gordon didn't do it... whoever did knew how to cover their tracks.<eos> Like someone in the Navy or law enforcement-- but we checked both victims' records, nothing jumps out.<eos> Nothing to confirm Gordon's claim of Janet Ortega's mystery suitor?<eos> Nothing other than the purple gemstone necklace.<eos> However, the victim was wearing it right before she got killed, like Gordon said.
Nothing to confirm Gordon's claim of Janet Ortega's mystery suitor?<eos> Nothing other than the purple gemstone necklace.<eos> However, the victim was wearing it right before she got killed, like Gordon said.<eos> This is from a surveillance camera at the Decatur streetcar station that same night, 20 years ago.<eos> Except, she wasn't wearing it after she was killed, also like Gordon said.
Thank you.<eos> Did Alvez say what he wanted us for?<eos> No.<eos> The same DNA was on the outside of the water bottle at Joey Fletcher's crime scene, but none in the water itself.<eos> So he's not drinking it.
That's my detail. What's yours?<eos> It's that damn water.<eos> Why does the unsub take bottled water to the crime scene?<eos> Well, we profiled sadist.<eos> That's when we thought he was drinking it in front of them.
The most I can get the DOJ to hold is four days.<eos> That's how long you have to me something actionable.<eos> Preparations for the sand mandala - are going well.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> These monks spent all week painstakingly arranging colored sand to fit this blueprint, and when, whoosh, they just sweep it away.
You were very... untraditional, um... selfish, probably negligent.<eos> Definitely negligent.<eos> Larger than life.<eos> Planetary, really.<eos> Yeah, like a big black hole, just capable of sucking all the light and banishing it to another...
- Okay, bullshit.<eos> We're entitled to the truth.<eos> - You want the truth?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And we're not leaving until we get it.
Gold Two is down.<eos> Zeb, get her to Medical, and then get on the guns.<eos> What about our ship?<eos> We need all the firepower we can get.<eos> - You got anyone who can fly it?
Yes, it is.<eos> Yes, it is!<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Now I know why I got this mission.<eos> Nobody else wanted it.
Why didn't she take her body?<eos> On account of all the pain and sorrow it soaked up.<eos> What happens in life writes a story in our flesh.<eos> What's gonna happen to her body?<eos> When we're done here, they'll take this box and bury it deep.
_<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, wow, your old bedroom junk.<eos> Is your dad finally turning it into the tiki bar he's always dreamed of?
Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play "Where's Wolowitz?"<eos> Okay, now, Th-this is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel.<eos> Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm.
You think anyone's gonna believe you?<eos> You'd be selling your ass on the corner if I hadn't taught you some sense.<eos> You still doing coke, bitch?<eos> That's what rich people do.<eos> Y'all are the ones who cook it.
Grab that flask, put on this lab coat, follow me.<eos> All clear.<eos> Everybody's at the ceremony.<eos> See, this light is here for a reason... So insane people do not open this door while the turbine is on.<eos> So stand back while I open it.
Should we do the Walk of Fame or the La Brea Tar Pits first?<eos> Well, I really... I wanted to see the Hollywood sign.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's fun.<eos> Just check to see that it's up.<eos> They take it down twice a week to clean the letters.
We need to get you to a hospital.<eos> Can you just answer my question, please?<eos> Red, - and blue, yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I think there's pressure on the speech center of my brain, and I've got to find out what's causing it.
I have to.<eos> You know how they never found Susanna's scarf?<eos> Burned up in the fire. No.<eos> I saw it... two days ago. - Mom...<eos> - The D.A.'s little girl was waving it out her window like it was aa toy.
There can't be anybody around.<eos> That's good, Michelle.<eos> That narrows it down.<eos> Let's find all those places within the search area;<eos> we come up with a list. We divvy it up between NCIS and FBI.
What are you doing in my family's cathedral?<eos> Didn't anyone tell you?<eos> It's our family's cathedral now by his Grace's royal decree.<eos> Capulets have been building that church for generations.<eos> And now Montagues will finish it.
The match that brings the flames of war to our fair city and burns it to the ground?<eos> She must be found.<eos> And I cannot sit by when it is my job to find her.<eos> I'm the one and only Prince.<eos> You hollow out the statue's head, fill it with colored oil, poke a tiny hole in the eye, and voilà.
Go talk some sense into him.<eos> To what end, doctor?<eos> You and I both know he will not change his mind.<eos> Samara and I will tow the Enterprise to a safe distance.<eos> Then we'll enter the rift and seal it.
Hey, hey, hey, all this anger and negativity is stressing Riley out.<eos> Here. I'll hold it while you take a sip. Ahh!<eos> You wanna know what's really stressing me out?<eos> How cold it is in here.<eos> Uh, Danny, do you... do you think you could go get my blue blanket, and if you don't see it, just keep looking.
[Huston] There were planes lost on that mission, but the War Department wanted it to be a completely successful mission.<eos> [airplane hums] [man] Nine bombers came out, and nine are going home.<eos> Audiences were very used to a sterilized Hollywood war.<eos> Listen, Dale, this is your first time up.<eos> Don't try to win this war all by yourself. [Spielberg] You know, with John Wayne, and where the war is secondary to the heroes who were fighting it.
"We don't need this anymore."<eos> Not only from a practical point of view, but from a human point of view.<eos> [narrator] After three days with no sign of surrender from Japan, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.<eos> [General MacArthur] I now invite the representatives of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters to sign the instrument of surrender at the places indicated.<eos> Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world and that God will preserve it always.
I got us one.<eos> The tunnel is underneath the van on the left.<eos> Damn.<eos> You weren't lying.<eos> Coke comes from Mexico through the tunnel and then the vans take it to Dallas.
Because I have to get my accordion out of the elevator.<eos> I guess you're not gonna do it, so I guess I'm gonna do it.<eos> No, I'll get it.<eos> Well, don't do me any favors.<eos> Look, I said I'll get it, I'll get it.
Are you okay?<eos> Are you hurt? Do you need help?<eos> I broke my bike.<eos> It was my birthday present, and I broke it.<eos> They can't afford it, but they knew how much I wanted it.
Or you can stay here and let us in.<eos> I'm not going anywhere, and I will not leave you.<eos> I had a feeling you'd be here.<eos> I had a feeling you'd find me.<eos> You followed me. Well... journalism might be dead in America, but where I come from, if you want to find a story, you go look for it.
And though this is a celebration, I can't help but think of all the people who still have to be afraid to just be who they are, to just love.<eos> And so... I vow that my love for you will be so big that it will give us the strength to never stop fighting for what's right.<eos> Also, I vow that every morning, when I get up, hours and hours before you do, and see your used ice cream bowl in the sink, not even soaking...<eos> I will resent you.<eos> But I will rinse it and put it in the dishwasher.
Ken, I'm glad you acknowledge your need for vast improvement in that area.<eos> Carry on.<eos> See, that was fun.<eos> Thank you guys.<eos> Look, I don't want Pat thinking I'm not 100% committed to medicine, because I take it very seriously.
As partners.<eos> Partners.<eos> I need a percentage of the gross.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Mary Pickford got it from Zukor in '16.
See, that's the problem with your side.<eos> You think that the truth matters to anyone, but this is a post-truth world.<eos> Nobody wants a boring fact.<eos> They want a good story.<eos> And the better the story, the more faith they have in the person who tells it.
I don't know why I had to pay a cover to meet you in here just to turn around and go back out.<eos> I like the music.<eos> That what they call it?
Her equipment may help us find Krilov. How?<eos> The eeg machine he stole from her is state-of-the-art.<eos> It's designed to receive updates from a main server.<eos> So it's part of a wireless network.<eos> Which we can use to locate the machine and Krilov, once he turns it on.
Prints weren't in the system.<eos> The killer went through her purse, took her wallet, but missed a side pocket.<eos> That's her public transit card.<eos> It was probably there for easy access.<eos> She used it constantly.
I am and so is Anna, but she also knows that if treatment stops working, extreme measure won't turn the tide.<eos> Look, this isn't a white flag.<eos> It's a worst case scenario.<eos> She said she had a fever.<eos> She does, but we're treating it.
And what are the people saying to you now?<eos> They're saying, "Protect us.<eos> Make us feel safe."<eos> So, how do I fix this?<eos> Well, I have a proposal, and I'm gonna tell it to you, Cecilia, first, right here and now.
Let's call to order this emergency meeting of the school board regarding Principal Shepherd's meltdown.<eos> I know a number of our students have felt<eos> "traumatized" by the events of this week, and we take those concerns very seriously.<eos> Lois, I'm done with my gum.<eos> I don't want it.
I go pop, pop, fizz, fizz, oh, how sweet it is.<eos> Check!<eos> Check!<eos> I'm done with this gum now.<eos> I don't want it.
Coal fires only burn at a thousand degrees Celsius. But if we can create a 20,000 volt lightning strike in the sand pit...<eos> That'll create a glass barrier in the middle of the coal vein, cutting off the fire from the depot.<eos> Okay, but how are you gonna create a lightning strike?<eos> Sand's an insulator.<eos> We'll wet it with saline solution so it conducts electricity.
You got it.<eos> If, in addition to this journal, you've found a small skeleton in an elf costume, you now know why.<eos> After the dinner incident, things just got more tense.<eos> But some desperately held onto hope.<eos> For that bottle to reach Allie, it would have to get down to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, get swept up into the Benguela, caught in the South Equatorial stream, switch to the North stream, somehow find its way to the Gulf Stream and hope that some Florida fisherman found it and mailed it to her.
The sins of the entitled athlete being swept under the rug by his enablers.<eos> I'm sure Mr. Fontino's family will be enjoying the blood money he's earning as soon as Houston Spivey's name is called in the draft.<eos> Well, the lab says the blood in Fontino's trunk was a match for the victims.<eos> And he knew about the murder weapon.<eos> He knew about it, couldn't produce it though, could he?
Extra shot, right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's Pride doing here?<eos> I'll get your keys for you, sir.<eos> Just leave it there.
I'll kill myself."<eos> You can do that.<eos> You can do that once.<eos> But you can do it.<eos> It's interesting because even when life gets bad, people choose it over nothing.
Don't ask me that shit.<eos> I don't know who Achilles' mother." Don't yell out if you know.<eos> "It's Campampetes." Nobody cares what you know. [audience laughing]<eos> She had a question about Achilles, it was interesting.<eos> I'll tell it to you.
We got eyes all over Knowhere.<eos> The zombies aren't just tearing stuff up.<eos> They're building some kind of weapon.<eos> A Believer weapon.<eos> And they're taking it to Xandar!
Francesca... have you ever seen this firearm before?<eos> Don't answer that, Ms Doyle.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> The murder weapon.<eos> Francesca, do you recognise it?
As if she didn't want me to feel special, on any day.<eos> When I was nine, she let me have my first birthday party and, um...<eos> I spent weeks planning it.<eos> Sent out the invites.<eos> And she cancelled it, the day before, without telling me.
His record's clean, but maybe you can find something I didn't.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I recognize this letter.<eos> Because I'm the one who wrote it.<eos> Not sure I'd call it a letter.
You will never believe what happened to me."<eos> - Did you get pliers?<eos> - Where from?<eos> What have you been doing all week?<eos> I got some clothes from Iman's cell before they cleared it. Uh...
Step out of the car, please.<eos> Step out of the car, now.<eos> Wait, no, no, no, Officer.<eos> This is my fault, okay?<eos> My father passed away, and we were driving down to Odessa to make the arrangements, and I was too devastated to drive, and she graciously offered to drive even though she's been working all night, so if you have to give anybody a ticket, please, give it to me.
Biology of this hybrid is nuts.<eos> Look at the size of that ear canal.<eos> It's incredibly similar to Marsupialia that use echolocation.<eos> Abe was onto something with that unique hybrid frequency.<eos> They're using it to communicate.
I'm sorry.<eos> She, um, disappeared... a few days ago.<eos> She ran away.<eos> She had a hard life.<eos> And, yes, I am taking it personally.
I'm a bit like Robin Hood.<eos> I steal from the rich, and I sell to the highest bidder.<eos> Dude, you gotta watch that movie again.<eos> I did say "a bit."<eos> Now... Black Badge wants it.
No, somebody he thinks has absolutely nothing to do with us, like an undercover agent who goes in there as an elite athlete in need of help.<eos> Going to need a pretty good undercover cop to pull that off.<eos> Okay, is she? She's going to Eddie's, isn't she?<eos> Looks like it.<eos> Okay, I think he keeps it off-site.
Okay, you just need to shut up, all right?<eos> The one time you should have opened your mouth is the only time in the last six weeks you've kept it closed.<eos> In case it escaped your attention, which for an analyst there is absolutely no excuse, we're in a race here.<eos> Against time, a manslaughter trial and Maxine Reynolds.<eos> She buys that drug, presents it to the court, gets Nate off, we're back to square one.
He says we can't.<eos> - I said we needed grounds.<eos> What happened to finding the drug that Tyler was taking?<eos> Are the NCC still trying to find it?<eos> I believe so, and if they find it they will hand it over,
Actually, mate, could you... could you do us a favour?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, Thommo, chuck us your keys, mate.<eos> Listen, um, Shannon's gotta go run some errands for me, right?<eos> If you go along with him and pick up Thommo's car - it's where the cops pulled him over yesterday - and then just drop it back at his place?
Where did Holly Winshaw get your semen from?<eos> I had a sexual relationship with Amber, and, if Amber took a condom, this Winshaw girl, very clever, very sharp, intelligent, knows everything, who knows what she did.<eos> Why would Holly fabricate evidence against you?<eos> They get into this business together.<eos> They decide on this joint venture together and they carry it out very well.
Here you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Stay on the lookout.<eos> Great song.<eos> Yeah. They play it at the nightclub.
No.<eos> Heads up.<eos> Pirates.<eos> Hey, where's the cockpit?<eos> Barracuda wants us to strip it for parts.
They do that a few times.<eos> Then they go in close and they shoot, like, a tight shot where it's just, like...<eos> You only see, like, three of the characters.<eos> And when they exit that scene, like, in our minds we see the whole room because we've seen it before.<eos> But in reality, when they're shooting it, the rest of the room isn't even there.
You see, I do give a shit about how prisoners are treated, which means you are gonna tell the court exactly what you just told us.<eos> Did you not hear what I just said?<eos> It came back down on me like a concrete block.<eos> This is my career. I...<eos> I am not gonna go on record and jeopardize it.
Okay, please face forward again.<eos> I need to see your hands. Put them out there.<eos> Can you please lift your head?<eos> Let me see the neck.<eos> Take off your shirt and hand it to the officer.
I'm not sure.<eos> We just ended up there.<eos> I remember this orange carpet.<eos> And that song...<eos> Frankie just... they played it over and over and over again.
What's that?<eos> That's our treasure!<eos> Stay away.<eos> You'll get cursed.<eos> I take the curse off of me and put it back on you.
Dad, it's an expression.<eos> Because I know how hard it is to keep a lasting relationship alive.<eos> Trust me, I've been through two of them.<eos> You've been through more than that, I think.<eos> Actually, Mike and I are kind of zhuzhin our relationship a little bit these days, keeping it fresh.
Let's go. Bathroom time.<eos> This is the common area.<eos> Good for R R.<eos> As you can see, I've planned for a long stay.<eos> The aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh.
Over there!<eos> There's a little beach.<eos> We made it!<eos> Go on, Tatty, you name it.<eos> I hereby name this Walker Island and claim it for our own.
- And me buying an island.<eos> - You're not buying an island.<eos> - No?<eos> Because I met someone who knows Warren Buffett's bridge partner.<eos> I'm gonna offer him some stock from my company in exchange for Warren Buffett's cell phone number. I'm gonna iSearchU Warren Buffett, pitch him my app, gain access to billions of dollars in venture capital, buy my island, and populate it with porn stars.
I promise, I'm not sure of myself.<eos> When they ask paper or plastic, I'm even like, "Whatever's easiest for you," you know?<eos> - ¿No habla inglés? - Yeah, your modesty doesn't fool me.<eos> I'll give you a choice.<eos> You can use your unique position for evil by killing the president, starting a war, and bringing this country to its knees... or you use it for good.
I'd prefer that you didn't.<eos> - I'm going to do it.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> Let me go!<eos> Not until you untie my straitjacket and put it on, okay?
I'll think of something.<eos> Here, eat your dinner.<eos> - I don't like that, Shay.<eos> - Well, you'll have to have it.<eos> - Well, I don't want it.
- I don't like that, Shay.<eos> - Well, you'll have to have it.<eos> - Well, I don't want it.<eos> - Alice, please.<eos> - I don't want it.
♪ Can be working for the clampdown ♪<eos> ♪ Kick over the wall cause government's to fall ♪<eos> ♪ How can you refuse it?<eos> ♪ Let fury have the hour anger can be power ♪<eos> ♪ Do you know that you can use it?
But I won the fight.<eos> Everybody saw it.<eos> They can just take away my belt?<eos> They-they... that's what they can do.<eos> They will take it away if you don't defend it.
We saw your island across the sea and we thought,<eos> "I wonder what they're up to?"<eos> But, there's no other place besides here.<eos> Yes, there is. And we are from there.<eos> We call it, Piggy Island.
An island has been spotted a few miles away.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> We're somewhere in the Philippine Sea.<eos> You don't know where we are.<eos> We're going to catch a current, and we're gonna ride it over to that island.
I didn't touch him.<eos> I didn't touch that old man!<eos> I wasn't even...<eos> Our man had come for revenge.<eos> And he got it.
See you later, Monsieur Paul.<eos> Take a seat, big guy.<eos> So, I'll resume...<eos> As I was saying, the cow is a ruminant. This means that she ruminates.<eos> That is, first she swallows the grass, without chewing it, then brings it up later and calmly chews it.
I never leave home without it.<eos> I just got a new one yesterday.<eos> Kind of magical.<eos> It's basically the secret to my entire career is this little box.<eos> Almost anyone can use it, but no one knows about it.
Vanderbilt?<eos> Everything I have, I worked for it.<eos> Not like them, with their fancy friends and their pocketed politicians.<eos> I want land, you know what I do.<eos> I take it.
Before me it was just old farts taking it in turns to miss. HE SNIFFS<eos> Barry!<eos> Can we open a window?<eos> Fucking stinks in here.<eos> Tell you what, Alex, I'll open a door and you can walk straight out of it.
There's no switching off. The elevator man wants a little piece of you on the way back to your room.<eos> The maid wants a little piece of you back at the hotel.<eos> And I don't mean sexually, I mean a piece of your time and your energy, and it's like a politician, you're on 24 hours a day.<eos> I think that John got fed up first. He became agitated or frustrated about what was being written, particularly from 1965 onward.<eos> Richard Lester had said we need a song, and John started it, so by the time I came to see him, he had a lot of it, and he said to me, you know, this is kind of autobiographical.
This is David Larraine.<eos> Yeah, I got your number, fuckshit, and, hey, listen, you know that thing you were looking for at my place?<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> I have it.<eos> If you want it, you're gonna meet me on the southwest corner of Blake and Van Nuys the morning of the sixth, 3:00 a.m.
You're leaving.<eos> The sword cannot be kept here.<eos> Where are you taking it?<eos> I would not burden you with that knowledge.<eos> Too many will hunt it.
Even now, he rides to meet you and secure the sword.<eos> Go!<eos> I cannot leave without the sword.<eos> You know this.<eos> - You will be killed if you take it.
You doing all right?<eos> Hi.<eos> You used to sleep in my room?<eos> Yeah, that used to be my room.<eos> That's what Papa call it. "Cory's room."
He still got that rag tied to the tree.<eos> He was out here swinging that bat.<eos> I was just getting ready to go back in the house.<eos> He swung that bat and just fell over.<eos> Seem like, when he swung it, he stood there with this grin on his face. Then he just fell over.
Go on.<eos> He used to sing the Molahonkey song.<eos> - The what?<eos> - The Molahonkey song.<eos> I thought everyone knew it.
Actually, no, there's something digging into my collar.<eos> It's a tag.<eos> Have we got any scissors in the bag?<eos> I don't know, Clark.<eos> Believe it or not, I rarely pack it myself. Um...
I had to hold a conversation with a new person for 30 minutes...<eos> - ...and demonstrate how to be a good hostess.<eos> Next week, I'm thinking maybe they'll arrange marriages.<eos> I'll tell you what, I'm gonna design a special new badge for the Dandelions.<eos> It's gonna be a real big one, so no one misses it.
I was jealous of the whole steam room incident.<eos> That is some crazy shit.<eos> That's like something I would do.<eos> This one time in high school... This bitch tried to hit on my boyfriend...<eos> And I cut off her ponytail while she was sleeping... And I wore it to school for a month.
These people depend on us!<eos> First off, it's always summer.<eos> We live in a desert.<eos> And second, that promise is still in effect!<eos> It's a 100% valid promise, and you can redeem it in one hour.
To London?<eos> But that's a shit surprise.<eos> You know I hate London.<eos> And anyway, you promised we'd always have Christmas here in New York.<eos> You know, darling, life doesn't always work out as we-- as we plan it.
The machine's keeping his body alive but he's gone.<eos> - You see those diodes?<eos> They deliver a micro charge to his frontal lobe.<eos> Even though his brain is clinically dead, the charge fired the neurons one last time and lets us build a map of the neuronal pattern.<eos> And then you transfer it to the other guy's head?
It's the same woman from the hospital.<eos> We can't stay here. And we certainly can't trust the consulate.<eos> Flatterers adrift in excrement.<eos> That's not right.<eos> If a plague exists, do you know how many governments would want it?
That's good. You seem clearer.<eos> Yeah. I am.<eos> What's your middle name?<eos> - Well, I am.<eos> Zobrist is dead, but if his plague is real then this map, it's a trail he has left so someone can find it.
How do we help?<eos> During the Plague of Justinian 5000 people died every day in the streets of Istanbul.<eos> The border between East and West, another doorway.<eos> Which is why he chose it.<eos> If the bag's intact, we can contain it. But if someone ruptures it before we get there 95 percent of the Earth's population will be infected in four to seven days.
Visitors were followed by the FBI. And the FBI was followed by some dark suits.<eos> So you're handing me over?<eos> To give them the design.<eos> And what will they do with it?<eos> When a scientist advances a theory, they open it up to the world, people make with it whatever they want.
We're family, Mr. Paczynski.<eos> That's a gene pool screaming for chlorine.<eos> The feds will be coming.<eos> He'd have taken the money.<eos> This broad offers you the golden goose and you wanna cook it for dinner.
And like them, we had a dream.<eos> Could we create actual, genuine magic?<eos> And I'm guessing one of you achieved that dream, and it wasn't you?<eos> That is what he would like you to think.<eos> My vision was a perfect blend of elegance and technology. But Owen wanted it for himself so he humiliated me by exposing my private files to the board of directors and convinced them that I am unstable.
You trust your people implicitly.<eos> You will have them take care of everything, and you will wait in the car.<eos> And eyes open, wide awake.<eos> Excuse me. These people are following me. You might wanna check their pockets.<eos> Then our time is ticking to infiltrate the lab and get the card to the market, where I'll hand it off to the Eye, so we can all get the hell home.
"It's not how hard you can hit, "it's how hard you can get hit and still keep moving forward."<eos> It's from Rocky, mate. It's from Rocky.<eos> Yeah... but when you said it, it made me think about life.<eos> Whereas he was just talking about boxing.<eos> No, he meant it metaphorically in the movie, so...
Was.<eos> - Is.<eos> - Now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you're missing it.
Almost.<eos> Power is back. We're waiting for the Internet connection.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Technology.<eos> Only as good as the dumb shits who are using it.
- Yeah, he was always a terrible kisser.<eos> He used to do this really fucking weird thing with his tongue. Hold on.<eos> Oh, yeah, what'd he do?<eos> What, was it like this?<eos> Or sometimes he'd just jam it in there real quick and he's like...
Where did you learn that song, Papa?<eos> I learned it from my parents.<eos> And they learned it from their parents.<eos> And them from theirs.<eos> And one day... you'll sing it to your children, too.
I know the kind of mutants you're looking for.<eos> And I know where to find them.<eos> It's my first time in America.<eos> I'm very excited to see your culture.<eos> Well, you're not gonna see it here.
Yurei, different from ghost.<eos> The forest use them to trick you.<eos> Do you know why, "Do not leave the path"?<eos> Because if you get lost, and you have sadness in your heart,<eos> they will use it against you.
I took up my place between Heinrich Heine and Spinoza.<eos> Bahia Province, Brazil January 1941 ...quite different depending on the region.<eos> They can live for 20 years, but here they usually last five.<eos> The sugar cane here can live for five years.<eos> We cut it off just above the ground, the stalk.
Yeah.<eos> All right, I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna go roll.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> So you're gonna take your coin, And you're gonna put it into the bottom of this bottle.
Take the coin-- you're gonna hit it into the bottom of the bottle.<eos> -Great. -Whoops, oh!<eos> That's awesome.<eos> let's run one through, And just kind of review as we go.<eos> You're gonna take your coin and you're gonna put it in this-- Into this.
He knows that, okay?<eos> The only time I'd used "defense of others" was a barroom brawl where my client intervened between two guys fighting and shot one in the head.<eos> I lost.<eos> It's hard for a jury to understand how the intent to kill can be formed on behalf of another.<eos> They always see it as two against one.
And there's bits of cars and people in trees everywhere.<eos> So, I run down to help, throwing people in taxis or whatever will take them.<eos> And I grab this one guy, and his leg comes right off.<eos> Just separates from his body.<eos> So, I toss it in the car with him, and on to the next and the next.
I will smite you!<eos> You wanna get smote?<eos> Smotten?<eos> Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life... it's a homing beacon of death.<eos> If you don't put it away, bad things are gonna come for it.
You have a scholarship to a local college.<eos> And even though we can't afford the dorm, you get to have me as your new college roommate.<eos> Actually, I, um... I have kind of a cool idea about that.<eos> What if we fixed up Mike's room and listed you on Airbnb or something.<eos> Maybe it's time we finally go through his stuff and maybe give some of it to Goodwill.
Alright, thank you.<eos> A lighthouse?<eos> I love it, thank you.<eos> Well, a very wise person once said, and this was earlier today, they said that the lighthouse represents the thing that you want the most.<eos> So, whatever that is, I hope you get it.
I felt pure rage.<eos> It was like something had been taken from me again, and... just thought if I could...<eos> If I could, I'd just go to her house and I'd go and... Find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just...<eos> I'd wrap my hand in her long blond hair, and I'd jerk her head back. I'd just jerk it back.<eos> And then I'd pull it down to the ground, and I would just...
Why did they give Mellizo the hard disk before us?<eos> I don't know, but we've got something.<eos> It's from years ago, at the start of her political career, her first government post after winning the elections.<eos> Valencia in '95, on the verge of an absolute majority.<eos> She needed an abstention to get elected, and she got it.
I feel too ashamed.<eos> No right to be there.<eos> I have no right...<eos> Can you imagine what life will be like in 2,000 years?<eos> Let's see if we can do it a little better this time.
Enjoy your pen.<eos> Go ahead, motherfucker!<eos> Mr. Abrams, I need you to put that down!<eos> Didn't know I had that in me, did you? Oh.<eos> Put it on the ground and back away from the weapon.
Yes, good.<eos> I need a drill.<eos> Wait... wait...<eos> How are you going to pay for it?<eos> Well, my people will contact you and arrange it, ya, yes.
I lied.<eos> I learned to lie.<eos> I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work.<eos> I made myself indispensable... and all the while, I laid the groundwork of my revenge.<eos> We call it the Death Star.
None of this is your fault, Kate.<eos> The hag can visit anyone, but preys on the weak.<eos> It preys on their fears, because once you believe, it keeps coming.<eos> Belief, that's how it finds you.<eos> Like a beacon, a light that draws it towards.
Beginning today, we will filibuster this bill.<eos> Let the real war begin.<eos> This ain't about the Constitution.<eos> It's about those who got more wanting to hang on to what they got at the expense of those who got nothing and feel good about it.<eos> Yeah, but the way he frames it, draping himself in the Stars and Stripes, it's compelling.
He's just like every other politician. He'll do what it takes to get elected.<eos> But I think he really wants civil rights.<eos> Now, we've got a chance here, Bob.<eos> A real chance.<eos> Best chance in a hundred years and I will not throw it away.
She was a little bit of a jokester.<eos> - A little bit.<eos> - Really?<eos> Okay.<eos> So who gets it?
So where's Grim?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll tell you where he is.<eos> He's out there rotting.<eos> There's some shit in that woods. And cousin Henry's spreading it around.
There's no pay, but you can drink what you can drink from the bar.<eos> What's the last song of your set?<eos> The song is called Nora.<eos> - Good.<eos> When I hear it I'll know it's almost over.
It carries a lot of blood, and fast.<eos> - Dr. marks, my patient is in a delicate state.<eos> Are you sure an incision medically necessary?<eos> - You need circulation.<eos> I'm giving it to you.
- Yeah, it's all right.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Dear God, I'm thankful for everything I have.<eos> I am deeply satisfied with my life and everything in it.
If you ever need help with the kids or if you just need some time alone, I'd be happy to watch them.<eos> Thank you, I appreciate that.<eos> Look at us, first time we meet and we're exchanging sob stories.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna bake up a cake and bring it over to you guys.
What's he doing?<eos> Look, this guy doesn't want to play. Can somebody let him out?<eos> Open the door, please!<eos> Would they really lock us in?<eos> Open the door before I kick it down! Excuse me, dumbass.
It's his back-handed way of getting retribution against Earth.<eos> What if he's telling the truth?<eos> You believe him?<eos> I believe we need a full investigation of the fusion drives in question.<eos> And you'll see it all in the intel briefing later tonight.
- What'd you do that for?<eos> - Oh, sorry, Frank.<eos> We thought you were some jerk-off who bought the mountain.<eos> I am the jerk-off who bought the mountain.<eos> I'm turning it into a members-only resort for millionaires to plow their trophy whores in private.
There's no use hanging onto it if no one's going to use it.<eos> I'm going to use it.<eos> It's got to be maintained.<eos> I'm maintaining it.<eos> You can't maintain it by yourself.
- His real name is Wylis.<eos> And he could talk and fight and-- and then--<eos> What's wrong?<eos> The Three-Eyed Raven says there's a war coming.<eos> And we're going to fight it in there?
And don't tell Sister Monica Joan.<eos> - Are you sure you can spare all this, Fred?<eos> - You could do with feeding up. Unlike meself.<eos> Married life's wonderful, but good for the waistline it ain't.<eos> Well, you seem to be thriving on it.
That was really rude!<eos> - Poor Delia was only trying to help.<eos> - I know.<eos> If I'd had a rotten day like yours, I expect I'd be tetchy too.<eos> Have some of Violet's jam before Sister Monica Joan gets her hands on it.
Like a bird in a nest.<eos> Look.<eos> Hot water, whenever you need it.<eos> Space for a fridge.<eos> You don't even need to take the rubbish out - you just drop it down a chute.
Kenneth Parker smokes. He's six weeks younger than me.<eos> You are on thin ice.<eos> If I ever catch you with a cigarette again...<eos> You'll what?<eos> Light it for me?
I am nothing if not an incurable romantic.<eos> That sounds splendid.<eos> On one condition.<eos> What?<eos> That you promise to bring the parish sweetie jar and fill it with sherbet lollies.
Put these back in the kitchen.<eos> They're for after the talk.<eos> ♪ By the silvery moon... ♪<eos> In the United States, the pill was initially only approved as a treatment for menstrual disorders.<eos> But hundreds of thousands of American women are now taking it as a contraceptive and it has been declared to be 100% effective in preventing pregnancy.
- Would you like it? - She always makes such a beeline for the one at the community centre!<eos> Why spend all that money when she seems perfectly happy with a basket of sticks and pine cones? !<eos> Ah, just in time for some bacon!<eos> Where's your scarf?<eos> It's a school scarf, so I wear it on school days, and today's a Saturday!
- Within you.<eos> - I might have to think about that one.<eos> - Ooh, ooh! - Be here all night.<eos> - All right.<eos> Ooh, ooh! You know, I do have a gun in my cubby and I will use it.
No. I'm staying here with you guys.<eos> I'll be downstairs.<eos> I'm gonna have to break up with him before we leave Libya.<eos> How do you leave me on D when the party's right here?<eos> Hey, about this whole Ambo story, I don't buy it.
- Hey.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> ¶¶<eos> Because I am trusting you with the future of the entire human race.<eos> And I'd like to show you how you're going to save it.
This thing is bad for Israel, bad for America, bad for Jews, bad for everybody. Step away...<eos> You're right, this is bad for everybody. That's why I want to help.<eos> How can you... How can you help?<eos> This is a political war going on 7000 miles from here.<eos> Look, Eshel's rivals have found this cockamamie story and they're going to use it to take him down.
You sure you don't wanna stay the night?<eos> Got some fine Brandy and a couple of choice wenches in the cellar. Get abner here to strike out the fiddle and sit around the fire, tell some old lies?<eos> We best be gettin' back before sun go down.<eos> All right. Suit yourself.<eos> Would take a bottle of that Brandy, if you could spare it.
Uh, I mean...<eos> I'm not gonna just get elected, you know, and... and look like a jackass.<eos> Oh, geez...<eos> All right, kids. Today, we have a very special treat.<eos> One of the older students has written an original children's story and is gonna read it to you.
And that's where I get in trouble.<eos> This one time...<eos> You'll like this.<eos> There was this lady... her grandmother made these German apple pancakes.<eos> She wanted this recipe, she couldn't find it... so I go, there's a website, it's called "Stormfront"... and it's like a neo-Nazi site.
Isn't that right, partner?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, Walt, do you want a beer?<eos> You have beer?<eos> Yeah, I keep it tucked away in a little fridge in the garage.
You think this is hard?<eos> Well, the new owners might...<eos> The new owners have no intention of running this as a wood mill, Jack, and you know that as well as I fuckin' do.<eos> Who's gonna buy a wood mill that's been running at a loss for five years, huh?<eos> They're gonna turn it into a fuckin' tourist farm for UFO nutters, or a fuckin' art gallery, getting paper made from cocoa palms from the fuckin' Amazon or some shit.
Traditions still stand strong in America.<eos> That makes me very sad.<eos> I mean, what is it gonna take to get that point across?<eos> And your solution would be to contain violence to video games?<eos> Well, we're never gonna contain it, but we can direct it.
- Hey.<eos> Nina pulled a good image - of the shooter's face from the security video.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Uniforms showing it to the neighborhood?
I-It's fine.<eos> I don't mind waiting.<eos> Would you get me a pizza ... sausage and onion?<eos> Really? Okay.<eos> I'll get it in one of those sleeves, keep it extra hot.
But only if you eat breakfast.<eos> - Dorsa?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Have you seen my workout tape?<eos> - No. It was here but I can't find it now.
Curly, Charlie.<eos> Kitchen, five minutes.<eos> Actually, we were told on the train there'd be cocaine.<eos> Jeremiah, John Boy, kitchen, let's go.<eos> I swear to God, them fucking cavalry boys are asking for it.
I've been all over the world.<eos> I've seen more of it than all of you combined.<eos> And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do.<eos> Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband.<eos> I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.
Right.<eos> Three lords walk into a tavern... a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.<eos> They order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup.<eos> The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another.<eos> The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.
- And you're under observation.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> There.<eos> This is my room.<eos> Do I have to give it back ?
This is my room.<eos> Do I have to give it back ?<eos> Be only right.<eos> But it's my room now.<eos> - Let's play for it, ok ? - No.
What happened ?<eos> A ditch, he fucked up.<eos> - Down by the windmills ?<eos> - No... This new clandestine thing.<eos> A much bigger race, they call it 'Italian Race'.
You know why you're not improving ?<eos> Because we haven't got enough money for simulations and testing ?<eos> We don't understand each other.<eos> You're training for control and working well on holding the track, but you're scared of anticipating.<eos> You have to anticipate the curve before you even see it, OK ?
But you can barely stand up.<eos> Never felt better,<eos> I'm like lightning.<eos> I'm supposed to give you a car ?<eos> What if you wreck it ?
Thank you, Beetle.<eos> To know Kubo has someone to watch over him when I'm gone.<eos> That would be a fine way to end my story.<eos> Your story will never end.<eos> It will be told by him and by the people he shares it with.

What's that tune?<eos> Long time ago...<eos> I swear that my grandmama sang that... 'fore I got sold.<eos> There was a man on the farm, played this old Africa guitar. He... he...<eos> I think he played it, too.
This song is mine.<eos> Nobody in this place can have it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I can wait till you share it with me.
Night, where you going?<eos> To get a ride.<eos> Are you the mother or the sister?<eos> For you I'm not either.<eos> And I know a hyena when I see it.
I could run circles around those jerks.<eos> I will believe that when I see it. I figured it out.<eos> Play j-14 for me.<eos> ♪ What's that playing on the radio ♪ ♪ why did I start swaying to and fro ♪<eos> ♪ I have never heard that song before ♪ ♪ but if I don't hear it anymore ♪
Cock it again.<eos> Round two.<eos> Look at that fucking face, john boy.<eos> Look at that face.<eos> Now he feels it.
Okay.<eos> My necklace.<eos> The one that you gave me on our first anniversary.<eos> It's on the nightstand.<eos> Would you get it for me, please, dear?
It's the same.<eos> Hmm. Still, beats my slut mother's goulash, no?<eos> Where are the children?<eos> Ring the bell again.<eos> I doubt they'll hear it.
That's right.<eos> I'm onto you, you slippery little bastard.<eos> Gina, come on. You can do your Internet socializing in the truck.<eos> Okay, cool, I just have to tie my shoe real quick.<eos> Tying it.
Point is, haters gonna hate.<eos> Shake it off.<eos> Taylor Swift, always right.<eos> - The reason bullies get to me is because I lived with one-- my dad.<eos> He was a cruel man who didn't like his life, and he took it out on me.
Sorry.<eos> Dev, our future, everything, it's all riding on this sale.<eos> But the company, it's dead.<eos> I mean, there is nothing there.<eos> And even if I can pull this thing off, the Germans are just gonna scrap it when they find out it's just an empty shell.
It's a tobacco vape, Dad.<eos> Katherine Heigl uses one.<eos> Smoking kills, you guys.<eos> Where is that pipe, Jackie Lynn?<eos> I held it in the air, and a hawk took it.
We have to work together.<eos> We have to talk to Wadsworth's widow.<eos> I shouldn't have slept with Evelyn, but to be fair, we hadn't established any ground rules for the break.<eos> Oh, God, I can't take the silent treatment.<eos> My dad used to do it all the time.
- The view.<eos> - Still don't get any reception, huh?<eos> Do you remember that guy, Ryan?<eos> The one whose short I did that went to Sundance?<eos> Well, he sent me this feature script he's been working on, and he really wanted me to show it to this producer on that movie I shot last June.
... It was better that way.<eos> No, do not be afraid.<eos> I here, in the presence of Emilia, I guarantee your place.<eos> You were safe.<eos> If a friend make you a promise, I keep it to the last.
And the lovers say; "This is a really special octopus,<eos> "because he can play any instrument on the planet "better than anyone."<eos> The bear's like; "Bullshit!"<eos> So, he goes to the back of the bar, and he grabs the guitar that's back there.<eos> And the octopus looks at it, and he plays it better than anybody's ever played the guitar before.
- Yes, thank you.<eos> Merci. Gregory, listen to me.<eos> All we need is delivery by Tuesday.<eos> So tell your friends by the Vltava that they need you to start driving tomorrow morning.<eos> This room is probably exactly as you remember it, sir, although the bathrooms have been completely refurbished.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.<eos> Except you? Special guest?<eos> I'm not.<eos> He calls it The Citadel.<eos> And there's one key... and he hides it.
You're funny.<eos> Call your friends, okay? Tell them to come.<eos> And bring money!<eos> We shut this motherfucker down at all costs.<eos> Y'all go in, shut it down from the inside. Me and Kelly stay, call the cops shut it down from the outside.
Let me just show you.<eos> - Damn.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Maybe we could put up a fence.<eos> - No. - No, they'd only climb it. - Hm...
We wanna put this guy away for years.<eos> The gun makes all the difference, you know that.<eos> You gonna let this person victimize you twice?<eos> Forget about the gun. All right?<eos> The gun was not Salamanca's. If you try to introduce it in evidence, Mr. Ehrmantraut will make himself available to the defense, and he will set the record straight.
How the hell should I know?<eos> You're the nerd. Just make it cheap.<eos> Now go on, get outta here.<eos> I see you got your old car back. Yep.<eos> The kidney people wouldn't take it.
I'm feeling kind of like, uh... like Carnac.<eos> Do you remember when Johnny Carson used to do Carnac?<eos> You know, he'd give the answers before the questions.<eos> You know, Ed would give him the envelope, yeah?<eos> And Johnny would hold it up to his forehead, and, um, he'd give the answer, like, "Leave It to Beaver."
I think I can work this one out.<eos> When I can see straight, that is.<eos> Wha... What the devil is this?<eos> It's music, ye dolt.<eos> I know music when I see it.
It's everything.<eos> I mean, look at us.<eos> We're just air conditioners.<eos> I mean, after all, we're just walking around on the planet, breathing, conditioning the air.<eos> I condition it hot, that conditions it cold.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.<eos> No, I don't imagine you would.<eos> So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.<eos> I see what you see in them...<eos> Silver and Flint.<eos> But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.<eos> Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
Captain Flint is dead.<eos> Not anymore, he's not.<eos> Go now, quickly.<eos> The stockpile is nearby.<eos> My people will transport it directly to your ship.
It is my hope that in exchange for this plea<eos> I might be spared the humiliation of a public trial,<eos> and that my execution be carried out... privately and mercifully."<eos> At noon tomorrow, you'll be transported under guard to the bay, where you'll be boarded onto the Shark and sent to London to face a Court of the Admiralty.<eos> Agree to this plea, and the governor will endorse it.
They get to have it?<eos> Yeah, it's like, Christian people get the Nilla wafer and we get...<eos> - Like a sacrament.<eos> - What?<eos> It's a wafer and when you take it in your mouth, you let go of all your sins.
What are you doing?<eos> Just chilling.<eos> Barb, is that my shirt?<eos> I don't know, is it?<eos> Want me to take it off?
- I shouldn't assume. - No, by all means.<eos> He's well.<eos> As well as can be expected.<eos> But first, uh, the information you mentioned?<eos> I will ensure personally that Oberfuhrer Faber receives it the moment he becomes available.
You got 48 hours.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Empire's new CEO, Hakeem Lyon.<eos> What's up, y'all?<eos> Let me just say, before we start this meeting, that I'm very excited to be the new Chief Executive Officer of Empire Enterprises.<eos> Thank y'all for coming. This company was kicked off by my parents, and we will keep it in my family bloodline.
Go for Harris.<eos> No, no, no. No, yeah, I got it. Yeah.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Yep.<eos> And that even if they did want pizza for the hostages, which they don't, the perps wouldn't eat it 'cause they know we'd put sleeping pills in it.
I uh, didn't know you were coming, so we didn't get a chance to clean up your room.<eos> I told you guys I was coming.<eos> No, actually,<eos> Ahhh, I haven't heard from you in a few weeks.<eos> Sorry, sweetie, your, your room, we kind of turned it into a bit of a dumping zone.
Uh, we have special authorization.<eos> - That's what everyone says.<eos> - No. We'll just need the room for a few minutes... to do research.<eos> Yeah, that's what everyone says.<eos> You know, I've never seen a patient receive so much attention... especially one who's so unworthy of it.
And the history has gone wrong.<eos> I should... by a wayward arrow, and not a sword.<eos> No one... will lift me onto my horse.<eos> And I won't win the battle after I've died.<eos> I will win it for you.
The real Cid died because of you?<eos> Yes, 20 years earlier than expected.<eos> The story is getting out of hand.<eos> And I won't win the battle once I am dead<eos> I will win it for you.
Fine, lady, you're in charge.<eos> Quickly, Irene, take this.<eos> - What do I do with this?<eos> - They're forceps.<eos> With the paddles, first one side, than the other you grab the baby's head and pull it out.
That flu killed 50 million people in one year, five times more that World War I.<eos> - But that was in... - 1918<eos> Almost a century has passed since then...<eos> And the population has lost it's immunity.<eos> If we bring it here, we could have a situation like in America. The conquistadors carried smallpox to the New World - and millions of people died.
You'll have to speak with Doctor Vargas later.<eos> How did you manage to stop the pandemic?<eos> Sadly, we didn't manage to stop it.<eos> It simply wore itself out after a year.<eos> We didn't even manage to get them to stop calling it "Spanish".
How did you manage to stop the pandemic?<eos> Sadly, we didn't manage to stop it.<eos> It simply wore itself out after a year.<eos> We didn't even manage to get them to stop calling it "Spanish".<eos> I've read that they called it that because Spain was the only country - that didn't censure the news.
Mmm... Colorado.<eos> I really hope you enjoy.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> This is the bedroom.<eos> You probably would call it a boudoir.
Okay, we can do this.<eos> Alright, oh, I'll grab a chair.<eos> He's just using it a foot rest.<eos> Hi, can I grab this?<eos> Oh, sorry. I'm using it.
- Don't touch me.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> - Okay, I would not. - I would not.<eos> - Take the chair...<eos> - I'm not gonna take it.
- Very good!<eos> Very good!<eos> A great performance. Very convincing. Even better than the one you did this morning.<eos> Great acting. Congratulations.<eos> And thank you for your idea. I might use it in my next novel.
There are no facts, there are interpretations.<eos> The truth, or what we call the truth, is an interpretation which prevails over another one.<eos> You're not giving me an answer. Just avoiding...<eos> This is for you. Regarding interpretation. What is this scar?<eos> Do you see it?
It's boring.<eos> Daddy said we could do as we please.<eos> Ah, my father used to say that only boring people get bored.<eos> Mine, too.<eos> I used to think it's only boring people who don't feel boredom, so cannot conceive of it in others.
Marty, please, please! Just two minutes.<eos> - Oh...<eos> - Two minutes!<eos> Okay, but I smell some despair.<eos> Yeah, I smell it now.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, it's okay.<eos> So, uh, Pop used to do this thing.<eos> Can you lay that out for me? - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Called it the five S's.
Put that down, that's my...<eos> Hey, why don't you shut your fucking mouth?<eos> Excuse my language, Miss Mimi.<eos> I got the equipment all lined up.<eos> Sergeant Pete's bringing it over.
This is your way of life now.<eos> The more you fight back, the harder it will be.<eos> So, if someone knocks on your door you let us in.<eos> We own that door.<eos> You try to stop us and we will knock it down.
Attention students, there will be an assembly to honor Will Byers in the gymnasium now.<eos> Do not go to fourth period.<eos> It's locked.<eos> -What?<eos> -Hey, do you think you can open it?
Shut up, Scott.<eos> Just stop fucking talking.<eos> Hey, I am a junior partner here.<eos> Guys, we started this company, the three of us, from nothing.<eos> - Right, and now we're selling it. - No, we're not.
What does the final resolution mean for you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> If the senators fully consider this information and come to a conclusion, I will be satisfied.<eos> That is what I want...<eos> for them to fully consider it and take this seriously.
But they say they have enough to prove prostitution.<eos> - Excuse me, I just...<eos> I insisted on a gag clause.<eos> The money will be held in escrow for a year.<eos> If they breach it, try to out you, it'll render this agreement null and void and they'll have to pay you the money.
- Damn, Mylene.<eos> You filling out Regina's dress better than she do.<eos> - Shit, for real.<eos> - What are they doing to this song?<eos> Ruining it.
¿Tú sabes?<eos> Well, I couldn't have done it without you.<eos> No, you couldn't.<eos> And whether or not Jackie has a song... you my girls, for life.<eos> Bring it down to the front so everybody can see it.
- This? - Yep.<eos> I think there's a pattern forming here.<eos> I'll tell you what you've got here. Adhesive capsulitis.<eos> That doesn't sound good.<eos> They also call it "40-year-old shoulder."
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.<eos> He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect or wit.<eos> He wanted the real thing.<eos> He wanted to create consciousness.<eos> He imagined it as a pyramid.
Who says?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The Sahib, Mr Charlie.<eos> Only, I can't keep it.<eos> I do not want it.
So I'll just, uh...<eos> Just back it up here.<eos> - This is heavy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You mind if we just set it down?
I'm 18, Reverend.<eos> Between you and me, I'm 17.<eos> All right, I'm 15 if I'm a day, but I'll be 16 in October.<eos> I thought as much.<eos> You say a letter home to your family, and nurse Mary will write it down for you.
I am so tired... Of hiding all the time. Moving from place to place.<eos> I've lived in the shadow of the noose a long time. I'm used to it.<eos> But these poor people...<eos> You preach rebellion?<eos> Is it rebellion to fight against unfairness whenever you see it?
It's under control.<eos> - They murdered a man.<eos> - They didn't.<eos> Well, that's not what the authorities are saying, and they're going to come after them.<eos> And who's going to look after all these people in the Zone if they shut it down?
Oh, now who's being cynical?<eos> It's your fault I'm doing this.<eos> You got involved in government first.<eos> You inspired me.<eos> I watch the government, I keep it honest.
Still the same number?<eos> - Same number.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Toby, who are you building the house for?<eos> What makes you think I'm building it for somebody?
- Get in.<eos> - What is it you expect me to do?<eos> - You're gonna fix me.<eos> Tell me... who were you stealing this pin from?<eos> Why did you want it so badly?
Shit.<eos> - Get down.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Let's get back to the road.<eos> If we follow it, we can find some place.

He's angry and he's lost.<eos> And in order to find him, you'd have to teach yourself again, and you decided somewhere along the way that you were done learning.<eos> It's... it's too painful to stay open.<eos> Well, I think we all face the same hopelessness, Mrs. Winchell.<eos> It's what we decide to do with it.

In my tribe, if a man loses his sword to an enemy, he's no longer fit to be a warrior.<eos> Really?<eos> We let him walk into the mountains and die alone.<eos> And what if he loses his sword to some half-grown Warig?<eos> Ah, then we usually just get it back.
You seem on the road to recovery.<eos> I had me some sassafras root.<eos> Seemed to help.<eos> Did the doctor give you that? No.<eos> I had a friend bring it to me.
Can I just say, I thought magic was all about breaking rules.<eos> Like, defying the laws of nature, whatnot.<eos> And those people...<eos> Oh, my God, they had such sticks up their asses.<eos> I just don't take it that seriously.
I don't know how much longer he can keep it together.<eos> We better do this now.<eos> I've seen my share of schemes, Mr. Hawkes.<eos> This one is unique.<eos> Well, I see no reason why the law can't aide us while we break it.
I'm talking about your retirement party.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I have few more rounds left in me yet, Marty.<eos> What?<eos> I swear to God, I've found this old lamp and whenever I rub it, a genie pops out and grants me. any wish I want.
It's the Snot Rocket and Barrycuda The Blob.<eos> Nobody was expecting this.<eos> Total Package, there's only one thing keeping you alive... that pretty face!<eos> And that belt!<eos> But I'm gonna take it from you. Ow!
The purpose of my visit here was best accomplished without fanfare.<eos> Might I ask... What was that purpose?<eos> To determine whether mansion house is a suitable venue for the first lady's itinerary.<eos> And?<eos> Mrs. Lincoln is not afraid of real life, Dr. summers, she embraces it.
Get him the fuck out of my sight.<eos> Loyalty is everything to me.<eos> I deserve it, and I demand it.<eos> Now, let's get to work.<eos> Yo, Tommy, that shit with Chuleta, man, I'm hearing it from everybody, yo.
- No.<eos> I never walk away from a fight.<eos> This is not how you change things, Christophe.<eos> You both know, the enemy never gives you victory.<eos> You have to take it from them.
- Find anything?<eos> - Negative, Kojak, we're still looking.<eos> Hurry the fuck up, Charlie.<eos> We gotta find that formula.<eos> Listen, we're gonna find it, we're gonna give it to these Nazis, and then this nightmare will be over.
Listen, I'm just trying to think of a way out of this, all right?<eos> Max?<eos> Max? Shit.<eos> You know, he's right about not giving them the formula.<eos> But none of that matters if we don't find it.
Yeah, I do.<eos> Sorghum.<eos> Yo, give me a hand with this.<eos> Ahem. Let's flip it over.<eos> I don't think we got it.
No, he'd have killed us both and my daughter.<eos> That'd be my punishment.<eos> He's got a gun.<eos> He's what?<eos> Keeps it in our bedroom as a warning.
- Yeah. I do.<eos> Mother drank herself to death after father was floated for stealing medicine to save you.<eos> That's a tough row to hoe. I'll give you that.<eos> So what does he do with the second chance his father gave his life to buy for him?<eos> Wasted it setting the arresting officer's quarters on fire.
My work's done.<eos> I'm just gonna put this in the director's cabin.<eos> So, what do you know about this conference?<eos> I know it's small, secret, just a few countries.<eos> They're calling it "a symposium on the alien contagion."
Still, you gotta hand it to them, though.<eos> They know how to frame a narrative.<eos> How will we find Simon?<eos> He'll be in the most secure room in the building.<eos> Trust me, we'll know it when we see it.
Always liked that about you. I'll tell you what.<eos> I was gonna have Howie and Russell here beat the crap out of you, but for old times' sake, I'll let you leave in one piece.<eos> You know what's funny?<eos> I didn't even know I had that map.<eos> But once I heard you were looking for it, I made sure to find it and put it somewhere safe.
♪ you say you got the touch ♪ I wish I could invent a machine that would just erase her memory from my brain.<eos> You know, some people say that the sativa is a memory-erasing machine, Frankie.<eos> I know that's funny, Gar. I'm just not in a laughing mood right now.<eos> Hey, free beer to anyone who helps us bring the rest of the stuff in.<eos> Why the hell should we work for free beer when these hipster jackwipes are buying it for us just for treating 'em like shit?
Come on, now.<eos> Do I think the car's gorgeous?<eos> Of course. Did my congregation pray on it? Definitely.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Do my friends expect me to be driving it because I posted pictures of it on Facebook and tagged them in?
So I'm building a cedar chest for my knits.<eos> You're planning on building a cedar chest?<eos> That's correct.<eos> You are.<eos> - You're gonna build it?
Look, I get that you're upset.<eos> Why don't you go home?<eos> Just take a couple of days, like a week.<eos> You've suffered a loss.<eos> If you had met my father, you wouldn't call it a loss.
Witness is a Mr. Gregory, a pools collector.<eos> He was doing his rounds. He saw a woman he took to be Ingrid standing at the curb.<eos> A car pulled up. She got in.<eos> Don't suppose he got a registration?<eos> Strange is running it now.
What it could carry.<eos> Why the hell would you want to keep a tiger in here?<eos> How could he afford to feed it, for one thing?<eos> I don't think he did.<eos> I think he was keeping it for someone who could afford it.
I just believe in the redemptive power of sleep.<eos> It clears up the molecular garbage in our brains.<eos> Molecular garbage? Jesus.<eos> What if I fall asleep and all the good stuff's taken away instead?<eos> They'd have to find it first.
If Jay ran, would you hunt him down?<eos> No.<eos> What we do ain't personal.<eos> It's the law.<eos> And these runaways are breaking it.
Not since our mother passed.<eos> Would you be so kind as to... play something for us?<eos> Why, I'd love to.<eos> This song reminds me of my childhood friend Mary.<eos> We used to play it together.
Paul. Why are we still losing shingles off the heat shield?<eos> We're working with a prototype of the capsule, Al.<eos> Its lid is one third the size of what it's going...<eos> I get that. So, what do we do with our million dollar fan, Karl?<eos> Turn it down? No, Al.
That took Shepard, took Grissom.<eos> That cannot take Glenn.<eos> Now, the Atlas rocket... that can push us into orbit.<eos> Goes up, delivers the capsule into an elliptical orbit.<eos> Earth's gravity keeps pulling at it but it's going so fast, it keeps missing the Earth.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.<eos> No, no, no, it's a button-up.<eos> -I unbutton it real slow.<eos> -No, no, no, tear it off.<eos> -Pulling it off. It's off.
No.<eos> You think I'm a spoiled bitch.<eos> We're not to engage in conversation, Miss.<eos> What's the treatment tomorrow?<eos> They call it hydrotherapy.
- Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I've been thinking, perhaps we might return to our old home.<eos> I spoke to the landlord and it's available, should we want it.
Schrodinger's Cat.<eos> Ah, I can see I impressed you all with my artistic abilities.<eos> Schrodinger puts his cat in a box with poisonous food.<eos> Now, until he opens that box, the cat is, in theory, both alive and dead.<eos> But when he opens it, it's either "Hello, Mittens" or "Goodbye, Socks."
Probably not.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I know you probably don't believe it, but Theo is looking for the same thing.<eos> You mean the last Chimera.<eos> That's not what he's calling it.
We're gonna be okay.<eos> I know you probably don't believe it, but Theo is looking for the same thing.<eos> You mean the last Chimera.<eos> That's not what he's calling it.<eos> What is he calling it then?
But it was stolen.<eos> Then how did it end up at the high school?<eos> Beats the hell out of me.<eos> I mean, that thing was a junker back in the day.<eos> God only knows who'd want it now.
'Maybe that's what you heard, Aria, but the rest of us' heard Ezra kick us out of his apartment.<eos> Guys.<eos> And every member of this police department is taking this case not just seriously but personally.<eos> 'Without going into detail that can harm the investigation' 'I can tell you that we are narrowing down' 'our list of suspects.'<eos> We're confident we know what the murder weapon was and we will find it.
Not before indicating what his plan might be.<eos> How do you take down a Ci...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What?<eos> I've been thinking about what would happen if he used the web-nuke o take down the Internet, but if he used it right, overloading he electrical grid, shutting down hospital equipment, causing water main breaks.
When the earliest homo magi forged these idols, they did so in the image of those whose powers they wished to channel, so attention to detail is essential.<eos> It's missing a piece.<eos> The Ribalvei stone.<eos> They must have hidden it someplace else.<eos> Find it, or Genesis is not what you and your daughter have to fear.
I was trying to figure out, like, how Felic-- - Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> Ok.<eos> We have work to do.<eos> HIVE was behind the Havenrock explosion.<eos> They stole a cyber weapon called Rubicon and now are using it to commandeer the world's nukes, so we have less than 24 hours to stop it, or the world is going to experience the sequel to "Wargames."

And this is postmarked a week before our wedding!<eos> Aw, there was a time when the president of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas Fan Club got a lot of mail.<eos> I don't know what to do, Bonnie.<eos> Why would Peter write a letter to another woman just before our wedding?<eos> Why don't you just open it and read it?
Into time.<eos> And there are the sedatives.<eos> You don't believe in ghosts, do you?<eos> I don't.<eos> You got to open your mind, Doc, before someone opens it for you.
Many are afraid.<eos> Many don't know themselves.<eos> I had the feeling that something was bound to happen. Something evil.<eos> I think that's why I've been chosen.<eos> This feeling... I still call it as I did as a kid.
Yes.<eos> So, what if we go to a 24-hour Home Depot, and we get, like, ten of them,<eos> - and we just, like, suck up the sand...<eos> - Okay.<eos> And... and we blow it in the truck directly.
Now during the war, the British were invading the country and ransacking artifacts everywhere.<eos> They hit the Capitol, the White House, and they were targeting other important sites...<eos> Like Paul Revere's house.<eos> So, rather than risk Betsy's flag falling into the wrong hands...<eos> Key secured it elsewhere.
Look!<eos> Look!<eos> My axe, Beowulf found it. It's proof!<eos> You might, if you're drinking this stuff.<eos> We brew it ourselves.
They've got their troublemakers firmly under control.<eos> You mean the Catholics.<eos> This is my home, Edward.<eos> I will not leave my children.<eos> One of whom is a wastrel and does not deserve our protection and the other who ran away and doesn't desire it.
Where are you?<eos> 'A bar. I'm meeting Cassie.'<eos> Students are really, really young, aren't they?<eos> We've found Brian McDade's car.<eos> 'There's a squad car keeping it under observation at the moment.'
For me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a done deal.<eos> The whole wedding industrial complex is... it's out of control.<eos> You know, you hear about it, you see your friends go through it... Mm-hmm.
All right.<eos> I wanted to ask about the clothes that he was wearing that night and if he still has them.<eos> Okay.<eos> I-I think so.<eos> If y'all haven't washed them yet, put them in a paper bag and just tape it closed.
Is Brett Ratner's career on the patio?<eos> Oh-ho-ho! Burn!<eos> Tell you what... You sign my permission slip, and I'll loan you my power washer.<eos> You think it's strong enough to do the job?<eos> Let's just say the Statue of Liberty uses it to shower... which she doesn't do often, 'cause she's French.
You have to immerse yourself in the past, Sarah.<eos> All of it.<eos> Find out what was going on in your parents' lives 30 years ago.<eos> Find what was buried in that house.<eos> No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it in a cellar, so that those who enter may "see the light".
You don't believe in God but that shouldn't upset you.<eos> Even though you're a pope.<eos> There's still another path that'll allow you to find the people and things you are looking for, even if you can't see it now... because all you can see before you now are your own doubts and the darkness.<eos> Please, show me this other path, I beg you.<eos> If I show it to you, then the adventure is over.
Padre, you missionaries do not seem to know Japan.<eos> And you, honorable inquisitor, do not seem to know Christianity.<eos> There are those who think of your religion as a curse.<eos> I do not.<eos> I see it in another way. But still dangerous.
No.<eos> No, the Minister wants it all on his pizza. He likes it that way.<eos> So you'll have to put ham, mushrooms, artichokes, mayonnaise, and most of all, a lot of mozzarella.<eos> The Minister wants it with mozzarella.<eos> I found it actually strange he didn't want it!
Well, you'd have to survive this first.<eos> You see, there's an anchor locking my brothers inside.<eos> Something representational.<eos> That's why they can't get out.<eos> But I'm going to bust into this little mental prison and shatter it from the inside.
Though, that's the thing about ancient vampires, isn't it?<eos> They don't pay attention to modern things, unlike your friend here, who minored in computer science and wrote a paper on the Dark Web.<eos> Bottom line it for me, Zuckerberg.<eos> I ran down some online rumors.<eos> Turns out someone claiming to have the white oak is offering it up to the highest bidder.
Is this what you want?<eos> You do realize that becoming like him will only add to your already substantial misery.<eos> Lucien cannot save you from yourself, nor could Tristan, nor could I, for that matter.<eos> You've spent centuries trying to cure your madness, and yet you're still no closer.<eos> You hold your wicked tongue or I shall pluck it from your wicked skull. Yes!
- What if I'm a liability?<eos> I've been training, so I can punch a bag, but in a real fight?<eos> Cami, here's the thing about being afraid.<eos> If you have to do the thing that you're afraid of, then all this fear is for nothing.<eos> Either turn it into anger or leave it at the door.
Thank you.<eos> Humans... think of evolution in terms of progress and advancement.<eos> This final errand will be the catalyzing event precipitating a new era on Earth, akin to the meteor that felled the dinosaurs and ushered in the Ice Age.<eos> I'm honored, sir... and humbled.<eos> Once we dock, you will take the suitcase and place it exactly where I showed you on the map.
- This is great.<eos> - Great?<eos> Is that your G.I. Joe gallows humor, like, "Ha ha, we're all gonna die"?<eos> It means your intel is good.<eos> If the Redhats are guarding the station, it means they're using it for something.
A four-karat, unheated Burmese ruby.<eos> And this necklace has special meaning to Magnus Bane as it was a gift from him to his then lover, Camille Belcourt.<eos> What, Camille and Magnus were lovers?<eos> Warlock gets around.<eos> Magnus bought it in 1857 for the price of his London townhouse.
Wow!<eos> Father José, I haven't spoken with him for two years, I'm curious, I want to hear.<eos> He did not tell me much, Father Lucas, just asked me to deliver this letter to you.<eos> And he said the matter is one of extreme urgency.<eos> I'll read it and I'll get in touch with him.
That I for poor auld Scotland's sake..."<eos> All right, you little monsters!<eos> You've awakened Scotland's shame!<eos> Willie, you know you can't play that torture trumpet to kids.<eos> I'll just use it to vape, then.
Well done. You should be a therapist, you should be.<eos> Okay, right.<eos> Well, all I'm saying is, sometimes, you need to listen to other people.<eos> All right, well, I'm listening to you now.<eos> You take a few minutes, play around with the ladder, do what you wanna do, then take it back and get your money back.
That's me.<eos> Remember, in this country, you could be anything you want to be.<eos> Now, go get 'em.<eos> I want you to look at the tip of my pen. All right?<eos> With your eyes only, follow it.
But I think this new treatment is gonna change things.<eos> Bring her back to us.<eos> Am I gonna get Mom's disease?<eos> No.<eos> Only women get it.
Like hell you are!<eos> It's either that or you'll be wearing orange for the rest of your days.<eos> Orange, Mother.<eos> With no accessories.<eos> You have had 30 years to make that call and we both know that you're not going to do it.
Good people have been lost along the way.<eos> And maybe worse than that... ..good people have simply lost their way.<eos> Difficult day.<eos> It occurs to me... ..that no-one has lost more or sacrificed more than you have.<eos> And I don't think you get much sympathy because you don't ask for it.
It's for you.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - Liam.<eos> Please do not do this.<eos> I know you're in pain and I know that you want revenge, but you don't want it like this.
Yeah.<eos> My son, Frank Junior, he...<eos> He used to grab a handful of cookies and take 'em and hide 'em in that bench.<eos> You know, he'd play soldier.<eos> - Guard it, protect it. - Oh, yeah?
There are larger pieces at play here.<eos> Oh, you're out of your mind.<eos> You know what it is, what it can do.<eos> You've gone soft for that thing, Stick.<eos> If you won't kill it... I will.
Okay, here's the play.<eos> Walk Frank through his story.<eos> Connect the dots between the Colonel and the neurologist.<eos> We don't have to prove that Frank's version of events is true.<eos> We just have to convince the jury that he believes it, and he relives it every day.
Don't worry.<eos> I'll answer for you.<eos> Detective?<eos> This is unexpected.<eos> You said the door's always open, and I'm walking through it.
There's nothing to take further.<eos> What do we have today, Mrs Whitaker?<eos> Ham and potatoes, Mr Clark.<eos> Nothing more miraculous than ham.<eos> MR WHITAKER: Tell Mr Graham the room's still his if he wants it.
- I didn't come here to argue.<eos> - Gary, okay, you don't...<eos> I just got a question I got to ask.<eos> I-I apologize for the zoo thing.<eos> Oh, oh, is that what we're calling it now?
Big surprise.<eos> And our D.A. was in an unholy hurry, so instead of felony murder, she offered Emile 12 years in exchange for giving Daniel up as the shooter.<eos> To corroborate his testimony, she asked our new star witness to deliver the gun.<eos> Emile told us where it was.<eos> And you never found it.
It's because I am the cartel, Daniel.<eos> And this church?<eos> This church is the cartel.<eos> The Bloods, the Diablos... they're all me.<eos> I cut the dope, and I send it out to both gangs.
_<eos> _<eos> Well, one of these searches is me... when we first found the weapon in the church.<eos> Sharon: Yes, I see that, Mike.<eos> But before we found the gun, Francine, you I.D.'d it from its casings.
No, I was not gonna let what happened to Sherry happen to me.<eos> But Tamika's baby was...<eos> You got to understand.<eos> I never thought she would have that baby in the car that late.<eos> When I realized I gave her the wrong heroin, I had to get it back.
Seriously?<eos> What?<eos> My feet were cold, and besides, you let Tess borrow your shirt.<eos> Excuse me, JT gave me this shirt.<eos> Uh, actually that's my shirt, JT just wears it all the time.
To promote construction, the government makes the railroad companies an unprecedented offer... millions of acres of free land.<eos> For every mile of track that a railroad would build, Congress would provide the company with land on either side of the track.<eos> The land grants that Congress provides really is the sweetheart deal of the century.<eos> 175 million acres are given to the railroad companies... more land than the entire state of Texas.<eos> The railroads then take the land they got for free and sell it to the settlers... using a massive advertising campaign that promotes the West as an uninhabited paradise.
That looks like a call to arms to me.<eos> A direct signal from the Master, right?<eos> A passage in the Lumen refers to "the silent voice of the Master."<eos> Interesting, yet trivial.<eos> Not if we can isolate it.
I'll outlive you!<eos> I'll dance on your grave!<eos> - Unlock it, please.<eos> - Well, I don't have the...<eos> Open it or I'll blow your goddamned head off!
Not yet.<eos> About 20 blocks to go.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - This old water tunnel.<eos> So, the silver powder... how do we disperse it?
The allegations she made against you, everyone who doubted you and said that you were crazy--<eos> It all goes away.<eos> You're a hero.<eos> You said you have a piece of evidence?<eos> We can use it. I'll get around the admissibility problem, whatever it is.
You know what's sick, Otto?<eos> What you've been doing.<eos> What I let you do, that's what's so sick.<eos> Everything was for you.<eos> But now you won't speak our language to me, but you teach it to him? Why? !
I have Otto and am 90 seconds from emergency egress.<eos> Alexa!<eos> Where's emergency egress?<eos> Door 7... end of this corridor.<eos> Just keep making lefts, you'll run right into it.
But the yellow kind, no, not this... this stuff with seeds in it.<eos> Who puts seeds in mustard?<eos> Those are mustard seeds. That's what you make mustard out of.<eos> No, mustard is yellow.<eos> You know, you go to The Ball Park. You put it on a hot dog. Yellow.
Uh, I have to go.<eos> - Do you need help? - No.<eos> Why won't you let me help you with what you're working on?<eos> Look, thanks for helping with the realtor, but I got to go.<eos> So... you think he's taking it?
No doubt.<eos> Demand and supply.<eos> Don't you mean supply and demand?<eos> No, they've been teaching that wrong for years.<eos> You see, demand comes first, and whoever supplies it profits.
It could be cheese. It could be cheese!<eos> I don't think we have room for any more cheese.<eos> -I will make room for cheese.<eos> -I'm putting that on your tombstone.<eos> And don't try to make a wig out of that stuff, 'cause I'm not gonna wear it.
Look I brought her to you because I promised her that she could trust you.<eos> I'm gonna get someone to help.<eos> Pru, this is serious.<eos> What about the house?<eos> Do you think they'll find it?
For every one of those videos, I can show you a hundred of people cooperating.<eos> So you're saying it's safe inside the cordon? Major Carnahan.<eos> Yes, if people follow the rules, it is.<eos> Zone 6 is my territory.<eos> I know it inside and out.
Always give people the real story.<eos> Leo, the fact that Lommers is trying to shut you down means you're doing something right.<eos> They lied about it being bioterrorism, they lied about the number of bodies, they sure as hell are lying when they say everything's ok in here!<eos> You don't have to expose the location.<eos> The minute you post that it exists, cops will find it, they'll seal it up, but at least the people are gonna know the whole story.
I drew up the map, said this way is north, this way is south.<eos> Here's a mountain and a river, that's a tree...<eos> Made sense out of mush.<eos> A mountain's a mountain.<eos> Even if you call it as a tree.
Oh, hey, guys.<eos> Now, that is how rumors get started.<eos> This is not how it looks.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it looks like you got a sex doll and you dressing it up to look like Amy.
They were on sale, so...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I spoke with miss arden.<eos> The job offer's still open. Good.<eos> -And I'm taking it.
You got it.<eos> Enough small talk?<eos> Okay.<eos> You see that guy out there smoking a cigarette?<eos> The way this works is, you bring your stuff to him, he'll sample it.
Hey, Suzy?<eos> Suzy?<eos> Suzy?<eos> Hey, you got a small cheese here?<eos> Yeah, just throw it on the table anywhere, please.
Just take this stuff and get out of here.<eos> Yo, G, you can't beat up the customers like that.<eos> We got a business to run.<eos> You don't want your cut?<eos> Hell, yeah, I want it.
Damn, take it easy.<eos> Ain't been behind the wheel since I was eight.<eos> Well, it seems you heard correctly.<eos> That family's just rescinded their offer on your house.<eos> So can we buy it?
Uh, well, what can you do by tomorrow?<eos> Those stale-ass cupcakes.<eos> Can re-cream them with blue or pink in the morning.<eos> How do you re-cream a cupcake?<eos> Poke a hole in the bottom, scoop out the filling with a tiny spoon, pack a syringe with fresh cream, stick it in the hole, squeeze.
Shake it off.<eos> Use the pain, Joss.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Oh, please tell me we're not buying all this stuff for the house.<eos> - We have nowhere to put it.
The IRS... off my back.<eos> Didn't I tell you to trust me?<eos> - Cheers!<eos> - Wow, Jonathan, I, uh... I'm so happy for you that the audit is over.<eos> I really am, but, um, the Food Network has offered me a second season of my show, and I'm gonna do it.
Yeah, I, um... called to apologize about the other call.<eos> I should have been there for him.<eos> Did your dad own a gun?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He gave it to Greg when he became a cop.
Did your dad own a gun?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He gave it to Greg when he became a cop.<eos> Old man was proud.<eos> And where did Greg keep it?
I don't know who she is.<eos> She has my voice and a gap between her teeth.<eos> That's all I know about her.<eos> Our voices generate an image.<eos> Our words set it in motion.
You don't even know his name properly or anything about him.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> So he's a different Kosti.<eos> She's buried in the cemetery in the valley.<eos> Kosti visits her grave all the time and keeps it beautiful.
- 'Cause I will. - That would be a mistake.<eos> Not putting my star witness on the stand is a bigger mistake.<eos> Your star witness who is high on pain pills and hallucinating.<eos> You don't have any other choice.<eos> Get the judge to accept it.
- This is intolerable!<eos> I'm perfectly well.<eos> - You can barely stand!<eos> I'm quiet comfortable.<eos> If I require assistance I shall ask for it.
But then you are on holiday.<eos> An "exotic" holiday.<eos> I hear that's the thing to do this season.<eos> (laughing)<eos> Why don't you two call it a night?
More energy than I've felt.<eos> It felt good.<eos> It felt... dangerous.<eos> The reason you treat magic like a drug, is because the people that taught it to you act like drug dealers.<eos> They buy it and they sell it, and they fight and they fuck for it.
But you need to be a monster to defeat Hitler.<eos> - Did Jock give you my box?<eos> - He did, sir.<eos> What's in it?<eos> - You'd like me to open it?
Have they been watching the news?<eos> Yeah... and they're freaked out by it.<eos> I mean, who isn't?<eos> But they've got thick skin by now.<eos> Handling it a lot better than some of their friends.
They told him, "We like Rudy for this, and if you help him,<eos> "we may have to do sweep you up too and charge as an accomplice."<eos> Nothing like that happens in Hackney or Tottenham or Brixton.<eos> Should we march again?<eos> Should we walk down the same streets and sing We Shall Overcome... and hand in a list of our names to men who will not read it...
Who is this?<eos> This is Special Agent Hannah Wyland.<eos> Alex isn't in charge anymore. I am.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> So I hope you enjoy the sound of my voice as much as you do hers because you're gonna be hearing a lot of it... at your arrest, at your arraignment, with my finger waving at you from the stand
A wicked bunch they were.<eos> A wicked bunch they are.<eos> Sorkaktani demanded that my sister, Oghul Qaimish... pledge her fealty to the House of Tolui.<eos> She would not.<eos> So they stripped her and bathed her in boiling oil... before knifing her skin loose... and peeling it like hide from her bones.
Seven stars.<eos> So, the killings are gonna form a big dipper to match the constellation?<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> The Aztecs had this ceremony built around Orion's Belt, it was called "the Fire Drill."<eos> Why they called it that, I don't know. But every time Orion's Belt rose above the horizon, they would sacrifice a man on top of a pyramid.
We're gonna come in tight behind you zero-dark-30 style, all right? Right.<eos> So you mean, like, using me as a shield?<eos> You wanted the gun.<eos> As soon as you see him, you train the gun on him, okay?<eos> And keep it on him and then we'll hand over the money.
Chinatown, the Triad.<eos> Vincent, you can't give them that gun.<eos> I can't just let a Triad gang member walk.<eos> Obviously I'm gonna have to hand it over if we want this to work.<eos> Unless we switch it out. You know, you take back the real one.
Blonde shoulder-length hair, slim build.<eos> I've got a photo of her on file.<eos> Me and Shaf went down to talk to HR at the department store where she works.<eos> We made a copy.<eos> Shall I e-mail it to you?
You know what, Lydia?<eos> You're no better than Valentine.<eos> But at least he had the guts to tell Downworlders to their faces he wanted them all dead.<eos> You... hide behind the Law.<eos> I don't hide behind it, Isabelle. I simply follow it.
Thank you, my friend.<eos> Of course.<eos> - I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah.<eos> You have the Cup.<eos> Help me break my Punishment rune... and I will bring it to you.
Why risk the wrath of the Khan's army so close to the Kurultai?<eos> What wrath?<eos> Our army's ensnared in South China.<eos> If we choose to engage Kaidu, it will be weeks before they can be redirected East.<eos> And by then... news of the raids will spread to every village and every chieftain faster than we can counter it.
No, don't be so modest.<eos> If you didn't make a tourniquet out of that scarf,<eos> Robyn could have bled out and died.<eos> Speaking of that scarf, where did it come from?<eos> Um... Robyn was wearing it.
My, erm, sister seems to find her new life agreeable.<eos> And I will never give her cause to think otherwise.<eos> Not that she takes account of my approval.<eos> She would dearly love it.<eos> That's why I also desire it.
Eloise and Gerard had an on-again off-again affair, and since they were both employed by CRAFT, they kept it secret.<eos> Eloise tried to move on, but Gerard became obsessed.<eos> Didn't help that the guy was mentally unstable. - Come on.<eos> When he realized the love of his life was gone forever, he figured the next best thing is her mind-file.<eos> He stole it, along with five others, and it made it look like it was Eloise who sold them to TheScrubJay.
Saphenous vein.<eos> It's thick enough, and she can go without it.<eos> Prep another surgical tray, place it over the patient's pelvis.<eos> I'm sorry to be playing catch-up here, but huh?<eos> I'm gonna splay the harvested vein, cut it into pieces, and then sew the pieces back together so that I can make a wider vein.
I give you my word.<eos> Or... you give me your left nut.<eos> What?<eos> Shipment don't go through,<eos> I carve out your left nut and feed it to my dogs.
Not Trina.<eos> Well, come on, give me a hand.<eos> Please.<eos> The window won't even open all the way.<eos> They rig it like that so no one will fall out.
Well, I didn't know that, but I still want to...<eos> Fuck you, Fiona. What?<eos> The F word song.<eos> Your ex wrote it, right?<eos> My nephew watches it on YouTube.
And now, to the situation unfolding in Shady Glen.<eos> Authorities are calling it a bath salts scare, and we're moving there now to get you the full story at 11:00.<eos> Hey, it's Reuben, right?<eos> What's the deal with the lemonade?<eos> Mom makes it every night.
You won't be surprised to learn that China has been covertly cribbing Russian technology as well as our own to develop their own space program.<eos> Okay, so in order to save the astronauts, the secretary has to strike a deal with two of the most prideful nations on Earth, one of which we're currently fighting in a war?<eos> When does the Soyuz lift off?<eos> In 14 hours.<eos> They either need to repair vital systems on the station or get off of it.
It's alive?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And when you broke it, Henry, you sent it right down here to the Underworld, its purpose unfulfilled.<eos> It epitomized unfinished business.<eos> And now you are going to find it down here with my help.
What do I do?<eos> Do I get on to that and...<eos> Do you just... I mean, how do you get this down?<eos> Right, so you're controlling this, and you click on this bar.<eos> - Right. - And then you pull it down. - Oh, right.
She recorded it off the radio.<eos> Shipping forecast. It's on late at night.<eos> Sailing By.<eos> D'you like that tune? - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, Molly loved it.
Thanks.<eos> Okay, I just talked to the building manager...<eos> If an intruder jimmied the window open when they broke in, would they leave that window open or closed behind them?<eos> - That's a rhetorical question...<eos> - I think that they would leave it open.
Hospitals are filling up, as our citizens are breathing in poisonous sulphur dioxide.<eos> Sometimes we have sunshine.<eos> Too much sunshine and they call it a drought.<eos> Then we have rain.<eos> Too much rain, and they call it a deluge and find a way to blame us for that too.
What are the odds, right?<eos> One in 2 million, actually.<eos> Um, Sharon... (sighing): ...<eos> Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiveis a rare genetic disease that causes the body's fibrous tissue, ligaments, muscles to transform - into bone.<eos> - (sighing): I'm so relieved that you've heard of it.
Thank you.<eos> All right!<eos> All right.<eos> I have a t-shirt I'm gonna toss out.<eos> I'm gonna throw it to the loudest person in the loudest section. Where are you?
The situation doesn't call for control.<eos> The only way we're gonna find the bastards who came after Liz is if we sink to their level.<eos> Tom, stop.<eos> Just be with your child.<eos> We have a solid lead, and we're working it now.
It's been years since a man worked this hard to gain my attention.<eos> Who hired you to go after Elizabeth Keen?<eos> Howard would be so happy to see you.<eos> He still tells that story at dinner parties about the night you two were jumped in Kuala Lumpur.<eos> Each time I hear it, ? there are five more machetes you two had to fight off.
Anything you can do to not succeed would be greatly appreciated.<eos> Can we get that thing out of our house?<eos> What happened?<eos> The courier didn't want it, that's what happened.<eos> And I don't want it in my house, not with my kids.
You know Jonas Fischer from the OPR?<eos> Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> We met after the WITSEC list leaked... why?<eos> He's here on a mole hunt.<eos> So, unfortunately, no one can leave until he finds it.
Nature has its own "centres of interest" that draw greater attention.<eos> We look at it while moving from one point of interest to another.<eos> When we gaze at a Van Gogh landscape, we see the identical, repeated divisions.<eos> How should we look at nature to see it as it was painted by Van Gogh?<eos> And was he looking at it with a normal, natural, physiological gaze?
- There's the money for last month.<eos> - Bon Appetit. - Thank you.<eos> If anyone disagrees with this statement "Strzeminski spreads ferment at the school, he undermines the authority of other lecturers, and promotes pure formalism at a time when art is supposed to stimulate society into action", please raise your hands.<eos> No-one.<eos> In that case, I propose the motion of condemnation of Professor Strzeminski and I put it to a vote. Who's in favour?
We have the wrong guy.<eos> Rosewood: Check for everything...<eos> Blood spatter, shoe prints, impressions.<eos> Rosie, you can't process your own crime scene.<eos> If a single strand of hair fell off the killer's head, I want it.
I'm not gonna keep life out of my show.<eos> I went through a pretty rough... uh, breakup recently.<eos> It was a long time coming. Uh, we had a lot of conversations about it, she and I.<eos> But recently we had the conversation...<eos> It wasn't recent, but I remember it like it was yesterday, you know?
What do you mean?<eos> Look at how you're holding your purse.<eos> S-So?<eos> You're gripping it so tight, your knuckles are white.<eos> And what would happen if you dropped it right now on the dirty floor?
Look at how you're holding your purse.<eos> S-So?<eos> You're gripping it so tight, your knuckles are white.<eos> And what would happen if you dropped it right now on the dirty floor?<eos> I would pick it up and move on.
They're just trying to freak us out, so that we'll leave.<eos> Well, it's working.<eos> I want to leave, Matt.<eos> Now.<eos> If they want the house that badly, let them have it.
The man who murdered your daughter is on the other side of the border.<eos> The student that started the riot that claimed your son supported him.<eos> You wrote this speech.<eos> You planned this war.<eos> And I am going to win it for you.
This place has an airstrip?<eos> The mining companies built it back in the '80s before they moved out.<eos> That's when the pirates moved in.<eos> This island is basically a safe port if the waters get too rough for them.<eos> But they use it too inconsistently for the government to really do anything about it.
How can I help?<eos> All right, stand back.<eos> It's a pin removal pressure release switch. It's like a grenade.<eos> When the handle went down it ejected the pin, triggering the bomb.<eos> Right now, I'm the only one I'm the only thing keeping it from going off.
Come on.<eos> First a bomb threat, then a forced evacuation.<eos> I've always known it was you.<eos> - Put the gun down, Ryan.<eos> - Yeah, I'll put it down when you tell me what the hell you're doing with my computer.
Chances are if there was a partner, he'd somehow want to participate in the kill.<eos> It's a weird dichotomy, typically seen when an unsub is in their early stages of becoming a killer.<eos> Early stages.<eos> As in you think the murderer could be a kid.<eos> No, I think he's lived with the fantasy for quite some time, but it's only now that he's finally acting on it.
Our techs say the fumes from the meth contaminated Alice and Kira's food and clothes.<eos> That's why Kira and her friend Oscar are sick. Two, the house belongs to you.<eos> We don't know anything about a meth lab.<eos> We... we bought the house for doing some renovations, fell behind in the payments.<eos> I mean, the bank was gonna take it in the next couple of months.
No, there isn't enough room.<eos> They're too far gone. - If we touch them... - Wax.<eos> Paraffin wax.<eos> It's neutral, stable.<eos> We melt it down, paint it on, drip it on, let it solidify, and then we lift them out.
She's still at Brightborn.<eos> The power source is metabolic. From the host's own tissue.<eos> A synthetic ATP chain.<eos> Nature is just a set of spare parts to you, isn't it?<eos> I think of it more as a palette.
It's all right.<eos> I'll - - I'll be fine without a new kitchen.<eos> You've got to understand -- just because I don't like things to change doesn't mean you don't matter to me.<eos> I never thought I'd be happy.<eos> But you built this life for us, and I love it just the way it is.
Oh, and you've been challenged.<eos> Come again?<eos> Well, if there's a grievance in the community, we cut it right out before it has a chance to grow.<eos> - I'm not following. - Okay.<eos> When we try to avoid conflict, anger comes out, but when we face it head on, we leave the anger there.
Ned, what are you doing here?<eos> I stay here.<eos> Ned knows drama.<eos> ♪ Baby, baby, I'm taken... ♪ How many times did you play this song?<eos> They love it at the Denim Turtle.
We've been through Halloween vandals, black mold, termites.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And after all that, we're only gonna break even.<eos> We're supposed to make money on this house.<eos> And if we rent it out, we will.
Exactly.<eos> And after all that, we're only gonna break even.<eos> We're supposed to make money on this house.<eos> And if we rent it out, we will.<eos> "We" rent it out?
Jenna's.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Paper?<eos> What, did you write it with a quill by candlelight?<eos> Why don't you just fax it to me while you're at it, huh?
Drive.<eos> - Throw that shit up now.<eos> - You're out of time.<eos> - I am not gonna throw it up! - You're not gonna make it.<eos> - Throw it up.
Nothing really.<eos> How did Guero steal from Epifanio?<eos> How did he do it?<eos> The details I got were they had someone in with the Federales.<eos> They were getting back seized cocaine, re-selling it for themselves.
It's impossible to trace back to you.<eos> Why?<eos> One of Epifanio's men, a very dangerous man, came down today to look into my business.<eos> I'm afraid they're gonna start to dig deeper into everything, attempting to understand what I'm gonna use a trawling company for.<eos> And what do you plan on using it for?
My name's Vanessa.<eos> Ok.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> Well, we don't got that much water so it makes sense to double up on showers.<eos> You know, we turn it off when we're soaping up.
Power... like it, hate it, want it, have it.<eos> Feel however you want about it. Power is the fuel that runs this great, big industrial machine we all help move forward, and that fuel is made of only one thing... you.<eos> That is what the fat cats in Washington like to call the American way.<eos> See you next week.<eos> And remember, love your Liberty or lose it.
I forgive her!<eos> - Just one crazy girl.<eos> - You're saying Bobo's hiding Revenants in the trailer park?<eos> You wanna win this war, we do it my way.<eos> Are you gonna tell me you're kicking it with the ghost of Doc Holliday?
They must be on the move.<eos> That's why the vibe's in flux.<eos> Hey, did you turn off the Magnetar?<eos> No, there's no messing with that thing.<eos> Whatever he did to it... We try and touch it, we try and move it...
- Mm! Okay.<eos> - From scratch.<eos> It's my dad's recipe.<eos> Sounds like a special pizza.<eos> My mom gets it every year on her birthday.
- What?<eos> - Yeah. Al this stuff is stolen, Shawn.<eos> - We can't use it as evidence in court.<eos> - Screw the courts.<eos> Why can't we just leak it to the press or something?
I see why my brother likes you.<eos> - James. - When you see ol' Dave, tell him there's a new sheriff in town.<eos> The Author's power is far greater than that bearded old man wanted you to believe.<eos> And when you broke the quill, you sent it right down here to the Underworld.<eos> And now you are going to find it down here. And you're going to send me back to our world.
- Mom.<eos> And my Blockbuster original series has been keeping me very busy.<eos> I still don't get how that's gonna work, at all.<eos> Babe, it makes total sense.<eos> They make the whole season, put it on six DVD's.
- Get Dan and Amy right now. - The Chinese are ready.<eos> - She never knocks.<eos> - Uh, Minna, I am right in the middle of something.<eos> Selina, do I need to remind you how sensitive the Chinese are to promptness?<eos> Then why is my wonton soup so cold every time they deliver it?
- Definitely.<eos> I was there.<eos> Don, again. Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, because the plan has always been... entirely based on the freemium model, like Dropbox?<eos> You know, you give the platform away free to consumers, and then once you have a big enough user base, then you sell premium services to businesses.<eos> If we're giving it away now and waiting until later to sell it, what are we doing here now?
Look, once we get enough data flowing through the system, it will be able to recognize long-range patterns and actually learn.<eos> It will be able to optimize our algorithm on its own, increasing our already superior speed and efficiency.<eos> Right?<eos> Pretty cool, huh?<eos> But it won't be able to do that if we delete it.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.<eos> You're wearing a gold chain?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah, I've had it for a while.<eos> Just kind of throw it on every now and then.
You think I would poison a good pozole?<eos> Who would do such a thing?<eos> I am not the killer here.<eos> I see the way you look at me.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd say that's hatred in your eyes. But I am old enough to know fear when I see it.
And it works, too, sweetie.<eos> That's something that Mother told me that works.<eos> Okay, you pour the hot water into the pot, all right?<eos> Swirl it around a bit.<eos> And then you pour it out, okay?
Um, it's a box.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> So this is all kind of a joke to you?<eos> You know what? I don't actually give a flying fuck what this box looks like.<eos> Okay, if it was up to me, I wouldn't even have it in the first place.
Okay, if it was up to me, I wouldn't even have it in the first place.<eos> So, look, here.<eos> This is a black rectangle.<eos> Make it that.<eos> All right? Because we're going to take it and put it in a hole in a subbasement in a data center, where no one can see it except for a sad man named John with a ponytail.
[BoJack] She lives in this tiny apartment in the Valley.<eos> I could see her through the window and I just watched her being... normal. Oh!<eos> [sighing] [The Closer] There's something very intimate about watching a person be herself.<eos> [BoJack] But it wasn't good intimate, like when you see your mom cry.<eos> It was bad intimate, like when your dad writes a poem about Lena Horne's nipples, makes you read it out loud so he can hear if it scans.
Okay, so I did a rough accounting of your assets and liabilities.<eos> Jared, don't look at me like that.<eos> Just give it to me straight.<eos> All right.<eos> Your house has appreciated in value since you bought it, but if you sold it now for what Zillow and Redfin think it's worth...
You're pushing too hard.<eos> The line's funny.<eos> Trust the line.<eos> -That went well.<eos> -Great. Now let me hear you throw it away.
No, let's drive to the one on Forest Avenue.<eos> It's further from that jacket.<eos> Claude, you're on pager duty until we get back.<eos> Jared, can I borrow that jacket?<eos> I sense you're doing something ironic with it, but I'm okay with that because... however unattractive this jacket may seem to you, once you slip it on, everything will change.
You broke into my office.<eos> With due respect, sir, you broke into my mind.<eos> I built your mind, Bernard.<eos> I have every right to wander through its rooms and chambers and halls, and to change it if I choose, even to burn it down.<eos> After all this time, I know it almost as intimately as my own.
Ski mask, flashlight, the whole nine yards.<eos> Suckers.<eos> There's no way this guy's friends with Dustin Diamond.<eos> And where would we find these Doppelgangers?<eos> Well, they teach at our old school. You know it as Harvard, but most people know it as the Miami University of Ohio of Massachusetts.
Mr. Mayor! How do you feel today about the election? !<eos> Who you gonna vote for, Mr. Mayor?<eos> Are you feeling confident?<eos> You ran a good campaign, Mr. Mayor.<eos> They're totally buying it.
Which is why I am running the numbers to predict the exact time and location so the aerostat crashes in the Mediterranean.<eos> Where the Navy SEALs will pick it up in a watertight bag.<eos> Now, if your calculations are off, you could be delivering a WMD to a neighboring regime that is not on Washington's Christmas list.<eos> Trust me, I've got this.<eos> Just in case you don't, I want a photo record of this technology, because if we lose it forever, I want proof of what Rahal was trying to build.
Great, but how do we knock it out of commission without them detecting us?<eos> We walk like Egyptians.<eos> Okay, ancient Egyptians used to make mortar from water, sand and limestone.<eos> The sand will be on the other side of the basement walls, and we already know the pump room will have water pipes.<eos> We'll fill it up and turn the whole room into a big block of stone.
This hydrological cycle, it's easy to just write it off as, well, that's the weather.<eos> We steal a lot of the magic from things that we give names to.<eos> It's this beautiful, choreographed cycle of life.<eos> If you were standing on the moon looking back at Earth, at one point during the day, you're looking at a blue planet.<eos> The ocean traps the sun's heat energy and turns it into a solar engine.
The beginning of a brand-new chapter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A new beginning, indeed.<eos> I want to thank you for joining me tonight to celebrate the beginning of our new narrative.<eos> I call it "Journey Into Night."
Oh, there's one thing I have to show you.<eos> So this is a letter that I wrote to Josh our last day of camp.<eos> I was gonna give it to him and then he...<eos> You know, he broke up with me.<eos> So I was gonna mail it to him, then I decided not to.
Jackson Brooks?<eos> Look, I don't have time to explain to you, all right?<eos> Look, I need my go bag.<eos> It's in the shed behind my house, the corner cabinet.<eos> You're gonna grab it and you're gonna bring it to me and you're gonna be alone.
Finding someplace safe to disappear.<eos> I spent months moving my Emperor from one hiding place to the next, and you still found us.<eos> You're fooling yourself if you think those Mongol soldiers are the last ones to come your way.<eos> Our protection is your best bet.<eos> And if you want it, you have to earn your keep.
The map I was telling you about... to buried treasure, underground missile silos, whatever you were thinking.<eos> I wasn't thinking anything.<eos> The map's for Dany.<eos> Remember Dany?<eos> Client of Dany wants it.
I'd keep that one.<eos> That thing's cherry.<eos> Fine.<eos> You know what? Take your stupid dishwasher and your clipboard of lies and go back to appliance world, okay, pal?<eos> You can't return floor models, so I'll just leave it in your driveway.
I wouldn't kid about a mask like this.<eos> What is this, some kind of magic?<eos> Something like that.<eos> What does it say?<eos> It says you'll pay me half of what you earn for as long as you wear it. And then when you're done, you have to return it to me.
Thank you.<eos> You do know we don't drink, right?<eos> Oh, yeah, I know.<eos> It's for me.<eos> Open it now.
Why do you think?<eos> For Roscoe.<eos> You know, she's gonna be in his life a long time. I got to figure out a way to get along with her.<eos> Look at you, taking the high road.<eos> Yeah, I just don't want to look like a Sherpa while I'm taking it.
But she just kept digging.<eos> She made me start again.<eos> I had to find peace for her.<eos> I had to.<eos> And now I'll find it for you.
Follow my lead.<eos> Hello, ma'am, my name is Rebecca Bunch, Esquire, and these are my legal associates.<eos> Hello.<eos> Tell me, is your hot water out?<eos> Yeah, but they said they're going to fix it...
And how do you propose lifting them if they cannot see it?<eos> The people look to a monarchy for something bigger than themselves.<eos> An inspiration.<eos> A higher ideal.<eos> If you put it in their homes, allow them to watch it with their dinner on their laps.
Bon voyage.<eos> A tiny white community, surrounded by primitive Africans, grew into a young and flourishing nation with the ever brightening promise of more prosperity before it.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> We honour a man of remarkable vision, who saw how great this land could become, once civilized.<eos> I wish continued prosperity and success to all those who inhabit it.
One is about your writing, and you know what it is.<eos> Oh. Please.<eos> Please make some copies.<eos> You know that I know that your poetry is really, really good.<eos> And that some day, you might just decide to let the world get to read it.
Oh, my God!<eos> There's a woman here with a gun.<eos> - Where's my husband?<eos> - Who's your husband?<eos> Put it down.
It's imperative that we warn the public, and I'd like to pay another visit to Father Consolmango...<eos> He wasn't forthcoming with us earlier.<eos> Father Consolmango has been a pillar of this community for over 30 years.<eos> Señor Garrett, you must understand the politics involved.<eos> If I reach out to the archdiocese with such a request, they will deny it.
It also makes Sara's shirt smell like a Dumpster fire.<eos> Don't be cute.<eos> Why she's not waving the sage?<eos> Come on, wave the sage.<eos> The spirits said I was waving it fine.
Alternate idea: you could move up to Maine.<eos> Stephen King lives up there. Seems very nice.<eos> - I think that's him pulling up.<eos> At least we don't have to get into a back and forth about location.<eos> Let me just get some pictures of your face so the doctors can reconstruct it.
Hopefully.<eos> Have I died?<eos> Because Shannon looks like an angel.<eos> Thank you for the nightgown, Grandma.<eos> I'll wear it until you feel better.
- You again...<eos> - Sing me the donkey flying song.<eos> - Oh, please!<eos> How come you're so obsessed with that song, huh?<eos> My dad used to sing it to me, but he went to war.
Preliminary tests indicate that the mushrooms he used were infused with poison from another mushroom.<eos> The two of you wrote three books together:<eos> two explorations on the biochemical effects of psilocybin and one textbook on the chemistry of psychedelics.<eos> Then you two had a falling out.<eos> I wouldn't call it that.
We were together for almost a year. I would never have hurt her.<eos> But you're not together anymore.<eos> When we started hanging out, she was fun.<eos> She liked to take mushrooms, drop acid, do Molly.<eos> Chemists-- we get the best stuff, 'cause we make it ourselves.
Through folk art.<eos> Specifically, chain saw sculpting.<eos> One uses a chain saw to artfully sculpt entire tree trunks into a bear perhaps or an eagle.<eos> All rather kitsch and extremely loud.<eos> I'd retrieved my chain saw from storage, and I was in the process of oiling it when that fire broke out.
Yeah. Having the party on home turf isn't such a bad idea.<eos> - Right.<eos> - It's definitely safer - for the sisters, Mack.<eos> - I guess that's true.<eos> And we don't call it a party.
The list.<eos> Where exactly did Riggs keep this list?<eos> Jack said it was a notebook.<eos> A notebook like this?<eos> Salib tortures and kills Riggs for the list, then destroys it.
I'm not going to miss you.<eos> This pathological liar brain is gonna get me in trouble.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Not with me.<eos> I'll know the truth when I hear it.
Right. I get it. I get it.<eos> But look, a deposition's not rocket science.<eos> There's a way to deal with them. You know?<eos> There's really five simple rules.<eos> When they ask you a question, if you don't understand it, just ask them to repeat it.
You know what this is.<eos> It's a November 6 problem.<eos> Just put the box back.<eos> Don't destroy it, don't move it, don't mention it.<eos> Just leave it here, and we'll come find it again on November 6 and deal with it then.
The hope is that all the trouble I've known will be gone.<eos> 2, 4, 6, 8, we don't wanna integrate!<eos> I will no longer be held down by this notion held against my skin and my hair.<eos> More literally, I can get work because it's growing so fast here.<eos> And I can buy a house, and nobody's ever gonna come take it away from me because I'm black.
It's ridiculous.<eos> Can you guys represent me?<eos> Well, we would have to talk about our fee.<eos> Well, what if... what if I just paid you back with a percentage of the song?<eos> If you get it back.
- No judgment.<eos> - We saved your life.<eos> All right, so there might be a solution here.<eos> Uh, a weapon.<eos> It sounds like if we could find it, we could use it to kill The Beast.
Si.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Who else has the combination?<eos> Only the Inspector and myself.<eos> And I will require it in case of emergencies.
We're supposed to count 'em together, in front of everyone.<eos> I don't care about your sandpit politics.<eos> - You can do that in the morning.<eos> - They're not taking the bag back to their unit. They'll rig it.<eos> Yeah, well, you're not taking it.
I don't care about your sandpit politics.<eos> - You can do that in the morning.<eos> - They're not taking the bag back to their unit. They'll rig it.<eos> Yeah, well, you're not taking it.<eos> Right, we'll lock it in the observation box and you can get back to your units.
Take your time, until 7:00 this evening.<eos> Province of Nuoro?<eos> - In Sardinia?<eos> - Fanelli, I love it here.<eos> My colleagues are giving me special treatment, if a photocopy needs to be done, they say, "You're not capable, your colleague will do it."
And a jacuzzi in the rec room.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Dad, you have to get this place.<eos> Mom's never let us go in a jacuzzi.<eos> She calls it the devil's chowder.
I'll be right there!<eos> So, turns out there's zero viable tail in the freshman group.<eos> Any options for me in your crew?<eos> So, "crew's" caught on?<eos> Is anyone calling it the "K-crew" yet?
I make no judgment on the rights or wrongs of it, Bob.<eos> My investigation leaves me in no doubt as to the nature of Jacob Marley and I can only imagine the strain of trying to provide for a family at Christmas, under the weight of a loan you couldn't afford.<eos> No-one would blame a man for buckling under the burden of all that.<eos> When my Emily was expecting Martha, we were trying to get our own place, but we didn't have the money.<eos> So she pressed her mother's garnet necklace into my hand, watched me pawn it.
Thirteen, fourteen... who won?<eos> I did.<eos> Good job.<eos> The bathtub here is too small.<eos> I hadn't been in it in awhile.
Divine?<eos> Hmm, not so much.<eos> But a hungry gorge, yes.<eos> Oh, very, very hungry.<eos> Where do you want it?
Whatever it was... it wasn't human.<eos> Where's my cell phone?<eos> I'm calling in backup.<eos> The whole God damn army if I have to.<eos> We will find that thing and go kill it...
Go!<eos> A tonic.<eos> Something for the head, sir?<eos> Yes.<eos> This will shift it.
So she comes in holding nothing but a tray of lasagna?<eos> No, she kept them in a shopping bag.<eos> It was filled with arts and crafts stuff.<eos> Look, she had gate clearance.<eos> Yeah, but still, you put it through the metal detector, right?
We have an appointment with Jess Cagle.<eos> - Hey, what's up?<eos> - I slipped the manuscript to a producer friend of mine at Paramount. And he thinks it's perfect for Scott Rudin.<eos> How fast can you get me your offer?<eos> Liza can send it over now. Okay.
She's happy, though.<eos> I mean, if you looked like this, wouldn't you be excited?<eos> Just with this drug, do you feel like you would take it again? Or like...<eos> I don't feel like myself, so I feel a little bit like I don't...<eos> I would not... I don't think I'll take it again, and I don't feel like I need to be amped up like that.
We get 99%.<eos> You're never gonna get better cocaine than that.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah. And actually, we don't...<eos> - Where do you get it from?
- Where do you get it from?<eos> - Straight from the DEA.<eos> They give you the best, the highest grade of cocaine?<eos> Yeah, you wanna have pure, that's what you're doing.<eos> But that's taking away cocaine from all the other people in the world that wanna use it...
But that's taking away cocaine from all the other people in the world that wanna use it...<eos> - I think we should give even more to rats.<eos> - ...to give to rats.<eos> - Actually, we don't give them to rats...<eos> - That's pretty fucked up. - ...the rats take it themselves.
- Actually, we don't give them to rats...<eos> - That's pretty fucked up. - ...the rats take it themselves.<eos> - Oh, wow.<eos> Okay. We have a little button that they push and then they get the drug.<eos> If they don't want it, they don't have to push the lever.
I mean, going to a different part of the world that you've never been in is the same kind of feeling, I think.<eos> That's why I want to do ayahuasca because it would be great - to have a super spiritual experience.<eos> Though also people, like, you know, shit their pants and vomit and if I have to do that on camera, it's, like, great.<eos> - But I will.<eos> - Some people see it as a religion.
Would you take a drug that was tested on a fish?<eos> - Okay, that's evasive.<eos> So, I would take a little vial of cocaine, and I'd just go...<eos> It tasted awful.<eos> People put it in their assholes.
It wouldn't be too hard to inquire.<eos> And why should I exert myself for André when he has done nothing for me?<eos> Because if you don't, this won't move any further.<eos> Too thick a stone wall and Arnold won't...<eos> Why should I guarantee him a command before he's done anything to earn it?
You do?<eos> Yeah, because I'm the screw-up, and Victoria's the together one, and she's gonna take better care of the house than I would.<eos> No, she's not.<eos> She's gonna sell it before I'm cold in the ground.<eos> Well, wait a minute, if you know that, then why are you giving it to her?
- To do what?<eos> - Well, I don't know!<eos> Fish, jet ski, hang out on a boat.<eos> I guess that'd be kind of cool.<eos> Especially if you get it before I go to London.
So I, uh, have to go.<eos> Um, but, I love you both.<eos> Well, I think we nailed that.<eos> Is this top too over-the-top?<eos> I'm trying it out for Frenemy Frenzy.
Well, clearly, you know somethin' about farming.<eos> Then you must also know how far behind y'all are.<eos> The seed cane shoulda been in the ground more than a month ago.<eos> Yes, but the land is still the land.<eos> We're not gonna just give it away.
On second thought, I don't like your father anymore.<eos> Um, Hera, uh, our "friends" have bags full of detonators.<eos> Enough to blow up this carrier.<eos> - We're scrubbing the mission, right?<eos> - No, we're finishing it.
We have been captured.<eos> Cham, we don't have time for this.<eos> Imperial reinforcements will be coming.<eos> Destroy this ship, and the Empire will just send another.<eos> But if we take it, we can use it to fight them.
It's free to join and everything you buy gets you points.<eos> And then we return the stuff, keep the points.<eos> All these points are good for travel.<eos> It's amazing more people haven't figured it out.<eos> What if this stuff gets damaged and I'm stuck with it?
I-I see a mirror.<eos> It's so cold!<eos> Can she see a camera?<eos> Honey? Can you see the make and model of the camera?<eos> Um, no, no, I can't see it. It-It's too dark.
In fact, we may be at a bigger risk of losing the money we did invest in this home.<eos> But we can find another place.<eos> Dinner's almost ready. I'll check outside.<eos> Sir, open up. FBI.<eos> Sir, if you don't open the door, we're gonna break it down.
Score one for Brooklyn College.<eos> I got to let Mullins know.<eos> Uh, hold on a second.<eos> Uh, there's got to be an explanation.<eos> She can tell it to Mullins.
Yeah, well, I-I told him to buy it online, but I didn't say...<eos> Come on, man, you can't just fire me...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I'll turn in my shirt tomorrow.<eos> Yes, I will wash it first.
Okay.<eos> God. His airway's trashed.<eos> I can't see the cords.<eos> - Do you want a hand?<eos> - No, I got it.
Max, I know this sounds abrupt.<eos> Elliot? Max, in my practice, I developed the ripping-the-Band-Aid-off technique.<eos> You'll read about it in my book someday, if I ever finish it, but that's between me and my therapist.<eos> He's not speaking to me right now because of a couch spill.<eos> And I'd be mad as hell about it if I didn't completely understand it!
He didn't change with it.<eos> All right, I love you, Ma.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. You didn't accept my-- my LinkedIn request.<eos> Okay, I'll send it-- I'll send it again later.
You're both banned! What the hell's going on?<eos> ! You're out of here.<eos> Damn.<eos> ♪ You make my dreams You on Tinder?<eos> People, this company has brought nothing but pain and suffering to our community, and I'm shutting it down.
I-I answer from here, like this.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're gonna open the door.<eos> If you don't, I'm gonna break it down.<eos> All right, I'm kicking it in, in three, two, one.
I promise. I am so excited about this opportunity.<eos> As am I.<eos> Please clean the bones and rearticulate them.<eos> I can totally do that.<eos> I finished the facial reconstruction, and I'm running it through the Lynwood student database.
This is the right place, yes?<eos> Not anymore. We're done.<eos> You want to look at the space, talk to the building manager.<eos> Fourth floor.<eos> Rosalyn's death sticks a fork in Hull's building, and these guys call it a day?
When we first came upon this oak grove, there was mistletoe clinging to the branches.<eos> The sign of a sacred place.<eos> So we made camp and built the effigy.<eos> For protection, not human sacrifice.<eos> If it keeps us from harm, we'll burn it to thank the gods.
I mean, it's pretty expensive.<eos> I bet there are scholarships you could apply for.<eos> And having a reference letter from a working DJ wouldn't hurt your chances.<eos> Who says I'm writing him a letter?<eos> Oh, you'll write it, if you know what's good for you.
I remember it knocking that cat unconscious. Five years later, cupcakes alone aren't cutting it.<eos> Ouch.<eos> But true. Sure, they're sweet, delicious, and chic, but what if we add... alcohol?<eos> Which is sweet, delicious, and expensive?<eos> We keep the cupcake window, but we make it into a bar too.
We're opening a dessert bar!<eos> All right, give me the knife.<eos> To cut the cake?<eos> No.<eos> Well, then I'm not gonna give it to you.
This?<eos> Oh, no. It was a seahorse.<eos> - A seahorse.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I was just looking for it the other day.
Robert used to sing that song for the kids, all the time.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Danny told me.<eos> That's why I learned it.<eos> And Danny used to sing it to Nolan when he was a baby.
I didn't think I'd get to see his concert before I die.<eos> But he's coming here to Korea.<eos> Wait and see.<eos> I'm going to look online and find the sheet music for his arrangements.<eos> Then I'll get him to sign it and keep it forever.
What are you doing?<eos> That's never been opened.<eos> Have you ever looked for an alcoholic's secret bottle?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> You won't find it in the drinks cabinet.
Did you see someone?<eos> No.<eos> So come on. Show me inside.<eos> - The millstone.<eos> As a boy, I saw it as an altar, where a high priest might make a sacrifice.
14 hours later, a Taliban sniper put a bullet through my husband's neck, severed his carotid artery, killed him almost instantly.<eos> I didn't blame the shooter.<eos> I didn't even blame the government or the energy companies.<eos> I blamed myself.<eos> I had an opinion, and I didn't voice it.
But creating a Cyber Command meant using the same technology to do offense.<eos> Once you get inside an adversary's computer networks, you put an implant in that network.<eos> And we have tens of thousands of foreign computers and networks that the United States put implants in.<eos> You can use it to monitor what's going across that network and you can use it to insert cyber weapons, malware.<eos> If you can spy on a network, you can manipulate it.
I had this notion that somehow my extensive familiarity with Nick Cave, and Radiohead, and a smattering of Stravinsky destined me for success.<eos> So I'll never forget the day that I realized my composition class required composing.<eos> But I did it.<eos> I composed the melody, I added the harmonies, I drew those treble and bass clefs,<eos> I wrote those whole notes, those half notes, those quarter notes, those rest stops, and... while you'll never witness a public performance of my composition... because of that experience, I can see music when I hear it.
I sat down and it just came out.<eos> Flew out.<eos> It's like this story has been sitting in my brain for years, - taking up space.<eos> - Like the lyrics to "My Sharona." Exactly.<eos> It's been there, waiting for me to put it down on paper.
God, no!<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - So, no?<eos> - Sorry, but no.<eos> Since you and I don't want it, I thought I'd sell it to someone who does.
Hi, is she up yet?<eos> She's not answering her phone.<eos> I haven't seen her this morning.<eos> We have a 9 AM appointment to get a pedicure.<eos> I'll do it for you for half of whatever they're charging.
I must go.<eos> Jaya.<eos> This isn't a negotiation.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> The United States team that worked on the bomb is going to load it inside one of our helicopters and return it to Pasha Base inside the Pakistani border.
And why do you blame Gloria's Guns?<eos> The gun used to kill my daughter, it was traced back to her shop.<eos> She sold it to a straw buyer.<eos> And what does that mean, "straw buyer"?<eos> Someone who buys a gun and then they sell it to another person who couldn't have bought it.
Titanium dioxide is a white pigment found in a wide range of products.<eos> Like spray-in hair color, blond to be exact.<eos> That's my presumption, yes.<eos> Most of it washed out in the water, but there are still trace elements on her scalp.<eos> Someone who used this type of cheap hair color all the time would be more skilled at applying it. She wouldn't get it all over her scalp.
It's a unique blade, but I guess you wouldn't know that.<eos> You're lying.<eos> No. And here it is.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> We'll take it in together.
- Good.<eos> Well, you just needed a new control panel.<eos> That was it.<eos> - Oh, great. Thank you.<eos> Oh, uh, by the way, if you ever want to get rid of that old furnace, uh, just call us and we'll pick it up. - Really?
That... that's good. But no, here's the real play.<eos> Eat his doughnut.<eos> - His doughnut? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> He's keeping it... some kind of security thing.<eos> He's holding it in reserve or something, making him feel safe.
It can be chef's recipe.<eos> He can create anything with the fresh, raw material.<eos> [Nestlé chef 2] We have a chicken tikka Maggi.<eos> So, first we capture the flavor from here.<eos> We take the kabob, we skewer it, and then we just put it inside.
It's never easy to let a king go, Bill.<eos> Phil was being paid a lot of money to hug a lot of people and make them feel good about the old way.<eos> Well, the old way is gone.<eos> I'm looking for the new way.<eos> And we will find it.
I don't know.<eos> Oh, Jake.<eos> Sorry to bother you, Jen,<eos> But you left the Dufresne brief in the office.<eos> Um... okay, I'll take that. I'll just put it right here on the table.
She was there when we took it away from her.<eos> - She was there.<eos> - Stop humanizing her.<eos> Territoriality is not solely a human trait.<eos> Yeah, well, we took it back.
But honestly, it would've been very hard to tell because, like I've said before, she was very intoxicated.<eos> Did you know at the time that Mr. Aguirre was a high-ranking detective at the Monroe County Sheriff's Department?<eos> I didn't handle the situation well.<eos> I was young, I was a rookie, I admit that.<eos> And if that same situation were to arise today, I'd handle it completely differently.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> - Oh, yeah, now you know it?<eos> Now I know it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And, you know, he denies that "We Fooled No One" is about me, but I'm the one that wears a gold cross and never takes it off, so, yeah.
It was a long story.<eos> What's in this vault?<eos> Something that can't be let out.<eos> Gonna need you to be a little more specific.<eos> First you have to swear that you'll never open it.
Abby, uh, let me tell you what's gonna happen so you can use your ten minutes the best you can.<eos> The band will claim they don't want makeup, but Tom actually does.<eos> And Rick is gonna try to do, uh, this pose.<eos> We call it The Cock.<eos> Every photographer hates it.
Got it.<eos> Okay, check this out, Gabriel.<eos> You see that valve right there, right in front?<eos> The thing that looks sort of like a mouth?<eos> Yeah, it doesn't close properly, so I snip away the damaged part... and then I remove it from the field.
Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Brody?<eos> Answers you want--<eos> I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing.<eos> And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.
Who are you?<eos> Okay, this is just creepy, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna go.<eos> Help, somebody!<eos> Ivanka Trump is trying to kill me!<eos> And then I took my heel and threw it right at her face and just ran as fast as I could.
God save her.<eos> And you are?<eos> Better you don't know.<eos> There's a mechanical clock in the corridor leading to the Great Hall.<eos> Hide the pistol inside and I'll retrieve it when the time is right.
- You took his son?<eos> You get your son when we get the payroll.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> Payroll's in the shuttle, and the shuttle's sealed.<eos> And I won't open it until I see my son.
I will adjourn to consider whether the exceptional circumstances test for bail has been met and give my decision this afternoon.<eos> Court is adjourned.<eos> I'm chasing up that face morphology from Holland.<eos> Commission's paying, so it'll come straight to you.<eos> We'll get it much faster now than a plain DNA match.
Do you always dress this way for work?<eos> What way?<eos> This is a formal investigation.<eos> Itlookslike my gun.<eos> I usually keep it in the nightstand.
They made a fortune off Elliot's work.<eos> But Breen got bought out by a pharmaceutical company in '08.<eos> Elliot was laid off with no place to go, and, uh, the economy collapsed all around us.<eos> - Heard this story before.<eos> - He couldn't find work. - We'll likely hear it again.
I am?<eos> Mm-hmm. You're a good person 'cause I say mean things all the time and you just smile.<eos> You're nice.<eos> So nice 'cause you do things for people, and I don't.<eos> Sometimes I need a fork, and you get it for me.
See how I'm doing it here?<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, it's my nana's famous soup from Italy.<eos> Oh, I already gave them my famous soup from a can.<eos> I could make it from scratch, but they won't have it.
- No.<eos> - That never happened.<eos> It didn't even sound like me.<eos> 'Cause you do things for people and I don't.<eos> Sometimes I need a fork, and you get it for me.
_<eos> What's that?<eos> The crystal my grandpa tethered Storybrooke's magic to.<eos> Wait, I-I-I don't understand. You said magic is bad.<eos> Why are we going to take it out of Storybrooke?
- Maura.<eos> - Sorry, Frankie.<eos> Every investigated incident of spontaneous human combustion involved an overlooked external ignition source.<eos> We need to figure out what the source was here.<eos> Jane: Spontaneous combustion, and I'm missing it?
Every investigated incident of spontaneous human combustion involved an overlooked external ignition source.<eos> We need to figure out what the source was here.<eos> Jane: Spontaneous combustion, and I'm missing it?<eos> Maura says it's technically not a real thing, but this could be the one time she's wrong, right?<eos> It's the first time Maura's wrong, and I'm missing it?
You know, if you move back, I could help you with T.J.<eos> No smothering.<eos> I don't know, Ma.<eos> I'm just putting it out there.<eos> I mean, it's your decision, and I'll respect it.
I'll need about $89,000 more.<eos> I'll take cash or check.<eos> What about coke?<eos> The street value for that is $90,000.<eos> Yeah, if I step on it and sell it on the street, but, uh, that's not my business.
Jane...<eos> Uh, so what do you want me to do with all this extra cake?<eos> Let the crew eat it or... ?<eos> Put it in the freezer.<eos> I'll take it home and eat it on my cheat days.
- Yes, me too.<eos> - I don't want water.<eos> - Open the bottle and drink.<eos> I'm not thirsty.<eos> Will I open it for you like you were a kid?
I don't understand.<eos> This mediation is a bit special.<eos> Special?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're doing it with us.
They both want that orange.<eos> What would you do to settle that conflict without either coming off badly?<eos> - There's only one orange?<eos> - Only one.<eos> I'd cut it in two and give each a half.
So he thought you'd be observant.<eos> Why would he be sorry for that?<eos> Because now I love details.<eos> Well, his leg-- yeah, everyone sees that, but...<eos> I saw the way he covered it with a blanket to make it look normal for me.
Come on, I'm dying to know, what did it get you?<eos> Yeah, DiNozzo, I'm on the way.<eos> Sitrep.<eos> Agent West recovered the insurgents' camera.<eos> Some kid found it planted in the building, took it home to play with before West got to it.
Put that down.<eos> That's what killed the MI6 agent that defected from the KGB.<eos> Walt, this stuff is crazy toxic.<eos> One gram can kill ten million people.<eos> Okay... we're safe as long as we don't ingest it.
- I'm sick of Harry!<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> - Yes, I fucking am!<eos> - Oh, Mum!<eos> - Well, if you can't say the F-word when you're pissed off at my age, when can you say it?
But our search team's already on it.<eos> Yeah, a search team that's in a single boat, Cam.<eos> And they're just, like, randomly floating on the Anacostia looking for a head.<eos> I mean, that's like throwing darts in the wind.<eos> They're not gonna find it. And you can?
Here.<eos> Drink it, all of it this time.<eos> And you, too, shall be free of my hold forever.<eos> But I've given you your freedom.<eos> I do not want it.
Jesus Reid.<eos> Oh, Mathilda.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Mathilda. He Would not open it and set about the suspect, Mr. Buckley.<eos> Mr. Reid took Mr. Buckley's head between his hands and well, I cannot think of a better word for it, popped it against the wooden pillar.
That is a nasty infection, but there's plenty we can do.<eos> - A healthy mother makes for a healthy baby.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Nurse Franklin, could you spare a moment?<eos> I'll need to lance this hand, then you can dress it.
What about when they taste it?<eos> They won't. They are too scared.<eos> So we're not going to make a packet?<eos> Eh, Grumio, you cannot win the beauty contest if no-one will look at your face.<eos> I'm not sure I'd win it, anyway.
You're right.<eos> Somebody else drove it.<eos> Somebody knows what we did tonight.<eos> Hey, I just left Alison's house with Elliott's bag.<eos> Do we wanna burn it or do we wanna throw it in a dumpster outside of town?
I could heat up some of your friend's casserole.<eos> The song you were humming... My mom used to sing that to me as a lullaby.<eos> "Little Sparrow."<eos> Your mom and I used to fall asleep to that song.<eos> Your grandmother used to sing it to us.
Hi.<eos> He's giving me such a hard time about seeing you.<eos> Why are you here so early? Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, today is just the deadline for our job paperwork to be turned in.<eos> - Didn't want you to miss it. - Thanks.
Hey, Tuck... you think Riley and I had something, right?<eos> Really? We can't have one conversation about me?<eos> It's like Danny wants to pretend that what I had with Riley didn't even exist.<eos> Well, I guess I understand that.<eos> It's kind of like when I gave my cousin my bike, and he wouldn't even let me ride it once in a while.
Brock, come on.<eos> Well, there was this song my au pair sang to me when I was a kid.<eos> She sang it to me when she put me to bed, and it always calmed me down and helped me sleep.<eos> Okay, what's the song?<eos> The Chanels and I will sing it to you.
Sign it... Mr. President.<eos> Passive radar is clear, sir.<eos> No sign of the Chinese.<eos> How's the temperature below deck?<eos> Considering the circumstances... I'd call it a low simmer.
Nice choice.<eos> And what's your excuse?<eos> I just like drinking at lunch.<eos> So, the official SwapMeet offer is happening today?<eos> Yes, John Bosworth is taking it over later this afternoon.
I'd think you'd be happier.<eos> I am happy, very.<eos> I'm just a little surprised by how completely off-book you went.<eos> I thought this was supposed to be handshakes and how do you dos.<eos> You see an opportunity, you take it.
Pack up your stuff.<eos> Starting tomorrow, we'll be working out of my place.<eos> What'd you do that for?<eos> If you can find someone willing to pay north of $350, you should go for it.<eos> When you see an opportunity, you take it.
♪ Arrow 5x01 ♪ Legacy Original Air Date on October 5, 2016<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> The mayor will be making his official statement on the anti-crime initiative at the ceremony honoring the Black Canary, but--<eos> But he can say a few words now.<eos> The A.C.I. is an important step towards lowering crime in the city, but I'm not going to consider it without some major reform.
Very embarrassing.<eos> I know that Sara told her father she was leaving to protect history.<eos> Why?<eos> Why does history need protecting?<eos> Because the idiots who were protecting it...
I just needed someone to talk to.<eos> We're gathered here to say prayers for Emma Al Fayeed.<eos> After which, we will move to the family cemetery, and send the bodies of Jamal Al Fayeed and Rami Said back to God.<eos> In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful, to Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.<eos> He gives life and He takes it away.
What?<eos> It spoke to her soul.<eos> But alas, the conversation was short.<eos> Because while Jane loved watching salsa, it turned out she hated dancing salsa.<eos> Like, seriously hated it.
I'm okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Good.<eos> So the deadline is the deadline.<eos> You either meet it or you don't.
Nice move, trying to take control of the investigation.<eos> You might not be a moron after all.<eos> Unless you decide to spy on me like Wallace asked you to, probably in exchange for a key role in his political future. He did n...<eos> Every good politician plays that card.<eos> My father used it constantly.
- Move!<eos> - No!<eos> I brought it back for you.<eos> You're right, a gun is evidence.<eos> I don't want it at my place.
In a really big and creepy house.<eos> They had paintings on every wall possible.<eos> My brother said the paintings came alive and walked around at night.<eos> There was just one room that I liked, the TV room.<eos> Grandma called it the Blue Room.
So if we can somehow cool the air that is feeding the funnel, specifically the rear flank downdraft, by 15 degrees, then we can go from twister to very severe windstorm.<eos> Excuse me, God Complex, how exactly do you plan on making it cold in Vietnam? Dry ice.<eos> Remember, the owner said he had built CO2 lines out here for his factory's infrastructure?<eos> Yeah, but how do you turn CO2 into dry ice?<eos> Easy. Back in the orphanage, I'd shoot fire extinguishers into a pillowcase, seal it up tight, CO2 turns into dry ice in seconds, then you can use it all kinds of ways to get back at mean girls.
I was worried Craig was gonna bleed out.<eos> I had to make the call.<eos> I made the call.<eos> You two are going back to that car.<eos> You're gonna strip it, bleach it, chop it in 10 pieces, and then throw it into the goddamn ocean.
- This car?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 1963 Chevelle.<eos> This is my first car.<eos> Total clunker, honestly, but I'll never sell it.
No justice, no peace!<eos> We're in front of the courthouse as crowds await the verdict on Steven Benedict, the 45-year-old white male on trial for shooting an African-American man six months ago.<eos> This man is no "highway hero"!<eos> He is a "roadside racist"!<eos> We want justice, and we want it now!
Kill them.<eos> Your form is all wrong.<eos> I ordered Ichiro to destroy that blade after the death of his son.<eos> Very well.<eos> I will destroy it myself.
Car alarms keep malfunctioning too.<eos> Car alarms, transformers. What is the connection?<eos> Yeah, we'll get there, fellas.<eos> We'll get there. We just got to keep trying.<eos> Maybe someone's pulling power out of the transformers and using it to power the monster.
Thought of what?<eos> I think I know where Prometheus is.<eos> - I'll call the team. - No.<eos> I created this situation.<eos> I am gonna deal with it alone.
So, if, uh, you'll excuse me, I have a class to teach. - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Dad, what are you thinking?<eos> Lars found the lamp, and, clearly, he rubbed it, but that makes him the genie's master, right?<eos> But if no one has rubbed the lamp since and I were to discover it... then that would make me the genie's new master.
You take a needle and you inject accelerant into the bulb, you screw the bulb back in, and then when the light turns on...<eos> Boom.<eos> One of the workers from the bottling facility flips the breakers every morning at 6:00 a.m., and the alarm went off less than ten minutes later.<eos> I've seen this tactic before.<eos> Prison gangs use it to take out their rivals.
Call him now... or I will send you back to him in pieces.<eos> My father's not afraid of you... and neither am I.<eos> Then you are both foolish.<eos> Guys, we got a blood trail.<eos> If we follow it, we should find them.
Of course.<eos> I'll give you guys some space.<eos> Let me just get this out of your way.<eos> You need some help?<eos> No, I got it.
It's rudimentary right now-- you can tell if someone's thinking left, right, yes or no by picking up on their brain's unique electrical signals.<eos> But a mind like Collins' can advance that science to where a sensitive enough neurological implant can read the electrical impulses of someone close to it, even if that person doesn't have any electrodes on them.<eos> Mind reading?<eos> If Collins combines his research with mine, then can you imagine the privacy issues, the security concerns, if he has that tech?<eos> Or if he sells it to someone else.

Walter, this thing's destroyed!<eos> Bring the cable up!<eos> All right, I'm on my way.<eos> It's Collins.<eos> If you're calling to demand my research, I know you don't want it and I know you didn't hurt Toby.
Whatever I can do to help.<eos> This suit's worth $80 million.<eos> Whoever stole it is looking to get paid.<eos> Or they're looking to use it.<eos> I think we should assume they're gonna use it.
It's Savastano's.<eos> Some of you lost a brother, or a father, because of Gennaro and his guys.<eos> But that's history.<eos> The ones who treated us like slaves are now hiding in some fucking hole or hooked to a machine to stay alive.<eos> Me and Salvatore Conte made a promise and we're keeping it.

Please? If I can get used to the idea of you being with my brother, then you can get used to the idea of me being with Sam.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right, I'm sorry. And here.<eos> You're taking Emma tonight.<eos> Since I spent all day setting up a campsite, I'm actually gonna go use it.
- All right, Booms.<eos> I was gettin' to that.<eos> So, you gotta be standing by your door for their head count.<eos> You can keep you door open or shut, it's totally up to you.<eos> Yeah, but most girls keep it open, love.
Yeah, well, you can't.<eos> Brought you something.<eos> To keep your head warm.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll tie it for you.
Sure can.<eos> Hey. Where's your wedding ring?<eos> I-I don't know. Um... I had it on when I got here.<eos> You didn't put it in your locker?<eos> No, I never take it off.
He didn't take his eyes off of you.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I meant to the blanket.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Well, I'll make sure he gets it for bedtime tonight.
I'll drop her off on your lunch hour.<eos> I don't get one, okay?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> First order of business... Furniture.<eos> Apparently, this stuff belongs to the realty staging company, and they're taking it back.
Yeah, so...<eos> Listen, I...<eos> I don't think I'm really ready to smoke pot.<eos> Uh, uh, okay.<eos> The thing is we're not smoking it.
If this continues to spread, hundreds of thousands of people will starve.<eos> And you think that an animal is behind this glass?<eos> Well, it's not plant-based.<eos> And given your work connecting mutated animals to environmental events...<eos> If there is a connection, we'll find it.
This is the aquifer that runs underneath your property.<eos> It supplies water to all the farms in the county.<eos> My thought is that the snakes are shedding their toxic glass directly into your farm's water supply.<eos> What about the drinking water?<eos> The county draws it from the river, so at least we don't have to worry about - contamination.

- Fine.<eos> Can ask you for a favor?<eos> Can you record the cricket match Saturday?<eos> - Saturday there's a football match.<eos> - Can't you watch it there?
That's what I used to do as a child.<eos> Lay out my mother's clothes on her bed, in her shape, imagine she was there.<eos> It aroused me.<eos> When I was a wee bit older, 12, 13, whenever I could, I would obtain female underwear.<eos> I'd use it to masturbate.
In olden times, when wishing still did some good... ..there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful.<eos> "But the youngest was so beautiful "that the sun itself, "who indeed has seen so much,<eos> "In the vicinity of the King's castle "there was a large, dark forest "and in this forest,<eos> "In the heat of the day, "the Princess would go out into the forest "and sit on the edge of the cool well."<eos> To pass the time she would take a golden ball, throw it into the air and then catch it.

Set me free.<eos> Al! Will you help me?<eos> ! She's got superhuman strength!<eos> Take it!<eos> I'm handing it over.
Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Those guys hurt my back.<eos> There's a bag up there.<eos> Can you reach it?
It's doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.<eos> Yeah. Yes.<eos> Camping is insanity.<eos> Oh, God. I am exhausted.<eos> Look, if you're not gonna eat the rest of the thing, then I want it.
- Yeah, sure we do.<eos> - No, you own 25% and Clark Computers owns 10% for buying the mainframe.<eos> And Clark Computers, i.e., me, doesn't like the idea of blindsiding Cameron and shoving this IPO down her throat.<eos> That's... that is... Aah! ... just... a gross mischaracterization.<eos> I... Donna, if you pull this move, I guarantee you she'll see it as an act of war.
Family's more than blood.<eos> Look.<eos> Look.<eos> It's about honor.<eos> It's about reputation, and I defend it the same way anyone would feed a snake... through sacrifice.
He looks a little confused.<eos> He does, doesn't he?<eos> Let me straighten you out, in case you haven't figured out what your part in all this is.<eos> You're gonna tell us how it's getting here.<eos> You're gonna give us the name of the person who's bringing it onto the Island.
And I thought about everything.<eos> But what upset me the most... was knowing what my parents would go through if I never came back.<eos> War isn't just about the lads that go and fight.<eos> It's also about the families we leave behind.<eos> And we all go through it together. MAN: That's right.
Oh, farts.<eos> Oh, you poor little thing.<eos> Your mama's gone, but you still got us.<eos> Has Mike been around this cow?<eos> He was milking it today.
And you, my friend, are a pretty messed-up plant, that means some place inside of you is a pretty messed-up gene.<eos> Although I can't see it, I can sense it, I know it's there.<eos> I'm calling it the "ghost gene."<eos> It's a little melodramatic, don't you think?<eos> When you have your own scientific breakthrough, you feel free to call it what you want.
Huh?<eos> It's my scarf!<eos> I don't understand how you can be so mean in such a situation.<eos> It's a cashmere scarf!<eos> Make the invoice in my name, and then send it to me.
You must always remain seated.<eos> This is "Oliver Twist", a wonderful book.<eos> It's the story of a boy who...<eos> Anyway, do you see that door?<eos> You must never open it.
I made you another cake.<eos> It's a banana, fudge, cherry, berry, custard cake.<eos> With frosted vanilla icing and raisins on top.<eos> No. You're all right.<eos> You don't want it?
And it's super valuable.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Wait.<eos> Bruce, don't.<eos> If I buy it, you get paid, but we can still return it, and those men will have no reason to harm us.
Family's a bit of a sore spot with me.<eos> Trust me, I know the feeling, man.<eos> Where's this box, Pete?<eos> It's somewhere in the storage room.<eos> My son was looking for it a while back.
You won't have to.<eos> There was also non-human DNA on Boris.<eos> Swine, to be exact.<eos> A unique cross-bred for its delicious meat.<eos> And there's only one place that sells it.
♪ Got a lot of class, but we lack ♪ ♪ A lot of chemistry ♪<eos> ♪ On to the previous, bye, see ya ♪<eos> ♪ All said and done, it was a pleasure to meet ya ♪<eos> Man, we need something to make this song legendary.<eos> Like, once they hear it, they ain't gonna forget it.
No.<eos> You are not leaving this house wearing that tie again. Why?<eos> Why?<eos> What's the matter with it?<eos> Nothing's wrong with it, but you've been wearing it for three days.
What, do you want my help getting a 2,000-pound bomb past them?<eos> Not the bomb, just some of the explosive material inside.<eos> Getting past them is going to be easy.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> The Pons plan to dispose of it tomorrow.
Do you want to take your jacket?<eos> - Oh, don't you need that?<eos> - No.<eos> It's not a criminal case.<eos> - I don't really want it.
- No. She just boxed up her murder board and walked away.<eos> Do you think she destroyed it?<eos> The box?<eos> Not Helen.<eos> I'm sure she keeps it stored away somewhere and only brings it out when she wants to punish herself.
- Oh, thank you. - Mm-hmm.<eos> FYI? The "here" your best thinking got you to is this bar, richer than you were a few hours ago by $100,000.<eos> I'm gonna buy that bottle.<eos> Don't buy it.<eos> If you really want it, we can steal it.
Is this, um... Is this really necessary?<eos> Last time we didn't incinerate a tablet prototype, you could buy one in Shanghai the following spring.<eos> That's two down, Dr Morrow.<eos> You bring me a finished cake and then you ask me to figure out the recipe.<eos> Now you don't want me to slice it? OK.
Yes!<eos> It just needed a new switch.<eos> And he built a firepit in the backyard.<eos> - I dug a hole and put some bricks around it.<eos> Course, the Secret Service won't let us use it. Aw...
That wasn't me, I promise.<eos> Right.<eos> Tutankhamen, give me the bleeding card back.<eos> I don't know where it is.<eos> I haven't seen it since I gave it to...
- About killing all those people inside the safe zone.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He was Secretary of HUD.<eos> He set up the quarantine.<eos> Except he broke it.
"Really, nigga?" - You actually said that?<eos> - Yeah, man, I had to.<eos> Cool. You know that song "Paper Boy"?<eos> Yeah, "Paper Boy" by Paper Boy.<eos> Yeah, I've heard it. Shit's fine. Dude, the streets love it.
Bess... who carries a terrible burden of guilt for failing her own son.<eos> You can free her from that.<eos> Can you do it?<eos> Brandon Peters did not kill Alyssa Yang.<eos> People know the truth when they hear it.
He was sitting up the hill a bit.<eos> Soon as she left, he up and tailed her.<eos> Local cop has her pegged for a Commie.<eos> Is she?<eos> You reckon you'd know that car if you saw it again?
And in doing so, they've taken us into a world that is utterly unlike our own.<eos> However astonishing these images look, they are all real.<eos> With help from new cameras, one designed just for this film, we can reveal this extraordinary phenomenon as it has never been seen before.<eos> Bioluminescence holds many mysteries.<eos> But we do know that fireflies use it to attract the opposite sex.
The cool, blue light produced in each larva's tail is the lure.<eos> Other insects that hatch and emerge in the cave instinctively fly upwards to the sky.<eos> But this is not a starlit sky.<eos> It's a deathtrap.<eos> Bioluminescence is clearly a powerful tool to these life forms that possess it.
Okay, ginger snaps.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> This'll do.<eos> He's gonna be right behind this door when I close it, isn't he?
Yes.<eos> You've been taking 5.000 euros a month for three years.<eos> Why, do you think, I gave you that money?<eos> To be the first to know the others' bids.<eos> This contract must be mine, I can't lose it because you fucked up.
Nothing to suggest he won't make a full recovery.<eos> There's also nothing to suggest he will.<eos> Dr. Latham.<eos> I realize, like every doctor who teaches here, you have your own methods.<eos> But, I assume, if I have an opinion, you'd like to hear it.
I've got to action all of these memos before today's budget meeting.<eos> Very much looking forward to touching base in April, though.<eos> Oh, no, no. This isn't chit-chat, this is work.<eos> I've got a work memo for you.<eos> Ah, OK, what am I filing it under?
[LAUGHTER AND JEERING]<eos> Bear with me, bear with me-<eos> - I agree!<eos> - [LAUGHTER]<eos> The thing is, though, various supercar makers have now taken the polar-bear-friendly technology from a Prius, and they are now using it to create raw, naked speed.
Salvatore, we can't survive like this.<eos> He's right, I'm killin' myself to pay you.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> If this is a democratic alliance, we should all buy the stuff together, at the same price.<eos> Now we get it from you, and you pay less, so you earn twice:
with us and your spots!<eos> Who's forcing you to buy from me?<eos> I'm not Savastano.<eos> Buy where you like.<eos> Let's just see if you can find it for less! But that's not the point.
We'll cut out the middleman.<eos> We'll rent her out to the miners.<eos> When they're done with her, we'll sell her organs to the harvesters, her flesh to the meat traders, and I want whatever's left over.<eos> I'm gonna make a jacket out of her skin.<eos> I am gonna stuff and mount her face and put it on the wall.
I know, I know.<eos> My damn hands.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Did you ask your doctor if he could get you pot?<eos> Yes, I did, but he said he couldn't prescribe it to me, only to cancer patients.
- Aren't we all?<eos> You know in the alternate reality it was the destruction of Eos 7 that started the war.<eos> And you think the same thing will happen here?<eos> We think Ferrous smuggled a bomb on board.<eos> Three and Six are searching for it now.
Demons are... metaphors.<eos> Do you think I don't know that?<eos> Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to sit here and sound like this?<eos> But I am telling you, something is going on.<eos> There is a presence, and I feel it.
They're just doing their jobs.<eos> - Okay, well, I'm just gonna play some "Portal" and wait for her to text back.<eos> - Get the crystals out of the garage and sort them.<eos> A week at home on suspension.<eos> You're not gonna spend it on your computer.
We're just putting a Band-Aid over a hatchet wound.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> When we met, you were sunshine and bubble baths.<eos> We found a cure once and we'll find it again.
They're working as fast as they can.<eos> How are you?<eos> I feel like, uh... there's a dam inside me about to crack wide open... and there's nothing I can do to stop it.<eos> Mitch, your father, and the Shepherds... they're working on a solution.<eos> I don't know, Abe. Even if they do figure it out, there's no guarantee that the serum will work.
I just want to do...<eos> If I can just do one thing, one... great thing for her before I die...<eos> Maybe... Maybe make the last thing I do in this world saving her life...<eos> You made the right call in New Brunswick.<eos> I need you to make it again.
No, no, I was trying to save you!<eos> I'm trying to save you right now.<eos> This ship is in danger.<eos> There is a bomb.<eos> And we're trying to find it.
If we need you, we'll call you.<eos> - Wait. - Need us?<eos> Nothing has changed.<eos> Flynn is still out there. He still has the mother ship. And you are still our best option.<eos> When he uses it again, we will call you.
He just thinks it's a joke.<eos> I'm pretty sure he doesn't think it's a joke.<eos> Look, I know all the arguments.<eos> There's no money in music.<eos> One in a million make it.
But I'm here now.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Everything.<eos> Everything's fucking wrong.<eos> Look around at the house. Might be the last time that you see it.
My friend Amber's mom took us downtown to go shopping at Christmastime, and we were in this crappy little store when I saw that rhinestone brooch.<eos> I just had to get it for my mom.<eos> I really thought it would make her happy.<eos> The part she's not telling that lady is that the brooch cost $16 and I didn't have enough money.<eos> So when nobody was looking, I put it in my pocket.
Well, who am I leaving it to?<eos> Got no kids.<eos> What I do have is a bank account full of cash and a new 65-inch TV!<eos> I'm gonna make some popcorn.<eos> Where you want it?
I spent a lot of time here.<eos> It's actually a historic landmark, built in the 1880s for an inventor named Zackariah Webb.<eos> But he disappeared, so the place fell into disrepair.<eos> By the '70s, squatters were living here.<eos> But Patrick bought it back from the government in the mid-'90s, just before what happened to his wife.
Hey.<eos> C-Couldn't find my jacket. That's what took so long.<eos> I was telling Dirk, 1978, height of the oil crisis, right?<eos> Edgar Spring, Patrick's father, buried his own power grid.<eos> Three-mile radius, calls it Springsborough, and...
Don't worry.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I have a theory.<eos> I have a theory, and I don't like it at all, but it's... it's my theory right now, and right now that's all I got.<eos> So, uh... I'm gonna explain it to you, and... if you understand it, I mean, if you follow it all the way through, you gotta tell me, you gotta help me, and you gotta confirm or deny whether it's accurate, 'cause... right now I feel like I'm losing my mind a little.
Oh, that's funny.<eos> Should I tweet that?<eos> Let's just get back to Ping-Pong.<eos> How do I hold the paddle?<eos> Do I hold it like this or like this?
Ca-caw! - Okay, I'm done.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm out, too. - What?<eos> Wait, you can't leave. The game's not even in its last part.<eos> Uh, we'll just listen to it on the radio in the car... or anywhere else.
He took gum, and he was putting it over it.<eos> And I literally pulled him into our polishing room, like... "Show me your tongue," which, you know, sounds...<eos> And he was like, "No! Dude, why am I showing you my tongue?" You know?<eos> I was like, "Let me see your tongue."<eos> He showed it to me and I was like, "Jesus Christ, like... You gotta go to a doctor. Skip the dentist.
The idea of a product being able to showcase the terroir, which is the union between the land and the people...<eos> If we are able to do that with food, I think it's a pretty cool idea.<eos> And we aspire to do that.<eos> Agave plants take about 12 to 15 years to mature.<eos> At that point you can cut the plant, process it and bring it here to transform it into mezcal.
That sauce evolves and it's this living thing.<eos> When I was in, uh, Mexico City, I think it had been going for 453 days.<eos> He said there's probably a hundred ingredients in there.<eos> It's a very, very complex sauce, much more complex than any classical French sauce you could name.<eos> And he serves it on a plate in a perfect circle.
So then we fell in the pool and then woke up here. I remember now.<eos> We must've teleported.<eos> That's why our memories are fritzed.<eos> Tyson, goggles.<eos> If there's a door in here, we'd find it eventually, right? Let's see how we do it.
I heard you can get chlamydia in your eye.<eos> - I don't want to..<eos> - Oh, I get it.<eos> I don't want to have chlamydia in my mouth.<eos> Tell me if you get it, so we don't spread it.
And I will help you try.<eos> Oh, wow, man, I swear I won't let you down.<eos> Hi there.<eos> I've collected the worst-smelling garbage that I could find.<eos> Do you still want me to dump it inside of Antonio's house?
My sister would freak.<eos> So would Molly's family.<eos> I went to her old storage unit today to find her necklace, but her brother showed up and he took it from me.<eos> Better he have it than the coppers.<eos> Maybe I should let the police find it though.
Yeah, well he should be.<eos> Grace, before I met you, no one had ever looked at my art.<eos> Had ever looked at me as if I mattered.<eos> I love you, baby, and I will do whatever it takes to make you trust me again.<eos> I've been working on a surprise for you. But you can only get it if you come to the show tomorrow.
Put your weapons on the floor.<eos> We're... we're leaving the store.<eos> You can have the whole thing to yourself.<eos> We only want the tetracycline.<eos> We'll split it with you.
♪ You're never gonna get my love... ♪<eos> It's nice in here. You've done it well.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mum used to have a lamp just like that. - Uh-huh? - Yeah.<eos> Except the dog ran through the house one day and smashed it.
Oh, my God.<eos> That's land! No.<eos> I-I don't see any land.<eos> - There's... right there!<eos> - Nope. - I don't see it.
I know the caves.<eos> You and me?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Keep the mask on. - No.<eos> Don't. There's no ash coming in here, and I may die if I keep it on.
Oh, my girl. I'm so sorry.<eos> - How's it looking?<eos> - No ash. Wind must have blown it north of here.<eos> So then the farm's not wrecked?<eos> - We get it back?
And that's where leadership has to merge against all these odds.<eos> "Yes we can, we will, we must."<eos> I know what many of you think of this fight. This war.<eos> I do not want war.<eos> I do not crave it, but we need war.
Pot roast is wonderful.<eos> Is there anything I can bring?<eos> No, just yourself.<eos> See you then.<eos> Mutual assured destruction is what McNarmara calls it.
Dana has an update on SBK's bones.<eos> Great.<eos> Right behind you.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - All right, look, how 'bout I write her a letter, and you can decide if she gets it or not.
All right, what do we do now?<eos> I'm gonna go freshen up.<eos> Does your phone work?<eos> No.<eos> I have a gun, if you want it.
That sounds nice.<eos> Do you miss the farm?<eos> I think about it, I suppose.<eos> My dreams.<eos> And Brianna loved it.
You're gonna be fine, josh.<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it, baby.<eos> You're gonna take it and you're gonna swallow it.
I got an emergency stash there.<eos> We got to go there now.<eos> Quantrell told us you have an operation up there. You call it the "Alamo"?<eos> Yeah. Not my name, but it stuck.<eos> Been planning it for years.
I should just drink it off at Moe's.<eos> You'll never hear the name Julia again.<eos> - Hi, I'm Julia.<eos> - Neh! I just wanted to introduce myself and tell you you've got a great husband.<eos> I've got a nice bicycle, too, but I keep a lock on it.
Oh, carry on.<eos> What do you mean, there's a legal issue with my trapdoor?<eos> And, uh, as you explain, please take two steps back.<eos> The old trapdoor was perfectly legal. It was grandfathered in under the Reagan-era code.<eos> But once you start renovating it, it has to brought up to modern standards.
Because I just ate several pies.<eos> Hello, Mr. Smithers.<eos> I see you haven't given up.<eos> Just enjoy the cake.<eos> As long as you don't eat it in front of a notary public, you're fine.
It's-it's uh-- it's red, but not, uh, too red.<eos> You're right!<eos> Why don't you stick around and we'll discuss stitching patterns over tea?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> And I'll take the cake back to the home and share it with the seniors.
- I love Adele.<eos> - I know.<eos> She is amazing.<eos> All right, I got this thing.<eos> I'm calling it the Alpha Adele Arena Night.
Well, it wasn't really about us.<eos> Nope, it's about Micki.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But, I mean, like any song, everyone interprets it their own way.
It's a bill... that the previous government attempted to push through Parliament.<eos> It recommends placing all our intelligence agencies, border services, port police, airport security, and perhaps even prisons, all under one command.<eos> One big circus tent.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It died when they lost the election, but now the same clowns are resurrecting it.
Well, I-I thought I lost this necklace, and then I see it on the neck of J.P.'s new wife.<eos> - Yeah. - Whoa.<eos> That asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman.<eos> Right?<eos> So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.
So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.<eos> You stole it right off of his wife's neck.<eos> No, I didn't steal it.<eos> It's mine.<eos> - I just took it back.
I'm Madison Gray.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I don't know about this.<eos> I haven't been on a board in over ten years.<eos> You made a promise and I'm holding you to it.
Us.<eos> We do it. How much do they pay for a beer now?<eos> What, like a nickel.<eos> Triple that.<eos> When it's against the law, they're gonna pay more for it.
You have less than 30 minutes.<eos> After that, the virus will have progressed too far to be reversed.<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> Remember, she is just a machine.<eos> If any other part of the ship were facing a critical malfunction, you would shut it down without hesitation.
Cratered and dead.<eos> It may just be that life is more unique than many have thought.<eos> That was kind of a crushing disappointment to a lot of people who just assumed there would be something there, anything there.<eos> But, we haven't abandoned the idea that there's life there.<eos> There's almost a religious belief that we will find it eventually if we just keep looking, and it's based upon faith and not knowledge, in the same way religion is based upon faith and not knowledge.
Oh, my God.<eos> Wait. Did he, did he name the bank?<eos> Yeah, Mutual Bank.<eos> Well... I'm just spitballing' with my Ivy League brain over here.<eos> But nobody says they found the perfect bank unless they're robbing it...
In this time of strife,<eos> Howell and his cohorts are using fear tactics to manipulate you, the electorate.<eos> You, Sir, are an unelected bureaucrat.<eos> And this is a prime example of government overreach. Okay?<eos> I say if the people want their water, let them have it.
I suppose if I asked you who he paid, you'd have the same answer.<eos> I find out you're lying, next time, you are gonna be the one in solitary, and it won't be just one night.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm just thinking about when this asshole finds out you're gonna blow his bullshit suspension out of the water.<eos> William, I am gonna blow it out of the water, but I'm gonna need you to sign this first.
Your Honor, I'm simply requesting Mr. Sutter hand over...<eos> Something he has not right to.<eos> I have every right to make sure that your client is operating within the law.<eos> And what exactly is your basis to say that he isn't?<eos> Your Honor, when you break the home run record, and someone says, "Your bat is corked," you turn it over to show it's not.
Oh, you're getting fast there.<eos> Don't tell me, sing me!<eos> You rascal!<eos> Can I ever tell you a story without working in a song again?<eos> I'm playing it by ear.
Follow as far as we can without getting burned.<eos> And that's the rule... Never get burned.<eos> If we lose him, come back the next day, pick him up right where were we lost him.<eos> Then we're back to our map, and we're marking our route.<eos> Over time, we know where he lives and where he goes, and we've got a formula, and you're sticking to it.
If the Coast Guard rolls up, dump the bag, come back later that night, press a button, and boom... floats to the surface.<eos> Then from Canada, they head here, south of Mackinaw City, Michigan.<eos> They stop to refuel at Rowley's Bay.<eos> Then down into Chicago.<eos> Where Scoot gives the drugs to Red and several other scumbag dealers, and they sell it to kids on the street.
Can I have it?<eos> No.<eos> Did you take the sculpture?<eos> No.<eos> If I sell it I take 10%, deal?
Huh!<eos> I think the power couple's losin' their spark.<eos> Hmm. Who's next?<eos> Ha ha-a-a! Pearl, I don't recall asking you to bring me a spear.<eos> Uhh! You won't like how I give it to you.
! Don't act surprised, Rose Quartz!<eos> You shattered a Diamond!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Ooh, I'm gonna get ya!<eos> I'm gonna take your gem and bring it back!
I was just sitting here, I swear to God.<eos> - Open up.<eos> - ‭What?<eos> My boys need teeth.<eos> You can open your mouth, or I can open it for you.
Gets me into Stanford or Berkeley.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But will it make you happy?<eos> Look at Tio.<eos> He's got all those degrees, bought this sweet car, never has time to enjoy it.
He wouldn't tell me the contents of the box.<eos> He ordered me to wait for the delivery instructions.<eos> I had to get it back.<eos> Torres had many warehouses, many offices.<eos> It took a week to find out where he kept it.
Uh, Chinese characters.<eos> They say, "Receive the Mandate of Heaven, and with it longevity and prosperity."<eos> So, assuming he had his hands on the genuine article, Rey was right:<eos> the green rock was worth a fortune.<eos> In fact, the Chinese emperor once traded it for 15 cities.
There it is.<eos> It has great meaning to me.<eos> And now it belongs to me.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I'm taking it, and you're letting me because that's how our deal works.
- Hypervigilance?<eos> - I saw a sniper on the overpass.<eos> IEDs in the trash? Yes!<eos> Roadside trash is the worst.<eos> Why can't they just throw it away?
Shouldn't you be trying to shoot down Snoopy?<eos> I went a little crazy with the purge.<eos> Got rid of all my outerwear and my underwear.<eos> I'm currently wearing one of Edgar's bathing suits.<eos> Jimmy, I've thought about your pros and cons list, and I think it's only fair that you show it to me.
Call me.]<eos> Isak!<eos> Hey, he's awake.<eos> With morning wood straight up. Look!<eos> Devil's cave is what I call it.
- Smells good, honey.<eos> - I like that bracelet.<eos> Two.<eos> What happened to your shirt?<eos> I'm gonna put it away for tonight.
If only I was 30 years younger.<eos> I need a minute of your time, that's all.<eos> I'm clocking you.<eos> Are you investigating the Quiller Commission report?<eos> No. I'm not familiar with it.
Still don't know how you convinced Ganz to let us rent his boat.<eos> Kind of agreed to be his inside guy at Cornell.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - It's cool. I told him I'd only deal weed.<eos> I don't like to think of it as selling an illegal substance so much
Well, unfortunately, you don't have clearance for more than that.<eos> Sir, every moment that passes without finding Nassar is a moment for the American people to doubt your mettle for this job.<eos> I think this is when you offer me your full support.<eos> Your boyish sincerity is your best quality, sir.<eos> I hope you don't lose it.
This is making me depressed-o.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Pick up.<eos> Salad with a rabbit on it.<eos> He just can't serve a salad without a hare in it.
Hi, Monroe.<eos> Tell me, Red, what do you notice about your Sheba head?<eos> That it's sitting on someone else's set.<eos> No.<eos> It's sitting on someone else's finished set, whereas your Sheba head isn't really a head at all, which is why I'm sending it back to the mill.
But then they...<eos> I can't make that movie.<eos> I can't even say the word "Nazi" in a movie anymore.<eos> But don't you see?<eos> You wouldn't be saying it at all.
And what's that?<eos> Monroe.<eos> He just hired me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I pitched him a story. He wants me to produce it.
Although I did pass a dutchie once in college, but it was to the right-hand side, and everybody got very quiet and then asked me to leave.<eos> Oh, well, perhaps we can get you an edible.<eos> An edible?<eos> It's where we bake the weed into the pastry so you don't have to smoke it.<eos> We bake it into all of our goods here.
But more than anyone else, the person I miss is.<eos> Mr. Jack Walser, he was the superintendent of the building where we lived, before the Lord called me to Him.<eos> He had divided the tenants into two categories, the "natives" and the "nomads".<eos> One day, Jack rang our door bell at ten in the morning, confident that Lucy and I would be at school, but that day we were in bed sick with a fever, happy to be safe at home.<eos> Through the bedroom door I saw my mother offer him a cup of coffee, which Jack drank it standing up, because he didn't want to get the chair wet with his rain-drenched clothes.
It's funny. We've traced license plates, phone calls, but we've never traced blood before.<eos> It's surprisingly easy when you know what animal it came from.<eos> What is she talking about?<eos> Doug suffered from New Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.<eos> It had been eating away at his brain for the last nine months. You might know it as mad cow.
Look, we can't end this mission just because you found this bug in Alex's room.<eos> Yes, it's CIA.<eos> No, I can't trace it.<eos> But, for all we know, it could be Owen Hall on behalf of a faction.<eos> We're not calling it a faction anymore, sir.
I want to win on the taste, not sympathy.<eos> Bamboo shoots have the same mouthfeel as mushrooms.<eos> Thanks, Antonia.<eos> Hey, there's the box with the wreaths.<eos> Why don't you hand that to me, and I'll... put it on the pile going outside.
Come to think of it, that was Bill Maher.<eos> Hey, look, it's Saddington Bear.<eos> Oof, unlike torrential rain, this jacket does not repel insults.<eos> I have to go check the drains.<eos> Oh, if you find my love life down there, bring it back to me.
This link is open day or night any time you want to see Agnes.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> What do you mean, you don't want to trace the link?<eos> You don't think he's thought of that?<eos> The second he discovers we traced it, he'll take it away, take her away.
But you're not, though, okay?<eos> Ah, the look.<eos> Every mom gets it.<eos> Doris is imagining choking Oliver to death with her bare hands.<eos> Now she's remembering jail is a thing, so she shoves the rage down and saves it for when someone thinks she's Japanese.
Please don't tell her.<eos> I'll do anything, I swear.<eos> Aloha?<eos> Okay, listen up.<eos> You are gonna get your pot out of the house... All of it this time. Then you're gonna put it in a lock box with a combination, and then you're gonna send me a picture of that box.
Yeah, you wearing sweat pants?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> [laughs]<eos> Yes, I am. I, um, had some hot cocoa this morning, and I totally biffed it.
Where is Mom?<eos> The sanitarium.<eos> The sanitarium?<eos> ! Yeah. I told her I was leaving her, and she freaked out for no reason.<eos> And I'll tell you, I don't know why they call it a "sanitarium."
Hey, what the hell's going on?<eos> Oh, Santa. I-I'm sorry. I didn't realize this was your car.<eos> That's right. Now, crumple up that ticket.<eos> Now eat it!<eos> All right, now we're gonna go to your home and wait for you to pass it, and then you're gonna eat it again.
Well, he's been racing his whole life. All the way back to go-carts.<eos> He was gonna turn pro after his discharge.<eos> Possible it was mechanical failure?<eos> No, no, no, we built that car ourselves.<eos> Check it out head to toe every time we took it out.
Comin' through!<eos> Weller, Jane, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, we're good.<eos> One suspect down.<eos> Secure that bomb before the other one sets it off.
Keep trying to reach him.<eos> We gotta find him before Elizabeth does and we got another dead body on our hands.<eos> FBI!<eos> Put your weapon down.<eos> Put it down!
Put your weapon down.<eos> Put it down!<eos> Completely surrounded.<eos> And no other options.<eos> Put it down.
Hey, Jack!<eos> You got a minute?<eos> Yeah, Lee.<eos> Hey. I just took the stove to the Lawsons' place.<eos> Uh, some of the ladies are cleaning it up now.
You know that broach I sold?<eos> My father gave that to my mother because he loved her.<eos> She treasured it because it was from him.<eos> After she died, you know what he did?<eos> He gave it to Regina because he loved her, too.
- Yeah.<eos> Okay, on it.<eos> At this point, it could be anywhere.<eos> Hot sauce is a precious commodity, Linda.<eos> You can put it on anything.
In fact, you know what?<eos> You're wearing it today.<eos> - Give me that. Here.<eos> - Dad, come on.<eos> You know, he's just gonna take it off when he gets to school.
You know, he's just gonna take it off when he gets to school.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Don't do that, Alangulon.<eos> No, uh, t-t-that thing is enchanted, okay?<eos> If you take it off, you'll turn to stone.
Well, I guess we've both got some reconciling to do.<eos> Are you doing the dance of reconciliation!<eos> Oh, no, not quite.<eos> No, that's-that's actually the dance of perpetual virginity.<eos> But you are nailing it, son!
Yeah.<eos> What about bank accounts?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So with the help of your computer geek, Larsen, you could transfer money out of those accounts as easily as pulling cash out of an ATM.<eos> And don't tell me the cash was used to fund NSA investigations, 'cause that balloon is gonna pop before you even start to blow it up.
No. Our father's watch is missing.<eos> It's a Piaget.<eos> His black leather jacket isn't here either.<eos> He loved it.<eos> He would never let me borrow it.
Where does he practice?<eos> In the heart of such performers as Sandra Bullock, Tom Cruise, and James Franco.<eos> All of whom have used his techniques to get underneath emotions.<eos> I'll say a phrase, let's say, ""You're an alcoholic""<eos> and then you'll repeat it, but with "I".
- No.<eos> What do the red blood cells look like?<eos> Red blood cells are exploding.<eos> - Schistocytes.<eos> - We know she's got hemolytic anemia. What we don't know is what's causing it.
Ooh! What if we send this story to Mr. King?<eos> Maybe he could get it published.<eos> I-I would love that, but it's just a first draft.<eos> If he's gonna read it, it has to be perfect.<eos> You keep working on it, and we'll keep it under wraps until then.
Only-only 'cause I know you're not a deceitful person, so, logically... you lied, then something's bothering you and... that bothers me.<eos> My dad was a good man, um, but my mom... had some trouble.<eos> When she, um, left him, it... he was crushed.<eos> She was the love of his life.<eos> So, for Halloween, he'd buy a gross bag of no-name candy from the dollar store and leave it in a basket and turn off all the house lights, and so he'd... no one would think we were home.
Yeah, your doc confirms that he was poisoned to death.<eos> Are we sure the explosive was his?<eos> We are now.<eos> A base surveillance camera shows him assembling a bomb in his car.<eos> Bomb squad's sending it to Abby.
Well, roll the tape.<eos> This is it, 200 years old and built from beautiful Cotswold stone.<eos> Now, I want to make it absolutely clear that this is Jeremy Clarkson's actual house.<eos> Yeah, it really is. I'd swear to my children's lives on that.<eos> It's Jeremy's house. He bought it when he fell in love with the view.
What smoke?<eos> That massive ball of smoke in front of us, up front.<eos> I can't see it.<eos> My hay fever's really bad.<eos> No, you can't see it because you're trying to looking at it through a cow's butt hole.
Extracted Re-Synced By Farshid ACE<eos> S01E07 the beach (buggy) boys - part 1 12/30/2016<eos> Hello and welcome to a Grand Tour special, which begins with this the Volkswagen Beetle.<eos> It's a car we hate very much because it appeals only to Nazis and hippies, and we are neither of those things.<eos> However, if you remove the bodywork and replace it with something a bit more fun - something like this... You end up with a beach buggy, and that's brilliant.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> What about that room?<eos> - That's the red room.<eos> - The red room?<eos> That's what the docs call it.
I chased them off. It happened.<eos> And the traveler was so grateful, he wanted to repay me.<eos> You know, he-he didn't have much, so he reaches into his little satchel and he pulls out this shirt.<eos> He says to me that it's a magic T-shirt.<eos> He said, that when you wear it, your enemies will see you exactly as you want to be seen, and only that way.
All right.<eos> Road trip... to get intimately acquainted with Coach Bud Erens.<eos> Could be the key to why Marchand went UA.<eos> The history of sauce has always been rife with intrigue. You know?<eos> Ever since the first man mixed ketchup and mayonnaise, added relish and called it "secret."

You know?<eos> Ever since the first man mixed ketchup and mayonnaise, added relish and called it "secret."<eos> Some people actually call it Thousand Island dressing.
Never better.<eos> I decided to take your sister's advice, and pick up some extra shifts.<eos> Every shift, in fact.<eos> I haven't left the store.<eos> I even slept in the hot tub. Till Barry sold it.
I love these people.<eos> I don't have the heart to mercy them.<eos> We've all had people that we love turn.<eos> Mercy is better.<eos> That's why they call it mercy.
I noticed.<eos> Maybe Dr. DeLuca... No.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> This artery that will allow this woman to survive.<eos> I'm not putting it in the hands of a first-year intern who hasn't taken out a tonsil.
- Scissors.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> Total hepatic vascular isolation.<eos> We're gonna completely stop the blood supply to the liver, find the source of the bleeding, and then we'll repair it.
I was gonna sneak the plaque out without anybody knowing, But then i thought... So much more fun to make you watch.<eos> Now enjoy As i steal the plaque of destiny.<eos> Ah, trying to pick the lock, elcapitán?<eos> That'll take at least three minutes,<eos> By which time i will have hidden this plaque Somewhere you will never find it.
We don't keep drugs in the office.<eos> If I want narcotics, Doctor, I'll call the guy with the briefcase like everybody else.<eos> I'm looking for Dr. Adrian Shaw.<eos> Units are rolling to Rayburn's clinic now.<eos> Who owns it?
And through all the digging and the dust and the death, we never found a single soul.<eos> And I felt like I failed them.<eos> Firefighters don't fail people.<eos> A hole formed inside of me.<eos> Hope is hard to find when you lock it out of your mind.
Oh, shoot.<eos> Mike and I were saying how great it would have been if you could have joined us for dinner this year.<eos> Oh! That's so nice, but we're already committed.<eos> Axl's making a salad.<eos> You mean you're making a salad, dropping it off at her house, and then coming back to our house?
Rags just sitting there, talking to her imaginary friend.<eos> Someone... something... called Captain Howdy.<eos> Damn game.<eos> Dealing with those kinds of forces...<eos> Anyway, she loved it.
Chutes, actually.<eos> Police found three more base jumping parachutes in the storage shed in your backyard.<eos> All sabotaged as well.<eos> Who had access to that shed?<eos> Bennett always left it unlocked.
- Nothing yet.<eos> Want to take a closer look?<eos> Sure.<eos> You really think the perp ditched the murder weapon downstairs?<eos> Eh, 20 bucks says we find it in some bushes down the street.
Winning the war is bigger than any one soldier.<eos> I wasn't on shift the night of. But I saw a guy sitting in a car outside the vic's house that morning.<eos> Black guy, short hair.<eos> - You get a plate?<eos> - Yeah, I wrote it down.
Gustus always saved me.<eos> Did you catch scarlet fever as a boy?<eos> - I did.<eos> - So did I. Caitlin too.<eos> Now what that means is that once caught, we cannot catch it again.
There is no Mrs. Batman.<eos> Have you seen the Batcave?<eos> Only a woman could've put that together.<eos> Look, this Thanksgiving party is just too much work.<eos> I mean, when I did it in the past, it took weeks of planning.
-A romantic reunion? -No.<eos> -No?<eos> -No.<eos> He give you that necklace?<eos> If you're not a romantic, why do you wear it?
If she is with the Cause, I hope she's dead.<eos> I don't get those people.<eos> -They're a bunch of fuckers.<eos> -They're ungrateful.<eos> The Offshore offers salvation for everyone and they despise it.
Besides... I'm not drinking alone now, am I?<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Now I just got one more question.<eos> You gonna finish that steak?<eos> Damn right I'm gonna finish it.
Yeah, they must've not finished it before the virus hit.<eos> Yeah, but what they did finish is frigging awesome. Yeah.<eos> I can't believe there's a working toilet, guys.<eos> That must a gray water system.<eos> A holding tank collects rainwater, then pumps it down to the toilets.
Didn't want anyone figuring out his special recipe. Right.<eos> You mean he made that food himself?<eos> Last night.<eos> He'd usually make a batch after we'd close.<eos> Store it in the prep fridge.
And a footprint.<eos> It's faint, but pretty clean.<eos> Find out who that belongs to.<eos> There's a security camera, but it's pointed at the register.<eos> It's out of the range of the body, but I'm sure if we looked at it, we'll find something on the footage.
Oh my God!<eos> Really?<eos> That's amazing!<eos> What's his invention?<eos> He calls it The Hot Legs Duvet.
Classic tell of a discount purchase.<eos> Oliver, it is not a big deal.<eos> Honestly, without any drama, for real, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone.<eos> Okay, well, guess what.<eos> I bought you the [bleep] shirt so you're going to wear it!
But one thing we learn on the farm is that death is a part of life.<eos> If you tell Joe what happened to that goat, death is gonna be part of your life.<eos> You know what, kids can handle a lot more than you think.<eos> And every step, from birth till the end, has its own magical beauty.<eos> So, do we jam the goat in the garbage or heave it over the fence?
You know, if he moves across the hall for good,<eos> Leonard could keep the stuff you don't like in Sheldon's old room.<eos> Solves everything.<eos> That's a great idea!<eos> Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.
And, Nick, have you met Jordan?<eos> She plays golf, and is what kids will someday call a "DUFF."<eos> Hey, yeah.<eos> Nice tam-o'-shanter.<eos> I'll drink your finger bowl if you don't want it.
Get those trucks on standby and some ice cream.<eos> The ground is coming up really fast, Pop-Pop.<eos> Which is good.<eos> That's where we want to be, right?<eos> Hey, let's make sure that seatbelt is nice and snug, but not too snug, so you can loosen it in case we catch on fire.
You did.<eos> I received a promotion today.<eos> It's everything I've ever dreamed about.<eos> That's... that's great.<eos> But the whole time the bishop was offering it to me, all I could think was...
For a beetle no larger than a thumbnail, this is the equivalent of us climbing a dune twice the height of Everest.<eos> But even more impressive is what it does next.<eos> Standing perfectly still, facing into the wind, the beetle does a headstand.<eos> Fog begins to condense on its body.<eos> Microscopic bumps on its wing cases direct the water to grooves that channel it towards the mouth.
Oh... no, no, it's... it's fine.<eos> It's... it's my fault.<eos> I must have gotten so tipsy on Halloween, I forgot to write down my own name.<eos> See? It's right there in the song.<eos> He makes a list, he checks it twice.
So, I examined Captain Green's computer.<eos> He had an account with a ridesharing service called homestretch.<eos> But they have no record of a pickup request the night of the murder.<eos> Well, someone picked him up.<eos> Yeah, it looks like his account was infected with a worm that intercepted the request and then sent it to a third party.
Kissed her for the first time under that tree.<eos> God.<eos> That must have been something.<eos> Well, I got down on a knee. I pulled the ring box out.<eos> Only thing was, I opened it up upside down.
Oh, yeah. That funky Dixieland song.<eos> Yes.<eos> Was that song significant in some way?<eos> Uh, yes, Allison.<eos> They sang it on Thanksgiving. Keep up.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear a word you just said.<eos> That stain on your pants looks exactly like Bryan Cranston.<eos> - That's who it is.<eos> - Ooh, that's right.<eos> Yeah, been staring at it for an hour. - That's it.
It's not a radical position, but I have a feeling a man of your intelligence has an interesting take on the subject.<eos> What is your point?<eos> Let me do the interview...<eos> One hour.<eos> You can say whatever you want, and I will broadcast it on "LHL," which airs in 130 countries.
Which one of you threw the gun?<eos> Me.<eos> Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.<eos> He said If I was gonna roll with SBK, I had to be strapped up.<eos> So I took it to Whitlock, and I told him I didn't want it.
Corona General Hospital in Queens.<eos> Thank you very much. Mm-hmm.<eos> Sometimes I wonder what hobbies other people's roommates have.<eos> I briefly shared a flat in London with a collector of wild game urine.<eos> He used it as a lure for hunting and trapping.
So, how 'bout you tell us the truth?<eos> And we'll all just agree that you've suffered enough.<eos> It was a silver Lexus.<eos> It just pulled out of a parking lot and up to a light;<eos> there was a guy and a girl in the car. I pulled the driver's door open, I shouted for them to get out, but then the guy yanked it closed again.
She doesn't want to take...<eos> It's okay, I'll see her.<eos> Oh, Damona.<eos> The holiday party's back on.<eos> Ken and I are gonna host it.
- It will only work once.<eos> So, please use extreme caution.<eos> You won't get a second chance. Noted.<eos> Cassandra, what you got?<eos> I got an idea, but you're gonna hate it.
He's on his way here right now.<eos> Wow. So you actually did it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the hardest part's still to come.<eos> Well, you'll get through it.
I've had a taste of flying.<eos> Now for the real challenge.<eos> To freedom!<eos> To rebuild that freedom balloon using the exact same specs and materials as the original.<eos> This is the actual balloon, and what's even better is I have one of the guys who made it on the line.
A little bit of both.<eos> He was crazy in the sense that the idea was to put a pigeon into a missile so that it can guide it to a ship and blow it up.<eos> Putting a pigeon in a bomb is definitely nuts, not to mention immoral.<eos> But in theory, it might have worked.<eos> One pigeon pecks the ball as it comes toward him and knocks it toward the other.
-Is that thing for real?<eos> - You've never heard of the Dale? - No.<eos> I know a lemon when I see one, though.<eos> All right, the Dale was the most talked about car of its era.<eos> If this was such a big hit, how come we haven't heard of it?
I'm sure you see a lot of printers in your daily life.<eos> Have you witnessed printer rage?<eos> Oh, yes. Absolutely.<eos> You walk in, and they're smacking their printer, kicking it, cursing at it.<eos> They physically pick it up, smash it.
But a master predator is on the prowl.<eos> The creature's mortal enemy.<eos> Armed with a sticky web, she tempts it closer.<eos> Stunned and ensnared, the creature is helpless.<eos> She will take it back to her nest... and put it in the bin.
-I can hear it through here?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I hear it.<eos> It's a sine wave.<eos> Combining those tones with a keyboard, the Telharmonium could synthesize music and play it through the phone.
Driving the original Torpedo was a two-man job, but I doubt anyone's gonna wanna take this ride with me. So I'm going solo.<eos> What I'm gonna do is build a foam mock up first.<eos> That way I can find my shape.<eos> This is what they did in 1902, they whittled.<eos> Once we have the shape we like, we're gonna build it out of steel.
But Tom kinda sat with his leg up like this.<eos> In Arabic culture, you never expose the sole of your shoe to somebody.<eos> That's not a done thing.<eos> [Loney] Tom holds his leg so that he can't knock it down.<eos> [Loney] And then Tom sort of put it down.
Maybe we should try it." And, "No, no, no."<eos> And then we just decided to try it.<eos> And actually, unbelievably, it works.<eos> It's a very simple mechanism.<eos> There's just a little spring and if you lift it, it'll just release, like magic.
♪ Don't go chasing ♪<eos> - ♪ Waterfalls ♪ - ♪ ...falls ♪<eos> ♪ Just stick to rivers and the lakes ♪<eos> ♪ That you're used... ♪<eos> You loved that song. I hated it so much.
Oh, so you hate the fact that I'm the Goblin's Bride?<eos> Or do you have another woman in your life?<eos> Even if you don't, you don't want me so you don't want me to be your bride.<eos> You said that seeing the blade and then pulling it out are the proper steps to take, right?<eos> I'll pull it out and prove to you that I'm your bride, then!
By any chance, is it because of the sword?<eos> Ajusshi.<eos> I can grab the sword.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute, I'll pull it out for you.
- So, not a ghost?<eos> - No.<eos> Just a dozy boom operator with a very, very large microphone.<eos> Do the line.<eos> I'm not saying it.
Now they want us to run away and leave our town.<eos> We cannot do that.<eos> Never.<eos> This land is ours.<eos> Our ancestors have lived here, taken care of it, and left it for us.
I am not a great writer.<eos> I am not Hawthorne.<eos> But from my first hearing of it, this tale has haunted me.<eos> It consumes me.<eos> I fear if I do not write it, then I should never write again.
But from my first hearing of it, this tale has haunted me.<eos> It consumes me.<eos> I fear if I do not write it, then I should never write again.<eos> What else?<eos> I fear if I do write it, that it will not be as good as it should be.
Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.<eos> But the inquiry was a sham.<eos> Pollard went out again,<eos> looking for the white whale.<eos> He never found it.
It's got everything you need, as long as you're not afraid of heights.<eos> Where does the water come from?<eos> He pumps it up from deep in the earth.<eos> Calls it aqua cola and claims it all for himself.<eos> And because he owns it, he owns all of us.
Me too. I'm here, right?<eos> First, design.<eos> We figure out what went wrong and correct it.<eos> Then we build, then we send organic matter over there.<eos> But more importantly, we bring it back.
But he's not stronger than all of us.<eos> Look, this place gave him his powers. But it gave us all of ours too.<eos> It's who we are now.<eos> Maybe it's who we're meant to be.<eos> We opened this door, we're gonna close it.
Oops, wrong door.<eos> Could I, uh, take the Nissan?<eos> Ha, ha. No, no.<eos> Wait, Dad, I thought we were going to the airport.<eos> Boys, when your father makes you a promise, he keeps it.
So you're the new guy.<eos> We've actually met before.<eos> A long time ago.<eos> You see that cornerstone?<eos> I watched them lay it in when this was nothing more than a cornfield.
No, not you, too.<eos> I heard that you can't tell before it happens. Okay?<eos> He's just standing there all chilly calm, and then...<eos> Wham!<eos> He cuts your head off and puts it in a sack on his belt.
If you laugh... You have to go out with me one more time before you move away.<eos> If you don't laugh, I will know we're incompatible and gladly give up.<eos> That must be one hell of a joke.<eos> It's the funniest in human history.<eos> But it's subtle, sophisticated... so you probably won't get it.
How perfectly charming.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Her stepmother-to-be was a woman of keen feeling and refined taste.<eos> And she, too, had known grief.<eos> But she wore it wonderfully well.
Girls, you're too clever.<eos> Who's this for?<eos> Is there someone we've forgotten?<eos> It's my place.<eos> It seems too much to expect you to prepare breakfast, serve it and still sit with us.
I know how many I lost.<eos> We do like Glass says.<eos> That's the end of it.<eos> We have to set the boat loose.<eos> If the Ree are tracking us, they'll find it downriver.
Cañedo, help me! This baby is bleeding.<eos> I thought she was peeing down my leg, but it's blood. Look!<eos> Help me. I could not face a child bleeding to death in my lap.<eos> I only--I only construct death in the cinema.<eos> I don't make it, cause it. Get the mother.
You're not an easy man to live with.<eos> You know, you were right about that word.<eos> - Which word?<eos> - The little word like.<eos> You said all my friends are using it all the time, remember?
His dad used to force Ned to be on the team.<eos> Back when he was trying to mold him into a new Chaz Jr.<eos> And so Ned finds himself out there, deep left, last inning, last game.<eos> And I'm on the mound and I serve up this meatball.<eos> And the kid hits the snot out of it.
- I didn't mean that.<eos> Sorry. - Class act, this guy.<eos> - It's not going to get better, so just...<eos> - Got it.<eos> I'm going to take a key. I'm going to stick it in my mouth, and I'm going to turn it and I'm going to lock it.
Kill him! Kill him now!<eos> I'll say this for you, Katniss.<eos> You don't disappoint.<eos> Well, Plutarch gave me a letter for you.<eos> I don't want it.
Happy birthday, sweetheart.<eos> I'm sorry I was late.<eos> You forgot it, didn't you?<eos> That's okay.<eos> I didn't really want it anyway.
No, no, no, no.<eos> Mom's paintings.<eos> We... we do this gallery show.<eos> We call it "The Hidden Art of Camille Fang"<eos> and we promote it like a memorial and then Caleb will come out of hiding.
- Hey, sweetie.<eos> I was wondering if there was room for my bike.<eos> Thought that I could ride it to class, then I wouldn't have to buy a parking pass.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I'm sure I could figure out a way to fit it in.
You're shooting in the garden?<eos> You're crazy! It's dangerous!<eos> They started it, those bastards!<eos> The fence is useless?<eos> They ate it!
I was nine and I found a bullet with some of moms stuff.<eos> I swallowed it.<eos> Maybe it's still inside me.<eos> Dad followed me today like he did just after mom died.<eos> I felt I had to to something important. So I wanted to show him I visit mom's grave. But I couldn't find it.
She'll do us credit.<eos> Go on, Chris, read us more.<eos> "And there at Aberdeen, he was nearly killed in rioting for liberty, and equality and fraternity."<eos> Equality should begin at home.<eos> Yes, she sat for her bursary and got it.
Yes, at the inn, cleaning up, cooking...<eos> I'm guessing you never did all that, by looking at your hands.<eos> Alright, can we go?<eos> What about your bag?<eos> Did you expect me to carry it around?
It doesn't matter, Plankton.<eos> Krabs knows all your plans.<eos> He's been through my hard drive looking for the secret formula.<eos> I never had it.<eos> But we're going to get it.
- Kevin Kevin Kev... - Hey, Kevin. Hey.<eos> So. How should we do this?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Oh. You see this tiny little trinket?<eos> Well, just take it from my hand and you got the job.
- Not chicken or veal?<eos> - I don't eat meat.<eos> Really?<eos> You look like the kind of guy who'd eat meat every chance you'd get.<eos> If it had blood, I don't eat it.
You need patience.<eos> Need to see the big picture.<eos> I don't see the big picture.<eos> I have a little picture.<eos> I take it out and look at it, every day.
Better?<eos> I just keep the house a little differently. That's all.<eos> It's my house.<eos> Will, could you do me a favor and go get some more firewood?<eos> You know where we keep it.
I'm okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Where's the car?<eos> Well, if it worked, it's not gonna be here until we drive it here tomorrow.
Here we go.<eos> There.<eos> There you are. Turn it off!<eos> Oh, you loved this song.<eos> We used to sing it to you every night before you--
That is an enormous amount of absorbent cotton on a very small mop head.<eos> Now I'm done with the bathroom, and I haven't wrung the mop once.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> Would you take this mop where you were just cleaning the bathroom and around the toilet, and all of those germs and take it into the kitchen where your family eats, where you feed your children?<eos> I take this mop head, I put it in the washing machine it comes out clean like new.
One team will go out onto the field to play defense while the other team will take turns hitting this ball... with a stickie.<eos> What are you gonna call this game?<eos> What else?<eos> Stickie McSchnickens.<eos> Now your goal, ball thrower, is to get the ball past me two times without my hitting it.
I tossed it, hit him in the mouth, and knocked his tooth out!<eos> What an asshole!<eos> Mama.<eos> In any event, I still have one bottle left from that case.<eos> I'll go fetch it and we can drink a toast to that awful woman and her hideous son.
Death.<eos> Well, or maybe the imperfection of human relationships, the imperfection of others, of yourself.<eos> What happens if you get this third star?<eos> - Oh, no, not "if," "when."<eos> - All right, when you get it.
Jimmy and Conrad have climbed Everest four or five times.<eos> Jimmy's even skied off the top.<eos> But Meru is the anti-Everest.<eos> No one's gonna carry your stuff.<eos> If you need it, you need to carry it on your back.
Now, there was a couple of ways this could go.<eos> Talking Chris out of smashing my head in at this point seemed unlikely.<eos> But fate stepped in once more and booted me right in the bails.<eos> And there's the bell!<eos> But no one hears it.
You have rejected our proposal, we will not go back on , But today I made you come here...<eos> I called the school to tell me that you withdraw Katie.<eos> It is a mistake!<eos> It is the best girls' school in the country !<eos> Do not I can afford it.
Got something in the trunk?<eos> Nothing special.<eos> It must be meat.<eos> Ricardo's never wrong.<eos> If there's meat around, he'll find it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Oh! Oh, my God.<eos> You think everything is like Terminator.<eos> 'Cause everything is like Terminator!<eos> Arnold's hand gets chopped off in the past, somebody finds it, reverse engineers that shit. Boom!
The history of man is defined by war.<eos> And war by the men who fight it.
Yes.<eos> You always were a small man, Antoine.<eos> A derivitive thinker, at best.<eos> This desperation suits you.<eos> The key to everything... is in your mind, and you're going to give it to me.
If you cannot argue constructively, what will Mother do?<eos> Destroy our video games.<eos> Andrew...?<eos> And the gaming system.<eos> Burn it while we watch.
Zip it.<eos> The Worlds signifies a shot at redemption.<eos> You don't have a chance at winning until you find your sound again.<eos> You have totally lost your harmony!<eos> So, for the next two days, you will be doing everything together until you regain it.
You're too good for me, and I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You're not going to.<eos> Now, the eagle-eyed amongst you will notice I'm wearing a funny costume today.<eos> But the thing is that's out of respect for the uniform.<eos> You don't go shopping in it. You don't go down to the pub in it, even though you think you might pull in it.
She killed our parents.<eos> Our parents brought that on themselves.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The box?<eos> It was in their house. They were the ones hiding it.
"I can't believe you just said that, you fucking moron."<eos> Everybody hears that voice.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Most people just ignore it.
"Laugh, god damn it, laugh."<eos> Everyone's laughing and I'm not laughing.<eos> I wrote a poem.<eos> I wrote a poem for my date to the high school prom.<eos> And my brothers found this and they posted it on the bulletin board like it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen.
Fuck.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> See that case?<eos> It's full of money.<eos> Someone wants us to take it.
I had some unfinished business, I guess.<eos> Hey, and to see you, stupid. Huh?<eos> Why else would I come back? Huh?<eos> Hey, so we're having a parade in Manhattan next month, to commemorate the fighting.<eos> We're going to go all the way uptown from the Village, right up to Central Park. And they're going to call it the Gay Liberation March. Okay.
General Yu-baek ordered me to kill you, sir.<eos> I'm the assassin.<eos> Go ahead and try.<eos> Will you kill me?<eos> The sword... I will aim it at him.
Hold on!<eos> Wait right here.<eos> Hong-y"!<eos> Sul-rang's sword...<eos> I haven't seen it in years.
Well, it's a riddle!<eos> Did you ever fight for something, even though you had no idea how you were going to win?<eos> Story of my life.<eos> I plan to make that my story, as well.<eos> Just to be clear. If your father gets us to the throne of Lord Alcaman, if there's a crown, then I'll be taking it back to King Zakkour in Al-Moraad.
You think of propaganda as a totalitarian thing, very grim, loudspeakers, you know, chanting crowds and so on, and we think of Hitler.<eos> We always think of it as a foreign thing, okay, but it's actually as American as apple pie.<eos> [Kasser] Well, the reason that advertising works is because the smart advertisers, at least, are trying to tie the consumption of their product to a message that suggests that your needs will be satisfied by consuming this thing.<eos> It wants you to believe that you'll look wonderful in that thing.<eos> But then to put it on and feel like,
I can't let you go.<eos> Hands up!<eos> I want to see those hands, alright?<eos> We've been informed there's an injured boy with you. Is that true?<eos> Tell them to get their cars away, you have a bomb and you'll blow it up.
Proof that we were here.<eos> It's because door's open.<eos> What?<eos> It can't really be room if door's open.<eos> Do you want me to close it?
And Ring Lardner, Jr. and Albert Maltz and...<eos> Um... It'll be like this.<eos> I'll find the writer and work with him.<eos> He'll deliver the script to me.<eos> If it's good, I'll give it to you.
Others?<eos> Two thousand dollars entices a certain breed of undesirable.<eos> Just what breed are you?<eos> Local tribes call this forest "The Place of Spirit Trees".<eos> Trappers call it "Silver Ghost".
I think I certainly would've recognized him.<eos> I don't see any reason why anyone wouldn't have,<eos> Who knew what he looked like.<eos> Seattle's own police reports indicate That Officer Lavendowski found Kurt Cobain's wallet Lyin' on the floor.<eos> He opened it up and removed his driver's license, And he put it on top of Cobain's wallet To take a photograph for evidence.
But I have to stop before I catch it.<eos> Just keep running.<eos> When you turn right trust that the ball will be there in the pocket.<eos> What?<eos> Want me to catch it for you?
- Er, I can't, sorry.<eos> I just came to say thanks for inviting me around, but I've made plans.<eos> Oh, that's a shame.<eos> Well, Jim's here.<eos> Jim, why don't we save your supper and you can warm it up when you get back later?
And even now, you haven't brought her flowers for ten years.<eos> And that letter!<eos> Do you think Mommy never read it?<eos> Well, you're wrong.<eos> She found it and she read it and I've read it too.
This ethos would be embraced by the chief architects and vendors of the Silk Road and reverberate through the entire community.<eos> [There were quite a few people that I didn't sell to] [just because I could tell that they were obviously not mature enough to handle] [using these drugs, and didn't know enough. It was like "Go read first...]<eos> ["go figure it out and then come back to me and I'll sell you something"]<eos> ["but I'm not gonna pop your cherry and kill you, potentially."]<eos> [The heroin in particular I was very careful about who I sold it to because...] [it was not stepped on. It was the best heroin on Silk Road.]
And so for those who are arguing that information should not be encrypted, certainly that makes it easier for law enforcement to... combat, but it also makes it easier for the cyber criminals to attack.<eos> It makes total sense that criminals are among the early wave, along with the sort of paranoid people, of these new tools and services.<eos> But that doesn't mean that they're the only people using these services.<eos> There are a hell of a lot of journalists that I know and regularly communicate with now over Tor.<eos> But you know, for the people who oppose this technology, who see it as a threat, the fact that criminals use it is a great way to demonize it.
- What happened to a child like you?<eos> - Meaning?<eos> Once you must was a good boy. Done what him told.<eos> How you gone so wrong?<eos> I was 14... in the basement of my best friend's house in Maryland me and him snuck a bottle of Sambuca down there finished it between us.
I make the men feel better about themselves.<eos> See, every man here has served under a captain who uses violence to achieve an end... to terrorize, to advertise.<eos> When the men see that, they can spot the lie.<eos> They know that that captain is, in some part of his soul, sickened by his own actions.<eos> And the lie infects everyone who sees it.
I rather envy you.<eos> I remember what it was like the first time I met him.<eos> There's a feeling one gets when in the presence of the truly great men.<eos> It's something quite indescribable.<eos> I imagine you're having it as we speak.
You have to trust us.<eos> Why should we?<eos> You certainly don't trust us.<eos> There's a map to the fairy kingdom.<eos> We guard it with our lives.
Well, she passed away before I got the job, but... I hope she'd be proud of me.<eos> Would she have supported your prosecution of, uh, medical marijuana facilities, for example?<eos> Well, Nigel, my mother taught me from an early age to fight for justice, protect those who are vulnerable.<eos> The law's the best way to do that.<eos> The U.S. attorney's office prosecutes those who break it. We don't decide what the laws are.
It was very Oprah.<eos> Seven-thirty, just spew this shit out.<eos> I'm a vessel.<eos> This shit just comes to me from the universe.<eos> I put it back out there.
I'm not the one he has to get along with.<eos> Don't give this to him until he lets you touch him.<eos> So how'd you get to be such an expert in all this?<eos> Do you have credentials or...<eos> You gonna eat that carnita or are you gonna give it to your dog?
Well, the color of your bruise doesn't tell me anything but this conversation tells me that you have anxiety.<eos> But, April, you're gonna have to deal with the possibility of relapse for the rest of your life.<eos> You have to learn how to control your anxiety.<eos> How?<eos> Some people use anti-depressants, other people use medical marijuana, some people work it out through exercise, yoga, meditation.
- Seek.<eos> - From her maker...<eos> And the desert wild...<eos> Become a garden mild.<eos> I'm going to give you a word. And I'd like you to repeat it back to me.
No money is worth going through this again.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Slow down!<eos> Why are you still here?<eos> All right, I'll say one thing, and then I'll drop it.
I'm sorry?<eos> Your handbag, miss.<eos> I'm just... I'm just going in here.<eos> It's policy.<eos> Fine, I'll just... I'll just go leave it in the car then.
This is very stressful for the animals, therefore it must be done very carefully.<eos> After surgery, the wound can be sutured or left open.<eos> Open wounds heal much faster, but there is a greater risk of infection.<eos> The operation takes only 20 minutes, but then it must be supervised by a veterinarian...<eos> Not all apply anesthesia, as some guinea pigs die from it, and they may even die after surgery.
That's all right. I got penicillin. Okay.<eos> You're good?<eos> Yeah. Do me a favor.<eos> Leave the door open for the dogs.<eos> They like to wander from room to room at night. If the door's closed, they'll eat it to get through it if they have to.
Technically... yes.<eos> I, too, have a fascination with fairy godmother's wand.<eos> Which is another reason I look forward to the coronation.<eos> Perhaps we could sit next to each other and discuss its attributes.<eos> Are you saying they use it in the coronation?
Have you tried his compass?<eos> Where are you, compass?<eos> Doesn't work.<eos> Must be the volcanic rock.<eos> The high iron deposits are throwing it off.
- I can control it.<eos> - Just tell them the truth.<eos> - I can control it!<eos> I won't...<eos> I won't use it again.
We will not serve Szorlok.<eos> Yes you will.<eos> Whether in life or death.<eos> As your sister did.<eos> Necromancer, you will retrieve the stone and you will deliver it to me.
Just scroll through it.<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> What do you mean, there's nothing there, stace?<eos> The image is everything.<eos> I want you to find it.
He'll start bugging you for shit.<eos> Now, if you need something to do, you can get me coffee.<eos> - Aren't you already drinking... - Hey, sport.<eos> You see that garbage over there?<eos> Why don't you grab it and throw it in the dumpster in the garage.
- Do you wish you were 20? - No!<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> No, I would...<eos> If I had a pill which would reduce my age by 25 years,<eos> - I wouldn't take it. - Why not?
You should've seen May last night, man.<eos> She said she was surrounded by death.<eos> And I just heard no séance.<eos> You think she'd be okay with this?<eos> Absolutely not, which is why we're going to do it right now.
- A letter?<eos> - Clown!<eos> When I thought they were hanging me, yeah.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> You had to get Letters Molloy to write it for you.
Cynically telling you what you want to hear in the hope she may reap some reward?<eos> But I have proven I want nothing in return.<eos> Last time... - ..you said you felt my children's presence.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do you feel it now?
I would pass on your request to the governor.<eos> ~ In private?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> He might refuse it.<eos> He is more than likely to refuse it.
Do you think that a) the taxi driver who gave you a lift is just some eccentric millionaire who's driving his taxi for kicks?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't think so either.<eos> Or what do you think, is it actually b) some son-of-a-gun drug dealer who's a little too smashed on his own merchandise to realise he's mislaid a small matter of, what, say, half a million in used 50s?<eos> So why don't we keep it?
Her killer cut out her implants.<eos> Michael Kelly severely bit his nails and his killer severed his fingers.<eos> Her killer targeted her face, her skin.<eos> The Internet's a place where you can create an illusion, show people only what you want them to see... but when reality didn't match up with what the killer saw on Flirtual, he punished them.<eos> He wants perfection. He's searching for it.
Good, run with it.<eos> Great, I'll see what I can turn up around town.<eos> No, you know the drill.<eos> You've got the story of the night.<eos> When we break this, I want you running it from here.
Schools of thought that say that it's better to acknowledge your fears, get them out in the open.<eos> You keep them bottled up inside, they turn into other things.<eos> - Like bad dreams?<eos> - Nightmares, yeah.<eos> Repression is what they call it.
Alan, you coming?<eos> Alan?<eos> They can't so much tighten as screw on that Gemini capsule without running it by Gus first. Mm-hmm.<eos> Two clubs.<eos> Down at the cape, everyone calls it the Gus-mobile.
What if you don't?<eos> What if you don't find anything?<eos> All actions have ramifications, which means all actions leave evidence.<eos> And we will find that evidence, for no other reason than it exists.<eos> And we will not stop looking until we find it.
Worked at night.<eos> Saw a white thing running around.<eos> A white thing?<eos> Yeah, it used to run around the factory at night.<eos> Only I saw it.
I'll book 'em today.<eos> 'God doesn't ask if we accept this life.<eos> 'There is no choice.<eos> 'Life is forced upon you.<eos> 'The only choice is how you live it.
Just browsing.<eos> What?<eos> I'm here to meet the Spanish cousin.<eos> Mind you don't put your elbows on the table, I've just had it polished.<eos> If you see a fly, get it with the swat.
They're coming after me.<eos> Where do you want me to meet you?<eos> 'Destroy the recording.'<eos> Destroy the...? But...<eos> 'If someone is after you, then destroy it.
Why would he do such a thing?<eos> Suicide?<eos> No.<eos> The gun is in his left hand.<eos> In his room earlier, he was holding it in his right.
Of course.<eos> The gun was in his hand.<eos> You don't think it could have been anything else?<eos> An accident?<eos> Not unless he was scratching his head with it.
They look very... pagan.<eos> They're the ten little soldiers.<eos> You know, from the poem.<eos> I know it off by heart.<eos> When I was a little boy, my nanny used to recite it to me.
The Owens are lucky to have you.<eos> I'll certainly be telling them so.<eos> Thank you, Madam.<eos> Whereabouts is your school?<eos> I doubt you'd have heard of it. It's not particularly well-known.
It's like the kitchen in your house.<eos> Like baking a cake.<eos> Only a much better cake than you've ever had.<eos> Look, an old press, an antique.<eos> Now we put it in the oven.
Does anybody recognise it?<eos> Are we forgetting about the gun here?<eos> There's a Fenian sat over there with a bloody gun!<eos> - Don't blaspheme!<eos> - Hand it over.
You're joking.<eos> Why would a man about to die joke about such things?<eos> Will you give me the ax, or not?<eos> Your gift was foolish.<eos> I don't think you'll use it against me.
- Wait a minute!<eos> I'm not finished.<eos> You better not be.<eos> (Zander moans) You wrote one steamy scene, Lennox.<eos> And they are nailing it.
- That creep is Randall Toth and he's curating a group show about artists who have dealt with depression.<eos> And that's why he wants to use your mother's work.<eos> - Great, so now everyone can know what happened.<eos> - It's just an art show, Leah.<eos> - You know that's not how mom would see it.
Can I help you?<eos> - David: I'm looking for an extra towel, - Stevie:<eos> And this might be a stupid question, considering the state of the rugs in our room, but do you have a business centre here?<eos> Yes, we do have a business center.<eos> You can find it right outside the doors to your left, right beside the hammam spa.
Yeah.<eos> Can you hold this?<eos> Liquid oxygen... and some stain remover, that contains ammonia.<eos> This thing here, is five times stronger... than a stick of dynamite.<eos> How do we activate it?
~ He has an ancient family name - doors which are closed to us might open for him.<eos> What inducements could we offer?<eos> His need at present must be severe.<eos> You mean to buy his friendship?<eos> I would rather he bestowed it willingly.
I don't feel safe going out.<eos> There's a rage in the air.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You telegraph fear.<eos> The militants can smell it on you.
Food is scarce over there and things have started to fall apart.<eos> There are gangs. And, rule of law is less firm established over there.<eos> Definitely stay away from the Wall.<eos> On their side, there is a line. Cleared of buildings along the Wall. They call it the "Death Line."<eos> Cross it and you will shot.
- Did you see that?<eos> - I did.<eos> That was sexy talk, there.<eos> Half dozen.<eos> This pool is even better than I remember it.
RUSS: Yes, it's shit.<eos> God!<eos> What happened to your painting? RUSS:<eos> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> I've got some bad news, and you're gonna hear it eventually, so you might as well hear it from me.
Yeah, uh, we should probably discuss that.<eos> You're gonna sweat me about the cost, right?<eos> Don't.<eos> I hammered them on their fee.<eos> They're going to bring it way down.
All Tim did was type it.<eos> Well, clearly that's where the money is. And by the way, don't you think it's a little odd that this is the first you're telling me any of this?<eos> Because there was no "this" to tell.<eos> It was just an idea.<eos> Well, there's a "this" now. It just pisses me off that he has the nerve to suddenly claim we came up with it together.
You might not know it now, but it's out there, waiting to be found.<eos> Wanting to be found.<eos> It's almost always simple.<eos> So simple, it's almost silly.<eos> And when you find it, well, there's no feeling like it in the world.
Your turn, Einstein, saddest thing ever.<eos> Well, there was a scientist who lived 300 years ago who wanted to figure out how much the earth weighed.<eos> And he theorized a series of measurements that could be taken using pendulums, weights, and counterweights.<eos> He spent years building his ingenious contraption and then he died.<eos> He knew exactly how to get the answer, but he never got to know it.
Mom, I'ho given to you the report card.<eos> We lost the report card.<eos> Your father arrabbier ? .<eos> - Search fine!<eos> - There '? , not find it.
You know, we could help if you let us go.<eos> You can also try and take back this ship if I let you go.<eos> We share an interest in seeing Flint rescued, but make no mistake, this ship belongs to my men now.<eos> It was bargained to us.<eos> We claimed it and we intend to keep it.
For the first time since I've known it, there is no Guthrie in Nassau.<eos> One gets used to a state of affairs for such a long time, it's easy to forget that they're all just transitions.<eos> Specks of dust suspended in the air until a strong enough gust comes along and rearranges everything.<eos> A strong gust has come to this place.<eos> The men can feel it.
A few months ago, my life meant nothing to me.<eos> I got no enjoyment out of it, no pleasure.<eos> I'd have been fine if that little game of Russian Roulette ended it.<eos> But since I planned and executed the elimination of Judge Spangler, my life had taken a new turn.<eos> I understood why people loved life and saw it as something joyous to experience.
~ LOUDER GROANING ~ Make that two pegs. Do you mind?<eos> More than two, less than ten.<eos> If I get out of here now!<eos> So to pass the exam I have to be able to clear a five bar gate.<eos> Have you ever seen a five bar gate in India, let alone a civil servant leaping over it on horseback?
I wish I had something for this eye!<eos> The house doesn't grant wishes.<eos> It helps people in need.<eos> It was built as a refuge.<eos> No one ever expected a serial killer to find it.
- Thank you.<eos> - For a straniero.<eos> Are you familiar with the personalities of pre-Renaissance Florence?<eos> I think not.<eos> Dr. Fell might hold in his hand - in his non-Italian hand - a note from Dante Alighieri himself. Would he recognize it?
- Men only?<eos> - Every hour.<eos> It's getting to be a blur, really.<eos> So you lead them both, both the teacher and the learner, into the, uh... electric chair?<eos> Well, we don't call it that, but, yes, if you'll follow me into the next room, please?
If you read the manual, you'd know.<eos> It's a spirit steeper, you put it on and the last spirit that possessed you is invited back.<eos> We record everything on that camera there, and we chart your progress.<eos> If you can remove the spirit steeper on your own, while possessed, then you've completed the training.<eos> If I have to remove it for you, then... The therapy continues.
And you're giving me E.Coli?<eos> I'm treating your blood with different bacteria.<eos> It's all just preliminary research.<eos> If you want to find a cure, you have to know how a disease defends itself.<eos> The more scenarios you expose it to, the more you know how it works.
She'll always remember the evening she climaxed at the restaurant, it will be her legend.<eos> But there's nothing real, it's a bluff.<eos> Emotions are always real, the rest is a line at the post.<eos> Mr. Potent?<eos> I have a beautiful farm, if you'd like to see it, maybe for pastoral settings...
I get nothing, this job doesn't pay off like it used to.<eos> - You can sell this car. - To who?<eos> It's all traceable.<eos> In a month the owner returns from the Caribbean, reports it, and they see where it is.<eos> I'll have to give it back.
What's below it?<eos> It looks like a minicam.<eos> This is a minicam.<eos> Now I see how they got in.<eos> This shows the door, and as they force it an intact image shows on the security screen.
--Are you ok?<eos> We started a mutiny!<eos> Acting is a strange job...<eos> I sit here...<eos> It mixes with real life and confounds it...
Mmm! - These are really good.<eos> - Same as when you were a little girl.<eos> That song you were humming yesterday...<eos> - reminds me of something.<eos> - I would sing it to you when you were scared.
From leaf to paste to powder, they produced 10,000 kilos a week.<eos> At 50 grand a kilo, that's five billion dollars a year.<eos> These guys weren't fuckin' around.<eos> Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.<eos> They added it to liquor, to coffee, and just to be funny... they put it back in Coca-Cola. ¿Patrón?
So what's our options, since we have none?<eos> Well, we keep her in hiding until things cool down, and get her immunity in exchange for her testimony...<eos> Are you gonna get us immunity?<eos> We are going to jail if we get caught with this woman.<eos> Well, the next time your wife decides to bring home a human hand grenade, how about she hands it to you?
Listen, I think Dre and I are way more evolved than that.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't you remember why you fell for him in the first place?<eos> Give me the mustard.<eos> I'm using it.
Oh, there's pizza in here.<eos> You want it?<eos> You want my slice?<eos> I'm fine, but thank you.<eos> Okay, well, you can have it for later then.
Come here.<eos> First one is on me.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - It's really chill.<eos> It's just prescription, my grandma eats it for breakfast.
Honestly, that's not ours.<eos> Yeah, who would leave weed in a wall, anyway?<eos> (Mocking) Who would leave weed in a wall?<eos> A weed genius!<eos> And she'd leave it there indefinitely, in case of emergency.
Why is it like this?<eos> Why isn't it any easy for me, like it is for you?<eos> The pain is the same for everyone.<eos> Morphine.<eos> I don't want it.
Look, can you give me that fix bag right there?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> Hey, listen, um... we've got a huge problem out there, dude. - Oh.<eos> - Earlier, when Dennis said "We've got a really good idea with this plan," that wasn't entirely accurate, 'cause it was actually my idea and I think the usage of the word "we" in there is really confusing, because, like, how can a whole group of people have the same idea at the same time?<eos> What, do they just say it all at once?
A couple of guys got drunk and were looking for trouble, all right?<eos> That's not what you told Karen.<eos> Uh, why are you lying to me?<eos> I'm not.<eos> Look, I know crap when I hear it, Stan.
Have you got in over your head, as they say?<eos> What had charlie found?<eos> He wouldn't tell me.<eos> You know, I had no option but to sign your exile notice.<eos> I don't make the law, I just administer it.
The nuns.<eos> Why?<eos> I was raised in the faith. It was arduous for me.<eos> Have you religion?<eos> - Are you offering it?
When the Devil knocks at your door, he doesn't have... cloven hooves.<eos> He is beautiful and offers you your heart's desire in whispered airs.<eos> Like a Siren, beckoning you to her ruinous shore.<eos> And what do you do, when that Siren sings?<eos> You save your soul... or you give it to her.
I wasn't there till Christmas '53.<eos> I was home by then.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> No, I got one.<eos> Tell you one thing about Korea. They can keep it.
Drag it all up.<eos> Reel these puppies in.<eos> Everybody wants to go back to who they were, don't they?<eos> I had a pedicure once.<eos> The girl doing it pointed out I had hairy toes.
I hid it in here years ago.<eos> Ah!<eos> Wait! Yeah, no.<eos> No key. Just a note and a movie ticket stub and four teeth.<eos> "If you are looking for Ron's key, "I moved it, and you'll never find it.
Plus, who's gonna miss some dumpy diner?<eos> Why don't you ask the people gathering outside of your building right now? Hmm?<eos> What do we want?<eos> Breakfast!<eos> When do we want it?
I'm going to tell Brody.<eos> Thank you for coming down. I hope you're enjoying your stay.<eos> Oh, I am.<eos> I especially like the golden shower.<eos> I know the fixtures are gold, honey, but I don't think they call it that.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!<eos> I ain't wearing that fucking paper shit.<eos> That's my color.<eos> There is one maternity-sized paper suit.<eos> I suggest you grab it... before one of your plus-sized dorm-mates claims it for her food baby.
Well, when you talk dirty to me like that...<eos> Yeah, I know you've been sniffing around Angie's tree.<eos> And you should know the only soggy box that interests me is mine, and all that goes in it are dicks and tampons... and sometimes other things, but only guys can put those in.<eos> Noted.<eos> Although, when you call it your soggy box, you know, it makes it really hard to resist.
That's my favorite Daya story.<eos> What is it?<eos> What, you bang her and you don't know her quinceañera story?<eos> She tells that story to everybody.<eos> Aleida got wasted and she tripped and fell on the birthday cake and the candles lit her dress on fire... but you gotta hear the way Daya tells it.
I just said I don't want to start a panic. I just...<eos> But why would we panic unless the camp's shutting down?<eos> Uh, there are many reasons why a person may choose to panic.<eos> Sharks, school shootings, uh, bee extinction.<eos> They call it colony collapse, and they say it's all from this Monsanto pesticide.
Hey!<eos> Is that our wheelbarrow?<eos> It's the prison's.<eos> I can use it.<eos> You can use it and you can return it.
Come here, come here.<eos> Get to cutting.<eos> Listen, okay?<eos> You can't have this cop car. It's our cop car.<eos> We found it and we're not going to let you have it, okay?
You name it, we're doing it.<eos> Basket weaving at the craft museum.<eos> Well, you named it.<eos> Oh, here's another one.<eos> I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an "A," but I don't put it there because I don't want you breaking one of your little legs when you're supposed to be making my breakfast.
This is about... it's about Thin Mints, goddamn it! Right?<eos> And the reason I'm so good at this is because I take it seriously.<eos> Now, just watch and learn.<eos> Listen up!<eos> According to the Master, guys, we're not getting enough vitamin D, so these stickers harness the power of the sun and deliver it directly to our bodies, okay?
Passionate and gross.<eos> Now you want to hang onto that grouping.<eos> In marketing, it's what we call the Good Belushi.<eos> If I had a magic wand, I would use it to make sure Greendale never had to grow up.<eos> I would also probably use it to cut the Magic Wand class that I noticed is actually offered here, as well as VCR Repair, a class called Ladders, and
What about... that boy?<eos> You got him to sweep the floors, remember?<eos> Boy called Michael stole a card.<eos> Well, could it have been this one?<eos> He said he'd found it. But he never actually handed it in.
Hey, Sam.<eos> Ah, if it isn't Dr. Warren.<eos> I need to speak with you.<eos> What's wrong with your face?<eos> The north and south-end mobs going at it again.
Return from where?<eos> As far south as south goes.<eos> You are my queen.<eos> The prince does not wish to be disturbed.<eos> Remove yourself from my path or I'll take that long axe and I'll shove it up your...
- Thanks.<eos> - Thank you, Your Grace. - Thank you.<eos> Take the head.<eos> Let me, Your Grace.<eos> I would take it if you don't mind.
Sure.<eos> I almost sold the house twice.<eos> It was empty all the time we lived with mark.<eos> It was four years, right?<eos> Nadia wouldn't let me sell it.
What should I do?<eos> Kate?<eos> I think that he should have the surgery.<eos> Look, a-all due respect...<eos> I don't think Doc would want it.
Look.<eos> It's Mighty Maggie.<eos> This is a dream, really.<eos> And, you know, I was taught that this is a team effort and to always credit my coach first.<eos> So, this gold medal, I owe it to you, Hope Greggory.
Yup!<eos> Got the code.<eos> Just saying... no refund for finish early!<eos> Sure you don't want to go home?<eos> When the bag's returned, they'll deliver it to us.
- That's all right.<eos> - MARIE SIGHS - Thanks so much for coming.<eos> It's really good of you.<eos> I've rediscovered cabbage.<eos> It turns out if you shred it, add salt, pepper and butter, it's delicious.
- MARIE SIGHS - Thanks so much for coming.<eos> It's really good of you.<eos> I've rediscovered cabbage.<eos> It turns out if you shred it, add salt, pepper and butter, it's delicious.<eos> You only cook it for five minutes, boil it vigorously... five minutes flat... then serve, because if you cook it for too long, that's when it gets smelly.

I'd like to, it just costs too much to develop. Hm.<eos> Well, you could always set up your own dark room, - learn how to develop yourself.<eos> - Yeah well, there's, uh there's not really a lot of extra space where I live, so...<eos> Well, anyway, the Hasselblad is responsible for that beautiful blur you see in the photograph.<eos> They call it "bokeh."
He wasn't that stupid.<eos> I don't think he would have picked a milk jug that leaked.<eos> I think whoever or whatever cut those wires made the milk jug leak.<eos> Well, we can think a lot of things, but here's a fact.<eos> In his journal, the guy bragged about how many times he assembled the bomb, tested it, and every time it worked exactly the way he planned, except this time.
Hey, sam, this is my second call to you.<eos> I really hope you get this soon.<eos> I'll keep in touch. Marlo:<eos> All right, sylvia.<eos> Look, you don't open this door right now, i'm gonna break it down.
- Gone in? One person. Her name's Marta.<eos> She's no longer with the program.<eos> Why not?<eos> She couldn't handle it. So what do you want me to do once I'm inside his memories?<eos> We think yesterday's bomb was an accident. Brandt blew up his apartment while prepping it.
- What? - ?<eos> Take that off.<eos> - My necklace? - ?<eos> Take it off.<eos> Take it off.? I don't want you to wear it.
Okay, then.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> I'm gonna take Peggy Blumquist back to Minnesota.<eos> If anyone's got a problem with that, after the week I've had, they can keep it to themselves.
Why do you keep looking out the window, Will?<eos> You like the snow?<eos> You know, for some people, snow brings on a very specific feeling.<eos> Uh, some love it.
But the army is still searching for him.<eos> Well, nobody's searching.<eos> Those few soldiers back in the glen were taking MacQuarrie to the sherriff's court in beauly.<eos> This dispatch is calling on the garrison at Fort William to find Jamie.<eos> And if they never read it...
But Social Security?<eos> Benefits. Entitlements.<eos> We don't want to present a fresh face only to shoot ourselves in the foot.<eos> Then let's not pretend to unite the party, let's unite the party behind this legislation.<eos> We'll never get it past the Republicans.
If you stay straight, sky's the limit.<eos> Bigger assignments. Manage your own team.<eos> You know I wouldn't be here if I had a choice.<eos> But you do have a choice.<eos> You can make the most of this second chance if you want to, but... you have to prove you want it.
Francine Tenaka.<eos> And if you don't know who Tenaka is, there's no reason you should know who Brad Petite is, or that he's ambitious or a good guy.<eos> This job offer came from you or the president.<eos> And I'm telling you that it didn't.<eos> Well, I'm turning it down.
As does our country.<eos> When I invited the president here, I set out hoping to find a partner.<eos> But the demands that President Petrov made proves to me that peace is not a priority for him.<eos> Peace should not have to be bought.<eos> Peace should be its own reward, and we will achieve it, with or without him.
This is nonsense!<eos> How can people believe this farce?<eos> We've already received thousands of e-mails claiming the Moon landing was a hoax!<eos> Social media is going nuts over this!<eos> Everybody's already calling it the Big Lie.
Creditors bleeding us dry.<eos> He was so consumed with his damn legacy, we were going broke.<eos> It was his fortune to lose, not yours.<eos> He built it.<eos> And he was squandering it.
Come on.<eos> We're at 30 seconds and counting.<eos> The National Guard has arrived.<eos> Put yourself in front of the shuttle.<eos> Don't let any sharks hit it.
Uh, actually, we have a little bit of an issue.<eos> - What kind of issue? - You have a fever.<eos> It's low-grade... just 100.5.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> Well, it means that we need to figure out what's causing it so that the surgical team can determine how to proceed.
As long as you can.<eos> I can still taste you.<eos> Hey, you got any aspirin?<eos> Little too much Jäger last night.<eos> Uh, yeah. I'll get it for you.
Are you coming?<eos> I'd love to go with you, but I don't have any money.<eos> Do you talk to your parents this way?<eos> Do you have any grass?<eos> We can get it there.
Derrick, what can you do?<eos> I can fall down.<eos> Great. Draw some fouls. Harvard, what do you got?<eos> Unbridled rage.<eos> And right now, this wedgie is feeding it.
Pistol whip a midget?<eos> Jimmy, come back.<eos> I gotta check your vagina for sand.<eos> Did you get a look at that door?<eos> It was locked before one of the nosepicks broke it down.
No.<eos> - But how do you know her name?<eos> - You won't think I'm crazy? I won't, because coming from me...<eos> Here, lean your bike on there.<eos> No, I'd like to keep it near me.
- Oh, Weird.<eos> Look At This Chair.<eos> - I Know.<eos> At Least, I Think It'S A Chair. What Is That?<eos> I Don'T Know, But I Wouldn'T Go Touching It If I Were You.
Is there a god?<eos> Shoos!<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> Is there a god?<eos> If you speak of the great thing again we'll rip out your tongue and feed it to you.
You have as much interest in finding a cure as I do.<eos> You help me, and perhaps with what I learn, I can help you.<eos> I'll work as fast as I can and you can bury her in a few days.<eos> You won't cut her face?<eos> I'll protect it with my life.
So Sal the Shrimp Guy wants to buy Jake's houseboat?<eos> Lemon:<eos> Yes. So I overheard him say that he was looking for real estate investments.<eos> So I suggested the boat, and he said that he is in.<eos> - And even better yet, George, he said that he wants to rent it to you, same as A.B.
What is it?<eos> Why didn't you get rid of it?<eos> I thought it might be useful.<eos> I just didn't realize I'd be using it for this.<eos> After he moved it from your property, it-- lt appears he kept it for himself.
Enough! His mother is in reception.<eos> I think she's trying to report him missing.<eos> He'd gone out to score drugs.<eos> The only time he borrowed the car was while I was at the gym, because I was at a drink after with the girls and got taxis home.<eos> He always put it back exactly where and how I'd left it. ~ Except the cab smelt of fresh weed.
You didn't know?<eos> I knew she was brought up by the sea, and that her father was a fisherman, but she kept names and places to herself.<eos> She was protecting you.<eos> This is that shell.<eos> I've kept it close to my heart ever since, wondered about her every day.
One moment, sir.<eos> You take issue with the laws of this land?<eos> I can't help but feel that, in this case, justice would have been best served by clemency.<eos> Happily for justice, this court is better able to interpret the law than you.<eos> Then the law is savage and you interpret it without charity!
Five.<eos> Jesus, John.<eos> What?<eos> Five?<eos> He's selling a lie and folks are buying it.
Oh, oh, why don't you come and join me and Sam on the Farmstead tonight?<eos> We can sip some Pinot.<eos> Watch the owls hunt.<eos> Actually, I can't.<eos> Jimmy and I are throwing a surprise party for Nate, which isn't a surprise because we do it every year.
We'll have to make the spring stronger.<eos> We?<eos> You then, you and whatever it is you use for a brain.<eos> Start with making the spring twice the length.<eos> Better bring it over here so I can check it.
I-I messed up a little bit.<eos> DOUG (chuckling): $400,000.<eos> I can't fucking believe it.<eos> Hello? Hey, do me a favor.<eos> Take your $400,000 offer, stuff it in one of your autopiloted cars and drive it off a fucking cliff,
Not better or worse, just different.<eos> You got a smart mouth.<eos> Only if one assumes that a master's in economics constitutes a smart mouth, as opposed to educated.<eos> Many educated people are quite stupid, and many stupid people like to start fights for no good reason on a truly beautiful day.<eos> Let us not ruin it.
We shouldn't be killing the people we're supposed to save.<eos> Please empty your pockets into the container.<eos> We're here to see...<eos> Please empty your pockets into the container.<eos> Please remove your belt and place it into the container.
Work just went... oh, I don't know.<eos> Work went insane.<eos> I got you a slice of Braum's pecan pie. - Oh.<eos> - It's in the fridge. Thanks.<eos> You mind if I just save it?
Well, there's absolutely nothing automatic about a bail hearing.<eos> - It... - But he could still get out.<eos> - Yes or no?<eos> - Even if they granted bail,<eos> I can't imagine they'd set it at a level that I...
Oh, you reading my mail, now?<eos> You can't see it to read it.<eos> I can see well enough.<eos> Then read.<eos> I'm gonna read it later.
Dude, I guarantee you a hot-ass milf drives this thing, man.<eos> For sure.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> 90,000 miles.<eos> I think she used to drive it, now, the daughter drives it.
- Yeah, I was just leaving.<eos> - After I told you to leave.<eos> No, no, no, I was thinking about it way before you said anything.<eos> - Is that my shirt? - Thanks.<eos> I can give it back.
Two of them... at the dam and in the mine... are moving into position already.<eos> The third... inside the mountain... is freeing the Grounder prisoners as we speak.<eos> It is our job as the fourth team to keep the eyes of the enemy off of them for as long as possible.<eos> To do that, we have to be in position here at the main door with our entire army.<eos> The mountain men believe the door can't be opened from the outside, so they leave it unguarded.
They tell me you haven't eaten in two days.<eos> We both know you aren't here to bring me dinner.<eos> It's bad.<eos> They're going after our power.<eos> I sent a team out to the dam, but there is an army outside of our main door, and they're drilling into it.
From what?<eos> It drives me crazy that places like this Are so close to the city.<eos> Places like this?<eos> Yeah, you know, where tranquility isn't just a myth.<eos> You can come here any time my family isn't using it.
You, Moose, you're the sane one.<eos> You onboard with this?<eos> Wings of Titania, bear mine eyes aloft as I bid thee.<eos> Insane.<eos> You want me to procure the most dangerous weapon on the planet for Dean Winchester... the man who goes mental every time he touches it.
He built an empire from a shoe-shine box.<eos> And then, and only then, did he send for your father.<eos> Ma, I know the story.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> 'Cause if you did, you'd know that you are just a small part of it.
You're the scientist. Go prove they aren't.<eos> They didn't give you any warning?<eos> Do they ever when they're passing out pink slips?<eos> What about Peter's adoption?<eos> They won't grant it if you're unemployed.
I have no quarrel with you.<eos> Esther made this bargain long ago.<eos> It's most unfortunate that you've been dragged into it.<eos> You talk like you don't have a choice, but this is your doing.<eos> When I give my word, I keep it, and I expect others to do the same.
This is all fascinating.<eos> How do we find Simmons? Light bulb, literally.<eos> I--no, actually, figuratively.<eos> Uh, just before Simmons beat me, I blasted him with my compressed light beams, and he thanked me for topping him off.<eos> He absorbs energy and turns it into weaponized plasma.
The behavior is defensive.<eos> He's relaxed when the perceived threat is gone.<eos> Or when he thinks no one's watching.<eos> I don't think it's an act.<eos> I have a theory, but I'll have to test it before I can make a diagnosis.
Pierce knows where he is and he's not telling me.<eos> Joanne, if I don't find this guy, very bad things are going to happen.<eos> You're a clever boy, Walter.<eos> I'm sure you'll figure something out.<eos> Hey. I just came by to pick up some of our belongings and show you where I was forced to hide your weed before the girls could find it.
- I mean, that's gotta hurt. - Well, it doesn't exactly hurt...<eos> Anyway, this has nothing to do with Billy.<eos> I just heard that my nomination is dead in the water.<eos> It's not dead in the water. It's an uphill climb.<eos> An uphill climb, but we're gonna push it through.
This is all my fault.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Is Bo a shifter now? Not exactly.<eos> The cat you gave her is an aitvaras.<eos> By bringing good luck to its owner; it steals it from those who don't pay it reverence.
Respectfully, I have no clue.<eos> Phil, sometimes, in quilting, you just don't have the right scraps.<eos> And no matter how much effort you put in, you make a quilt that looks like this.<eos> - I will agree that it's ugly.<eos> - And you worked so hard on it and you trick yourself into thinking it's beautiful, and you display it proudly in the entryway on your divan.
He's with a new friend...<eos> an important friend.<eos> Why is this new friend so important, Minx?<eos> Something terrible is coming.<eos> Before I crashed, I felt something enter my mind, as if something was ripping it apart looking through my memories.
That end zone dance was sick.<eos> Yes, I love sports.<eos> You're gonna take my virginity tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> That crown I got from being prom king was so tacky, I hardly even wear it anymore.
Open the gate.<eos> You know, that tough-guy routine might work okay in L.A. but out here in the desert, we like to do things a... a little differently.<eos> Mrs. Waters, please.<eos> Eugene said you had a court order.<eos> May I see it, Detective?
If you were my lady, you'd never have to do that.<eos> Cookie, wait.<eos> I'm gonna send you a song.<eos> I think it'll work for your son.<eos> Hell, I think you'll remember it.
-Snap it.<eos> -Come on.<eos> -Look, we've got the gun. Why don't we just let him-- -wait, wait.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I don't-- i don't feel good with it.
-Come on.<eos> -Look, we've got the gun. Why don't we just let him-- -wait, wait.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I don't-- i don't feel good with it.<eos> Who wants it?
What makes you think I would ever agree to that?<eos> I'm selling my beloved estate for you.<eos> I scratch your back, you...<eos> [Whip cracks] ...whip mine.<eos> Adrian, it is bad enough that our home is a murder house. I won't let you turn it into a sex dungeon, as well.
That, I can't figure.<eos> You asked Waits for proof. He gave it to you.<eos> Smoking gun, man.<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> I don't know his angle, but I'm not buying it.
He was wounded by the Boers.<eos> He was shot in the face.<eos> It's never got right.<eos> He owns this house.<eos> Father is just renting it at the moment.
Just the two of you?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Near enough to give her a letter without anyone seeing?<eos> Easily near enough for that.<eos> Wait here, then, while I write it.
How much do you love this weed?<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> Medical-grade miracle.<eos> I can tell.<eos> An old love of mine was sick, and he used it for pain.
It's a miracle.<eos> Medical-grade miracle.<eos> I can tell.<eos> An old love of mine was sick, and he used it for pain.<eos> Well, we used it together.
Her parents are going to kill her! - And now...<eos> I'm sorry? - What?<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, you know, the spelling bee!<eos> I told you I watch it every year.
You can't bring more in?<eos> Not with the thinnies sealed.<eos> Then we need to find the stash William left here.<eos> William left a stash here?<eos> Mara was looking for it. She never found it.
Don't tell me you both drank it without noticing!<eos> Mabel!<eos> Really, sometimes I despair!<eos> I did nothing to encourage him.<eos> Lytton, cake without eating it simply isn't cake.
Hood!<eos> Where you going?<eos> You can't...<eos> You can't just leave!<eos> Well, I'm not giving it back this time.
Yeah, do you have a minute to talk?<eos> The Stingray.<eos> I loved that bike.<eos> Had the three-speed shifter on the frame.<eos> He'd never let me ride it.
Well, you're gonna need some time to recover from your surgery.<eos> This shot of cortisone should help you feel better.<eos> So, when were you diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy?<eos> I saw the brain atrophy on your C.T. scan.<eos> My, uh, my pediatrician detected it when I was 5.
I'm never gonna see her walk.<eos> I'm never gonna hear her talk.<eos> I'm not gonna see her get married.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> There's an ambulance coming, Dougie; I can hear it.
Everybody know that one.<eos> Mnh-mnh. He's from Boston.<eos> Oh, Boston does not play.<eos> - Josh: Ugh, I had a bully.<eos> I'd grab his tiny head and flush it in the toilet.
I don't want the wave.<eos> - Come on!<eos> Take it!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> I don't want it!
- Who is Hartley Rathaway? - Hartley Rathaway is the prodigal son.<eos> And he has returned.<eos> - Hartley Rathaway possesses one of the finest scientific minds I've ever encountered.<eos> - Any ties to Rathaway Industries?<eos> - His grandfather founded the company, his father expanded it, and Hartley here was set to inherit the throne.
And you where do you move your erotic charge?<eos> - Get up.<eos> - Where is your frustrated sexual charge?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - Where do you put it?
- Where is your frustrated sexual charge?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - Where do you put it?<eos> - You've made me impotent.<eos> - Where do you put it?
I love you very much.<eos> I love you.<eos> I consider this land the heart of England.<eos> Mmm, yes.<eos> When I see it, I mind more not having a son than any other time.
I torment myself and those around me.<eos> I'd crawl on broken glass to avoid failing.<eos> About anything.<eos> I inherited this illness from my father, but...<eos> I'm afraid I'm passing it on to my son.
But first, I was blind, lost in the world.<eos> These gifts are deeply layered for people like us.<eos> Now I can go anywhere... Find our people.<eos> Well, what was the good in finding me?<eos> If I have a use, I don't know it.
People would hit the thing with a heavy book, like a bible... or a textbook.<eos> What the hell?<eos> !<eos> Hey.<eos> So, how do you think he's gonna take it?
A celebration, if you will.<eos> Your resistance to Powers registration landed you in the Shaft yourself.<eos> - A political prisoner.<eos> - So, will you register?<eos> Just because you disagree with a law, doesn't mean you get to ignore it.
And now stark is public enemy number one.<eos> Yeah, we're not railroading him.<eos> We got evidence.<eos> Yeah, what you don't have is the whole story.<eos> Somebody does, But they're keeping it to themselves.
The soldiers that came into my camp in okinawa...<eos> The ones I killed.<eos> They were coming to surrender.<eos> I just didn't realize it until it was too late.<eos> I buried the flag before anyone else saw it.
Well, that's just great.<eos> Screaming baby during the picture?<eos> Oh, don't pay any attention to him, dear.<eos> Dexter, dispose of your litter properly. Nah!<eos> Let somebody else pick it up.
- I like it.<eos> - That's 'cause you got taste.<eos> I love music.<eos> Just not so loud.<eos> What the hell good is it if you can't hear it?
All right, Nurse Joy's gonna take care of you.<eos> We'll get you out of here as soon as we can.<eos> Bye, buddy.<eos> I have a sling.<eos> You want to put it on?
You are cursed, indeed.<eos> But if it means I will finally be rid of you, then so be it.<eos> Goodbye, Mercenary.<eos> Time has stopped still.<eos> The door to Olympus is not a door as we know it, it is a door in the speed of time.
- Oscar!<eos> - What is it, Felix?<eos> I'm kind of in the middle of something. Oh, hey, Ashley.<eos> Oscar. I was just hearing about your new romance.<eos> Oh, well, I wouldn't call it a romance.
It's only for the Russians, not the peacekeepers.<eos> They can't stay if they have nothing to eat.<eos> What are you going to do, shoot down a supply plane?<eos> We hope they won't make us face that choice.<eos> They'll ignore it.
Well, if you flew into a paradise, wouldn't be as effective, now, would it?<eos> You do have a flair for the theatrical.<eos> I can say the same about you, showing up on my doorstep like this.<eos> This isn't your doorstep. You're squatting where you shouldn't be.<eos> I don't think my men will see it like that.
And the man who shot me here and here, he stabbed me when his rifle jammed.<eos> I pulled the knife away and slit his throat.<eos> Yes, I know, you've told that story dozens of times to the press.<eos> The part I don't tell is that after I slit his throat, I kept going.<eos> We strapped his head to a donkey so it would carry it back to his village.
I've been waiting for you.<eos> _<eos> Where's the cure?<eos> Give us the cure!<eos> Why are you hiding it?
Whatever you do, maintain lock on Mr. Cole's tracer.<eos> Mr. Ramse.<eos> The core can't keep up with our power demands.<eos> Between that and the toll the splinter process takes on Mr. Cole's physiology, we're losing our real-time tether.<eos> And if we lose it?
I'm so sorry.<eos> Our relationship was, um... complicated.<eos> He was very proud of you.<eos> He wrote me this letter.<eos> I thought you might want it.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, look at that.<eos> He knows where everything is.<eos> So how's the grad school application coming?<eos> Not so good.<eos> The school e-mailed me back and they won't accept it because I missed the deadline.
No, listen, but there's a way to find it.<eos> Just before I left, okay, they were upgrading a mobile containment system.<eos> They called it "The Big Burn"... ultraviolet light powerful enough to torch anything in the lab if the wrong virus got out.<eos> How does that help me?<eos> Their specialized equipment... if you find it, you'll find the Night Room.
Thanks.<eos> Um, are you okay?<eos> You seem like you have a heavy heart.<eos> Sometimes I'm not sure why I wear a mask with you.<eos> Well, maybe one day you'll take it off.
Which is why... I need you to read and to record everything.<eos> Which is why I stopped taking cases.<eos> Well, until this one.<eos> - Are you...getting treatment?<eos> - Mm. I have injections, which keeps it at bay.
Did he pour the shots?<eos> I, uh, don't remember.<eos> I was a little bit preoccupied.<eos> So Carson and Ren are in a secret relationship.<eos> I wouldn't call it a relationship. But, uh, whatever it was, it was a not-so-secret secret.
That's the point, dude.<eos> This is craft brew... fancy kind, trust me.<eos> Shouldn't it say, like, "Schlitz" or something?<eos> Nah, it's better than real beer.<eos> My dad brews it in the downstairs bathtub.
You mean the shirt?<eos> I'm going to the Phillies Game later with Dad So, I bedazzled this as a joke just to drive him crazy.<eos> I mean, I would never wear this to the game unless you think I can maybe wear it to the game.<eos> You know, you shouldn't just wear it to the game,<eos> I would wear it to school!
Do you think this is a joke?<eos> Not at all.<eos> They got the "F."<eos> But point is, there is a story to tell... the story of us, our family, our culture.<eos> The details of the story might change over time, but the important thing is we tell it.
You made me feel like the other woman instead of your wife.<eos> I thought we were going to be one family, not two separate ones.<eos> Oh, her?<eos> Oh, she is one phone call away from deportation.<eos> And yeah, I mean, our whole situation seems crazy, but we'll figure it out.
So, if Wells is as fast as you, what's he need a time machine for?<eos> Apparently he lost his speed when he killed my mom.<eos> He gets it back sometimes but only in spurts.<eos> He can't fully control it.<eos> So I was right about the wheelchair. He was using it to charge himself.
I won't even ask.<eos> It's alright.<eos> You're alright.<eos> I gotta take this shirt from you, alright? Help me out here.<eos> I'm gonna take it off, put it in the bag and give it back to you after, okay?
Actually, we can't because he's dead, and we believe you killed him.<eos> What? ! That's crazy.<eos> You argued with Tino when he wouldn't give back Mrs. Sanchez's gold watch.<eos> You hit him in the head with something.<eos> We don't have the weapon yet, but we'll find it.
- She's just testing you.<eos> - Christ, I have to get out of here!<eos> 6x05- "Sounding" The more I think about it, the better it sounds.<eos> The bluegrass state has some of the most lonely soil in the union.<eos> Weed used to grow so big here, old timers called it "Christmas tree dope. "
I should read it then.<eos> You should.<eos> My copy is in the barn at the old house.<eos> We set up a bit of a playhouse there.<eos> Come with me. We'll fetch it.
I don't know, but it's not uncommon for coders to be kept in the dark.<eos> That's how stealth companies work.<eos> That's how terror cells work.<eos> This was a bioinformatics company creating climate change models.<eos> We'd write a piece of code, and we'd pass it on to someone else.
It's a wee bit early for deathbed speeches.<eos> "Ramu Sood!" you will cry, as you scatter my ashes.<eos> I'll toss 'em straight in the rubbish if you keep this up.<eos> And I would cheer you on, Mr Ian, but Kavitha wouldn't stand for it, she was a superstitious soul.<eos> Are you going to shut your mouth or am I shutting it for you?
What are you doing out here?<eos> Oh, hello, sweetheart.<eos> So you made it after all.<eos> They're singing my song.<eos> It's MY song... .. and they're singing it.
Never explained why.<eos> You know a lot, huh?<eos> It's my job to know things.<eos> I know that Jack was denied worker's comp because he stole the ambulance.<eos> They got it back.
He never wears a shirt.<eos> He's hot.<eos> I was waiting for the L train.<eos> And he said, uh, "Nice jacket.<eos> You wanna give it to me, right?"
I don't want it!<eos> Any of it!<eos> You are a spoiled brat!<eos> People are starving, and you're complaining about having to wear a goddamn wig!<eos> You're not the one who has to wear it all the time.
Yes or no, it's a simple question.<eos> I shall not reveal my innermost feelings.<eos> In other words, Hoess was not a criminal in your eyes.<eos> I did not say you ordered the foot march.<eos> I know the Chief of the Security Police ordered it but I say you initiated it.
No, that was hardly possible, because when the foot march took place I was in Berlin.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> No is quite good enough.<eos> Now look at page 62 of your statement.<eos> Go ahead and read it out loud.
Great, so he's leaving the country.<eos> Now we're gonna have even less time to connect him to the shooting.<eos> Um, I-I know Milt is suspended, but, uh, the FBI has this really cool vector program.<eos> He called it, "Six Degrees of Edgar Hoover."<eos> Uh, you know, if there is a connection between the victim and the shooter, it'll find it.
The FBI there?<eos> Put them on the phone.<eos> Kyle, Ryan Hardy.<eos> Love your house, man.<eos> Too bad you're never gonna see it again.
You must listen.<eos> No.<eos> There is a girl with Lucrezia.<eos> Sophia.<eos> You must find the Page and protect them both from those that seek it.
It's called "Dead Man's Hand."<eos> Just pick one, all right?<eos> And memorize it and put it back.<eos> And your card is... not here.<eos> You don't see it, do you?
We write about new agriculture.<eos> You know, it's not Time or Newsweek, but, um... an interview with you could put me on the map.<eos> Well, I'll, uh, I'll make you a deal.<eos> How about, um...<eos> I'll give you an interview if we do it over dinner.
They were flat, they weren't singing together, and one of them was picking his nose!<eos> But they had nobody to follow -- why didn't you sing with them?<eos> Cos I'm practically a baritone since my voice broke. Excuse me, Mrs Turner?<eos> Oh, Mrs Willens, wasn't that a lovely service?<eos> And the church looked immaculate -- you keep it so spick and span.
They've been very kind to me.<eos> Yeah, ol' Mitch, he's something.<eos> Well, I probably shouldn't be here too long.<eos> Can I give you a hand?<eos> No. I got it.
Uh, Marcus, you know I'm very fond of Mr. Chris. And all I want is for you to make a bit of an effort to connect with him outside of school.<eos> Marcus: About that...<eos> I've concluded that Mr. Chris isn't right for you and things should go back to the way they were.<eos> Mom, you and me, we have this perfect love bubble.<eos> Messing with it could pop it.
Why?<eos> This display, this tantrum -- it isn't about anger, is it?<eos> Fear?<eos> Of what?<eos> That we weren't too far off about you keeping a stash of dirty money, and that with enough time, we will find it.
That's what i always liked about you.<eos> Appreciate that.<eos> You know, this... this whole thing's A little weird for me, right?<eos> Can't say i ever saw us getting to this point.<eos> Yeah, but you're handling it like a pro.
Yes! It was the only language he understood!<eos> Give me the gun. - No.<eos> It's mine.<eos> You can't walk around with a loaded pistol!<eos> You can really overdo it with this method acting! I'm keeping it.
Yes. (Laughs)<eos> Is the wig bothering you?<eos> It's just itchy.<eos> I'll get used to it.<eos> Why don't you take it off?
Sent.<eos> I took ecstasy tonight.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> That's pretty crazy.<eos> Mm-hmm. I have another pill if you want it.
Hey, Ape...<eos> I have to ask the question...<eos> What if we don't find anything?<eos> We can't give up so quickly. I just...<eos> I just mean that it's not like Leo left that first envelope where he wanted you or anyone really to find it.
How?<eos> Well, he started coming in a month ago...<eos> By himself.<eos> Always did the same thing...<eos> Ordered a coke, nursed it, then left a huge tip.
[ as scarface ] say hello to my little friend.<eos> You get all this stuff from the set of "star trek"?<eos> Cybercrimes and homeland security, joint task force.<eos> Have you finished mapping her facial architecture?<eos> Sending it to you now.
Please!<eos> Dad, please.<eos> Say something.<eos> Why did you put that flashlight back in my truck?<eos> The detective was looking for it, and she wouldn't leave you alone.
No...<eos> No!<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> All this time you spent here, You could've been building worlds.<eos> You could've been redefining life And how we live it.
Do you think Brezhnev's death could have an impact on the Soviet war in Afghanistan?<eos> I cannot tell the future.<eos> However, the entire Politburo is behind this terrible war.<eos> I saw it on the news.<eos> A "missing person," they call it here.
You did great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, here's your credit card.<eos> Be gentle with it;<eos> I rode it pretty hard. Why don't you keep it.
Oh, here's your credit card.<eos> Be gentle with it;<eos> I rode it pretty hard. Why don't you keep it.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah, I want you to have it.
They lack knowledge of how to live daily in the light of truth.<eos> I am not saying that these men have not received the Holy Spirit, but I ask and question this:<eos> what happens after they receive the Spirit, and how may our traditions instruct them so that they may not stray from the Spirit?<eos> If they have truly received the Spirit, then why would they throw away the truth and the law?<eos> They don't throw it out.
Previously on Allegiance...<eos> You turn your son into a spy.<eos> An SVR officer said he was close to launching an operation that would bring America to its knees.<eos> They're calling it Black Dagger.
My father was only ever a Markridge man.<eos> I love you, Dad.<eos> It's why we're all here today, isn't it?<eos> Not to eulogize, but to capitalize.<eos> Through continued advancements in bioengineering, through government contracts, through strategic partnerships and a renewed push into pharmaceutical retail, we will realize my father's vision for Markridge, and we will transcend it.
Can I help you?<eos> My name is Carrie Mathison. I'm from the During Foundation.<eos> We funded the construction of your gym.<eos> Ah, you must come back later if you wish to see it.<eos> The men are using it right now.
We really need this.<eos> It'll give the Powers a reason to stay in line.<eos> It is a bomb, Christian.<eos> And it doesn't discriminate.<eos> It's only as good as the people who are dropping it.
Like, I don't just think it's awful 'cause it's my mum?<eos> What do you think of my orchid?<eos> Good things.<eos> It is a good orchid.<eos> My psychiatrist makes me keep it so I learn to trust myself.
-Really?<eos> -What did you think of me?<eos> -Uh... Equi-cute.<eos> -I like your face though, to be clear.<eos> I am enjoying it.
-No, not that type of team.<eos> -Like milo and otis.<eos> -You only have to take one pill, right?<eos> -Right.<eos> -So I go to the doctor, I get the medicine, But I do not take it.
-I'm calling to tell you where we are So that if anything goes wrong, you can call the police.<eos> -Or maybe you could just call the police now.<eos> -Your mom doesn't want to send him to prison.<eos> Your dad brought a cricket bat, josh. Oh.<eos> -I'm not gonna use it.
Thank you.<eos> It's Scottish.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> You treat yourself well.<eos> I don't drink. I keep it here for my guests.
Jess asked me to clear out Tom's room.<eos> She just can't.<eos> Hey, do you still have Jess' house key?<eos> We should really get that back.<eos> I don't know where Nat keeps it, but I'll take a look.
Now, they can't do that if I offer an alternate theory of the crime.<eos> Okay, what's the theory?<eos> You sleep with Jess once.<eos> No one says a word.<eos> Then six years later, Christy confronts you on it.
Mom, why is the door locked?<eos> This is confusing.<eos> Get... hide.<eos> Um, the door's locked because I am looking for my robe, sweetheart.<eos> And let me find it.
No, not really.<eos> Becky's getting married in her grandma's wedding dress.<eos> Isn't that adorable?<eos> No, she's probably just trying to save money.<eos> Oh, man, I love it when they cut the cake and they wipe it all over each other's faces.
- Oh, yeah. People go into hospitals every day, and they never come out.<eos> And it's a well-known fact that they have super infections and flesh-eating bacteria in there.<eos> Sir, you have flesh-eating maggots in your leg right now.<eos> Yes, but it's good for the wound.<eos> Cleans it out.
Don't put this on me.<eos> You gave up that code.<eos> You have three federal agents and at least 40 innocent hostages in that facility.<eos> Inmates included, over a hundred lives will be lost.<eos> I don't agree with this course of action, but I understand it.
Wow, wow, wow. This is an incredible resume.<eos> Did you print this yourself?<eos> Yeah, you just, uh, press "Ctrl P."<eos> Wow, wow, wow, wow. My biggest weakness is that I lose my purse a lot.<eos> But then my biggest strength is that I always get it back.
Damascus steel, made in ancient Persia.<eos> But the... the secrets of its manufacture have been lost for centuries.<eos> It's purported to have magical properties.<eos> A Da Vinci who believes in magic?<eos> Well, it only appears as magic to those who don't understand it.
- You shouldn't have.<eos> Found it in the barn.<eos> asked Ava if that was all of it, but she didn't seem to be in a talking mood.<eos> Well, it's a long way to Lexington. I'll see what I can do.<eos> And if Ava knows where the rest of it is - and tries to use it as leverage?
What are you doing about this?<eos> You can't do this!<eos> How long have you known about this, Mayor?<eos> I was briefed 30 minutes before the broadcast.<eos> That's the first I heard of it.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> On one condition.<eos> You don't bring your gun.<eos> If Chuck sees it, he will fire first, and I'm not getting stuck in some crossfire.
Did you cut off her finger and steal that ring?<eos> What do you think?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> The combination for the safe.<eos> You're never gonna find it.
By the way, I love this new scruff that you're rocking.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Very sexy.<eos> Thank you. I'm just trying something new.<eos> But when you meet my parents, you should shave it off, 'cause they will hate it.
I love you.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Women can't dance and they're not funny. I should be Dr. P's best man!<eos> Hey. I haven't gotten your RSVP for the wedding.<eos> Yeah, I can't make it, buddy.
- What's up?<eos> - Eric...<eos> - Lee.<eos> - Lee. - It's Lee.<eos> And you're gonna take this rose, and you're gonna put it in the hand of the man that knocked you up.
- I'll be right back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Look at you being selfless.<eos> To think you're the same punk kid who got a credit card in my name when you were in 8th grade.<eos> Whatever. I only used it for emergencies.
You're talking to the wrong person about that.<eos> All I know is the DA likes the idea of having a respectable doctor on the stand.<eos> See you in court tomorrow.<eos> The reason I didn't call yesterday was because my husband wasn't served with a subpoena until after you closed.<eos> Yeah, and if I filed that extension, you wouldn't even see it until after the hearing.
I came to see if you need any help.<eos> You're such a good friend.<eos> And I do need help.<eos> I just did laundry, and all my underwear is on the bed.<eos> Could you fold it for me?
Stand over there with an apple on your head.<eos> Take the string and slip it under.<eos> Pull it nice and tight and then... Then you tie a knot.<eos> The knot has to be good and tight.<eos> Choose an arrow, put it in the little notch. You pull hard...
There's a journal entry where Kurt mentions #oing heroin for the first time in 1987 when he was living with you.<eos> See, he never told me that.<eos> He totally had kept that from me, because I totally would have talked him out of it.<eos> In fact, he used to make fun of some of the people in Seattle that were using that and say it was really stupid.<eos> Because I've been told before that he was doing it when we were dating, but I'm like, "He didn't do it around me, ever."
- What, you like apples?<eos> I prefer ice cream.<eos> But yeah. I like apples.<eos> Well, it's yours.<eos> You gonna eat that, or put it under your pillow?
She had a cut on her face, Manolis.<eos> I treated her.<eos> His ring must have caught her.<eos> She has a scar if you look closely.<eos> She keeps it covered very well.
I should've listened to you years ago.<eos> Good for you, man.<eos> During the Revolutionary War, the Americans held you limeys off right here in Red Hook.<eos> There was a fort that covered most of the Red Hook peninsula.<eos> They called it Fort Defiance.
Uh--it helps me focus.<eos> You know, in light of recent events, I think it's ok to give yourself a break.<eos> An entire night, though.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're wearing the same shirt from yesterday, and you're covering it with a cardigan from your go bag.
You never know what you'll find at the dump.<eos> Someone dropped off a Herman Miller chair today.<eos> - No! - Yeah.<eos> That's astonishing.<eos> I saved that chair and I'm gonna refurbish it and when it's done, you're not gonna be allowed to sit in it.
All I can say for certain is that she's flipped.<eos> - If I'm wrong, you can have Arlo's place.<eos> - And what if you're right?<eos> You can still have it.<eos> I can't give it away. Wait a second.
Since we're talking bribes...<eos> What you saw on the street? It's in everyone's best interest if the Company doesn't hear about the weapons.<eos> Yeah, well, lucky for you, unless there's a warrant involved, I don't give a shit about you, The Company or your doomed- to-fail resistance.<eos> So you'll keep your mouth shut?<eos> If you put enough beer in it.
- Do you know what you've done?<eos> - Bought you a few more floors and better luck with those now unlocked security doors.<eos> D'av...<eos> Look, I couldn't tell you what I had planned.<eos> The charge is undetectable, but if they link it to me, I can say I acted alone, because I did.
With beer?<eos> Um... so, do you have any idea where he is, or...<eos> If I did, I would be there rather than here.<eos> What?<eos> Walt's saddle's on the fence. He normally puts it in the barn.
Or someone who was recently released from prison?<eos> Something like that?<eos> We-we just brought down a biker gang that killed a city supervisor.<eos> That's good.<eos> Have your lab send that file over right away, and we'll look into it.
Ask my parents for money.<eos> No, they think I'm a successful artist.<eos> Art!<eos> Sell my art!<eos> It's brilliant, but no one understands it.
- The game's about to start.<eos> - I think it's a good idea that you give him the tour.<eos> - I'll put in on pause.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And then we can watch it afterwards.
A time machine.<eos> Don't you want to ask me why?<eos> I think I know why.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You think I'd use it to go back a few days ago...
Yes, Richard.<eos> But Mathis said that she didn't have the purse when she got into the car.<eos> I think I know what happened.<eos> As Ana was leaving the opera house, she realized she was going to be abducted.<eos> So before she got into the limo, she ditched the purse outside the opera house, where I will find it and solve my case!
You make them sound like monsters, but they're actually really nice.<eos> Well, they are!<eos> My parents are horrible people.<eos> You're being dramatic. Oh yeah.<eos> That's what people say when they take your soul, and they rip it out of your chest and then shove it in your mouth.
And you can't make me not cry.<eos> You're all a bunch of bullies, and I will say, I'm sorry, however I want.<eos> And by the way, I'm not sorry!<eos> It's my giant hand and I love it.<eos> We're not selling it.
Carol, I'm not a crank.<eos> It's just... what they're doing is unacceptable.<eos> They know we know it means they're having sex.<eos> And they just keep playing that song day after day after day.<eos> Well, if you have such a problem with it, why don't you go fix it?
The same cover-up that cost Julianna Keaton her life.<eos> Wait, what's Keaton's connection to all this?<eos> Well, she was the one responsible for making the drug.<eos> Right?<eos> And distributing it, which is why we arrested her.
Answer me.<eos> - Is this your color?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> Your voice... You will feel it along with him, like tinnitus or two speakers badly aligned.
But there is a higher power watching us right now, and he wants you to stop the evil that has cast its shadow over this city.<eos> How?<eos> Tell me who has the book.<eos> It's our only hope.<eos> Tell me, and I will release your soul to God before the forces of vile darkness take it from you.
Yes? "Meantime we shall express our darker..."<eos> "Meantime we shall express our darker purpose."<eos> "Give me the map."<eos> Don't tell me, don't tell me, I know it!<eos> I'll ask for it if I need it.
Kimmy Schmidt, Carla Tuesday, WDUR.<eos> I think of you as the Paul McCartney of the Mole Women.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> - Isn't there a back door?<eos> Well, there used to be, but all the prisoners kept escaping through it, so we got rid of it.
Copy that.<eos> Ravit?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Looking for the cure?<eos> I'll give it to you.
He struck an oncoming car, hospitalizing the couple inside, and somehow sparing the six-year-old in the backseat.<eos> All of which you know... if your friend read you the report.<eos> I don't have to read it.<eos> I know every... painful detail.<eos> And as for Wynn's blood, aconitine only shows up if you're looking for it.
It's fleek, girl.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> I'm gonna sample some cannon sounds, blow it up mad real.<eos> These lyrics are gonna make this song commercial.<eos> More people are gonna hear it, and we suck 'em in for the rest of the album.
Come on, I'll give you a ride back into the city.<eos> Do you remember that time you tried to kill me?<eos> What?<eos> You pointed a gun at my head.<eos> I think I was pointing it at your father.
You know, when Laramie becomes the new hub of the Union Pacific Railroad, land bought today will be worth...<eos> Ten times the price tomorrow.<eos> Mrs. Palmer!<eos> What a delightful and unexpected surprise.<eos> I hope you're not too fond of that shirt, friend, because you're about to lose it.
Steady on, New York.<eos> We got a land deal to finish.<eos> I found you by the hotel.<eos> You have an infection.<eos> We have to keep your fever down while you fight it.
It's not the worst job I've ever had.<eos> The hours are good.<eos> Is this a weight loss spell?<eos> I suppose it wouldn't hurt for me to just...<eos> Hm... So, before I steal your soul and trap it forever in a bottle, what's your formula for turning things to gold?
The first exercise, after you do all this reading and stuff like that, is this thing called which is basically, you stand... you sit just like this, eyes closed, three feet away from somebody who's doing the same thing,<eos> and you basically confront them.<eos> You know?<eos> And in Scientology lingo,<eos> Exteriorizing is what they call it.
John Travolta was a young actor in his very first movie.<eos> He was a troubled young man, and he was looking for help.<eos> A fellow actor gave him a little bit of Scientology counseling.<eos> She gave him a copy of "Dianetics," and he was transported by this.<eos> He would go out on his auditions, and no matter what he went out for, he would get it. ♪ I am stuck on Band-Aids... ♪
They played the damned music.<eos> "He said," We're gonna play it to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen."<eos> And he emphasized the line... ♪ Nothing really matters... ♪<eos> "nothing matters anymore." And that's your whole attitude, that's where you live, that's who you are.<eos> Playing that music, and stop it, and everyone would have to grab a chair.
Oh... personal appearance.<eos> Affairs of the heart.<eos> Entertaining!<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> I'm going to write one column each week, and I'm calling it...
Doc, I just came in because Tracy asked me to come in and see you.<eos> - Spencer, don't panic. - I'm not panicking.<eos> I never panic. Uh, MRI really necessary?<eos> It's only precautionary.<eos> Besides, we won't know if the MRI is necessary until after you take it.
I need that key!<eos> Key?<eos> What? You said key.<eos> What is it a key to?<eos> Give it back to me and I'll find out. And when you do, use this burner.
He asked me the questions I'm afraid to ask of myself.<eos> Well, you can always stay here.<eos> Don't stop now.<eos> Where's my key, Tonkin?<eos> She has agreed to return it.
So you'd know I'm not your door-and-cinder-block, desk-using younger brother anymore.<eos> All right that's sweet.<eos> - What about the chair?<eos> - Totally cramping my style.<eos> Will you take it downstairs?
You know what, you go sit in his chair and tell him you're not leaving<eos> - until he gives you the list. - You got it.<eos> I'll go wait in my chair for the list to show up.<eos> I will wait here in my chair for the list to show up.<eos> This is my chair, and I defend it to the death.
- Doesn't make it any less true.<eos> Rizzoli.<eos> - Isles.<eos> Do you wanna borrow my jacket?<eos> Yeah, put it on and go like this. Makes you feel incredible, like you could do anything.
My mother was only a young girl at the time,<eos> But she never forgot what happened in salem.<eos> And she made sure I would never forget, either.<eos> The puritans believed magic was all around them.<eos> Even those such as kent's coven who sought to do good with it, They still had to hide their identities.
I've got some friends at Halton PD, and they're looking.<eos> She was tracking Castor.<eos> I just... I don't like it.<eos> Yeah, I'm going to go through everything again... criminal databases, military records, known points of contact.<eos> Look, if there's a trail, I'm going to find it.
Come on in.<eos> Feel free to explore.<eos> Oh, we have... my mother's new men's line.<eos> It's minty gleam.<eos> It's her original recipe, but we'll probably update it with a little musk.
Working on his argument to go back in.<eos> Got a stranglehold on him, is what it's got.<eos> I say we blow the espheni hub-of -junk to kingdom come Before it hurts anyone else.<eos> Well, we're keeping ben and everyone else<eos> Away from it for now.
He's a paratrooper.<eos> Henry, don't forget your poem. How could I forget?<eos> You told me 10 times already.<eos> Henry!<eos> Well, I'm not reading it out loud.
Go to bed.<eos> Tessa?<eos> Have you seen my letter from Henry?<eos> I could have sworn I left it right here on the nightstand.<eos> You did. Now I'm putting it back on the nightstand.
I'm so glad you brought them up.<eos> Well, since they themselves have been so public about their treatment with us, I feel we can say they're patients, although I can't divulge specifics.<eos> All right, then. In a general way, what-- what about their case is significant?<eos> Well... let's take, as an example, a real ape taken out of its natural habitat, as a good way of understanding what happened with the Neelys...<eos> Because if you take that ape and damage it in ways that only humans can inflict damage, watch it turn itself into something it's not, then our job is to take those shattered parts and, uh, bring them together,
Like if I put my hand on your desk and then I put a finger in my mouth without thinking, which happens all the time--<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stop that.<eos> I'm just trying to demonstrate that if there's diarrhea on your desk,<eos> I just put it in my mouth.
I've got this.<eos> So four of a kind.<eos> So what's a full house?<eos> The death penalty is undeniably popular.<eos> 32 out of 50 states have it.
So four of a kind.<eos> So what's a full house?<eos> The death penalty is undeniably popular.<eos> 32 out of 50 states have it.<eos> 62% of Americans want it.
Maybe he went for a walk to clear his head.<eos> Maybe, but it's too early for him to be drinking.<eos> Rosalie, what is going on here?<eos> Your home is never this untidy.<eos> Teddy keeps it so neat, like Harry.
You may also wanna look at this.<eos> Whoever's been stripping the car left their tools behind.<eos> I'm thinking they'll probably be back for more. You know what?<eos> Leave it just where it is.<eos> Duke, I want around-the-clock surveillance on it.
It's not here.<eos> We just have to keep looking.<eos> The page was here two hours ago.<eos> It didn't just grow legs and walk out of here on its own.<eos> Unless someone walked out of here with it.
You gave them the forged page Emma made.<eos> Smart kid.<eos> Where's the real one?<eos> Oh, great job.<eos> Mary Margaret and I are gonna take this and keep it safe.
Yes.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm a girl with a great story.<eos> All right. I'm all ears.<eos> I'm sorry. If you want to hear it, you're gonna have to get me out of here first.
This is amazing.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> I have my methods.<eos> And this key?<eos> I mean, my mother never lets it out of her sight.
Which might be good for you, too.<eos> I'm sorry, but I will not succumb to your games.<eos> I know better than to trust you.<eos> I have a wife and child.<eos> We need this home, and we're keeping it!
I can help you.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> And my life is great, thank you very much.<eos> I have an awesome daughter and a loving husband.<eos> The last thing I need is for you to come into my life and just blow it apart again, so...
And now I need you to believe in it, too.<eos> You're right.<eos> Emma.<eos> Hope is a very powerful thing.<eos> Which is why I'm going to have to snuff it out of you and that awful son of yours.
You cover your flank well, My Lord, nearly as swift as myself, a compliment I don't render lightly.<eos> We're alone, Ka.<eos> Dispense with the formalities.<eos> If I have to remind you again, I'll have your head.<eos> Vizier Ay will have it himself if he learns of these excursions.
Your vulnerability is what gives you strength.<eos> Not enough.<eos> You told me at the pyramids you want to be remembered As a great pharaoh.<eos> Greatness cannot only be seen in the eyes of your people, But in the eyes of your enemies as well.<eos> From an enemy who will not see it.
It was just for friends and family and you.<eos> Too late... these gals ate it up.<eos> Oh, like the way Milly in your book gobbled up that stuttering pool boy.<eos> He wasn't a stutterer. He was just nervous 'cause his step-aunt was giving him the old "crooked corkscrew."<eos> Where I'm from, we called it the "little Jack Horner."
Yeah, but it could be better.<eos> You know what you're doing, don't you?<eos> This is my Super Bowl guacamole all over again.<eos> I can't hear that story one more time.<eos> Well, you're gonna hear it.
But I think that Mom's anger is what sustained her.<eos> The energy, the creativity and the passion of those days is really what kept her going.<eos> When she wrote "Mississippi Goddam",<eos> I thought it was something else. You know, I liked it.<eos> They put a 45 out on it. I knew it had a lot of impact.
I knew that we were lost.<eos> I felt chased all the time, no matter what I did or how sad I got.<eos> I felt that there was just no life for me in the country.<eos> I knew I had to quit or I had to leave Andy or do something.<eos> So I took my ring off, put it on the table and I left the country.
- Mike Walsh, nice to know you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Congratulations on the house.<eos> It was a steal.<eos> I knew someone would snap it up.
That's no small thing.<eos> Yeah, it doesn't really feel like a full-time job.<eos> Look, no one knows what the future holds, but if you're an optimist, that... just means anything is possible.<eos> Last time that I knew what I should be doing with my life was the summer that I bought the beach house...<eos> Just fixing it up a little bit at a time.
What's gonna happen if Ana's parents decide they wanna take this baby?<eos> What's going on?<eos> - I went back to see our grandparents.<eos> - Why? She asked them to take this baby.<eos> Moms want it.
People have been pillaging your country's resources since time began.<eos> Someone has to offer a better alternative.<eos> That someone could be you.<eos> Ruslan, there is an endgame here that you don't yet see.<eos> But you see it, don't you, Agent Burke?
But what Mr. Mahoney needs right now is rest.<eos> Spencer?<eos> Spencer, slow down.<eos> There was blood everywhere! Okay?<eos> I threw out the purse, but what if somebody finds it and they turn it in?
He cannot be found.<eos> Of course he can.<eos> He has a weakness.<eos> If you seek the Doctor, first, seek his friends.<eos> Will I get it back after school?
Some really interesting fabrics from tanzania.<eos> I know textiles are your weakness.<eos> I'm gonna go and get the school up on its feet.<eos> I'm gonna get them out of this jam, and then--<eos> And then the next great opportunity's gonna come along, And you're gonna jump on it.
Ben: I thought that Sackett moved - all of his devices to Valley Forge.<eos> - Mostly did. But not all his treasures could fit in his wagon. Including... our way into New York Harbor.<eos> - My God, is this... - Yeah.<eos> Davey Bushnell's underwater machine.<eos> The Turtle, he calls it. The Turtle?
It reminds them of victory and the sacrifice that victory requires.<eos> I can fight.<eos> Let me prove it to you.<eos> And I assure you that my glory will not detract from your own.<eos> It will only enhance it.
I also mended your fence.<eos> What? !<eos> What have you done? !<eos> It was broken.<eos> Yeah. Steve broke it with his face when he was three.
Kono once mentioned you had a friend who worked at Leonard's Bakery. - Is that right?<eos> - Zak.<eos> He's practically ohana.<eos> They make this macadamia nut malasada that Kono loves.<eos> I wanna get her a box. But the thing is they only make it once a year.
You asked to see me, Father?<eos> I owe you a pound.<eos> An honourable man always pays his debts.<eos> One way or another.<eos> Please, give it to the poor in the parish.
Yes, that is... pretty impossible.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I can't make that decision.<eos> I won't! ETHAN:<eos> Then let me make it, Mom.
I saw the wicked... ..condemned to doom.<eos> To damnation.<eos> I saw my own fate.<eos> God is a merciful judge.<eos> There is always redemption for those who truly seek it.
The forecast is for evening showers.<eos> Why don't you take this?<eos> At least let me protect you from the rain.<eos> A reckless offer to make to a thief.<eos> Well, I know that I will get it back when I see you again.
He resisted arrest, assaulted us.<eos> That's GBH, sir.<eos> All right.<eos> Have I.T. grab the best frame they can.<eos> We'll put it out citywide.
No, I don't see you telling me anything.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> All I know is, if one more person puts a microphone in my face, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna say.<eos> But the ice sculpture's all sculpted.<eos> - Now you don't want it?
Are we sure that we've cleaned up all the food and crumbs?<eos> Why is everyone looking at us?<eos> We're the ones who eat up all the crumbs.<eos> Yeah, we're the solution.<eos> Well, there are no ants on my desk because I sanitize it daily.
I'm just trying to figure out how this got on the docket.<eos> Have you all been conferring along the way?<eos> Well, Your Honor, the State believes that if we let this go, we're saying that a grown man can slap a kid.<eos> And the bat was already on the ground.<eos> My God, it wasn't on the ground. He was swinging it around.
There's a thing we say when someone dies.<eos> We say it to the patient's family.
Come on, we got to enjoy this car while we can.<eos> - Hit the gas. - All right.<eos> I'll take it up to the top of my age dating window.<eos> 40.<eos> And I'll take it to the top of mine. 80!
As you can see here, the victim also suffered of severe scoliosis something that usually treated by a doctor.<eos> Then we have some external injuries too. Mm ...<eos> Yes, he seems to have been through a lot.<eos> This is the worst part.<eos> In my opinion of this scar, he sewed it together by himself.
Heaven was many things, but without a doubt it was the greatest family reunion of all.<eos> A holy awe came over me as I stepped forward.<eos> I had no idea what lay ahead. But I sensed that with each step I took, it would grow more wondrous.<eos> And I heard the music.<eos> I can only describe it as a holy swoosh of wings.
Well, in my first moments of consciousness, two things stand out.<eos> First, I was singing.<eos> I don't sing. No.<eos> What a Friend We Have in Jesus.<eos> And the second was that Dick had climbed into the car with me and his hand had gripped mine and held it tight.
You wouldn't.<eos> What would you do?<eos> Third floor, south wing, last room on the right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They started this war on a lie and they sustain it on lies.
- We'd actually be safer assaulting the headquarters?<eos> - Safe is relative.<eos> - The building's vulnerable.<eos> The Gestapo just moved in, and it's not as fortified as it will be.<eos> Now, the SS have confiscated Balik's weapons research, and they're transporting it by courier to their team - of physicists in Berlin. - Which courrier?
How do you hack someone's password?<eos> You study them, you understand what's important. Ok.<eos> So the same thing here.<eos> He wouldn't have picked a random phrase.<eos> He would have picked it from a source that meant something to him.
Do we think this is a homicide or an accident?<eos> Or neither?<eos> I figure we should wait for the M.E. report.<eos> Why don't we check out his place?<eos> Hopefully, one of these keys will open it up.
We've been singing this song like it only belonged to us, when every city in America's had its lips on it!<eos> Even Des Moines.<eos> Wait a minute. This song was supposedly written by former Mayor Moleman!<eos> Oh, I didn't write it.<eos> I bought it from a salesman who was selling it to half the towns in America.
Yeah, but none who can actually figure out what's really going on, which is what we have to do if we hope to get us back.<eos> And back home.<eos> What? You don't like my houseboat?<eos> Well... I do have a lot of good memories here, but it's not where we live.<eos> Besides, I thought you were gonna sell it.
Besides, I thought you were gonna sell it.<eos> I am, I just...<eos> I haven't got around to it yet.<eos> If you hadn't noticed, I've been a little busy.<eos> You're not secretly holding onto it as a safety net in case you and me don't work out, are you?
You okay? Yeah, actually, that was fun.<eos> She kicked ass.<eos> Don't ever lose that part of you. Especially in a marriage.<eos> Flash drive?<eos> We'll take it to DHS, see if they can I.D. any of the suspects.
Someone hurt me too.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I recognized the necklace right away.<eos> Lucy wore it all the time, and...
- I hear L'il Wayne may be a free agent soon.<eos> Oh, yeah? So, who do you got in the streets in your ear, Mimi?<eos> - Don't you worry your pretty little weave about that. - Okay.<eos> No, what I'd really like to know is, why do you want to depose Lucious?<eos> He's lost his way, and I need to get my company back before he destroys it, or destroys my family.
I kept everything.<eos> Do you know I still have a Facebook page?<eos> People wrote the nicest stuff about me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I used to look at it sometimes.
You afraid of the dark?<eos> You know what I used to do when I was afraid?<eos> I would sing a song inside my head.<eos> You should try it.<eos> You know, just pick a song and then sing it inside your head until you fall asleep, okay?
It means we both bring our baggage and our eccentricities into this union, and it is our job to respect each other's quirks...<eos> Among mine, being my family.<eos> And mine?<eos> Well... How about the fact...<eos> That you keep losing your wedding ring and I find it all over the house and I return it back to you without once asking you why you keep taking it off?
Just remember, Detective. You came to me.<eos> Theo Galavan will be the mayor of Gotham.<eos> A crowd has gathered outside, and the excitement is brimming, and in just a moment, we'll also be talking to many of the supporters that gave up their time and effort to support...<eos> What do you have against the front door? Nothing.<eos> It's the ape who opens it who I could live without.
Ugh. You drank a soda?<eos> Not sure that's the worst thing in the world.<eos> It was the worst thing in the world... worse than a fruit-forward Riesling.<eos> No, I'm not exaggerating.<eos> Anyhow, I cleverly ditched the crown in a trash can... wait a minute... so as to not arouse suspicion and then retrieve it.
The Ministry of Time.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Be careful you don't slip. It's quite the fall.<eos> Spanish civil servants from different time periods work here with keeping history unchanged as their mission.<eos> Our civil servants travel to the period when a time alteration has happened and fix it.
She's his lover, it seems.<eos> Dolores de Villamejor, an aristocrat who lived in the West Indies.<eos> - West Indies?<eos> What's that? - America.<eos> He has a bedchamber at his disposal all year long whether he's occupying it or not.
I'm gonna be good, man.<eos> I'm gonna be good.<eos> Because every time I feel that temptation, all I need to do is look in my wife's eyes, and she sings to me.<eos> You know that old song, "Erie canal"?<eos> I don't know what it is about that song, man, but every time I hear it, I don't crave the nose sugar anymore.
Nothing.<eos> Don't you see? He was doing just fine before we stepped in.<eos> He was on the next plane back to Africa.<eos> Well, better on the way to Africa than on the way to bankruptcy.<eos> Well, actually, bankruptcy is not as big a deal as everybody makes of it.
Maybe you see me and think, "Where is this young man going?"<eos> Maybe it'll be hard for me to talk about it... but I Want to go to a place Where we can all raise awareness.<eos> I could steal from you now, but I won't because I don't do that anymore.<eos> Look. Maybe you haven't seen the light.<eos> When you consume that light, you don't see it.

But, more importantly, it's my rollout as the congressman's girlfriend.<eos> I never thought I'd be this happy.<eos> Okay, well, remember this feeling and never let it go...<eos> You're just like a little hallmark card, aren't you?<eos> We got to get that file back before the congressman sees it.
And I'm offering you an opportunity to prove that you are still an effective team.<eos> I have a job for you.<eos> It's a Traugott research facility.<eos> Our intelligence indicates they're about to make a major discovery.<eos> And you want us to steal it.
Previously on Dark Matter...<eos> It's a Traugott research facility.<eos> Our intelligence indicates they're about to make a major discovery.<eos> And you want us to steal it.
Dad, why would you do that?<eos> This is really embarrassing, um, but I started the paleo diet, because I'm back on the dating scene now, and I-I wanted to lose some weight.<eos> But I'm on a teacher's salary, and I can't afford meat, and that freezer, it's got chicken, burgers, ribs, there's whole sides of beef just hanging on hooks, and you girls don't even eat.<eos> So I figured I'd just make sure that none of it went to waste.<eos> I'll return it.
[Max imitating dog barking] Fine, I'm going.<eos> This is why I never leave Manhattan.<eos> Hey, you need to get in the girls' apartment?<eos> I have a key.<eos> Find it here in my big bag.
Alonso.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You thought I would allow them to kill you?<eos> You're insane.<eos> The gate is too far away, we'll never reach it.
I will begin immediately, provided that no one interferes with my right to speak to any person, Dante, John Clarkson's butler, included.<eos> I want you to know that it was not my plan to prevent you from getting to know Dante.<eos> Blame me if you like, but please understand there can be no whiff of suggestion that your story has been influenced by the blacks of London.<eos> This could cause great damage.<eos> If I give my account and I will give all of it... it will be on my terms, and my terms only.
We have killed ourselves crossing the ocean so some Africans can eat us in soup?<eos> No one has to go.<eos> If Mr. Shackspear distrusts this offer, then he's perfectly welcome to stay here.<eos> But we need 1,000 people.<eos> The abolitionists who have commissioned me to carry out this mission, will not finance it unless we can establish a sizeable community of free negroes in the Sierra Leone.
- Let's go. Madrid is full of spies.<eos> And Juan and Luis?<eos> - They're safe.<eos> Leave immediately for Montserrat.<eos> Destroy that door before the Nazis find it.
There's a Frank Miller?<eos> - He wrote "Batman."<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> See, that's why we live in a bubble now... me, Thom, Jules.<eos> We've got this happy little family and I don't want the world fuckin' with it.
You're selling yourself short.<eos> It's phenomenal.<eos> It's called Cashmere Burka, And it's all about Gwen's life.<eos> Well, I'm sure you have a prior commitment.<eos> Oh, no, on the contrary, I wouldn't miss it for anything in the world.
Well, you know, he's the commissioner now, so, he might be busy.<eos> You should be wearing it.<eos> Oh, I'm not going to wear it.<eos> No, no, come on.<eos> My God, if I had a medal, I would wear it all the time.
Kinda dicks, right?<eos> - Right?<eos> - Totally.<eos> Okay, now enter the command sequence string.<eos> Okay good, now once you've... entered that... wow, still working on it.
It's not near his home.<eos> Perhaps it's near his new business.<eos> This stain is horchata.<eos> Specifically, Salvadoran horchata.<eos> The morro seeds give it away.
So they sell it on.<eos> They sell the debt?<eos> To who?<eos> Why would anyone buy an unpaid bill?<eos> Because you can get it at a steep discount.
Why so serious?<eos> It's just a bit of fun.<eos> Let's get out of this mausoleum and find some proper women.<eos> You're far too choosy.<eos> My friend doesn't know ripe fruit when he sees it.
I'd like to hire a photocopy machine.<eos> - OK.<eos> That's OK.<eos> - Possibly for six months.<eos> - Yes, why not? Um... If you like it for one year, one for...
The Russians put a sniper on one of the main roads in Kabul.<eos> But Amin's convoy drove too fast and the sniper missed.<eos> They tried again.<eos> This time they put poison in Amin's can of Pepsi in the presidential palace.<eos> But his nephew drank it instead... and died.
The cure.<eos> The cure to vampirism.<eos> I knew you were planning on getting it yourself. You had the whole route mapped down to the kilometer.<eos> Why are you giving me this?<eos> Because my mom's surprisingly happy as a vampire, and because I have full faith that we'll get Caroline back to normal the old-fashioned way, but mostly because I knew you wanted it for Elena.

Hurry with the smashing!<eos> Love your school!<eos> If my scans are correct, the realm of Asgard is actually bleeding into our own.<eos> I'm getting the same readings, Falcon.<eos> I'm more concerned about who's using the space stone. And where they're using it from.
Thor: Mystical creatures that feed on electricity.<eos> How these two got here, I've no idea.<eos> If we don't stop them, they'll send Earth into the stone age.<eos> Magic isn't real, Thor.<eos> I'm not buyin' it!
This is Mitch.<eos> I'm somewhere else right now.<eos> See that?<eos> He's somewhere else right now.<eos> That walkie-talkie probably has a tape recorder in it, and you tape-recorded Mitch's voice earlier and now you're just playing it.
You know this isn't about that.<eos> Harvey laid it on the line with Daniel, and you didn't have his back.<eos> Donna, I've had Harvey's back since the day I met him.<eos> For your information, when I found out what Daniel was up to, I had him guarantee partnership was on the table.<eos> And then you let him give it to the wrong man.
A couple of weeks ago, after you left the party with the twins, these Scandinavian girls showed up...<eos> Make a left here.<eos> From Denmark or Sweden...<eos> They were really tall!<eos> So I was driving them to my dad's boat. I'm using it while I work for him...
On Page 15 you get a joke.<eos> The giraffe joke?<eos> Fuck off.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I'll take it.
Hold still!<eos> There are two ways to do this:<eos> the easy way or the hard way.<eos> The easy way!<eos> Are you giving me the vial or do I get it myself?
With the wide radio call, We've hopefully given a large enough number of people enough time to make it to the port.<eos> As we pull in to shore, you'll all be given booster shots to compliment the vaccinations already running through your bodies.<eos> Within an hour, these boosters will make you vessels for the contagious cure.<eos> For how long?<eos> You'll be contagious for five to eight days, during which time, it is imperative that you pass it on to as many people as possible, who will then have five to eight days to do the same, and so on.
Just give me everything you've got.<eos> This is the last of it.<eos> There's got to be thousands shown up by now, boss.<eos> Jeffrey thinks they had a shabby crowd at Vicksburg.<eos> After this, the only Americans who show up to greet that ship will be looking to sink it.
Tom.<eos> Every shoeless shepherd, every farm boy dreaming on a haystack, even every clerk with slicked back hair finds love, except me.<eos> Well, if it's love you're looking for, Sam, this is hardly the place to find it.<eos> What I find here is consolation.<eos> Doc, I left a bottle of whiskey under the bed. Would you be good enough to fetch it for me?
Now it becomes my duty to make presentation of this sword, this emblem of my past office.<eos> I have worn it with some humble pretensions in defense of my country.<eos> Should danger again call, I expect to resume it, and I will respond to that call with my blood and my life.<eos> (Santa Anna) I lost.<eos> So if they want my head, let them have it.
So instead of being the evil plastic bottle makers,<eos> Nestle becomes the voice of environmentalism.<eos> "We just want you to have clean water. But there isn't any.<eos> So we go out, we find it,<eos> - and we bring it to your supermarket."
- Read it?<eos> - No.<eos> - Get it on your iPad?<eos> - No.<eos> Then how come you don't want it?
- Oh, I kind of wanted--<eos> - My dad gave that to us.<eos> I know, but...<eos> I remember you nursing Matthew in that.<eos> How about I get it on weekends?
I'm sorry, "squished"?<eos> Has anyone told you what's gonna happen in there?<eos> Well, my wife tried, but I put a pillow over my head.<eos> It takes five minutes.<eos> They put your breasts on a plate of glass, position it, then another plate comes down.
- I didn't make a damn bit of difference.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - And you did it with this camera.<eos> - Aw, come on, what are you doing with that?<eos> I'm giving it back to you.
You know, Kate?<eos> You're right. Should we get a drink?<eos> Yes.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> Anytime I suggest anything to Annie, she ignores me, but then Kay will suggest the exact same thing and she immediately does it.
You're doing good, it's going good, just keep pushing.<eos> How much longer?<eos> You're doing fine, just take a breath.<eos> Doctor. It's okay. The heart rate's dropped from 160 to 120.<eos> Keep an eye on it.
I'm dealing with this side of things now.<eos> Got a problem with that? I do.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> That's my camera.<eos> How about I take the film out, expose it, give it back to you?
Dude, that's his new phone.<eos> Which I can search, according to the terms of your probation.<eos> If you've got any questions about the legality of all this, we can call your probation officer right now and go over the details.<eos> It's nice weather, huh?<eos> Once you slide that bag my way, I will take it and walk away.
All right.<eos> So, this Dwight Brisco guy said he got the anti-depressants from inside here?<eos> He also said Hector's still alive, so I'm not sure how reliable he is.<eos> So, you're taking this search pretty seriously.<eos> Of course I'm taking it seriously.
And don't miss the bus.<eos> Sorry, Kyle.<eos> Wait, what are we gonna do about the car?<eos> Taylor, it's just a dent, we can get it fixed. When?<eos> I don't want mom and dad to see it.
So... back in the mid-90s, I'm in Vegas.<eos> And I'm tweaking. I'm outta money.<eos> And that, that caused me to do the most dumb-ass thing I've ever done in my life.<eos> I'm staying at this hotel and there's this huge jewellery convention, stalls and booths, with like thousands and thousands of dollars worth of gold and silver and diamonds.<eos> And at the end of each day, they just pack up all their stuff and they carry it up to their rooms.
Cabals.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, sinister cabals!<eos> I bet the royal palace is lousy with them.<eos> So instead of trying to undermine the mission... Don't undermine it!
Well, we'll find out. When she's about to be convicted and I offer her a deal.<eos> What happens now?<eos> What happens now is we go in there tomorrow and enter a plea of not guilty.<eos> But I am guilty.<eos> Donna, intent to commit fraud is a bullshit charge and he's just using it to try to scare you.
She's not going to, so what difference does it make?<eos> The difference is, if you're out of the picture, Wolf backs down.<eos> From where he's standing, I'm in the picture and he's never going to back down.<eos> You don't know that and this is Donna's life.<eos> And I'm not putting it in your hands.
You know, I always thought that I'd write a book that would make people see sports differently, like Moneyball or Seabiscuit.<eos> But instead, I'm cranking out a book about a guy who has two talents... catching baseballs and not catching chlamydia.<eos> I wasn't trying to upset you.<eos> I honestly thought I was being helpful.<eos> It's funny, you live in denial for so long, you can't see the sad truth about yourself until someone shoves it in your face. DANI:
Then, we come to the engine.<eos> Like the McLaren and the Porsche, LaFerrari is a hybrid - it has a petrol engine AND an electric motor to drive the wheels. BUT... whereas the other two can be driven on electric power alone, like a Toyota Prius, the Ferrari can't, because, Ferrari say,<eos> "We are not interested in electric cars."<eos> Instead, the battery and electric motor combination works a bit like the kinetic energy recovery system in an F1 car.<eos> In very simple terms, it captures energy that's normally wasted - during braking, for example - and keeps it for when you need it.
It's before noon, so I went with a crisp Chablis. Here we go.<eos> I don't know if I should drink coffee.<eos> My stomach is rumbling around like a dryer with one tennis shoe in it.<eos> I told you not to eat that gas station sushi!<eos> But I figured I'd be safe. The guy who owns it is Japanese.
And I don't know... I just felt crazy. The ups, the downs...<eos> I wanted it to stop.<eos> And the pill regulates it, and lets me just concentrate on my writing.<eos> Well, you've been back for months.<eos> Why are you still on it?
What is it?<eos> Damn!<eos> My card.<eos> I forgot it in the morgue.<eos> - I can get it tomorrow.
- Shut it, Kevin. I hope it's a girl. I want a little sister.<eos> Whoa, let's not tear into that like it's a gas bill.<eos> Don't you want to know?<eos> Well, there's this new thing people are doing... a gender reveal party.<eos> You send a bakery a sealed envelope, and they make a cake... pink or blue... and cover it with white icing, and when you cut into it at the party, everyone finds out the sex of the baby together.
It's actually Caroline writing about her affair with Clay.<eos> This is complete fiction.<eos> Here, Clay was with me on new year's Eve, not her.<eos> And here, he hates BlackBerry jam.<eos> He would never eat it off of anything.
Majesty... Do you wish the body brought to St Pauls?<eos> We will lay her to rest in Peterborough.<eos> It will cost less.<eos> She sent me a letter.<eos> I don't want it.
They have to be lined up perfectly if we're gonna try and direct the energy from that room, bounce it - all the way down the hallway into that room there.<eos> Got it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, that's the plan.<eos> We take the thermal burst from a direct sunblast, bounce it off a couple mirrors into a door, focusing it up through the storm, where it should burn off the cold air and break the cycle.
Wait, how did you guys get... wait. What? !<eos> You had a team-up with him?<eos> I... had to find you and warn you that Ray is not just pulling things from the Library.<eos> - He... - Is the Library.<eos> Pretty sure I was about to say he's destroying it.
You can't feel. You don't pay the price, but you can't feel it either.<eos> Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Eternal life in a numb chase.<eos> That is why I hate you people so much.<eos> You can feel, and instead you just watch.<eos> You take mortality for granted and so you don't deserve it.
Oh, I think I'm coming down with something.<eos> I was scrubbing the kitchen sink all afternoon, and now my fingers are numb.<eos> Were you using that illegal Chinese cleaning powder again?<eos> It's not illegal in China.<eos> And it didn't kill those children who made it.
In the spirit of sportsmanship, you may go first.<eos> Ah, your first mistake.<eos> Once I get on a roll...<eos> The cellist strikes!<eos> I make it, so I take it.
- Michael. - Who's this now?<eos> - My lawyer.<eos> I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies.<eos> It's called Brad's law.<eos> We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point, you're performing it on venison.
I listened to the birds.<eos> I cleaned up files on my computer after dinner, then I slept.<eos> I tried not to dream.<eos> And every morning after I woke up, I wrote a letter to my wife and son.<eos> And I folded the letter up, and I put it on the bookshelf.
Oh, it's not what you think, Terry.<eos> I-I-I just manage the joint.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> So, uh, who are you managing it for?
Be smart about the money.<eos> I'm doing just like you told me.<eos> I put half in the bank in my mother's name.<eos> And the other half?<eos> Where nobody can find it.
No matter what happens, you're not responsible.<eos> - HENRY:<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - What just happened?<eos> - Will you please sit on my suitcase while I close it?
For her art stuff.<eos> She was my first client.<eos> Only client.<eos> Yeah, so far.<eos> Jasper taught her a bit of taxidermy and she put her own spin on it.
They want to know everybody's business, all the time.<eos> The bomb I just dropped on him, there's no way we don't get a reaction.<eos> - What does a reaction look like?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> We'll know when we see it, though.
But it won't be enough.<eos> It hasn't worked because you're still choosing faces like his.<eos> It's the wrong reason.<eos> Looks fade, get old, yours already are!<eos> You know, I'm getting more and more bored of that perfect face every second I look at it.
Hey! When you're trying to recover from a soul-shattering disease that destroys you and everything you love, then you can have a brownie!<eos> So what's up?<eos> I was just...<eos> Okay, this is a little weird, but, um... when we were married, how would you describe our... sexual relationship?<eos> (chuckles) How would I describe it to you or how would I describe it to my friends?
We always had to keep Bob on message.<eos> Uh, "You were afraid of him.<eos> "You were afraid of what he would do, "and you knew you had to get your hands on that gun or something could happen to you."<eos> That was the case.<eos> So, we had the gun like this, and he was pushing it like that, and then we fell.
If you're doing this case by yourself to teach me a lesson... you don't have to, okay?<eos> -How'd you find me? -Ah.<eos> I took an etching off your notepad.<eos> Then I decided to take a crack at the St. Louis suicide house.<eos> So you know about it?
~ Yeah.<eos> That's actually well spotted.<eos> Two-seater sports coupe. And they say, and I'm quoting now, that "It is..." Er, make sure I get the quote right.<eos> ".. unmistakably a Bentley."<eos> But if you look at it from the side, I think you'll agree that is unmistakably an Aston Martin.
Call me when this makes a little bit more sense.<eos> I'm still trying to wrap my head around this whole idea of time travel.<eos> There is, uh, one problem that remains.<eos> If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth, there is a breach somewhere in Central City that we need to find and close for good.<eos> Yeah, but how do we find it?
Apparently, it's based on his ex-wife.<eos> Except the cake didn't leave in the middle of the night.<eos> No! No.<eos> Look, I'm hungry and I want cake, but I feel like it would be a sex crime to eat this thing.<eos> OK, maybe I can cut it when no-one is looking.
What now?<eos> Jeanette?<eos> - I lost the bag.<eos> - What?<eos> There were some men who drove up beside me and just took it.
A car was stolen the morning they disappeared.<eos> Ten minutes from our house.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> - It's a six-year-old car theft. - Is that it?<eos> Even if we find it, the chance that it will lead to anything is minimal.
What are you complaining about?<eos> You passed.<eos> I did?<eos> I told you it would work.<eos> If you can't beat the machine, you wear it down.
Nothing.<eos> Let's just get through this joyous occasion.<eos> You ingrate.<eos> After all I've done for you, you can't put in a good word for me at that crappy diner?<eos> Oh, believe me, Ma, if I could find a good word, I'd put it in.
My battery's fried.<eos> Just leave it.<eos> Aw man, that song.<eos> We used to play this when I was ridin' around in the caiman in Iraq.<eos> Was playing it when we hit an IED, blew the whole damn floor out.
Are you intending to go for your walk tonight?<eos> I am, Father.<eos> If you feel... anxious in any way, come straight home.<eos> Yes, Father.<eos> The key didn't belong to us, so naturally my father handed it in to the police.
~ The transcript has not been completed.<eos> But the blame for that lies not with Mr Higgins, rather it lies with you, Mr Wood, and your employer, Mr Bray.<eos> ~ Surely the transcript is a matter for public record?<eos> ~ And he will have it.<eos> The question is, why does he want it?
And in so doing, exonerating your son.<eos> George is innocent and I mean to prove it.<eos> Let's go back in the house.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Why would they take my doll and return it so many years later?
That's the sketch based on Jesse's description.<eos> Now all we need is a name. Hmm.<eos> Forensics on Ken's murder weapon are a wash. The gun was wiped clean of prints, and the only prints on the shell casings were Ken's.<eos> Ken was killed by his own gun?<eos> So either Ken's killer disarmed him, or knew where Ken kept it.
You aren't going to get rid of it?<eos> Then I, too, won't wear the neck tie.<eos> -Are you a kid?<eos> Put it back on quickly.<eos> This is the company.-I won't wear it.
-Are you a kid?<eos> Put it back on quickly.<eos> This is the company.-I won't wear it.<eos> -Wear it.<eos> -I won't wear it.
I am going to be making a call of my own.<eos> I'm calling your boss.<eos> Okay, but you're still gonna need to step out of the vehicle, ma'am.<eos> I will not.<eos> I don't think you wanna be in there when they tow it.
Amen.<eos> We were--<eos> Michael has asked to say a few words.<eos> My mom tells a story.<eos> A lot of you have probably heard it.
You still work for me.<eos> For the next several hours anyway, right?<eos> Um... yeah.<eos> Till 5:00.<eos> So, there's this invisible submarine... a super weapon... it's just sitting there, letting us look at it.
Lay bare her back.<eos> Cut the cloth, if need be, and hold her still.<eos> Please, have mercy.<eos> This top was a present.<eos> Let me but take it off carefully. There's no need to ruin it!
Fine. So, you didn't really encourage me to take risks, and so I told Sue that's what I would do differently as a parent.<eos> I mean, I didn't realize I was holding you back so much.<eos> That's not what I'm saying!<eos> Oh. We have a table of six for the Heck party.<eos> [Sighs] I wouldn't call it a party.
I'm just having some mom fun.<eos> Getting through the day...<eos> Joking again!<eos> Of course I brought the axe.<eos> So, shall we lob it off?
On doors he imports from Peru.<eos> What, like hollow doors?<eos> No, no, that's too obvious.<eos> He takes cocaine sulfate liquid. And spray it on the doors, like a lacquer.<eos> Then at this end, they take cheese graters, scrape it off, put it in an acid bath, and render it into cocaine hydrochloride.
This isn't about Kai anymore.<eos> The people that that this would free are a million times stronger than him and us, and don't get me started on the fun they would have with a newly human Elena.<eos> My mom has the cure, Bonnie.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> If I don't bring her that, she's gonna destroy it.
Bonnie's mom or Caroline.<eos> Already tried to pawn it off.<eos> Then I'm sure there's a long list of vampires who would give anything for a do-over.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena.<eos> Well, I don't want it, Damon.
Then I'm sure there's a long list of vampires who would give anything for a do-over.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena.<eos> Well, I don't want it, Damon.<eos> I don't want to live without you either.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena, and I'm gonna take it with you.
I left it out for you to find since Damon was never going to offer it to you.<eos> Why would you keep it a secret from me?<eos> I'm so in love with you and I don't want to lose you.<eos> I don't want to live without you either.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena, and I'm gonna take it with you.
Did you mean it when you told me you'd take the cure, or were you just afraid that you were gonna lose me?<eos> Honestly, a bit of both.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, here's what I'm afraid of.<eos> I'm afraid that if you do take it you'll lose something else that you love, being a vampire, and we're not gonna be happy if you resent me
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> The cure to vampirism.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena, and I'm gonna take it with you.
Where the hell are you?<eos> Bonnie and Matt are already M.I.A., and now you and Damon?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> This is a wedding.<eos> This is supposed to be Jo's magical night, and you are ruining it.
Lorenzo...<eos> It's our family.<eos> You think she'll be safe here?<eos> If word gets out that her body has the cure inside, every vampire who wants to be a human will come busting in through that door.<eos> Bonnie will spell it shut.
I refuse to surrender.<eos> My reign will not end without a fight.<eos> Doesn't Mary's life mean anything to you?<eos> It means a great deal.<eos> Which is why you're the last man I'd entrust it to.
I was wondering that too. Until I realized that every single attempt to destroy the dome has come from the outside.<eos> So what if the only way to bring it down comes from the inside?<eos> Let me just find the page...<eos> Sam, with the right frequency and amplitude, it's possible that the dome could shatter, like an opera singer breaking a glass with her voice.<eos> Let me just find it here...

Very well.<eos> How ready are you to get your new version of the cure out into the world?<eos> As I mentioned before, as soon as we safely land in a highly populated area, anyone carrying the new, contagious version will be able to spread the cure via close contact...<eos> A handshake... Or a hug.<eos> If each of us carries the cure to even two people, who then pass it on to two more people, we'll start a chain reaction that even Ramsey won't be able to stop.
They've gone beyond simple text messages from phone to phone.<eos> This is a vast network.<eos> The sub's running low on weaponry, and they've missed us twice.<eos> Now counting on civilians for help.<eos> So we get into the network, and we shut it down.

- Did you just knock over my lamp?<eos> I was sitting here and the thing just falls... 'cause the wind...<eos> - Okay, it's not a big deal, I'll...<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Tandy knocked over the lamp and Tandy's gonna pick it up.
So now, you're giving up fashion design to become... - what?<eos> A hero?<eos> - I'm not giving up my art.<eos> The truth is... that jerk I stabbed in the hand... he was right.<eos> My work lacked identity, because I didn't have it.
Good.<eos> So, about this cake...<eos> If you could give me a hand, it is quite heavy.<eos> Don't be leaving this lying around, Jim.<eos> Wouldn't want Katie putting it on by accident.
The judicial process has been suspended in favour of military tribunals.<eos> - Your chances of getting a fair trial are zero.<eos> - I have rights! No, Rhonda, you don't have any rights whatsoever.<eos> The State will seek the death penalty for you.<eos> And what's more, they'll probably get it.
On October 28th, 1929, the U.S. stock market crashes, losing billions of dollars in just one day.<eos> It's the worst economic disaster the country has ever seen.<eos> Nine thousand banks fail, and one in four Americans are unemployed.<eos> But while most people see the great depression as a time of hopelessness,<eos> Luciano sees it as a new opportunity.
Which results in car overboard.<eos> If that bird flies off...<eos> Walter dies.<eos> Guys, the car's starting to tilt... ever so downward.<eos> We're aware of the situation, and handling it.
Scholars call it the Wishing Cup.<eos> You need to acquire this cup.<eos> It's more of a chalice, actually.<eos> It's gonna be heavily guarded, but you need to get it any way you can.<eos> Because once you do, you need to fill it with your cum, Kevin.

Miracle.<eos> Jarden.<eos> What?<eos> The town is Jarden.<eos> Miracle is the national park that surrounds and protects it from those who would corrupt its exceptional properties.
Carries the mummified remains of the holy priest that founded this town like 200 years ago.<eos> It's sacred. No one disturbs it.<eos> Very clever... you hide it in a box that no one will touch.<eos> But, then, where the hell's the box?<eos> _ ...as part of the celebration, then they take it to a cemetery.
'Cause only Ukrainians drink Horilka?<eos> No one's made radio tubes like that since World War II.<eos> This is a Soviet bunker.<eos> We always loved our history.<eos> I just don't want you to repeat it.
Have you been offered some tea?<eos> I've learned you have in your employment Juliana Crain.<eos> Yes. That's correct.<eos> She is the sister to a known subversive.<eos> Thank you for the information. I will take it seriously.
Thank you.<eos> The pistol is our prized possession.<eos> Colt .44 from 1860.<eos> Issued to the Union Army.<eos> Boys in blue brought it into the second Bull Run.
I'm going dancing.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> So what color is my new ride, anyway?<eos> Maybe talk to him, convince him to give your car back.<eos> Or maybe I find the guy and I hold him at gunpoint... or bow-and-arrow point and I make him give it back.
Very well, then.<eos> If the good doctor will not perform for you, I am more than happy to play his role.<eos> Ladies and... gentlemen...<eos> If you will indulge me a moment.<eos> I have a-a question to put to miss Hale, and, um, I ask it in the sight of god and all of Salem's finest.
There's a Towels Stuff in that mall where Gretchen can buy a toothbrush and other things adults own.<eos> You're gonna help me shop?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> I'm going for literary inspiration.<eos> I'm not finding it here, so maybe I'll find it amongst the diabetic masses of the American shopper.
I'll replace it, of course.<eos> - No, don't you dare!<eos> No, I despise that lamp with a passion.<eos> Adam's great aunt gave us that as a wedding gift, and try as I have over the years to get rid of it, Adam insists we can't, in the event that she visits and expects to see it.<eos> Then I'll replace it with a different one.
Before, I couldn't even consider the thought without feeling pissed off or depressed,<eos> But my perspective has changed.<eos> You can still get the transplant.<eos> You can have your normal life back.<eos> I don't want it back.
♪ Until I smile ♪ ♪ At you ♪<eos> ♪ I'll never laugh again... ♪<eos> Sinatra: Ruth Lowe, who was a Canadian woman, her husband got killed. He was a Canadian flier.<eos> Right in the beginning of the war, he got killed.<eos> She wrote that song and brought it down, personally, to New York.
Teachout: There was an enormous sense of foreboding in the American psyche immediately after the war.<eos> What was going to happen next?<eos> Would we really be able to sustain the peace that we finally achieved in 1945?<eos> Or was the roof going to fall in on us even more than it had before?<eos> You see anxiety in abstract expressionist painting, you see it in bee-bop, a jazz of extreme intensity of style, but American commercial popular music responded to this anxiety with the musical equivalent of comfort food.
I can't imagine you'd just let folks walk away.<eos> The control you have over this neighborhood?<eos> Look, I'm no saint, all right?<eos> But hurting Triva?<eos> I'm about lifting up my community, either through someone like Marco getting out or someone like Triva building it up from within.
He had to marry the girl he met while she was peddling Jell-o shots in hot pants at the Husky Hole.<eos> Don't let this thing turn into one of "your things," okay?<eos> Are we done?<eos> Because I want to get back to the babysitter show.<eos> I bet when no one is around to see it, she yells and berates those poor girls.
Capri?<eos> I think Catalina is a little more our budget.<eos> I like Catalina.<eos> I do too, as long as you're there.<eos> Are you sure we can afford it?
Something we can assume he's done before.<eos> Are you saying he planted the hoodie?<eos> Of course he did.<eos> That's what he does.<eos> He wanted you to find it.
We're all on the watch lists, our pictures are everywhere.<eos> I don't think my picture is on any... watch list.<eos> Not as of this morning, Malik.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you can get a gun in there, with Allah's help... I will fire it.
Hey Josh, it's laundry day.<eos> Hint hint.<eos> And by hint hint, I mean take off the damn shirt because you stink.<eos> Sorry, Yolanda.<eos> Not taking it off.
(Lindsay) It's mine.<eos> (Amaro) Locked.<eos> Nothing. No body.<eos> I gave her that scarf.<eos> She left it for us to find.
- You put out alerts?<eos> - Yeah, his photo, hers too.<eos> Flagged both their credit cards.<eos> Also checking for stolen cards along the way.<eos> Okay, as soon as you can confirm his new license plate, we'll broadcast it.
(Amaro) Locked.<eos> Nothing.<eos> No body.<eos> I gave her that scarf.<eos> She left it for us to find.
"The Presentation Cup," if indeed this is the genuine article, is here.<eos> Wait a second, are you into hockey?<eos> What I'm "into," Watson, is the possibility that the Cup was stolen.<eos> It travels under the constant supervision of its keeper, so opportunities to nick it are very, very rare.<eos> If it is the real Cup, I shall return it to the National Hockey League with all due haste.
Detergent.<eos> [man 3] Deodorant?<eos> Soda? - Kool-Aid mix?<eos> - No.<eos> They'd take a syringe and put it in and they were happy to see me.
I mean, you do realise that falsely accusing corrections personnel, that carries very serious consequences, yes?<eos> Was there something else?<eos> The LSD in her system caused the psychosis, but she's come down now.<eos> So, I think she is ready for release from the Psych Unit. I appreciate your opinion.<eos> Meaning you're ignoring it.
Hathorne, listen to me. This is much bigger than our rivalry over Anne Hale.<eos> I am not here as a man but as a magistrate... To do my duty.<eos> Then let me stay here.<eos> As magistrate, it is your duty to protect this village.<eos> I have proof that the witches spread this pox and will use it to damn all of our souls to Hell.
Why haven't you gone to the Board?<eos> Because I can't prove it.<eos> Ferguson made sure that Jodie Spiteri is not a viable witness.<eos> So we just have to wait for her to do something else?<eos> If I find proof and I go to the Board with it, will you support me?
You've never taken any of the other kids.<eos> I know.<eos> Maybe I should.<eos> We've got a gun in the house.<eos> I know I keep it locked up, but, you know, it's not a bad thing to teach them about gun safety, especially if they're curious.
You want to know about Alice or not?<eos> You do.<eos> So write about me, okay?<eos> You agree to tell my side of the story, or you don't get shit.<eos> And if you give me your word, you'd better keep it, too, okay?
How do you even know Scheibe? - Do you play?<eos> - No.<eos> No, somebody I used to know, she played him a lot.<eos> Okay, you want the gun, Charlie?<eos> - I'll give it to you. - All right.
- Ah, so what?<eos> You want to answer directly to Charlie Isaacs?<eos> I'd rather report to a guy who reports to a guy who only has to see his pretty-boy face once a month.<eos> I mean, we practically invented implosion.<eos> G group's going to test it.
Sorry.<eos> Oh... Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was looking for, erm, Simon's schedule.<eos> I couldn't find it anywhere.
- How can I help?<eos> - Well, uh, we checked with security, and I understand that most employees enter and exit through the front door, but apparently there's also - a private V.I.P entrance?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Sid had it installed for the actors so they could come and go with more privacy. Are there any security cameras on that private entrance?<eos> They're actors, so they also use it to do other things, like...
Do what I do-- I sleep in it.<eos> Like a pig who lives in his own slop.<eos> In this case, Meegan's slop.<eos> Is the Andre and Meegan thing gonna replace the Pete and Kevin thing?<eos> No, I look at it as an addition to a beautiful house that I'm building over time.
What?<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> But a home... a home is more fragile than that.<eos> A home is made of the people you fill it with.
(Sniffs harder) I smell rich people things.<eos> Ooh, is it a swag bag?<eos> Please tell me it's a swag bag.<eos> Maybe. Wait, I don't get it.<eos> What's going on? Every time I go to a big event I get this gift bag full of really cool stuff and I let Elliot and Yolanda divvy it up.
Oh!<eos> Is this Gucci purse under $20?<eos> Uh, no. But you know what is?<eos> - What?<eos> - A picture of you wearing it.
I've capped the amount it affects any one partner.<eos> You've got to be shitting me.<eos> Now, I know you're wondering why I'm proposing this.<eos> It's crystal clear why you're proposing it.<eos> You get the exact amount to cover Donna's salary and you take it out of my paycheck.
If there's filed...<eos> What happened?<eos> We lost you.<eos> Your wire's in the toilet.<eos> You're welcome to dig it out.
Wheatley, get ready to hit the building from the river.<eos> Tower ladders on my signal.<eos> That'll cook anyone in there.<eos> There's no way they have any air left, and that hose line isn't big enough to get them out.<eos> I'm cutting off the water and sending it to the tower ladder.
Tough crowd.<eos> The signal's just up ahead.<eos> Fury told us to keep our distance.<eos> He told us to locate the power source.<eos> Until we lay eyes on it, this mission isn't over.
Floor model, 200 bucks off.<eos> Ok, but, you know, it was supposed to be the same as the one that we had.<eos> It's a dishwasher.<eos> That doesn't match the kitchen.<eos> Do you want me to take it back?
I can box things up for you.<eos> The leather bar stools, the doorknobs that you got in Big Sur.<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You know What? Until we reach an agreement, that house... it's 50% mine, and you are not to put it on the market.
Good.<eos> Have you found an acceptable specimen?<eos> Yes, an alpha male with a job ... the exact opposite of our first earthling.<eos> I will earn his trust and then transport him to the mother ship.<eos> Ever wonder why we don't call it a father ship?
Camille: Or humor.<eos> Basically, the worst roommate ever. Because of her condition, Kirsten lives in a state of perpetual deja vu.<eos> One day, Kirsten met a woman named Maggie, who recruited her for a secret government program.<eos> We do something there called stitching.<eos> We take a living consciousness and shove it into someone else's brain.
- That's disgusting!<eos> That's gross.<eos> So, Callie, we're going to the store tomorrow.<eos> Is there anything in particular you want for your birthday party?<eos> - I'd hardly call it a party when it's just us and the Quinns.
You want my sources?<eos> I want a byline.<eos> A byline or I walk.<eos> [sighs] All right.<eos> If we use it, you get a byline.
You have to tell me who you stole the car from.<eos> So, it was dumped here?<eos> People do it all the time, if it's a piece of shit.<eos> I came in early.<eos> Someone was dropping it off.
Keep your sorry. Just give me your help.<eos> There's more to this story than you're telling us.<eos> Now she's been injured and abducted.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Name your price. Anything you say, I'll pay it.
Not my question, but I'm glad to know it.<eos> I was wondering if you had an extra key to Dodo's morphine cabinet.<eos> I wanted to impress you and show you how clean I can make it.<eos> Why yes, of-- of course, as underbutler, it is my privilege to carry that key.<eos> Can I borrow it?
Hey. Look at that jacket over there.<eos> You dare me to steal it?<eos> No. Don't do that?<eos> But it's a cool jacket.<eos> And I want it.
But, um... I hope you see this shirt and remember that Nashville rocks and you'll remember the times we had together that did rock and forget about the brief amount of non-rocking time we had.<eos> It is a XXL, which I'm pretty sure is not your size, but it is 100% cotton.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love it.<eos> And I will cherish it forever, and I really cannot wait to use this as a rag to clean shit up with.
Are you holding your purse?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm just gonna take your purse, okay?<eos> No.<eos> And I'm gonna put it right here on the floor so you can see it through your face hole.
Huh! Watch it, boy!<eos> But you mustn't.<eos> Leave the sword alone.<eos> You're gonna have a time pulling' it out.<eos> Better leave it alone.
But in this weather, God only knows<eos> Are you afraid, Agnes?<eos> Keep your hands on the wheel.<eos> And your eyes on the road<eos> This road can be dangerous. We need to get past it before it's impassable
Tell me you don't hate this.<eos> It'll be over in a minute. It's okay.<eos> Has he busted the transmitter?<eos> Don't know.<eos> But if the bug's still on him, they'll find it.
You've been queen a long time.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And we were very interested to hear about your rapid rise to the vice presidency.<eos> Oh, it was fast, wasn't it?<eos> A nice charade, but I don't think anyone's buying it.
You're the only noise I hear.<eos> Good, you can hear me. So listen.<eos> I call the shots.<eos> Do what I say, you make out like a bandit.<eos> Just hold onto your face, Mr. Gecko, or Malvado will rip it right the hell off.
I was praying for Melas.<eos> There has been so much bloodshed.<eos> Will we ever be free of Pasiphae?<eos> It will be difficult... .. but not impossible.<eos> Pasiphae will only be vanquished... .. if you find the source of her power and destroy it.
They're all over the place...<eos> This town is insane!<eos> It's the same old story, a story about money...<eos> It's all bullshit, I don't buy it...<eos> if they really wanted a solution, Saudi Arabia would find it.
It's nothing but like simple labor, but you have to focus with all your might.<eos> Are you the type who takes care of another man and leaves your guy?<eos> What?<eos> Go inside.<eos> That heartwarming consideration, I'll refuse it.
You know, especially when you order it that way."<eos> And, uh... I look over and all of a sudden These two policemen walk in,<eos> ♪ ♪ We go all the way to this, uh, interrogation room. And this cop puts this confession in front of me<eos> And it says that I killed a man. And why would I sign something like this, you know?<eos> And he says, "you're gonna sign it."
Bootlips done that, Negroes.<eos> When they weren't hiding in the cellar, they was up here painting.<eos> Painting and painting.<eos> Pilar... every day she lights a candle for 'em.<eos> And every night I snuff it out.
Most people bring flowers to their mother's funeral, I brought a lifetime of bad choices.<eos> She got applause before she even started.<eos> We were up there for 17 minutes and nothing.<eos> Maybe we should rethink this whole story telling thing.<eos> No, we're gonna crack it.
They rob maybe electronics and sell cheap.<eos> They want me to come today and check some stuff out... you know, big discount.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - But they use meth.<eos> You know, so, when they smoke it, they're very happy.
Are you trying to get me killed, Andy?<eos> Christ!<eos> For the record, she's the reason<eos> I even offered you French third base.<eos> Who calls it that?
Listen, first rule...<eos> We have no contact until we get some burner phones.<eos> Rule two... Once the Gudea's gone, I'm not storing the other stuff.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> Where are you going to store it?
Then if the fake street, the trap street, ever shows up on someone else's map, they know their work's been stolen.<eos> My God.<eos> A whole London street just up and disappeared and you lot assume it's a copyright infringement.<eos> So we're looking for a trap street?<eos> We're looking for a trap street and we're not going to find it here.
No-one's ever made it back out of the Cloisters.<eos> Not quite no-one.<eos> This way, I'm fairly sure.<eos> According to the stories, there's a secret way out.<eos> If you find it, the Sliders let you go.
But inside looking out?<eos> We know we're using bartending as a way to see who's better... metaphorically... at friendship.<eos> All right, boys.<eos> I was looking for blankets, and I found this Ouija board.<eos> Should we use it?
And your competitors are who?<eos> I mean, who isn't a competitor?<eos> Wall Street, big oil, little oil.<eos> Little oil?<eos> It's a guy I know. He siphons gasoline out of parted cars and sells it on the side of the road.
To the plane!<eos> Am I allowed to say that?<eos> Let's all go to the plane, I guess.<eos> _<eos> What's the point of a boat if you never take it out of the dock?
We're all good here.<eos> I'm actually going to be training these handsome gents for the next three months.<eos> Three months?<eos> Yes. We've got a special.<eos> Not everyone gets it, you know.
I just know they help kill Nazis.<eos> Now you give me that goddamn film.<eos> And you get the hell out of my house.<eos> I'm not giving you the film, not anymore.<eos> I'll give it to the man you give it to.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey, Kevin.<eos> - Hey, Will. I'm glad y'all made it down here for this.<eos> I'm really excited about your song.<eos> I think Atlanta's gonna love it.
Get me a double espresso.<eos> - Now!<eos> - Okay.<eos> It was beautiful ...t-the song.<eos> Used to sing it in church a lot, so...
Better with you here, since you knew mama, you know?<eos> She would've loved the service you put together for her.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Still think it should've been in Natchez.<eos> Deacon wanted it here, and I felt very strongly about not arguing about it, which didn't do any good, 'cause he's still not speaking to me.
So were you.<eos> You know... whoever, um... whoever framed you... they expected you'd be caught.<eos> You being on the run wasn't part of their plan.<eos> And if you're right, if there really is a second bomb out there...<eos> So you think if I'm free, you won't find it?
We're not just getting you out of the neighborhood.<eos> We're getting you out of the country.<eos> I can't leave the country.<eos> There's still another bomb out there.<eos> You'll never find it like this... on the run, wondering where you're gonna sleep or eat.
- Oh God. - I know, don't ask.<eos> She guilted me into attending.<eos> Guilt is a powerful currency in your family.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> We pass it down, like our soft teeth and slow metabolisms.
If I want to move to London, I don't need your permission.<eos> I can move without you.<eos> And the way you're behaving right now, you're making the decision pretty clear.<eos> Creative license, apparently.<eos> It's pretentious for "it's totally fine to steal someone's identity or life experience and ruin it."
One of the earliest representations of the human face.<eos> The asking price?<eos> 600,000 pounds.<eos> Quite a bargain, really.<eos> Here in the West, we call it the Sumerian Mona Lisa.
48 hours.<eos> I have the mask. Tell them to relax.<eos> Hey, excuse me.<eos> They said I should talk to you.<eos> I'll drop it off this afternoon.
Talika Desai, 23, heroin overdose.<eos> Arsenic?<eos> Well, not enough to kill her.<eos> Apparently it's been seen before with taxidermists.<eos> Jasper taught her a bit of taxidermy and she put her own spin on it.
I know how to distribute the cure.<eos> Mosquitoes.<eos> - Mosquitoes?<eos> - Mosquitoes, all right?<eos> We inject a certain population of mosquitoes with the cure, we let them spread it to all the other animals.
Not all of us are.<eos> Not fully.<eos> I am.<eos> And I think you are, too.<eos> But if you tell anyone I said that, I'll find your base and blow it up.
We've all got cars styled by Pininfarina.<eos> He hasn't.<eos> ~ Oh, I have.<eos> ~ What, this was styled by Pininfarina?<eos> Yeah, the convertible version came out first and a couple of years later Pininfarina turned it into this.
Thank you, Father.<eos> I'll be over this afternoon to ride Stardust.<eos> You should bring her down here.<eos> Can you imagine Stardust sleeping in that draughty old barn?<eos> But we're going to fix it up, and then she can.
And perhaps some white ones as well?<eos> Great Maiden's Blush.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Oh, it's the name of the rose.<eos> Father gave it to my mother on their first wedding anniversary.
There's new research in the city.<eos> Yes.<eos> He's offered to hold a space on his surgical list.<eos> You both know the prognosis of surgery?<eos> Kelly and I see it the same way.
Then you've discovered your true purpose, Nuke.<eos> Do it.<eos> Always good to have a back-up nuclear power source.<eos> Thanks for the power boost, Nuke.<eos> Let me show the Avengers what I can do with it!
- Got to go, got to go.<eos> The bathroom is the most... it's the biggest most over talked, over concerned thing.<eos> Ugh, makes me nuts.<eos> - Ew. - Oh, it smells so bad.<eos> You know when I go to the bathroom, I go in, I close the stall door, and lock it.
- Quite sure.<eos> That's an awful shame.<eos> I'll tell you a joke.<eos> How about that?<eos> It would depend on how funny I found it.
I'm guessing there's a catch.<eos> The catch is it costs a fortune.<eos> But I have a handshake deal with the CEO of Range Tech.<eos> We started as mechanics together, and if I can close in two weeks, he'll sell me the whole company at a price I can afford.<eos> If I can't, he puts it on the market.
Now you're just being silly.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Silly, Deep-Ando 6-8-9-7.<eos> You must know the song.<eos> Everyone here knows it.
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.<eos> You wanna tell me what you want?<eos> I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology.<eos> Just for a few days.<eos> I'm gonna return it.
Wish me luck.<eos> Utilities online.<eos> Hey!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area, so I'm securing it.
His incredible luck!<eos> Only now, I guess, uh Looks like I was the lucky one.<eos> Did you tell anyone about last night's poker game or where it was being played?<eos> Nobody talked about the game.<eos> That was the rule, and we all kept it.
So, this way, the little creep can look at the questions in front of you.<eos> What good will that do?<eos> But, you know, maybe there's more to it than that.<eos> My client has nothing more to say about her casual relationship with Mr. Song.<eos> Other than it lasted less than a year, and she was trying to end it.
Why, it did work, the first time.<eos> It awoke the man behind the beast.<eos> But Rumple got scared of a life without power, and he chose power over love.<eos> He pulled away from me, and in that moment, the darkness forever regained its grip on him.<eos> You know, a curse isn't a curse anymore when the afflicted wants it.
Where is it?<eos> Where is Excalibur?<eos> I'm afraid it was missing when I arrived here.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> If your sword's here, we'll find it.
You don't go to trial.<eos> You turn up the pressure, and then you settle.<eos> Going to trial is turning up the pressure.<eos> The second we finish opening arguments, that offer is gonna triple.<eos> Look, I've sat across the table from these two four times in the last six years, and when they say this is their best offer, it's their best offer, and we're recommending it.
I look forward to it.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> As if Adams would have done any different.<eos> This was not a random choice.<eos> The knife senses only the deepest pain, seeks it out and channels it like a forge, out of which you emerge reborn, as you were meant to be.
Revere then used the staff from whence the Eye had come to draw it out.<eos> Now, Washington decreed the Eye too dangerous. 'Twas to be hidden, to prevent it - from falling into the wrong hands...<eos> - Hold on, hold on.<eos> That staff, it was like an Eye magnet?<eos> If we could find it, we could use it.
Short for 'gangster chef'.<eos> Wow, those losers have nothing to do.<eos> These witch hunts are a serious problem.<eos> The witch hunt is not the problem.<eos> The problem is the society that encourages it.
What's going on?<eos> Dog catches car.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Dog catches car. Yeah, you're not really giving me a lot to work with.<eos> No, dog spends all day chasing the car and never gets it.
Why is that?<eos> It's my job to read people, and you aren't that hard to read.<eos> Now, on that, we disagree.<eos> One thing we can agree on, this delicate, little theater between us does need to reach a conclusion, so...<eos> How do we end it?
Quick heads up, I was using your grill to dry some socks and smalls and, well, long story short, you need a new grill.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Trying to figure out what I'm gonna do with this gun.<eos> Bow doesn't really want it, and I can't stop feeling like I need it.
Okay, you do, you can't change that any more than you can change the fact that you're a klutz.<eos> You tried to shoot me with a box last night.<eos> - You scared me. - Okay.<eos> You gonna give me this damn gun until you learn some gun safety.<eos> And if you still want it, then we'll keep it locked up. That way, nobody'll get hurt.
That was oxygen.<eos> I added 71 protons to it. Terrific.<eos> The fart that pooped gold.<eos> No wonder every cop in the system is looking for us.<eos> Any species that gets ahold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy.
After I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing.<eos> Um, cleansing?<eos> Carbon-based life is a threat to all higher life.<eos> To us, you are what you would call a disease.<eos> Wherever we discover you, we cure it.
Spaghetti, kangaroos?<eos> I've got to check this place out.<eos> Well, you can.<eos> Contact the ministry of tourism for details.<eos> Up next, teenagers are calling it And it's not what you think.
That wasn't the source of my confusion.<eos> The confusion was about the joke not being funny.<eos> Why does everything have to be funny?<eos> Everything doesn't always have to be funny.<eos> Just jokes. Well, everyone at the network loves it.
There's one at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda.<eos> Why on earth do you know that?<eos> In season three of Horsin' Around, the horse got elected president and we shot on location.<eos> We can sneak into the library and get the shot, guerilla-style.<eos> Once Turteltaub sees it, he'll love it, and we can make the movie we both want to make. [sighs]
I will surpas everyone in this universe!<eos> I will be above all!<eos> I thought I was done, but...<eos> No matter how many times I see it, watching things blow up will never get old.<eos> The dinosaur meat, you really don't want it?
I will be above all!<eos> I thought I was done, but...<eos> No matter how many times I see it, watching things blow up will never get old.<eos> The dinosaur meat, you really don't want it?<eos> I don't want it.
He's not Wells.<eos> I'm Wells.<eos> Whatever, Harry.<eos> But we don't even really know if this thing works.<eos> Until we try it, no.
It would be a big help to us.<eos> I hear there's a new film.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Where'd you hear that?<eos> There's a guy looking for it... an operative from New York.
Damn it.<eos> Take my fingerprints.<eos> I tell you, they are not on gun.<eos> A man like you, Petrovich, I bet you take good care of the tools of the trade.<eos> You keep that gun clean, wipe it down after every hit.
I'm going to be arrested for sure.<eos> Peter, I know exactly where you're coming from.<eos> You, Quagmire?<eos> You enjoy pornography, too?<eos> Yup, and I know that a man's porn collection must be secured and protected at all costs, until he gets ashamed of it and ditches it in an alley behind a Kroger's.
Laurel.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Trust me when I tell you this will work.<eos> Oh, there's, uh, one more thing.<eos> Whatever's locked her soul away, it's not going to give it over without a fight.
Magnetism.<eos> Magnetism.<eos> Magnets of opposite poles attract one another.<eos> Help me out, Garrick.<eos> If we can change the dimensional frequency of this bomb and get it through that breach...
Or I could just jump out this window while you fend for yourself.<eos> First, give me that stone back.<eos> First, tell me why it's so special.<eos> It's some kind of trap for a bunch of souls.<eos> If Lily wants it, someone she cares about must be inside.
I don't need the recipe.<eos> I know exactly where I can find the antidote.<eos> I'll be quick.<eos> If The Strix have been using this poison for centuries, then Lucien has a cure, I guarantee it.<eos> Probably keeps it tucked away next to his cure for werewolf bites.
I know exactly where I can find the antidote.<eos> I'll be quick.<eos> If The Strix have been using this poison for centuries, then Lucien has a cure, I guarantee it.<eos> Probably keeps it tucked away next to his cure for werewolf bites.<eos> I'm sure he won't mind if we break in and borrow it.
So before we go, I'm gonna put the remote in your mouth.<eos> Here's a can of chili.<eos> And the opener we'll put...<eos> in your mouth. And here's a magazine I thought you might like to read.<eos> I'm gonna put it in your mouth.
They're lucky to be mute.<eos> They don't have to worry about what to say.<eos> I know you're upset with me.<eos> How could I not be?<eos> You know I care about dancing and you didn't think I could do it on my own.
How do you kill a drug addict?<eos> With drugs.<eos> How do you kill a depressive?<eos> Where'd you get them?<eos> People tell the doctor whatever story, collect a prescription, sell it to me.
I'll go.<eos> You must speak clearly.<eos> I will go to America.<eos> You will destroy your research?<eos> I will destroy it.
Get me out!<eos> 'You must be clearer.<eos> 'I'll go to America.<eos> 'You will destroy your research?<eos> 'I'll destroy it.
It could be anywhere in this place.<eos> Shima's confined to a wheelchair 90% of the day.<eos> There has to be some limit on where he could hide it.<eos> The wheelchair.<eos> It's logical that he hides it somewhere inside the chair.
Do not worry about us, lady, we'll get ourselves and the livestock to the hills.<eos> Get yourself clear of this place.<eos> Anything of value I will bury!<eos> Don't just pull at the bugger, you'll have it torn!<eos> Find out what holds it!
Abby, what if we gave this thing one more shot?<eos> SheShe wants to start a new divorce page.<eos> Barbara is our... your managing editor.<eos> - I didn't mean to insult you in any way.<eos> - Listen, let's pretend there's a door here, and I am shutting it.
All right.<eos> Oh, thank God everything is fine.<eos> Yup, clean bill of health.<eos> We're calling a partially blocked artery a clean bill of health now?<eos> You choose to see my artery as half blocked, while I choose to see it as half open.
Talk about our feel...<eos> That doesn't sound like a leader.<eos> You think Oprah says that to Stedman in the morning?<eos> Jerrod, where did that gun come from?<eos> My dad gave it to me when I was 18.
No, I am your father, so I'm taking the bed.<eos> Okay, look, Dad, all right, I realize that you really want the bed, but I'm sorry, you just can't have it, okay? - All right, good night. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Did you just pull your gun out on me?<eos> What?<eos> No, I was just taking it out of my back pocket.
I wish I could believe that.<eos> You were looking for reasons to stay angry.<eos> I just want what we used to have...<eos> When Jolene was little and it was just the 3 of us... Happy in our own little bubble.<eos> Before I burst it. Is that what you're saying.
Magic is an illusion made up of many steps.<eos> Sobriety takes just 12.<eos> (rhythmic breathing) First, we admitted that our lives had become unmanageable.<eos> Is this crazy or is this good?<eos> Once I was so desperate for alcohol that I shoplifted a can of hairspray and I drank it.
Thank God.<eos> And I'm gonna play Howie Mandel.<eos> My God, that sounds worse than Freak Show.<eos> You have to be on it.<eos> I'm going to have Tal put me on tape and she's going to give the tape to the casting director, who's going to give it to Ryan Murphy.
So am I. I just have to put Kelly in the car seat.<eos> I'll get him.<eos> How long have you lived in this house?<eos> About, uh, six and a half years.<eos> I never thought I'd be here forever, but I didn't know anything about being a Grimm when I bought it.
When Tracy arrived, Holden drugged her.<eos> He took the murder weapon from the scene, drove Tracy to a motel and then planted the murder weapon in her motel room.<eos> He's responsible for the angry messages on Tracy's phone.<eos> It's all a setup to fabricate motive.<eos> That story might impress a jury, but Tracy's testimony won't even back it up.
Like, men, you look down, you're like, "Oh, there's my dick."<eos> Well, like, hopefully.<eos> Um... (laughter) But, girls, you would need, like, a hand mirror and to do some, like, "Cirque du Soleil" type...<eos> Like, it's hard to find.<eos> And then the only time you see it is if you get a bikini wax.
Well, like, hopefully.<eos> Um... (laughter) But, girls, you would need, like, a hand mirror and to do some, like, "Cirque du Soleil" type...<eos> Like, it's hard to find.<eos> And then the only time you see it is if you get a bikini wax.<eos> And they wax you and then they show it to you, and there is no faster response time in the world.
I know we were going to come in today to finish up Dreyerson, but it's Sunday.<eos> We can wait until tomorrow, right? Okay.<eos> Sure.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, I had way too much fun last night, and I'm paying for it.
You know, in fifth grade, he dislocated his pinky playing catch with my dad...<eos> Whined about it for months. Damn!<eos> Your dad must have an arm on him.<eos> The ball was on the ground.<eos> Kevin's pinky bent backwards when he picked it up.
It's a simple question:<eos> Is Mr. Crane a liar or not?<eos> Well, I'm saying it's not a simple answer.<eos> Is the document real?<eos> Well, the paper is Dutch hemp, and its degradation dates it to the late 1700s.
I love you.<eos> Oh, would you like a coffee?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> - So, how is resident life treating you?<eos> Oh, I don't know if I'd call it a life, but it's great.
So you're a real medicine woman, huh?<eos> Same way you're a real doctor.<eos> Right on.<eos> This stuff is strong, ain't it? Yes.<eos> We use it to guide us spiritually.
You know it, I know it, and the men who've been instructed to guard this monument know it.<eos> I can't fault them for doing their job, but what I'm gonna ask them to do is to remember the man whose legacy was etched in that glass.<eos> Remember what he stood for and what he stood against.<eos> And remember how much he believed in all of us.<eos> If you don't believe in the monarchy, if you don't support it, that's fine.
Your turn, Peter.<eos> We'll make good use of the digger.<eos> You won't minding if I...<eos> Won't mind.<eos> Won't mind if I keep it a bit longer.
At the same time, being sure is sort of a fancy way of being lazy.<eos> You want to go check the door?<eos> I mean... You can see from here it's not shut all the way.<eos> I'll buy you a beer.<eos> Well, when you put it like that...
Very unlikely.<eos> The mass shows no worrisome features.<eos> We see them all the time during pregnancy.<eos> So let's just take it out.<eos> We're gonna remove it about six weeks after delivery.
Headphones it is.<eos> So, the, um... the curve of your rib is very similar in shape to the curve of your ear.<eos> So we're gonna harvest three small pieces of cartilage, and we shape them and we wire them together and we make this framework.<eos> And then... and this is the cool part.<eos> We take that framework, and we bury it under the skin of your forearm right about here.
You leave my sister out of this.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> As long as you vote to remove Jessica.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I'm not only gonna buy it, I'm gonna rip that company of hers apart.
- you don't know about. - Sh!<eos> No, I think that's everything.<eos> But look, new wand's fine. - Sort of.<eos> - It's, uh...<eos> I'll take it and get it cleaned for you.
Jared got in over his head with the crew that wanted to buy the list.<eos> Then Booth insinuates himself to make sure the wrong people don't get their grubby little hands on it.<eos> Booth isn't gonna give up till he gets ahold of that list.<eos> No, he isn't.<eos> Which means he's either gonna get it and be a hero or the poor boy's gonna die trying.
I had access to the list.<eos> If I wanted it, I didn't need Richard.<eos> Oh, I think you did.<eos> Because if you downloaded the list and went missing, you'd have every agency in the country coming after you.<eos> That's why you kidnapped Richard's fiancée and extorted him into downloading it for you.
I think I have to move my head.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> - I'm gonna do it. - Don't do it.<eos> - I'm gonna move my head.<eos> - Negatory. - I'm gonna move it right now.
Especially when you're a girl.<eos> Oh, thank you. I'm actually still working on my first one. Mmm.<eos> Did you want another one?<eos> When I was working at the daily planet,<eos> Perry white picked up a chair and he threw it out of the window,
Jimmy Olsen.<eos> Thank you for shooting our relief efforts. xxxx<eos> - Of course.<eos> - I'd heard you hung up your camera.<eos> Ah, well, I still break it out when the need arises.
It was her word against his, you see.<eos> She didn't stand a chance.<eos> Not against the maths superstar.<eos> But they'd had a relationship?<eos> Is that what you'd call it?
If we flood the chamber with an exact amount of water, we can cause the sub to correct position, freeing the trapped sailors' hatch.<eos> Just 18 degrees would be enough to get the hatch out of the silt.<eos> The others have immersion suits-- they could leave via the hatch, reaching the surface.<eos> This chamber-- the one that we're in-- is a closed space.<eos> If we flood it even partially, the rising water will compress the air above it.
My name is Brian Finch.<eos> I was your average 28-year-old screwup until I took a pill called NZT.<eos> Suddenly I had access to every brain cell.<eos> Every time he takes it, for the next 12 hours, he basically becomes the smartest person in the world.
Did you guys know that Ernest Hemingway wrote The Old Man and the Sea in Cuba?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - And... that he donated his Nobel Prize to a Cuban church?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - And... in 1492, Christopher Columbus claimed the island for the kingdom of Spain and named it...
Is he searching my trunk?<eos> You can't do that, man!<eos> Okay, shut up.<eos> All right, the car looks clean.<eos> I'll get CSU to take it to the garage and look it over properly.
His hawk swoops in and spills it on the ground.<eos> The king warns his hawk not to do it again, but it doesn't heed his warning.<eos> So, the king chops his head off with a sword.<eos> Cup drops into the river.<eos> When the king retrieves it, he finds a poisonous snake lying in wait.

Daddy's looking for his ashes.<eos> Really, do we have to explain something like that to her?<eos> Do you have to do that?<eos> Death isn't something to be shied away from, Booth.<eos> From an anthropological standpoint, the more openly a culture embraces death, the less anxiety they associate with it.
It's too swollen.<eos> Let's leave it open.<eos> No doubt we'll be back in there mucking about, given the extent of these injuries.<eos> Put a temporary covering over the incision, and let's use mesh.<eos> We'll sew it in when you're ready.
Tell them.<eos> As he runs over to the savages, as he's just about to strike,<eos> Hobbamock tumbles to the ground.<eos> No! No, he does! He tumbles.<eos> He takes an arrow in his hand, and... pff! ... sticks it in the savage's foot.
I had to perform an autopsy in under 10 minutes.<eos> Found the smoking gun in five.<eos> You're not even gonna mention that TMI's fancy skull helped tip you off in the first place? Who?<eos> Dad, you have a credit hog on your hands.<eos> I don't need credit... just an extra week's paid vacation, which is where I go on vacation, and you pay for it.
O-oh, hey, you know what?<eos> My friend eddie, he lives out in the desert.<eos> You can give him a call.<eos> Mm-hmm. He got a time machine.<eos> Yeah, he lets me use it on weekends.
What does any of this have to do with Justin's murder?<eos> Everything.<eos> The Van Gogh is connected to somebody we know. Who?<eos> Two years ago, there was a failed legal claim on behalf of the family that the painting was stolen from.<eos> And guess who filed it.
Sean, Kim.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Andrew's developed acute anemia.<eos> His red blood cell count has dropped to lower levels than are safe to perform the operation.<eos> So we reschedule it?
They said he was gone.<eos> And that's when you knew something was wrong.<eos> This coming weekend we were going to be celebrating our anniversary.<eos> He'd been planning a getaway for months.<eos> There's no way Lance would have missed it.
How many are there?<eos> It's a small group.<eos> Too small to be a coincidence.<eos> In the last six months, two acclaimed geneticists have gone missing, two prize-winning civil engineers. Always a man and a woman.<eos> Someone is building an ark, Lizzy, and populating it with some of the most brilliant minds of our time.
You... you're on to some other city as soon as this is over.<eos> You think that as soon as I seal the deal on these negotiations, that I'm gonna move onto someone else?<eos> You have one hell of a fucking ego.<eos> The orchestra is my family.<eos> I won't let anyone or anything hurt it.
Well, I'm doing great.<eos> Today is the day that I will receive the results<eos> Hmm. What's that?<eos> It's an ancestry service.<eos> You spit in a vial, you send it to 'em, and then, two weeks later, they e-mail you your ethnic and ancestral makeup.
Yes.<eos> I called in a drone.<eos> The facts on the ground changed, so I changed the plan.<eos> All perfectly legal.<eos> And now you're staging a black op on American soil in direct violation of an executive order prohibiting it.
And it just happened last night.<eos> At Rinkorama, of all places, but I wanted you to hear it from me.<eos> You know, because of all the history.<eos> That's ancient history.<eos> I know, but if you've got a problem with it, it ends here.
He's the one who alerted the NSA that an insider might be running Libertad.<eos> And you and Graff thought it was me, that I came to tie up loose ends.<eos> Yes, but then Graff said it wasn't you, when you were genuinely surprised that Libertad might leave the Tor network.<eos> Do you have the flash drive?<eos> He gave it to me for safekeeping.
I went home. I left after Ross.<eos> That means I can't be a suspect, right?<eos> Well, you could've easily just swiped his card, then waited, then left yourself out.<eos> Th-this is crazy!<eos> I wouldn't hurt a fly. Literally, if there's a fly at work, I shoo it towards a window and set it free.
You know what that... you know what that expression means?<eos> It means, "Why would you marry a woman if she's already having sex with you?"<eos> Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore.<eos> Now, it's like, "Why buy the cow?"<eos> Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you're gonna buy it.
No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.<eos> Then how 'bout the bathroom?<eos> I want to change my answer.<eos> Then the dining room.<eos> I guess we didn't use it very often.
Clearly my plan didn't work.<eos> All right, what'd I miss?<eos> Yeah, yeah, your only granddaughter's second birthday.<eos> Oh, I apologize, Edie.<eos> But if your party was better, then more people would be here and I wouldn't have missed it.
Well, mostly right.<eos> It didn't come in the discovery, but it came with the discovery.<eos> Another win for Mr. Millstone.<eos> All right, so, what do we do now?<eos> We take the bug to the police, exterminate it?
Don't try and find me, please.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> Where... where is this?<eos> Miami International Airport.<eos> This is a trail, and we will follow it.
Hey, watch it with the fingerpaint.<eos> When the clock strikes midnight, I bet this Cinderella turns back into a hooker.<eos> You just don't understand the kind of pressure I'm under.<eos> This party has to be amazing.<eos> The kids are gonna love it.
Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty.<eos> I learned a lot from my parents.<eos> Especially my dad.<eos> Like, I'll never forget... the first time I ever got a bad report card in school.<eos> First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me.
Like, I'll never forget... the first time I ever got a bad report card in school.<eos> First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me.<eos> Beat the hell out of me.<eos> But I learned something.<eos> Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom.
Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition.<eos> Kept it between two little pieces of plastic.<eos> But I was a kid.<eos> I didn't know any better.<eos> One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar.
What?<eos> I say that all the time.<eos> Hey. Check out this picture of my Dad in a Hawaiian shirt.<eos> Axl, I think we should break up.<eos> He doesn't have to wear it all the time.
- She's trying to sleep in my bed.<eos> - Well, sweetie, calm down.<eos> It's just, it's a new house. She's not used to it.<eos> You have your own room now, honey.<eos> Yeah, if you don't want it, I'll turn it into a gym.
Library book story!<eos> Library book story!<eos> Please, Miss Rebecca, just one more time.<eos> The library book story.<eos> But you know it by heart by now.
I'm not joking, I'll get a job.<eos> - Carter.<eos> - What?<eos> Not everyone hates school.<eos> Taylor loves it.
You can go as the front, I'll go as the back. Hm ?<eos> Don't be ridiculous !<eos> Why, you think people might catch on, eventually ?<eos> Lizzie, life is so short.<eos> Why don't we just suck the marrow out of it, while we still can.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Drax!<eos> Stop swingin' that thing around, you d'ast fool!<eos> I will not, Rocket.<eos> Ronan used this weapon to destroy my family!<eos> I will use it to destroy Thanos!
Okay.<eos> Just follow the light.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> The suspense is killing me.<eos> I want you to take your hand. Put it over your good eye.
You want to...<eos> I'm like Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense."<eos> Jay, will you please put the craft table over on the hemp rug?<eos> No.<eos> For a word you don't use, I'm sure hearing it a lot.
I didn't say I didn't know where it was.<eos> I said it's not where I thought it was.<eos> Where did you think it was? I don't know, some island in the Caribbean or something.<eos> - We're in Central America.<eos> - I know that now. They promised that my bag will arrive with the next flight, and they'll deliver it.
I know, it's just... there's nothing we can do about it except... wait and pray, I guess.<eos> I don't know, I just feel like there should be something that we can do about Molly's.<eos> Dawson shouldn't have to come out of this and deal with that.<eos> I could call my cousin Anthony.<eos> He's in construction. If there's a way around a building code, he'll find it.
Who is that guy? Where is this?<eos> Answer to the first question, I don't know.<eos> To the second, Miami International Airport.<eos> Well, they could be anywhere by now. Indeed, they could.<eos> But this is a trail, and we will follow it.
Wait a minute.<eos> My brain is cooking something.<eos> [ticking] Ding!<eos> It's ready.<eos> Check it. I will invent a brand-new thing and call it a fashion... show!
We gotta get the other USB drive back.<eos> How are we gonna find the other buyer?<eos> Their only identifying feature is the pin they're no longer wearing.<eos> Well, if we can get into the security system... we can go through the footage.<eos> Find out who was wearing that pin before Rich took it back.
We need to hurry. This portal is set to collapse space around Earth in about a minute, I need you to transport it!<eos> Transport it? Transport it where?<eos> Here, transport it here, we end this now.<eos> There's a catch; someone's gonna have to stay behind to operate it.<eos> I'm responsible for this mission. I'll see it through to the end.
I am good at throwing parties.<eos> - Uh, I didn't say anything<eos> - Look at the pinata.<eos> It's in great shape.<eos> No one can tell we've used it since Eddie was 2.
Oh, Jesus.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You know, we have a command hierarchy for a reason.<eos> We allow the residents to ignore it and there are consequences for the patients.
And even though it wasn't on the basketball court,<eos> Dave got his shining moment after all.<eos> When he accused councilman Sanders of being in the pocket of big sod, you could hear a pin drop.<eos> Well, there were only six people there. So for most of it, you could hear a pin drop.<eos> I know it would have been great for you if Dave was into basketball, but whatever his passion ends up being, you'll share it with him.
Oleg, it's time.<eos> See?<eos> The monkey's got a boner.<eos> I'm pretty sure that's a banana.<eos> It's yellow and he's holding it.
♪ homey, you don't know where I come from ♪<eos> ♪ but I know where I'm goin' ♪ ♪ I'm fresh off the boat ♪<eos> _<eos> This is my new version of Eddie's pimp walk.<eos> I call it jazz walk.
Your mom and I are petitioning for custody of Ben.<eos> - You okay with that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine with that.<eos> How do you think Lori's gonna take it?
You cannot let another man own your dignity.<eos> Because if another man owns it, at best, you're leasing it.<eos> And that lease rate... it's astronomical, brother.<eos> So what do I do?<eos> You take it back.
When I was at the academy, they were developing a new cruiser with gravity well projectors powerful enough to pull a ship out of hyperspace.<eos> Well, it looks like they finished it.<eos> Chances are they're still testing the system.<eos> If they follow Imperial procedure, the testing zone for this type of ship wouldn't be that large.<eos> You'll probably find it not far from where we lost contact with Commander Sato.
- And he pulled me out of it.<eos> - I'll never forget that call.<eos> "Come and get me, please."<eos> Don't know why I called him, you were dissolving cocaine in fucking cider<eos> - and injecting it at the time. - I liked to party.
Actually, Alfie, you're wrong.<eos> Ballistics proves that that gun was the gun that killed the professor.<eos> And T.O.D.-- that's "time of death"-- matches exactly the window where you accidentally borrowed it.<eos> I like how you used the gun range as a library.<eos> That's nice-- you take the murder weapon out, you return it the next day.
Awesome!<eos> It's been real.<eos> See you guys new year's day!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just 'cause I said we're not going to church doesn't mean we're not going to church.<eos> There's plenty of channels that offer a Christmas Eve service, so we'll stay at home and watch it on TV.
! No, no, no, wait.<eos> I think I have them in a box somewhere.<eos> Like a-a knock-off stride rite box from when you kids were little.<eos> I think it was, like, stride mite, stride tite?<eos> Oh, my God, I haven't seen it in forever.
I love it!<eos> It's just what I wanted!<eos> Look at this... I can sit in it!<eos> And I can put things on it or in it!<eos> I know exactly where I'm gonna put it.
I don't know!<eos> Okay, Axl, just tell me what to do.<eos> Please! Please!<eos> I can't do that, Sue.<eos> You got to come up with your own special lie so when you say it, you believe it.
Thanks.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> So... how you feeling?<eos> Like I've got a rock hanging over my head.<eos> Rope holding it up is about to snap.
A daughter mocking her father's life.<eos> Closets aren't fascinating?<eos> Since when?<eos> Want to talk about betrayal?<eos> How about when somebody steals a song and takes it for themselveses?
That's okay, 'cause I was lying about my grades.<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> It's our wedding night all over again.<eos> Okay, sweetie.<eos> So now we are gonna spell "Welcome" on our cake, and we're gonna bring it to our new neighbors.
Get some that good bottled beer.<eos> And make that "Frank's Special Chip Dip." [plop in toilet]<eos> You know, with cream cheese and chili in a can?<eos> [dryer whirring] [yelling] And those fancy potato chips that come in a tin!<eos> We can use it as a garbage can after!
(all murmuring) Oh, what, you want people staying at your cute BBs, buying up all your antiques, eating up all your artisanal mayonnaise?<eos> Then I suggest you pony up.<eos> Or you can take your chance and, uh, roll the dice!<eos> Thank you for that offer, Neon Joe.<eos> We will take it under advisement.
It's this simple: once Steven Avery is accused of this murder, and a lot of things... seem to clearly point to him having done it, as much as you mentally want to give the benefit of the doubt to him,<eos> This is Action 2 News at five.<eos> Coverage you can count on.<eos> Ironically, Steven Avery's arrest comes at the same time Governor Jim Doyle plans to sign a sweeping criminal justice reform bill inspired by Avery's wrongful conviction.<eos> Two weeks ago, the bill passed unanimously and Governor Doyle told me today he will sign it, despite the pending murder charges against Avery.
Jesus, you don't go into a place and search it 18 times and keep looking for something unless...<eos> The only reason you go in a second time is because you believe you missed it the first time.<eos> Once a place is cleared, it's normally released back to the person.<eos> The key was worthless, as far as I was concerned, as evidence, because of the number of searches.<eos> Now this is a key that was used by her for several years, and they took the key and meticulously scrubbed it for DNA and that was, at first glance, a good thing.
The blood I'm more... a little bit more worried about than I was when I first discovered it and was very happy and you know.<eos> Because I don't trust the FBI at all and I think that they're gonna come up with some dishonest test that somehow claims that the blood in the vial is different than what was found at the scene.<eos> And that'll be a little bit harder to overcome.<eos> I'm not worried about the key at all.<eos> I like the key. I'm glad they're using it. [clears throat]
- A digital camera?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He didn't give every one of those members Saturday morning a camera, did he?<eos> No.<eos> He just gave it to Pam Sturm who he knew was gonna go out to the Avery salvage yard.
It's a clever move by them to not call Brendan in their case in chief.<eos> - He's not a good witness.<eos> - Which we predicted months ago.<eos> He's, you know... even... once he starts incriminating himself and Steve, he can't do that consistently.<eos> I mean, the story is changing dramatically every time he tells it.
- He's not a good witness.<eos> - Which we predicted months ago.<eos> He's, you know... even... once he starts incriminating himself and Steve, he can't do that consistently.<eos> I mean, the story is changing dramatically every time he tells it.<eos> So... they put it out there in news conferences.

To get you into the courthouse door to pay the poll tax to get your name published and get yourself dead.<eos> That's true.<eos> We need a new plan!<eos> I can't take him back to Washington and waltz into the White House with a list of empty demands. Tactics, my friends!<eos> We must break down this institution into the tangible tactics that it takes to dismantle it.
Like when you're preaching, and you're just flying.<eos> You know, you're not on the notes. You're not on memory. You're tapped into what's higher, what's true.<eos> God is guiding you.<eos> I've known that feeling.<eos> It's rare, but I've known it.
Come.<eos> Come here.<eos> I like your necklace.<eos> My mother once gave this as a parting gift to my father.<eos> And though she's with the gods now... I want you to have it.
Okay. Okay, that's good.<eos> See, I didn't know that.<eos> I didn't know you were even interested in abstract art.<eos> I'm not.<eos> They make us do it.
Utilities are paid for, gas, electric, water.<eos> Kitchen, dining room. Refrigerator is fully stocked. Office.<eos> Here's a key for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The gym is close. You can almost see it.
No, no, I'm an artist.<eos> I used to be based on the Left Bank.<eos> Now I've relocated to the States and I'm looking for... an exhibition venue.<eos> I like my club the way it is.<eos> Your stuff is so hot, go put it in a museum.
This was your father's dying wish, and you're negotiating?<eos> He was not a perfect man or a perfect father, but he sure as hell was better than most.<eos> - Mom...<eos> - No!<eos> Your father had one final request, and we are gonna honor it.
River's End, this... this is it.<eos> Ryo, look.<eos> Holy shit. Look!<eos> Look at this!<eos> This house, we're looking for it.
Unless you like old wives' tales.<eos> Well, yeah, I might like them.<eos> Don't shovel that shit to these kids, Lucky.<eos> There's one story that says that house is still standing.<eos> Story says the flood hit that house hard, but it didn't take it down.
Why?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, tell your friend to stop swinging that goddamn bat!<eos> I think you're looking at a door that's never gonna open again.<eos> Not with those roots jamming it shut.
Tremaine Alexander don't do anxious. I cause anxious.<eos> I could be halfway down South before this thing goes off or you can make me an offer.<eos> I'll offer you to disable it before it blows us all up, you like that?<eos> That won't fly.<eos> How about I just send it back the way I found it?
Now it's here, I have a dust and ashes feeling about it.<eos> Do you take sugar, dear?<eos> Influenza is ripping through the troops.<eos> I read about it in the newspaper.<eos> They call it Spanish flu.
The Kragle!<eos> [GASPS]<eos> BUSINESS:<eos> As you can see, they're loading the Kragle in a big machine upstairs.<eos> I call it the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.
What is that?<eos> Is it super small?<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> It's my hand.<eos> I want you to take it.
is that why you only sent two assassins to kill me?<eos> My mother.<eos> -Don't blame her.<eos> -Yes, she wanted you dead.<eos> Who do you think hid your sword where you would find it?
They're jealous of our imagination.<eos> Of our incredible capacity to create.<eos> Why do they after us?<eos> Within the Jinn there is a prophecy.<eos> Very few of us know about it.
- so congratulations, use it for Lear.<eos> - Why don't you go in front of the house, in the audience and you'll see real energy?<eos> I wouldn't waste it.<eos> I keep it for the stage.<eos> I keep it for out there.
Hey, what about getting in the gas pump?<eos> We could break into that, we could pull that shit up with buckets or something.<eos> - Crap, I don't know.<eos> - Pumps don't work like that.<eos> The gas is in a tank under the ground, under the concrete without the pump's pulling it up, it's inaccessible.
Let us tell an old story anew, and we will see how well you know it.
Great.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> - And I need a key. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Well, like, maybe I could...<eos> if you call me, I'll either have it... and drop it around yours, or I could leave it at the bar for you.
As soon as he was on the street he was in the air. There was nothing we could do.<eos> Russians wouldn't take him.<eos> We think he's somewhere in Thailand, maybe Cambodia.<eos> Nick, you don't need to think about this right now, man.<eos> All the guys sent you this card and I'm going to put it right here.
He's set his sights on an armoured ground cricket.<eos> His eyes are bigger than his stomach.<eos> Better try again... for a lighter lunch.<eos> Delicious!<eos> In the middle of the day the sand's so hot most creatures can't stand it.
Jade. You said in your note, "Beware of the Golden Fang."<eos> Why am I supposed to beware of a boat?<eos> They're an Indochinese heroin cartel.<eos> A vertical package.<eos> They grow it, bring it in, step on it, run stateside networks of local street dealers and take a separate percentage off of each operation.
This was mourning, all right.<eos> And it was deep.<eos> This your new partner, Bigfoot?<eos> Want a banana, Adrian?<eos> Bend over and I'll stick it in for you.
You would be fighting as a mortal.<eos> That's rather extreme, don't you think?<eos> I'll tell you something that should chill your blood.<eos> No matter how far we tip the scales our way... no matter how many of them we turn dark... nothing seems to break their capacity for hope.<eos> They pass it back and forth like the flu at a preschool fair.
We can't afford to wait that long.<eos> Who's "we"?<eos> After New York, I convinced the World Security Council we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis.<eos> For once, we're way ahead of the curve.<eos> By holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection.
In that case, I'd like to say something.<eos> Let it be known, for the record, that Steve and Thomas Anderson have saved Christmas for the world entire.<eos> You can't take that away from them, even if you can take away their freedom.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Sometimes adults find it hard to accept the magic of Christmas. But when they experience it with their own eyes, even the coldest of hearts warm.
So, it'll start on camera four here.<eos> We're looking right at The Marrow and here comes Dekker, 1:30 in the morning with a bag and flashlight.<eos> All right.<eos> This is where it gets really weird.<eos> He walks over to camera three... looks right at it... and turns it off.
Why would he shut...?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Goes over to camera one.<eos> Again, right at it...<eos> - And he shut... - Turns it off.
It seems the Press Department's rather messed up the Hitchcock announcement. Well, I did say it was a risk.<eos> You did say you'd manage it.<eos> You should see to the children.<eos> Everybody in!<eos> ...a ball in the middle of the pool. You're gonna dive in and get it. The first one to catch it is the winner.
Shut up.<eos> I just hate this song.<eos> You're joking, this is like, my favorite song.<eos> I know, just, I've heard it so many times.<eos> Yeah, that's true, they do play it a lot.
Whoa.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. Come on.<eos> I do not want your tongue in my mouth.<eos> Then where do you want it, man?
I did.<eos> No, but your hairy tongue did, so...<eos> Should I go and shave it?<eos> No, just cut it off, maybe.<eos> And send it to you in the mail.
What is that?<eos> I think it's a brain heart attack.<eos> Yeah, I've had one already.<eos> So we're stealing power now?<eos> No, we're borrowing it from the neighbours.
Took a hell of a hit, you know.<eos> The missile just missed your power source.<eos> We call it a Spark.<eos> It contains our life force and our memories.<eos> Yeah, we call it a soul.
- Our former president.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Miss Wanyan Ying!<eos> - Miss Wanyan Ying!<eos> And now, a song so new that Mr. Gershwin won't even write it for another 10 years.
This isn't a game.<eos> We don't have to stay in the same room, we don't have to sleep together, that's not what I'm asking.<eos> If that becomes important, you'll be the one to decide.<eos> I'll hear the music, and then I'll know.<eos> And if I never hear it...
It's true.<eos> And you should see the giant's toy harp.<eos> It plays the most beautiful tunes without you even having to touch it.<eos> Of course it does.<eos> Why don't you go up to the kingdom right now, bring it back and show it to me?
He just wants to go home.<eos> Okay, that will not happen.<eos> He is far too valuable.<eos> This is crazy, this is crazy.<eos> So... we are gonna follow this map and you are gonna help us get that thing operational, and it will lead us back to its ship, and we will disable it permanently.
That is your opinion.<eos> You just happen to be wrong.<eos> Evidently, Casey managed to solve that dilemma.<eos> He sent us his research just before he was killed.<eos> Soon as it's packed up, we'll send it over.
We all send it!<eos> New tradition, guys, all right?<eos> When this team starts winning, we'll go back to that.<eos> And the pick is finally in.<eos> It's currently being brandished by some walkie-talkied individual taking it up to the Commissioner's podium.
So the batteries ain't that great. They're only gonna be charging up to about 70%.<eos> - Zinzane says that...<eos> - Zaytsev.<eos> Zaytsev says that the diesel engine's good, but there's a fuel leak he can't find. - It's dripping on the main turbine housing.<eos> - Tell him to find it. Tell him to fix it.
It's in the town of San Angel.<eos> - Are you certain?<eos> - I swear!<eos> I swear!<eos> A beautiful hero wears it to protect the town!
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together..."<eos> Nor did my darling Agatha.<eos> She and our infant son would be killed two years later by the Prussian grippe.<eos> An absurd little disease.<eos> Today we treat it in a single week, but, in those days many millions died.
I'm on spring break.<eos> Cool tingling.<eos> Got room for one of these babies.<eos> A grenade.<eos> Why you gonna put it there?
You're gonna come back.<eos> I'm gonna hold the door open for you.<eos> Jessabelle, you're gonna get what's coming to you!<eos> The unwanted presence in the house.<eos> When you see it, it's broken, right?
Fucking iodine pills.<eos> You got any water?<eos> I'd give you some of mine, but it's not ready.<eos> It takes about half an hour... with an iodine pill.<eos> But you have to filter it first.
I tried to tell you the truth, but you were too young to understand.<eos> I tried to take you away, but they discovered my plan.<eos> They are sending me to an asylum.<eos> So I'm leaving this letter with my solicitor, Mr. Jerome.<eos> They cannot stop him from giving it to you when you are older.
I want my car back.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> You ain't gettin' it back.<eos> I want my car back.<eos> If you don't give it to me now, I'm gonna get back in that truck and I'm gonna stay on you till you do.
She'll go 230.<eos> Top NASCAR speed ever was 228.<eos> This car is faster.<eos> 8:00 a.m., tomorrow at Shepperton.<eos> You get anything close to 230 out of this car, Ingram is going to buy it on the spot.
I want to stay in the now.<eos> I am in the now.<eos> Right now.<eos> This knob is the ship's thrust control... which works on a sliding scale of 50.<eos> Obviously, we'd never take it that far.
I mean, we're both these fractured people.<eos> You lost your hand in battle and I... - I am... I have...<eos> Yeah... I didn't...<eos> I didn't lose my hand in battle.<eos> I shot it off while cleaning a laser- refractor piston my first week of service.
I need you to make an introduction.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Five million Spanish dollars.<eos> When I take that ship, you stand to gain...<eos> When you take it?
Uncle.<eos> I'm glad you've come. Though we could have wished for better circumstances.<eos> I'm no stranger to your circumstances anymore.<eos> It will take more than a few mountain men to bring this house down.<eos> It's been in my family for three generations. And no matter what happens to me, we will not give it up.
Well, I thought the three of us should celebrate... you know, you guys getting back together and all that good stuff.<eos> I would drink to that good stuff.<eos> This is so nice.<eos> Need a hand?<eos> No, no, I got it.
Yes?<eos> I found you a small bowl, sir.<eos> I hope this do suit your requirements.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Where would you like I should put it for you?
It is far too powerful.<eos> But if we don't, we'll never fully understand what it's capable of.<eos> That is not our job.<eos> We're Dust Keepers.<eos> We nurture the dust, maintain it, measure it, package it, and distribute it.
What? Look like that, in 30 seconds.<eos> Do you have to go?<eos> There's a fundraiser at my children's school.<eos> Please don't take this the wrong way but it suddenly seems.. ...impossible to me that you have that life.<eos> I don't take it the wrong way. Actually, it seems impossible to me too.
GPS.<eos> He doesn't want to disclose the location, I don't know what that means.<eos> Oh, and he wants to be met with a weird list of goodies.<eos> You have to get that before you go and pick him up.<eos> I'll text it to you.
Karos wasn't inside.<eos> Some dumb ass kid boosted it.<eos> He's got a bunch of fucking coked up club girls in the back.<eos> - Did they recover the case?<eos> - They have not located it yet.
If you don't want to say good-bye, you don't have to say good-bye, but I'm still going.<eos> You know this isn't easy for me, either.<eos> Mom?<eos> You're gonna have to leave that camera equipment with me.<eos> We'll be sure to return it when you guys are ready to leave.
Smart enough to divorce me anyway.<eos> But, while we were still together, my dad died and...<eos> Suddenly Alex, at age five, became frightened of the dark and obsessed with death.<eos> So I invented a story about heaven to comfort him.<eos> He didn't really buy it, you know?
Yeah!<eos> We will return to England, for that land was so generous to us the last time.<eos> But this time, we shall not go alone.<eos> For King Horik and Jarl Borg have agreed to join us.<eos> And perhaps we will not have to return so quickly, but stay in their land for awhile, explore it, maybe even winter there.
It's a process, Barbara.<eos> Not a checklist.<eos> Of course, but if you had any specific suggestions...<eos> You know what's interesting about your story?<eos> Your voice, when you tell it.
Why didn't you hand in your gun?<eos> You know it's evidence.<eos> - I didn't...<eos> Nobody asked me for it.<eos> We'll take it now, please.
Wait, wait.<eos> There.<eos> What's that distortion?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It grabs the box and lifts it off... up...
Do you know what song you're going to sing for Mr. Shue's last assignment?<eos> Yes. "Defying Gravity."<eos> What?<eos> ! No, you can't sing that song.<eos> Kurt and I are singing it, but we're switching parts so that I can belt out the high note at the end.
- No, I think it does.<eos> Clearly, I have to go back to salsa castle to see my wife with that hunk again so that my mind can convince my body to stop being so foolish. Okay.<eos> Let's give it a shot.<eos> Daytime ESPN is just soccer anyway.<eos> Then I take the curtain from the bathroom window, wrap it around myself like a sarong, go back out to the table, finish the tiramisu.
Give me the shirt.<eos> My grandma's homemade stain remover will work...<eos> White vinegar and coarse salt.<eos> But won't it smell?<eos> I-I'll just put it through the wash. Wait.
Not if I show you first.<eos> Jenny Mills.<eos> Love to catch up, Chase, but we're leaving now.<eos> If for no other reason than you know I'm the best shot here.<eos> When we're done with the lantern, you have my word, we will return it.
Hello.<eos> My name is Saeed Jobrani.<eos> I am the CEO of lmmediBug.<eos> And we're hereto revolutionize the way you report bugs on your mobile platform.<eos> Happin! will revolutionize location-based mobile news aggregation as you know it.
That won't make any difference here.<eos> So this is really it.<eos> What's gonna happen to the choir room?<eos> Well, it's prime real estate.<eos> I'll probably turn it into two classrooms.
I was totally gonna.<eos> Okay.<eos> This algebra crap is ridic.<eos> Who gives a shit about math?<eos> - When am I ever gonna use it?
I should never have gotten involved.<eos> I won't make that mistake again, okay?<eos> I know you were only trying to help.<eos> Let's just hope this issue is a hit.<eos> My assistant is taking it to print as we speak.
Don't tell mother for a while, okay?<eos> Do you need my bike today?<eos> No.<eos> Thanks for letting me use it, though.<eos> I liked knowing you were riding it.
That if I would look at it long enough every day, That that would keep you alive.<eos> I guess it worked.<eos> And then I had this thing about your chair.<eos> My chair at the precinct?<eos> I wouldn't let anyone touch it.
I got it. Right.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> We're looking for a gun.<eos> Nobody keeps the gun in the crisper, dude.<eos> That's where I would hide it.
Guys, my grandfather lost that house in the '95 storm, and then he died before he had a chance to rebuild it.<eos> I-I've gotten hundreds of offers to sell the property, but I do not want one more castle going up, blocking people's view of their ocean.<eos> This isn't just about me.<eos> I can't let him take it.<eos> We're gonna get it back for you, brother.
- Stop lying!<eos> Get out.<eos> I can't think with you here.<eos> She's not wrong, Annalise.<eos> - It's aspirin. We all buy it.
About time. It's the only phone.<eos> You don't count.<eos> Maybe we should just give up on Lassen.<eos> No. This Ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life.<eos> And I'm gonna wreck it. Because he scarred me forever.
Memory banks, but...more than that.<eos> This is what keeps the Dalek...pure.<eos> How are Daleks pure?<eos> Dalek mutants are born hating - this is what stokes the fire, extinguishes even the tiniest glimmer of kindness or compassion.<eos> Imagine the worst possible thing in the universe, then don't bother, because you're looking at it right now.
You're ruining the Harriet Tubman experience.<eos> - Oh, I'm ruining it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> [Scoffs] I'm here to save it.<eos> You're the one that's ruining it by allowing off-topic snacks and spreading misinformation.
You know I think you're the most charming man in the world, but Pierson doesn't like to feel ganged up on.<eos> I think it's best if I approach her alone.<eos> Besides... You have a new job.<eos> You should let McQuaid see you in action.<eos> Our first night out since Mack was born, and we're spending it apart-- what a waste of a good sitter.
I don't remember it being so roomy.<eos> Well, maybe because you were a lot roomier back then.<eos> Thank you for coming with me to say goodbye.<eos> God, I love this tree house.<eos> I can't believe they're tearing it down.
- I'm not ready, okay?<eos> We're not ready. - (Scoffs)<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> We are like this tree house... solid, dependable and we'll withstand the test of time.<eos> We're here because they're ripping it out by it's roots.
You have the right to remain silent.<eos> You can't prove anything.<eos> That jacket you're wearing, you stole it out of the closet of a house where a girl was murdered.<eos> The original owner's DNA is going to be all over it, and your gun is being tested in ballistics right now.<eos> And we will match it up with the bullets you put in Bug.
That's a lot to live up to.<eos> Because I certainly can't tell a better story than the one we saw last night.<eos> I don't know what was more miraculous-- the technological achievement that put our species in a new perspective or the fact that all of us were doing the same thing at the same time.<eos> Sitting in this room, we can still feel the pleasure of that connection.<eos> Because, I realize now, we were starved for it.
I don't know what was more miraculous-- the technological achievement that put our species in a new perspective or the fact that all of us were doing the same thing at the same time.<eos> Sitting in this room, we can still feel the pleasure of that connection.<eos> Because, I realize now, we were starved for it.<eos> We really were.<eos> And, yes, we'll feel it again when they all return safely.
Why'd you stop?<eos> Something ain't right.<eos> It sounded beautiful.<eos> Where'd you find this song?<eos> My mama used to sing it to me.
How many fucking women would there be?<eos> I need you to sign these papers.<eos> What are they?<eos> Loan papers for the new house.<eos> I don't want it anymore.
- We have to get him out of here.<eos> - How do we do that?<eos> So, Andy, he steals the bag, and then he hightails it out of here...<eos> He didn't STEAL it.<eos> OK, you argue and he borrows it...
- How's that connected?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> That's why we need ears on that meeting.<eos> Galan keeps a model car on his desk.<eos> This is a bug that we'd like you to place on it.
If we have to absorb these price increases, this could be the last summer of Hankmed.<eos> Okay, so, Ray, the bile duct test confirmed that you have primary sclerosing cholangitis, or PSC.<eos> It's a disease that causes inflammation and obstruction of your bile ducts in and outside your liver.<eos> Well, how'd I get it?<eos> We actually don't know what causes it.
I think it's feeding into our show.<eos> The scenes... play out very gritty and very real on the rooftops.<eos> Stop!<eos> I can't imagine shooting the show anywhere else.<eos> The vibrancy of New York City street life infuses everything that we do, and you really feel it when you're out on the streets.
The crescent Mark on your shoulder did not disappear when you became a hybrid.<eos> Go on.<eos> Talk to them.<eos> What the hell you two want?<eos> Hold your tongue, or I'll tear it from your gaping mouth.
The judge is totally gonna deny.<eos> Your Honor, permission to approach the bench.<eos> No, it's... it's the game.<eos> The stenographer has a word of the day calendar.<eos> You get a word, and you have to incorporate it into the proceeding without the judge knowing.
So that's the entrance hall, I take it?<eos> Okay, that's it, we're done here, so just go back to Rome and tell the big kahuna that this party is over-<eos> - Never, you hear me?<eos> Never!<eos> Caesar entrusted me with a mission and I fully intend to see it through to the end, even if it means working the slaves to death!
Knock wood.<eos> Oh, I took the liberty of ordering for both of us.<eos> What on God's green earth?<eos> Veal parmigiana.<eos> Chef Vola takes an entire veal chop, slices it lengthwise, breaded, fried in olive oil, drowned in cheese and tomato sauce.
That won't hunt.<eos> It's a goddamn squeeze from New York and I won't stand for it.<eos> - How are you set?<eos> - What are we talking about?<eos> Keeping this town in the hands of those who own it.
He's a good boy.<eos> Works hard. Keeps his mouth shut.<eos> A bit of a mooncalf to me.<eos> What's the task at hand?<eos> Keeping this town in the hands of those who own it.
What's that, you old whore?<eos> I'll punch your tits off.<eos> You, too, you squirrel-faced cunt.<eos> Why don't you watch your mouth?<eos> Why don't you spoon the shit out of my asshole and eat it for dinner?
Oh, uh... It's a car accident. It's a long story.<eos> Let's hear it. Let's hear it all.<eos> - Did you shoot this man?<eos> Check the ballistics on his gun.<eos> Hey, I want it back after you've done with it.
Breed and multiply, my little green friends.<eos> Here he is.<eos> My friend and protégé Danny, the rising star of our firm.<eos> Take a good look at this handsome face.<eos> You'll be seeing a lot more of it.
Good job he's got you to fight his corner.<eos> Your Philip looks like he's having a good time.<eos> - Is that Amy Dyer?<eos> - What's she doing with that toffee apple?<eos> Eating it.
Oh, it ain't failed me yet.<eos> Hm. All right.<eos> Now what do you want, before I'm too drunk to say yes?<eos> The Fatah interview.<eos> I need you to kill it.
Okay. Hey, everybody.<eos> Uh, how about the Liberty Bell?<eos> Uh, that's a weird thing to be patriotic about.<eos> It has got this big crack in it.<eos> It's... it's like we fight this long war with England for our independence and then we get it, and the first thing we do is break something nice.
I do.<eos> That will be your undoing, not mine.<eos> I'm sending Keller back in.<eos> You'll destroy this operation.<eos> No, you will destroy it if you do not pull your C.I.
Something's got...<eos> Is that...<eos> I didn't say you could wear that.<eos> Daz said my stuff's still in his shed.<eos> Yeah, it's not like you can use it.
Good night, honey.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> I'm gonna eat your leg.<eos> You're not gonna get it.
"Malum" means "evil," but equally "apple."<eos> And I know believe the sentence to read,<eos> "the apple opens,"<eos> and, by implication, unleashes the death that results.<eos> I believe I have seen that apple, or the box that contains it...
By the power vested in me by the state, I declare you a temporary patrol officer of the L.A.P.D.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Okay, move over.<eos> Hold this.<eos> - Don't put it on!
I don't know.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I think you know as well as I do that there'll be no peace in your heart like there is today.<eos> My heart has never known peace.<eos> Then maybe, just maybe, we'll find it together.
You, uh...<eos> You know this woman? That's Allison Ball.<eos> Strange thing-- she had molasses on the soles of her shoes when she was shot dead this morning.<eos> Well, molasses is used in the cultivation of cannabis, right? Yeah, sure.<eos> Lot of the growers use it. Do you?
Well, then I guess we got to find ourselves a plane.<eos> Sit up. Sit up. Sit up.<eos> Sit up. Stop, I can't.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look, look.<eos> All that stuff that's inside you, I need you to get all of it out.
If you're gonna tell me to be careful, you shut it.<eos> My gun... where are we with that?<eos> It must've been out of your possession at some point.<eos> It's with me at all times. I told you that.<eos> Well, not at night. You don't sleep with it. This I know.
Well, I'm not sure if it matters to you... but you're about to execute the wrong man.<eos> Well, that... That's the first I've heard of it, but...<eos> Yeah, of course it matters, if it's true.<eos> Yeah, I've been working on this story ever since Jamal was first ambushed.<eos> Not that anybody's going to read it. No one can.
That's what you call it, huh?<eos> I really am sorry.<eos> So, you're planning on keeping that star, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The dome hasn't treated those who wear it too kindly.
If we're stuck here with no provisions, things will go south fast.<eos> Well, there's still a decent amount at the Sweetbriar.<eos> Don't know how secure it is, though.<eos> If it gets as cold as you think it's going to... We could lose it all to a freeze.<eos> I'll find Barbie, take the ambulance, fill it up with food.
And yet, here she is.<eos> And that is the girl I knew.<eos> Your sister faked her own death,<eos> - I-I don't know, maybe Melanie somehow... - Rebecca, I saw her die.<eos> And I know death when I see it.
I can't have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.<eos> It's nice they're getting exercise.<eos> Although now that I think about it,<eos> Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.<eos> I'm sure he brought it.
Son of a bitch.<eos> So that's it, huh?<eos> So they extract the helium-3 from the lunar rock and then use the ore as a fuel source.<eos> Exactly.<eos> They refine the ore into energy and deliver it to the power core, which converts it into wireless electricity and beams it to the Earth.
They just fuckin' brainwash you.<eos> You know? Don't clap, don't clap, I don't read, I don't read.<eos> Follow someone else.<eos> I'm telling you, they brainwash you.<eos> Come into the church, your brain's all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut.
- Okay.<eos> - Did you see anything, or were you all just standing around, talking? Sir, we just got here, all right?<eos> We didn't see your bike.<eos> You want to leave us your name and the serial number, we'll look at it.<eos> I spray-painted it orange to make it look hideous so nobody would steal it.
But instead, you walked into my office, and you sounded the alarm.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> And now I do.<eos> And now we'll reorganize all of our resources toward finding a solution.<eos> And when we do drop the bomb, and make no mistake, we will drop it, all those lives will be on your head, Charlie.
I really think it worked last time.<eos> You know what, never mind.<eos> It was a metaphor.<eos> Your place is so nice.<eos> I don't really think of it as it is my place.
- Please. I got this.<eos> See?<eos> Power's up.<eos> Why are you stealing electricity?<eos> Just borrowing it until they turn our power back on.
- When I saw Dekma.<eos> He couldn't have known where to find the weapon unless you called him.<eos> He's our dog in this fight.<eos> I was supposed to make sure he got the weapon.<eos> I'm gonna destroy it.
Yes.<eos> For love?<eos> When John and I were first married, he wanted everything to be right for me.<eos> There was a gate that used to swing shut on you and it hit me once and I had a bruise for a day or two.<eos> John found a round stone and he... he worked it with another stone like a pestle and mortar so the first stone had a hole in it.
Don't cremate me!<eos> ' Don't say it.<eos> The dead remain conscious.<eos> The dead are fully aware of everything that is happening to them.<eos> So your mind is here, your soul, whatever you want to call it and you're in your new body in your new world.
- massage therapist in question.<eos> - All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can I see your tongue?<eos> Where do you want it?
What we need to find is a jock who isn't a complete ass.<eos> Jake, what do you know about a secret book that jocks use to rate their sexcapades?<eos> Ugh, you know about the phonebook?<eos> It's a dumb tradition.<eos> Meaningless. Yeah, well, we're gonna need you to get it for us.
Seriously, you're coming with us.<eos> No, no. No touching.<eos> They said no touching.<eos> No, dummy.<eos> Gabby is throwing you a surprise party, and you're missing it.
That's none of your business.<eos> I need to know if there's something I can do to earn my way back.<eos> I'll do anything, man.<eos> Please.<eos> If I were you, I'd take that gun, put it in my mouth and pull the trigger.
Our investors are already getting skittish.<eos> The last thing I need is a gang war that brings the Feds sniffing around my relationships.<eos> End this rogue problem. Now.<eos> I hate to tell you, Mr. Marks, but the war's already on.<eos> And you're losing it.
- [Chuckles] Actually, sir, I was thinking about driving west. - A Tijuana?<eos> - No, no, Baja sur.<eos> - Oh, the Southern peninsula's beautiful. - I know.<eos> Been a while too.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - I remember loving it, though.
Yeah, uh, I got this cassette tape-- old school.<eos> Um, do the names Paul Briggs or Juan badillo mean anything to you?<eos> Yeah, I figured so.<eos> You know, this tape, it-- it almost--it sounds like-- you--you know what?<eos> Let me--let me play it for you.
To the desert.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> Show me what?<eos> - I want to show you the truth, Charlie.<eos> - No, I don't want to hear it anymore.
That stuff is mine.<eos> You're not the only one who needs insurance, Noel.<eos> We need it, too.<eos> Okay?<eos> And I promise you, I will keep it in a much safer place than this.
You want to wait in his office?<eos> Actually, we want to talk to you.<eos> Privately.<eos> This is a hit list?<eos> We call it a Dead Pool.
But if we don't get out of here, someone's going to die.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.<eos> We have to at least see if he's blocking the exit.<eos> Yeah. He's blocking it.
So help me help you.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> But be cool.<eos> Have you ever tried the salted ice cube diet?<eos> It's supposed to really work if you can stick to it.
I had some sort of vision when I touched the stone.<eos> I saw Thanos destroy a planet with this thing.<eos> If it's that powerful, he won't stop attacking Earth until he gets it back.<eos> That stone's the only thing that stopped those robots.<eos> How can use it if we can't touch it?
Why, Lady Syl.<eos> Still working on those self-esteem issues by throwing yourself at...<eos> Enough! Is that word even in your vocabulary?<eos> Never mind.<eos> If you want it... I mean, if you really want it, you can have it.
Me? Yeah, sure, I'm fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> Nice skirt.<eos> Must be really popular.<eos> I've seen a lot of girls wearing it tonight.
Well, Meredith, we all have to share.<eos> That is the Fighting Quaker way. Not the Fighting Quaker three-way, which was graffitied behind the gym.<eos> Got the checks here.<eos> Um, I know where the TV is.<eos> Ginny checked it out, but isn't using it.
It's overflowing.<eos> You've got your career, your friends... Oh, hey, look!<eos> Here's your favorite pen!<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll use it to make a note to remind myself to go down there and pick up my deposit.
Lorelei said that if she was born on Earth, she would've lived on the beach and surfed all day.<eos> Maybe one day, we'll see a real one.<eos> We'll never touch the land, much less see a beach.<eos> That's not true. We'll get there.<eos> We'll be old, but we'll see it.
Oh!<eos> No, no... see, the ground was wet!<eos> Yeah. Anton and Mr. Jaffe. They come in here a lot.<eos> Anton rented a P.O. box here about six months ago, Box 552.<eos> And he shared it with Jaffe.
Then why did they need the box?<eos> All I know is they both came in twice a week to check it.<eos> - Together?<eos> - No. Usually about an hour apart.<eos> They were using it as a dead drop.
Clothed.<eos> - You're married?<eos> - I am.<eos> You're not wearing a ring.<eos> Well, I-I take it off when I work.
All right?<eos> They're each true to its nature.<eos> An explosion goes, "Boom!" The force of energy expands.<eos> Right.<eos> So how do we reverse it?
Ye're a handsome woman, but if you proved false, I would have had no choice.<eos> But I ken now ye're telling the truth.<eos> May I ask what convinced you?<eos> St. Ninian's spring.<eos> Some folk call it the liar's spring.
Now I know why.<eos> Aw, were you sitting there the whole time thinking I hated it?<eos> Not the whole time.<eos> All right, the whole time.<eos> This song... mom used to sing it to me, didn't she?
Just concern for your daughter.<eos> Ashley, I'm so sorry about the trial.<eos> Divya had it under control. You didn't have to come in.<eos> Of course I did. I don't care about my time.<eos> I only... for as long as I can remember, the one thing that I could always count on was hearing your voice, no matter where I was or what I was doing, and when I heard it, you were right there with me,
As I recall, the floor was pretty comfortable, but...<eos> Well, if we wanna keep this Secret Santa thing secret, we better split up.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> How could you not tell me?<eos> Well... maybe I just didn't want you to take it personally.
Twenty thousand tons?<eos> Powerful enough to wipe cities off the map.<eos> Cities full of people.<eos> Children.<eos> No, the Army will detonate it someplace where it can't hurt anyone.
Looks like someone's going back to no man's land.<eos> We don't have a lot of time, Admiral.<eos> Be a bold move, Locke.<eos> Send a team in, destroy the deposits, nab whoever it is that's mining the stuff.<eos> And find out who they're selling it to.
We don't have a lot of time, Admiral.<eos> Be a bold move, Locke.<eos> Send a team in, destroy the deposits, nab whoever it is that's mining the stuff.<eos> And find out who they're selling it to.<eos> We know who they're selling it to.
You see that prefix?<eos> I know the place that uses this trick to mask their e-mail origins. Let's go.<eos> The sophistication of the e-mail sent to the governor's daughter stamps of this place.<eos> It's a known hacker petri dish.<eos> One guy makes an advancement in deception, passes it on to another guy.
I tried as hard as I could.<eos> I've been trying to hack Vlaxco's records, but all confidential drug trials are kept on an air-gapped system.<eos> That means not connected to the Web.<eos> We can't get it.<eos> If I had another coffee cup in my hand right now, I'd smash it.
Walter, there's got to be... (door bangs open)<eos> Walter!<eos> We see you on the security cam.<eos> I am in a dirty room, Walter.<eos> Just stay calm. Head out the east side door. Do you see it?
What?<eos> Wearing that mask everyday...<eos> Is it some kind of a costume play?<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'm confiscating it!
And it hit me.<eos> She was the activist, not you.<eos> Coming here was her idea.<eos> This was her dream.<eos> She couldn't have freedom, so she wanted it for you?
No.<eos> You'd think I'd have my own wing by now.<eos> Is that your story?<eos> Rehab? Oh, yeah.<eos> They call it Chino.
Yeah.<eos> Somewhere his guys can keep an eye on it.<eos> What about the smack?<eos> We weren't expecting the drugs.<eos> We'll store it with the guns for now;
Rachel, what are you doing here?<eos> I told you needed some time.<eos> And then you told me that you needed to get that image out of your head.<eos> Which is why I need- No.<eos> No, it isn't because you'll never completely get it out of your head.
Maybe they wanted to be far away from here.<eos> Maybe there, they could... be together and start a life together.<eos> There, they could be them. And... farm beef.<eos> ~ Maybe that was worth the sacrifice to him. ~ Yeah?<eos> ~ Yeah. ~ You know, I've got this theory on life and I call it smooth adjustment, right?
Because the boy I loved was taken from me.<eos> And because I fucked Eli yesterday and it's been freaking me out ever since.<eos> Tina!<eos> Tina!<eos> If you just read through your statement, and then if you agree with it, just sign it at the bottom.
And you just happened to end up at my place?<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Well, I'm starting to.<eos> And I guess I'm a little disappointed now.<eos> Look, if you finish it, give me a call if you want.
Okay, this place is 30 minutes outside of New York.<eos> It's a top-secret research facility belonging to the NRO, the National Reconnaissance Office...<eos> The most hi-tech of the government's 16 intel agencies.<eos> They developed this weapon.<eos> Who's transporting it?
The most hi-tech of the government's 16 intel agencies.<eos> They developed this weapon.<eos> Who's transporting it?<eos> A half a dozen soldiers billeted from Fort Dix.<eos> They depart the facility at 0700 hours. Then take it to a facility 45 minutes away.
- Obviously.<eos> If you steal that weapon, you're gonna be behind bars for the rest of your life.<eos> - Obviously not.<eos> - And if you succeed?<eos> You know what kind of man Burton is gonna sell it to.
Yeah.<eos> How the hell did the chinks steal your heroin?<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> Technically, it was their heroin.<eos> They just stole it back.
Yeah.<eos> I might.<eos> I might do, Becky.<eos> Russian flu is real.<eos> It's some psychopathic weaponised virus from the '60s... and they're going to release it, did you know that?
(High-pitched) "Oh, that's awesome. You should feel really good about yourself, Brody."<eos> Honey, we don't have time for side voice right now, okay?<eos> Four people just disappeared from upstairs.<eos> Richardson, Thompson, Martinez, Jackson...<eos> All good men who left behind their stuff. Or, as I now call it, our stuff.
I mean, sexy but anxious.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> How soon do I get the pot?<eos> Oh, no, it's not pot.<eos> We call it medicine.
Right. Well, thank you for sharing.<eos> Recent technical advances in CT and MR imaging have spurred renewed interest in these modalities for the diagnosis of acute and chronic PE.<eos> These techniques can enable accurate clot detection down to segmental pulmonary arteries.<eos> My oldest daughter's riding lesson.<eos> I had to miss it to be here, - so my husband e-mailed the video.
- I'm sure you can.<eos> The problem is your explanations aren't always true.<eos> - Hank's prescription pad. - No, it's not.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> The evidence is right here. We're looking at it.
Oh, I actually have to go.<eos> Someone's new car is here. - Oh.<eos> - But I'll be back by the time you wake up.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hey, where are they dropping it off?
Might be a little difficult.<eos> It's in ashes.<eos> Well, then we have a problem.<eos> Why's that?<eos> The girl who wore it was murdered.
That is how it starts.<eos> Next thing you know, you have a family.<eos> It's been hard for you to watch Tobias and his son.<eos> After my father died, Hank, I felt... sealed off in a world that I do not want for my son.<eos> I want Carlos to enjoy life, not just endure it.
Great.<eos> Talk later?<eos> Maybe more than talk.<eos> At this moment, a song pops into Zelda's head.<eos> She wouldn't call it this, but, from now on, it would be her "big glory" song.
Yeah, I sure do.<eos> What?<eos> D'oh, my badge!<eos> Those demons on the party bus must have stolen it.<eos> If you got a license and credit card, just pay to get it out.
But they won't come out for Agnes.<eos> They're afraid. But there'll be no Hankin or Allingham between them and the ballot box.<eos> Allingham underestimates us. And them.<eos> Sheffield train, Bill.<eos> We show them a better option and they'll take it.
What do you say?<eos> Yes!<eos> Bill, I don't usually go that way.<eos> Besides, it overlooks Allingham Hall.<eos> What's the point of a protest if no-one sees it!
Not really.<eos> And the point where I should have asked passed a long time ago.<eos> - So, an editor takes a raw manuscript... - Mm-hmm.<eos> ...and helps shape the material into a cohesive narrative.<eos> Okay, so, for example, an editor would take your last sentence and turn it into something that I could understand.
I'm afraid things will not end well for him.<eos> And are you on any other medication?<eos> No.<eos> This treatment's only in its infancy, Mr Bourg.<eos> We're piloting it to a limited cross-section of offenders.
It says here, when it was built in 1875, the light was the strongest on the East Coast, and it's one of only 12 lighthouses in the country still equipped with a first-order Fresnel lens.<eos> Impressive. No, no.<eos> The Fresnel lens is incredible.<eos> Fresnel was this French physicist who had the idea to take a glass lens and cut grooves in it in concentric circles.<eos> And each groove acts like a prism that refracts the source light and concentrates it into a beam that can be seen much further away using a much thinner piece of glass.
To keep him from being questioned, or he would end up exposing her.<eos> Blake could never succeed.<eos> He would just end up being arrested with the weapon and the investigation would have fallen out of her hands.<eos> Shit, if you're right, she's an evil genius.<eos> Yeah, and if Frank hands her that weapon, he'll just be giving it to the terrorists he's trying to stop.
It proves collusion.<eos> Not between me and Mike. Between him and Charles Forstman.<eos> And you're just gonna give this to me?<eos> Yup.<eos> And you're gonna give it to Woodall, and we're gonna see what he says.
Take me home.<eos> Okay, jeez.<eos> But I'm not looking for parking in Silver Lake.<eos> I'll slow the car down to a crawl, and you can duck and roll.<eos> You know what, you can take a last look at this face, because it's the last time you're gonna see it.
"Well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns."<eos> Not true.<eos> When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked.<eos> When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay?<eos> The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It'll be delivered to your house. That's it, man.
Oh, sorry.<eos> Looking for michael.<eos> You just missed him.<eos> Is his bag in there, because I want to stick something in it?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'll-I'll grab it for you.
You got a problem, Walinski?<eos> Just relax, man.<eos> It's a thousand degrees out here.<eos> I suggest you enjoy the fresh air.<eos> I'm enjoying it now.
What?<eos> You want me to give you...?<eos> No.<eos> This is my favorite shirt.<eos> You're not putting it on a dead guy.
- Your father has an ulcer.<eos> - Oh, that's a relief!<eos> Yes, it is a relief, but you've got to be good with your diet.<eos> Well said.<eos> We'll take it seriously - white fish, chicken, no alcohol.
We can't stop.<eos> This isn't a Grounder, Finn.<eos> - We have a rope.<eos> - You saw her.<eos> She'd never be able to hold on to it.
I'm clearing the halls as we check it out.<eos> You mean this gun?<eos> - It's not bad bad, Senator.<eos> - So it's okay?<eos> The post reprinted Senator DuPeche's stand-up routine word for word, and now everyone else is picking it up,
You about ready to go to the station?<eos> I am.<eos> Louis, I need a favor, honey.<eos> I'm supposed to host a women's caucus dinner tomorrow night, but my living room is still drying out from that broken pipe.<eos> - Any chance I could have it here?
- I copy, ma'am.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We're listening to the enemy.<eos> Blow the antenna, and we won't be able to do that.<eos> Don't blow it, and we won't make contact with any other
Because i have faith, too.<eos> In my daughter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll send a guard detail with you. No.<eos> They'll see it as a threat.
Cows?<eos> You get milk?<eos> Milk, butter, yogurt.<eos> Most importantly for you, penicillin.<eos> Amy makes it herself.
Did you check out the department video camera by any chance?<eos> Yeah, I was gonna take it home and videotape the top of my head.<eos> I think I might be thinning up there.<eos> Cool, cool.<eos> So I accidentally left a tape in there, and I want it back. Why?
I work with the one man in the world who doesn't care.<eos> You work for Berlin?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Berlin sent me with an offer.<eos> If I were you, I would think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
We face what we got to face.<eos> Take Brody, learn things.<eos> What the hell you waiting for?<eos> Well, you did offer breakfast.<eos> We'll take it to go.
Here's a key.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I understand your frustration here, Mr. Page.<eos> But in order for me to issue a warrant for a DNA test for someone for a crime that was committed 11 years ago who wasn't even a suspect, I'm gonna need probable cause.<eos> And you're not giving it to me.
It wasn't exactly a well-handled piece of evidence, but I was ready.<eos> - Okay, so what happened?<eos> - Get this.<eos> I get a call from the Jersey State Supreme Court office.<eos> Some judge wants to know what case this evidence is for and why I'm testing it in Jersey.
I'm sorry, I-I just...<eos> I-I didn't mean to bother you.<eos> My mother sang that to me when I was young.<eos> Her whole life, she sang that to me.<eos> I hadn't heard it in a while, and I...
Oh, Mike, I'm sorry.<eos> I was dumb.<eos> I was so dumb! Eh, it's not your fault.<eos> It's both of ours.<eos> We tried to find joy, and the universe clearly does not want us to have it.
Thanks.<eos> Avery, did I mention that Hunt and I are starting a special project with veterans?<eos> - We are?<eos> - We are.<eos> We are taking a chunk of my research money and focusing it on prosthetics for vets... free, pain-free, right?
You've got to hear this.<eos> Please, I can't help you if you don't give me your location.<eos> What is this?<eos> 911 call, came in a few minutes ago.<eos> Tracing it now.
I'm not putting my wedding ring in the closet.<eos> I'm not supposed to let you keep anything.<eos> I'm sorry. They won't allow any jewelry into the operating room.<eos> I'll give it to one of the kids.<eos> Adam will take it. I'll give it to Adam.
Suction. I can't even see the field.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I'm losing her.<eos> There's a solution. We'll find it.
You're over by half a mil.<eos> You're just going to have to give us raises.<eos> - I don't disagree. - CAM:<eos> Reggie. - Hmm?<eos> - CASSIE: Baby, we found the dream house and I love it.
Shutts Hill.<eos> - It's not west, is it?<eos> No, but that ridge is high.<eos> Goes all the way along there.<eos> Houses dotted along it.
Well, yeah, he has been dead for probably a hundred years now.<eos> What did you find?<eos> A mistake.<eos> The original Mary Kelly had a cut on her wrist in the shape of a semicircle.<eos> But one newspaper, the Manchester Herald, wrongly reported it as a star.
Cristela, don't use that word in front of the kids.<eos> I didn't mean "sex" like sex sex. You know, I mean "sex" like the sex that you are.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> Keep talking. Cristela, don't say the word "sex."<eos> Ay, now I'm saying it.
The Artemis Moon Candle was the last thing my mother gave me before the earth swallowed me whole.<eos> Like in Tremors.<eos> Kenzi's second favourite Kevin Bacon movie.<eos> Demeter knew that Hades abhors light... and that it could illuminate my way home.<eos> And where does Pops keep it?
What's in it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If I had opened this box, and there was evidence, morally I would have been compelled to share it with the prosecution.<eos> So I didn't open it.<eos> But I didn't destroy it either.
Trouble you.<eos> If you see it, please contact me.<eos> Halo!<eos> - = Son of missing = - Hello, if you see it please contact me.<eos> - = Son of missing = = Son of missing = - Hello, if you see it please contact me.
Just give my information to Leonard.<eos> Tell him I came by.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here's the drill.<eos> I want you to hustle up those stairs to the roof, grab the roll of hose, bring it back down, fast but secure.
Every time I start the car, I'm giving back to the Earth.<eos> That's both environmentally friendly and you're Liev Schreiber!<eos> It's incredible!<eos> As is that scarf.<eos> But tell me, Liev Schreiber, why are you still wearing it inside?
Why? She's just responded to a company-wide e-mail regarding the fracking case, "not my problem, turds."<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> What is this song, and why is everyone sharing it with me?
Bitch, you think you're the only one with a bicycle chain?<eos> - I'd like to buy an E.<eos> - You don't really expect me to play along with this insanity, do you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unless you want me to cut off your face - and feed it to Back-Pat.
This is the USS Serano to the San Dominick.<eos> Come in. You have my money?<eos> We're close.<eos> My boss signed off on the request.<eos> The bank's processing it.
Actually, I should really sit at the special table with the other heads of department.<eos> ~ Have you been sleeping in my classroom?<eos> ~ Like a dirty vagrant?<eos> MISS POSTERN: All Gareth needs is a place to sleep.<eos> This is my bedroom, or, as I call it, Shag Central.
We need evidence to do that, and we don't have it yet.<eos> He killed my dog.<eos> He attacked me.<eos> Isn't that enough evidence?<eos> There's nothing to link him to those two incidences, but if there is evidence to be found, we will find it, Andrea.
The RTCC worked fast.<eos> Well, they're good with computers.<eos> Spanish Harlem? That's Trinitarios territory.<eos> The abandoned school is their headquarters.<eos> They keep it under heavy guard.
What do you think made the special brownies special?<eos> Love?<eos> Your mom and I don't view weed as a drug.<eos> I mean, to us, it's medicine.<eos> And we only provide it to those in need.
Perhaps, right.<eos> So, Bones, you know, I've been thinking about Christine.<eos> And school.<eos> Right? There's a great public school right in our area.<eos> The neighborhood kids, they love it.
Fat lot of good that did.<eos> All right, you stay here.<eos> Watch for trouble.<eos> We've got some digging to do.<eos> If the placenta's really buried in Hugo's back yard, I can find it myself.
Believe me, she knows we're onto her.<eos> So I doubt she's going home.<eos> Now, where are we with Wagner's thumbprint?<eos> Well, I spoke to one of the partners at his firm.<eos> He uses it as a biometric key.
Dean!<eos> ...and that they were willing to go above and beyond to save one another.<eos> Say something!<eos> It was about religion, it was about fate, it was deeply about Dean as a character.<eos> I guess, if you're gonna have faith, you can't just have it when the miracles happen.
Yeah, so?<eos> So, you know what's wrapped in wax-covered cardboard?<eos> Dynamite.<eos> She broke in here to steal sticks of these.<eos> Ranchers use dynamite to clear their land. What the hell was Whitney using it for?
It's been three years for me.<eos> Even the first couple times I did it...<eos> What can you do if you're always worried about that?<eos> If you don't pop the cherry, it'll just bother you more!<eos> You can't carry it around your entire life!
26 satellites scouring the world for your map.<eos> Good.<eos> Multispectral images, ground-penetrating radar.<eos> Now we wait for the ding that says we have a match.<eos> If there's evidence of this city on Earth, the computer will find it.
It's a form of ostension, when someone does the acts described in a story in order to bring them to life.<eos> We've seen it before with the poisoning of Halloween candy and most recently with the Slenderman case in Wisconsin earlier this year.<eos> That's the case where two girls stabbed their best friend because they believed in doing so, they would become proxies of a mystical being.<eos> Also known as legend tripping.<eos> The unsub assumes the mantle of an established story, then brings it to life in his own way by recreating the circumstances described in that lore.
Either you lead me to Berlin or I lead Berlin to you.<eos> How exactly did you come upon this information?<eos> A CI. Someone the Bureau trusts.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> If the Bureau had a lead, they'd follow it.
I meant in his wheelchair.<eos> It's an old shoplifter's trick.<eos> What?<eos> The Tapping method. Perfect for multiple choice questions.<eos> I merely tap out the number of the question that I'm stuck on. And then whoever has the answer, taps it out back to me.
You're amazing.<eos> My whole life, you made sure my bike tires were pumped up.<eos> You let me ride on your shoulders when I cleaned out the gutter.<eos> Whenever mom yells, "I just can't do it anymore," you make my lunch for a few days.<eos> And best of all, when you find a pretty rock at the quarry, you always bring it home for me.
- Listen, hey! All right, listen, I get it.<eos> All right?<eos> You got a beef with me.<eos> Sandbag my career, fine.<eos> But don't take it out on Molly's II.
He cut me off before I could deprecate. I still need to deprecate.<eos> Eliza, wait till you see what's just up ahead!<eos> - Oh, my God, - I can't wait.<eos> I'm bombing. I'm tanking.<eos> I can feel the promotion slipping through my fingers. - I can feel it.
But this time you could really get hurt. Everyone sees it.<eos> We're all worried about you.<eos> There what is?<eos> That feeling.<eos> I haven't felt it since I left Fowlerton, since you left me.
You know how much blood's in your dick when you're real hard? So all that just came pouring right out.<eos> Ugh...<eos> But I think I got it settled down now.<eos> How?<eos> I opened up your mayo, ga And mayonnaise has healing properties, the Indians used it.
They said downstairs the queen was here, but I wasn't sure.<eos> Where is King Francis?<eos> Well, he's searching eastward of here.<eos> But I saw a carriage outside.<eos> I'll borrow it and take you both back to the castle and send messengers to let him know you're all right.
Some HYDRA loyalists from Skull's old knitting circle hijacked a S.H.I.E.L.D. armory.<eos> They're threatening to blow it up, unless we release him.<eos> Sending you the GPS tag now.<eos> That base is just outside Seattle.<eos> If they blow it, it'll wipe out everything in a 50-mile radius, them included.
How many times are we gonna...<eos> When you took off your suit, in what order did you remove your items?<eos> I followed protocol. Which is?<eos> Boots.<eos> And unzipped my suit. Removed it.
~ No deal.<eos> ~ And a spicy bean burger meal deal.<eos> ~ Enjoying your drink?<eos> ~ All right, don't be like that.<eos> We paid for it so I'm drinking it.
This happens every time ... we get closer, you get nervous.<eos> Everything we've been doing leads here.<eos> Our job ...<eos> find it before anyone else.<eos> If there's evidence of this city on Earth, the computer will find it.
Since we don't know how many of those creatures are in there, we can set up groups of canisters and create explosions that take them out a wave at a time.<eos> How will you get the creatures close enough to the rhydonium to be effective?<eos> - Well, we're gonna need bait.<eos> - Where do we get that?<eos> We don't get it. We are it.
Read any history book about the town's founding members.<eos> The guys that live in this house are Damon and Stefan Salvatore.<eos> Why are you just telling me this now?<eos> Because... They're vampires, and wherever they go, death and pain always follow.<eos> So if you're looking for family, you're not gonna find it here.
Your rhythm has returned to normal, and your levels are stabilizing nicely.<eos> You were very lucky that when you got shocked,<eos> David was there to administer CPR.<eos> You saved my life?<eos> I'd like to take you up for an MRI, if you feel up to it.
Joel?<eos> She can have it.<eos> It's our kids' home.<eos> It's your home.<eos> I want you to have it.
I don't know.<eos> Look, I have a buddy who has a cabin in the mountains not far from Park City.<eos> Your buddy has a cabin?<eos> His parents do. It's like a vacation house.<eos> They only use it a few times out of the year.
Yes.<eos> That's a great start.<eos> Hello.<eos> Um, thanks for the bottle of champagne.<eos> Bartender told me you sent it.
Across town.<eos> I live with my fiancé Gunnery Sergeant Mike Johnson and his son.<eos> Do they go to the house?<eos> Not really.<eos> Mike checks on it about once a week.
LOOK, SOMETIMES IN A MOVIE, A PERSON THINKS THEY WANT SOMETHING, BUT THEN -- OOH!<eos> LIKE IN THE "CARE BEARS: BIG WISH MOVIE."<eos> OKAY.<eos> I LEARNED MY DAMN LESSON.<eos> LEWIS HAS MY SHIT, AND I WANT IT BACK.
You don't strike me as a Rolex kind of guy.<eos> I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that if I check the serial numbers on that watch, it would be registered to Jack Mikorski.<eos> Yo, I'd listen to my partner.<eos> I do not like being up here.<eos> If you make me pull my gun, I'm using it.
I am?<eos> 1,200 bucks a night for a room and they don't even tell you where the ice machine is.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Can you at least open this for me?<eos> Like, just open it with your hands.
We were broke.<eos> We had this song, "Chicken Fried." We put on a CD in '05.<eos> This band, The Lost Trailers, called and said,<eos> "We wanna record 'Chicken Fried.'"<eos> I was like, "Well, I don't have a problem with you recording the song, but this is our song, and as long as you don't release it to radio, if you wanna have it on your record, I'm fine with that."
There was the Gershwins, Irving Berlin.<eos> People wrote songs to be popular.<eos> You know, you bought the sheet music.<eos> Sheet music was the first records.<eos> When they created the music industry, they created it from a completely different place.
Who knows about this?<eos> Hunt?<eos> Uh, anyone?<eos> Fetal surgery is a new field.<eos> The few of us who are practicing it are basically inventing it as we go along.
Electrocution is something I use sparingly...<eos> Usually on the back.<eos> Other times, somewhere else.<eos> How can it turn deadly?<eos> If the person administering it doesn't know what they're doing.
- Wrap this scarf around his booty.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Here's your scarf.<eos> Sorry I'm so late getting it back.
I'm jumping around and everything, and I'm so up.<eos> When I crawl back to the car...<eos> - I got my booty...<eos> - How often do you need the fix?<eos> Oh, I'd like to have it more often than I get it.
There should be unlimited add/drops in our league!<eos> No, that's a battle for another day.<eos> Right now, I just want to know what animal would do this. Enough out of you, Ruxin.<eos> Taco, what's going on with the new place?<eos> When can we see it?
For I was also the daughter of Jacob's four wives.<eos> And it was here... In the sacred place where the women went to bleed during the full moon, that I came to know the secrets and wisdom and love of my mothers.<eos> Four half-sisters born of the same father... a cruel and stingy man named Laban, who cursed the gods for only giving him daughters.<eos> His oldest, my mother, Leah, was strong and capable and splendidly arrogant.<eos> My aunt, Rachel, possessed a beauty as powerful as it was unearthly, and she wielded it like a sword.
- Have you heard of the troubles, mr. Brody?<eos> Were you aware that if your father died, You would inherit his popularity?<eos> - Oh, chris, we love you.<eos> - That is a nasty infection on your leg.<eos> We're going to take a small biopsy And send it off for analysis.
And would it have mattered?<eos> Would you have just let your daughter's spirit burn out forever?<eos> Feed the lantern.<eos> - No. - I suppose, after all these years, you just don't care for her anymore.<eos> Hold your tongue, or I'll remove it from your mouth!
Yes, it's always the same.<eos> I am the most awesome king ever, Maurice, and then I wake up and see you.<eos> Maybe some day that dream will come true.<eos> Please. We'd have to pry the crown from my uncle's, cold dead head.<eos> And even then, he probably wouldn't give it to you.
That is a bare-faced lie!<eos> Is it?<eos> No.<eos> I've spent my life in taverns claiming to be a hero.<eos> I know the real thing when I see it.
I guess he needs a map posthaste.<eos> It's fine, it's brilliant, actually.<eos> He's been giving me a lot more responsibility.<eos> The way I see it, the chores are my tuition.<eos> Look, if you want the benefit of my experience, he knows you see it that way.
"The County of King James, Virginia, 1794."<eos> It's the only known copy.<eos> But it's not actually the most valuable of the maps that were taken.<eos> How much are we talking?<eos> We haven't appraised it in some time, but I'd put it in the $200,000 range.
Including the Bray map.<eos> It was the only one that was laid out.<eos> Zupko must have been standing here.<eos> Obviously, he was examining the map when he was killed.<eos> Or displaying it for a buyer.
I know that the one that turned up is a fake.<eos> I'm interested in the original, same as you.<eos> Hearing that the Brays owned a copy is the closest I've come to finding one.<eos> Which is the other reason I'm here.<eos> I'd like to hire you to find it for me.
Bollocks.<eos> If he did, he would've passed that information to the police the same way he bought that atlas. Anonymously. No.<eos> The real purpose of this meeting was to buy our allegiance.<eos> He knows that we seek the Bray map.<eos> And in the event we find it, he wants to ensure we pass it to no one but him.
There are some who may have the knowledge you seek.<eos> They are known as the Grey Sisters.<eos> They are the most powerful seers on this earth.<eos> Nothing escapes their gaze, not even the minds of the Gods.<eos> If there is a cure for Ariadne, they will know it.
Stop questioning my leadership.<eos> That is not what is required in an emergency situation.<eos> I'm driving along...<eos> I will deal with the responsibility.<eos> And I dealt with it straight away.
Jeremy and I, however, were too busy enjoying ourselves to notice the view.<eos> Whoa!<eos> There you go. Yeah!<eos> Rally stage.<eos> And stick it into the corner. Power it round. Little bit of boot, full of opposite lock.
'Jeremy and I, however, 'were too busy enjoying ourselves to notice the view.'<eos> Whoa!<eos> There you go. Yeah!<eos> Rally stage.<eos> And stick it into the corner. Power it round. Little bit of boot, full of opposite lock.
This view is amazing. Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You know, I used to walk by houses like this and think the people on the decks were just looking down their noses at everyone, feeling all superior.<eos> Now I know it's true.<eos> Roger sold our beach house 'cause he said we never used it.
Carmelo a little, but that's beside the point.<eos> I have to have my gallbladder removed.<eos> I swear... first the dishwasher and now this.<eos> Why can't everything in the house work at the same time?<eos> They're gonna remove it?
Why can't everything in the house work at the same time?<eos> They're gonna remove it?<eos> - Surgically?<eos> - No,<eos> Arthur, they're gonna coax it out with promises of a better life.
'We all needs a mate...' Hiya!<eos> '..it's natural.'<eos> And it might take you a while to find the right one, but you will.<eos> And you might lose 'em, but it was good that you found them in the first place.<eos> Everyone here has had a mate and lost 'em, but life's only interesting if you shares it.

Take the key and go in the back door.<eos> The alarm code is 4242. Go up to the bedroom.<eos> On the bed is a letter.<eos> And it's addressed to Michael.<eos> Take it home and save it for me when I get back. But listen, promise me that you won't read it.
Let's not screw around.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Just tell me what the hell it is you want.<eos> There's only one thing I want from you, and I want it so desperately I could scream.
Now they're seeking radiation.<eos> To reproduce.<eos> Current tracking models indicate that all three targets are converging here:<eos> San Francisco Bay.<eos> But if we rig a nuclear warhead with a shielded timer... put it on a boat and send it... 20 miles out... the radiation lures the MUTOs... and the MUTOs lure Godzilla.
(IN BLACK SPEECH)<eos> I would not antagonize her.<eos> You like killing things, Orc?<eos> You like death?<eos> Then let me give it to you.
We know nothing about you.<eos> Who here can vouch for your character?<eos> Me.<eos> I'll vouch for him.<eos> I have traveled far with these Dwarves through great danger and if Thorin Oakenshield gives his word then he will keep it.
I know.<eos> Thank you. That was... important to me. Thank you.<eos> Are you back at the mill?<eos> Just can't get enough of it, you know?<eos> I hear they're gonna close it.
Look. There.<eos> I told you.<eos> No talent.<eos> The records indicate that you are a highly intelligent man.<eos> As such, I would have expected you to see the situation and understand it for what it is.
Now, this next part of the boogie woogie is so strange, it really calls for an explanation.<eos> It's called a boogie woogie break.<eos> When I'm playing it and I stop at a certain point... you're going to think I've forgotten the music.<eos> But I didn't forget the music. There's just no music written for that part.<eos> That's why they call it a break.
- It's so pretty.<eos> No. I mean, why?<eos> Getting rid of a lot of this stuff. I just thought you might want that sideboard.<eos> Well, no, Mom, I wouldn't have any way to get that home to Colorado.<eos> Maybe Ivy will take it.
Kid mangles dick and sues iBabe.<eos> Our goal is to eliminate step two and step three.<eos> Now I know what the problem is.<eos> Why don't we just move the fan?<eos> Why don't we just put it in her ear?
Sorry, Jean.<eos> I wouldn't bother with them.<eos> Most of them will die soon anyway, without your help.<eos> Three of them, a week from now in the same truck.<eos> This sword is hundreds of years old... And was named Danzan by the first samurai who used it.
So you haven't found them?<eos> Don't play with me, bitch.<eos> I could kill you.<eos> If you could make me feel something, Harada, that would be sublime.<eos> I can slit your pretty mouth open, before you open it to say one more stupid...
Is she okay?<eos> It's okay, I got you.<eos> Did you get that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll have the footage developed and get it over to Father Gordon.
Cut me. I need a wound like Jamie's.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I'll be healed in minutes.<eos> Take it from him. Do it yourself.<eos> They'll be suspicious of this scar. I can cover it with a cut.
You think you traded me for the cherry bomb?<eos> You think that's how things work?<eos> I left it there for you.<eos> It wasn't an accident.<eos> I wanted you to find it and give it back to me.
What?<eos> - I can not believe you asked me that.<eos> - Okay, it's okay.<eos> And what about the car?<eos> someone will surely find it.
someone will surely find it.<eos> Malakukan what you want me?<eos> call the police?<eos> Do not worry about it.<eos> I will make sure no one is going to find it.
My problem?<eos> You just spent the last five years taking care of Methuselah.<eos> We were married.<eos> See, nobody believes in friendship.<eos> People talk about it. You see it on TV. People drop by and then go to the doctor together.
Jerry would want you to have it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Ray!<eos> What in God's name happened to my car?<eos> Next time, don't park it in the fire zone.
Get me the G.l. Joes.<eos> Star One Flight commander separating for drop.<eos> All right, listen up!<eos> That nuke cannot have gone far.<eos> Once we have it, we will disarm it en route to the L.Z.!
Each satellite contains 10 hollow platinum tubes filled with a tungsten rod.<eos> Zeus satellite 1-A approaching London.<eos> Ordnance live and loaded.<eos> Awaiting drop authorisation.<eos> Now, to direct a rod to its target, we don't launch it or fire it.
And on that note... I was thinking it might be nice to have a royal feast.<eos> Maybe a grand roast.<eos> My sister has been telling me that your magic is really quite powerful.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes, boggling to the minds of all who witness it.
"the last scene of reason,<eos> Paradise one were two seagulls that flew over the water.<eos> Paradise two were a cluster of clouds in the northern east skies.<eos> Yesterday I sensed a strange presence.<eos> There was no one there but I still felt it.
Sure.<eos> I'd take it.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> Four years later, why not?<eos> I'd totally take it.
Only a year?<eos> You do not love me, then?<eos> I pray you, good Mercutio, let's go.<eos> The Capulets are out.<eos> You are like the man who snatches off his sword, on a tavern's table, lays it down forthwith and vows to have no need of it.
You do not love me, then?<eos> I pray you, good Mercutio, let's go.<eos> The Capulets are out.<eos> You are like the man who snatches off his sword, on a tavern's table, lays it down forthwith and vows to have no need of it.<eos> Till, with the second beer, he takes it up and runs his host right through.
Shut up and just get on the ground!<eos> And you'd better tell people The Motherfucker was here.<eos> What's wrong with you, boy?<eos> Get on the floor, too, Gandalf, or I will bust a cap in your ass.<eos> You're gonna bust your own face when that gun kicks if you don't hold it properly.
Oh, my God.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Hallelujah!<eos> All right, there is a word I like to hear.<eos> Let's be saying it when we find out where we are.
Oh, my baby!<eos> - Mom, mom, there's a sword.<eos> - A sword?<eos> There's a sword in the corner, okay?<eos> I need you to stand up and get it for me.
You can have in one day, and one in the next.<eos> That should keep you going till wednesday.<eos> All right.<eos> And potato salad.<eos> But with no mayonnaise so you can warm it through.
That should keep you going till wednesday.<eos> All right.<eos> And potato salad.<eos> But with no mayonnaise so you can warm it through.<eos> Well I could even have it with the red cabbage.
I always took her to school... in the car... every day.<eos> but that morning... she just...<eos> Why did it have to be her?<eos> Take off your vest.<eos> No need to wear it indoors.
No shame, Agent Fuller.<eos> No shame.<eos> I'm just having fun.<eos> So, if you had nothing to do with it, then how did the playing card get into the vault?<eos> Oh, yes. That would be... What do the kids call it these days?
Give your audience $3 million.<eos> Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?<eos> Best finale ever.<eos> They're gonna be the first magicians in history to get laid.<eos> Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down, - put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
Appreciate you flying with us today.<eos> So, what's in it for Tressler, besides the money?<eos> Ego.<eos> Okay, pick your card.<eos> Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.
Now you've got new orders.<eos> Open it up.<eos> Okay. Here's what I want.<eos> At this moment, they think that safe's leaving this site.<eos> So we stay with it. We follow it all the way to...
Fair enough, yeah.<eos> I get it.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> I took your stuff. Excuse me?<eos> I took your stuff and I went through it all.
That's our case.<eos> And what does forensics say?<eos> Forensics says the gun was inside her mouth, handle and trigger guard down, which means that the front sight was up.<eos> Now, somebody yells, "take that gun out of your mouth."<eos> She pulls it out fast.
"You don't want something else?"<eos> The Italian says, "No, give me a fork!"<eos> He says, "We don't have a fork!"<eos> He says, "Find me a fucking fork!"<eos> So the chief goes out, finds him a fork, he brings it over, hands it to him.
I mean, look at this.<eos> It's pretty much built for us.<eos> I mean fix this up a little, throw a nail here.<eos> Paint it.<eos> We change the sign, you know, "Mike, Chris, Chris." Whatever you want, or we don't even have to change it.
I'm thinking big, all right?<eos> This is going to be fantastic.<eos> We're doing video surveillance.<eos> I'm doing this from the feet up.<eos> You will never do it properly because you got too much government attitude to be small and sleek.
Sorry, my dear, what was the question you asked me?<eos> Do you remember Nightshade?<eos> Vaguely.<eos> It was some kind of a bomb, I believe.<eos> Dr. Bailey, people are looking for that weapon. People who want to use it.
Cyberspace is like a galaxy of passageways, constantly moving streams of data.<eos> With a simple computer, anyone can enter and explore.<eos> That's what Julian Assange liked to do, explore.<eos> He liked to use trap doors to enter where he wasn't supposed to go, to find secrets and expose them.<eos> He built a machine for leaking secrets and called it "WikiLeaks."
If this works, we've got a better chance of getting out of here.<eos> Let's say that there's been an ecological disaster for Carcharias.<eos> An offshore oil rig has failed, spilling millions of gallons of crude into the ocean.<eos> Now, there are three Carcharias owned companies that are potentially liable.<eos> The builder of the rig, the ones that operate it, and the company that owns the oil.
- I'm not here to talk about Victor Crowley.<eos> Well, then what the hell do you want?<eos> We are here on official police business.<eos> You've got a piece of evidence that is part of our investigation.<eos> We wanted to borrow it and then bring it right back to ya.
You know what, son?<eos> I once stood where you're standing now, mistaking my own hubris for God's touch.<eos> That ain't religion, son. That's called self-glorification.<eos> Best you leave this one alone.<eos> Put it down.
- It's ours.<eos> What do you mean, it's yours?<eos> You still own it?<eos> Yes, we own it.<eos> Michael's been renovating it.
Of course.<eos> Stupidly?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> But we don't mind, because that's the way we're made.<eos> And when it's time to die we don't resist death, we summon it.
There's no Blade Runner, there's no William Gibson.<eos> There's no Matrix, there's no-- All these other things that sort of come organically down this line.<eos> A lot of people took images and ideas with them and incorporated them into other projects so it always leads back to Jodorowsky.<eos> When you get involved in the process of bringing a beast like this to life and when you don't get the chance to realize that to put the thing on screen, it goes on living inside your head. You never get a chance to exorcise it.<eos> And a story like that can stick around and stick around and goes on haunting your dreams for the rest of your life unless you can get it out.
That's interesting.<eos> They create a... a completeness?<eos> As, for example, the handshake, which for all people is the sum of all the different handshakes that together form our view of what a handshake is.<eos> The good, the bad handshake, the firm, the limp.<eos> Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as... someone who can't get enough, and therefore, has sex with many different people. Well, that, of course, is true, but if I'm to be honest, I see it precisely as the sum of all these different sexual experiences.
- My mother thinks I belong in it.<eos> I'm not sure I feel that.<eos> - But I'm already strapped into this coffin. - Magda.<eos> What?<eos> I want you to secure it, and lock it...
End of conversation.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Leslie Chow is madness.<eos> You don't talk to madness.<eos> If you're lucky, you trap it in the trunk of your limo and you kill it.
If you're hungry, let me know.<eos> Shall I leave the water bottle behind?<eos> I'll put it in the shade.<eos> I'm putting it down here.<eos> You've got to look, or you can't find it.
- See the ball.<eos> Keep it fluid.<eos> There we go.<eos> See the ball.<eos> The thing was, when Frank threw the ball, I hit it.
Sorry, didn't you just see what happened up there?<eos> Yeah, what?<eos> Are you feeling sorry for yourself?<eos> No, I like my music.<eos> I mean who cares if they don't get it, right?
We've had 50 years now of water reactors, 400 of them, roughly, all over the world.<eos> And they've produced a hell-of-a-lot of waste that we didn't anticipate.<eos> You know, you've mentioned a 100,000 years of stuff that you gotta keep isolated from the rest of the world, it's enough to scare a lot of people.<eos> There was perhaps a price we paid for commercialization, in the sense that we didn't look ahead.<eos> Nuclear power was developed as a kind of a boutique energy source by utilities executives who really didn't know much about it.
First of all, we're talking about human, just quality of life.<eos> And, ah, if you look at the countries with the best quality of life, they are the countries that consume the most electricity.<eos> Rain or shine, 24 hours a day, a steady stream of power.<eos> The global south is pretty warm, they would like air conditioning.<eos> And, up 'till now, they've not been able to afford it. And now they can.
Our exodus.<eos> When NASA asked me to build them a new state-of-the-art luxury space station, I luxuriously told them to fuck themselves.<eos> Why, you ask?<eos> Well, because I'd already built one of my own.<eos> It's up there right now, just floating the fuck around, waiting for me and my people to inhabit it.
You mad little British bastard.<eos> Yeah. Well, you know...<eos> Where do you know that song from? Um...<eos> My mother had the record.<eos> We'd listen to it endlessly as kids.
There, now you look like an eighth-grade teacher out looking for a perv.<eos> I gotta warn you.<eos> You're not gonna make many friends for reopening up this case, not down here.<eos> Whoever gave you that file just fucked his next promotion... and your career.<eos> They call it The Track, like for horses.
They're showing Calculon's star on the Walk of Fame!<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> I'll always have that.<eos> Calculon was truly the has-been's has-been.<eos> And so I am proud to tear up his star and replace it with a second star for the fabulous Robert Wagner.
When the Freedom of Information Act released a bunch of documents, you found out that all these different subjects that had taken this chemical all experienced the same phenomena under the drug.<eos> They experienced something out there that came to them, that met them halfway.<eos> But what you can't lose sight of is what all of this would mean in terms of individual human beings.<eos> There would be deaths, there would be long-lasting and harmful effects.<eos> Everyone who took this chemical saw and witnessed the same thing, and they all named it the same thing, even though they were separate subjects.

What'd they name it?
Hurry, and speak to no one.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Judith's grave is in bloom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The neighbour doesn't want the house anymore. He's keeping it for you.
- Relax. - No!<eos> I won't relax.<eos> I mean... How am I supposed to explain this to Jason?<eos> Very simply. Don't.<eos> - Because we're not going to cut it.
Let it sink in, trust me when this stuff hits, it hits.<eos> I see what you mean.<eos> Very smooth, Very mellow, very wow.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> Manny, he's handing out samples, Some little old lady in pasadena, is growing it in her basement.
Karim.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> Where I am going, there is a river of wine... and women... Women that are more beautiful than in the Shah's harem.<eos> There might even be a redhead.<eos> God gives us life... and God takes it back.
I don't give a fuck if they don't let people out!<eos> You didn't see what I just saw!<eos> We have to leave!<eos> What about the infection?<eos> We just need to all stay inside. That way we don't get it.
Neither did Auntie Jackie and she's just over the ridge.<eos> Could it have been an accident, do you think?<eos> A shotgun blast up close? No.<eos> Did Mima own a gun?<eos> She keeps it in the hall cupboard.
I'll buy some more.<eos> What, are we done with the dog and the biscuits? - Sure.<eos> - Joseph.<eos> Duncan wanted to buy the croft.<eos> Joseph wanted Mima to sell it.
Right, son?<eos> It's a giant mountain, Mali!<eos> Only God can get the boat up there.<eos> Over there!<eos> We pull it up the hill, put it on the truck...
Of course you are.<eos> You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it.<eos> The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.<eos> No point in trying to hide behind that face.<eos> I know fear when I see it.
A demon?<eos> A conjuror's trick?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.<eos> And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.
We won't provide it.<eos> It's part of our training... how to deal with people who want the recipe too bad.<eos> - Oh? -We have a phrase we have to repeat.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - "We won't provide it."
Don't be silly.<eos> I asked the man on the gate and he said you'd taken over from the boss.<eos> I'm only his private secretary.<eos> What about the car?<eos> He lets me use it.
An army of 500 are only hours behind me.<eos> All this talk of reason... Sounds like a cover-up for weakness.<eos> We lie here because we have no choice.<eos> We need land!<eos> We either take it or our people perish.
No, please, look upstairs, by all means.<eos> This is my dark room, as you can see.<eos> I'd like to look inside if I may.<eos> These are just my photographs.<eos> Well, I'm very interested in photography. We're using it more and more ourselves.
Why revenge?<eos> I still, I don't know what they've done to you<eos> What they've done?<eos> Yes, they, them, not me.<eos> You're looking for some kind of justice and you're seeking it for revenge but there is a difference... - between the two of them and you can't see it.
- Really nice.<eos> - I don't care about the way I look.<eos> - There's more of you to love.<eos> - Great.<eos> - You want me to read it to you?
How to tie it.<eos> It's, uh, a Windsor knot. I think.<eos> Hey, man, I could tie it for you.<eos> I mean, I don't know if it's a Windsor, but it's the kind I do on me, for church. Tie it on me.<eos> Then, we transfer it to you.
One day, Lupo, all that you see here will fall under Rome's rule.<eos> And if that day happens a bit further down the road, because of Da Vinci's intervention... ..so be it.<eos> But he has the key.<eos> That makes him one step closer to obtaining the Book of Leaves.<eos> Let him keep it for now.
Show them and us how not to give all the heart.<eos> Want to give it a try?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> You're not re-envisioning the song, you're actually just directing it differently.
No.<eos> What if we make it more clearly about the fame?<eos> About how people do anything to get it?<eos> Wait.<eos> So the song about fame and what people do to get it doesn't do that?
And if you don't want to do the work, I will find someone who will.<eos> No, no.<eos> That's not it. Remember, this number is about Marilyn realizing that being taken seriously as an actress is not the same thing as becoming a star.<eos> I understand the song.<eos> Thanks. You might get it up here, but I'm not feeling it in here.
Renai, it's me, it's okay.<eos> I tried reaching you. I tried everything.<eos> I played your song.<eos> I should've known it was you.<eos> Only you could play it that badly.
You're not riding through the canyon tonight.<eos> Babe, why don't we make him a bed out there in the studio?<eos> Oh, and I wanted you to hear the song too.<eos> It's just a demo.<eos> I think I'm going to wait until she's ready for me to hear it.
Hey, Daddy!<eos> CALVIN: You got another one?<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> Listen, I just wanted to bring you this casserole.<eos> I want you to eat it this time.
Take it, Daddy.<eos> - Well, look who's here.<eos> - Hey, Olivia.<eos> Olivia brought me a casserole.<eos> I won't eat it, but it's sweet of her to bring it.
You always hated water.<eos> At the seaside, you always refused to swim.<eos> Can't I change?<eos> What'd you do with a boat?<eos> I'd go paragliding. Or put it on my balcony as a flowerpot!
Did you drug me again, you fucking wanker?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Guess what, though.<eos> While you were sleeping, I wrote you a fucking song.<eos> I'll play it to you back at the hotel. - Okay.
The land of milk and honey.<eos> Kate.<eos> Betty...<eos> Please. Let me help you.<eos> I gave my daughter life, you will not destroy it.
That's Morris Brown.<eos> He owns this entire chain. - Oh, wow!<eos> - Droppin' by to get his ass kissed, I like that. - I<eos> - I really think that this is your best bet.<eos> I mean, they might call it Coffee Town, but I call it Coffee Home.
Anticipating problems before they whack you in the face.<eos> Communicating, not competing.<eos> But politics is competitive.<eos> "A blood sport," didn't someone call it?<eos> Which is why we never bring it home.
We may need you to develop other... less direct contingencies.<eos> The Medicis are the reason<eos> Florence is a sanctuary for sorcerers and...sodomites.<eos> They've turned my city away from the Lord.<eos> Together, Holy Father, we will turn it back.
What do you mean?<eos> Landing gear does not work, so we have to make an emergency landing.<eos> It's very dangerous, they need to prepare the track in a special mode ...<eos> In short, a mess.<eos> Why they do not prepare it?
But in the end I brought only heroin, cocaine and pills.<eos> Where was my head at!<eos> The mescaline was retired in '86 ...<eos> It's being manufactured at Valencia again.<eos> I have a 'pusher' friend who sells it in Madrid.
Let her talk<eos> Explain, Bruna.<eos> For hours I smell death.<eos> From the beginning of trip, but I thought they were farts.<eos> I don't smell it in the whole plane.
I'm not trying to start an argument here.<eos> You make it sound like I'm in the wrong.<eos> No, you know exactly what you're doing, Orrin.<eos> You're using this poor girl's death for your own political advantage.<eos> You're the one that fought me when the peach farmers bitched and moaned about me tearing it down.
I can't, can I?<eos> I thought it was highly secret.<eos> Don't worry. I know you read my magazine from cover to cover.<eos> No need to be bashful.<eos> I won't be reading it much longer - it gets worse.
I will-- hang on.<eos> I will assign it to one of my deputies, quietly manage it, and help guide you through the process.<eos> I am not comfortable with this.<eos> Well, then what do you suggest we do?<eos> What a martyr craves more than anything is a sword to fall on, so you sharpen the blade, hold it at just the right angle, and then 3, 2, 1--
Alone?<eos> You're alone?<eos> What about me and Josh?<eos> We used to be enough.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't get your freedom exactly the way you wanted it.
What is this key for?<eos> It's for a locker with a very valuable statue inside.<eos> It's worth a fortune.<eos> I've got a buyer all lined up, so all we have to do is get the statue.<eos> Marko doesn't know the buyer, Jake, so we're gonna sell it and make loads of money and run off together.
Ah! Oh, oh, sorry!<eos> Sorry ma'am.<eos> Lady, ah, sorry.<eos> You hand the case to my associate.<eos> He'll bring it to me.
Sixty minutes. Or she's gone.<eos> Wait! Sixty minutes.<eos> Do you think he's serious?<eos> Who?<eos> Um, no one. I just -- we... ordered... pizza for you and we thought maybe you could get it in 60 minutes or less or it's free kinda thing.
/ Uh, excuse me?<eos> You don't belong here?<eos> That's what they all say.<eos> But you're still of the flesh, hmm?<eos> Until I burn it away.
Victor Silver.<eos> Cattleman.<eos> Land in the Argentine.<eos> Slaughters his beef there.<eos> Refrigerates it to board his reefer ship. Ships it for sale - New York, the Continent, London.
You know the job interview today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got the job.<eos> Well, it's not exactly a job.<eos> They bought my idea and they're going to let me make it, and, well,
She's a lot more than blandly efficient.<eos> I don't understand your problem with her.<eos> Well, it should be enough that I have one.<eos> Come on, you give me one good reason and I'll retract the offer.<eos> The fact that I want it should suffice.
Micaela.<eos> Yes.<eos> His camera.<eos> Yes.<eos> He gave it to me when he was sick.
- Did you?<eos> Were you really in bed when I called last night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's Pete Townshend.<eos> Townshend wrote the song, Daltrey's singing it.
With all due respect, Governor, our consumers are vampires.<eos> And considering your political leanings, the PR nightmare of partnering with the vampires' enemy number one just isn't worth the risk.<eos> You haven't heard my proposal yet.<eos> See... during my time in office here in this great state, I have seized my fair share of property, one of which is this old oil refinery.<eos> The company that used to operate it left it for a newer facility.
We must think... of the greater good.<eos> I need your help.<eos> What's up?<eos> We told you about this ridiculous Employee of the Month thing.<eos> Well, it turns out Tom's got his heart set on it.
Hilarious.<eos> I'm reminded of the time I met my wonderful wife, winner of Miss Avon and Somerset 1992, '94.<eos> All the same person.<eos> Don't worry, I'm not a Mormon.<eos> Double the nagging. Who needs it?
And I'm tired of finishing last.<eos> Because when you're there, you get to the finishing line, you find the pie's already gone.<eos> Because some bugger like you has already ate it.<eos> The success pie.<eos> Which is where they keep it.
We knew right after that we'd get a lot of business.<eos> It was like Fleetwood Mac all over again.<eos> Joe was always really good to me.<eos> There was a plaque that he had brought over to me when "Nevermind" hit number one.<eos> And we hung it on the wall, and it was just a couple weeks later that Joe actually passed away.
Thanks for watching him.<eos> [ Sighs ] You okay?<eos> Of course I'm okay.<eos> I'm better than okay.<eos> I get to get back to my own life, without some little rodent around to mess it up.
You think she would go for it?<eos> Honestly, I don't know.<eos> She's got this sort of anti-establishment "fuck you" attitude.<eos> Conventional news bores her. But if you had something gritty to show...<eos> I've got a story if you want it.
- Sally. Great to meet you.<eos> - Oh, Sally.<eos> Alex, I'm Joss.<eos> - Yay! - Wait until you see this house.<eos> I think you're going to love it.
Yeah, I have like a million places to go.<eos> OK.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Yep.<eos> If we're late for Shabbat, uh, you could just put your guitar in your cubby, and then we'll take it home at the end of the day, OK?
Goodbye.<eos> Yep.<eos> If we're late for Shabbat, uh, you could just put your guitar in your cubby, and then we'll take it home at the end of the day, OK?<eos> OK.<eos> If you're upset about somebody else playing it, then I can just take it home and put it right away.
Yep.<eos> If we're late for Shabbat, uh, you could just put your guitar in your cubby, and then we'll take it home at the end of the day, OK?<eos> OK.<eos> If you're upset about somebody else playing it, then I can just take it home and put it right away.<eos> OK? I don't want anyone else playing it.
That'd be a complete sellout.<eos> No, it wouldn't.<eos> Yes, it would.<eos> No, it wouldn't.<eos> They'd probably get it anyway.
Request denied.<eos> You know what we have to do here.<eos> My official mission begins at the Romanian border.<eos> No, your official mission begins here, now, with me.<eos> And if you jeopardise it, I'll see you are court-martialled.
Will she think it's under "A" or "B"?<eos> "B" of course.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I saw you put it there.<eos> But Lucy didn't see me put it there.
I thought you were gonna throw pizza slices in a bowl of salad.<eos> That's very much what I did do.<eos> Precisely, in fact.<eos> That's why we call it pizza salad. Know what I'm sayin'?<eos> You just take a Domino's pizza, you toss it in a bowl with some salad, also from Domino's.
A rubber?<eos> Wishful thinking.<eos> - Look at this.<eos> Huh? - Nice.<eos> Yeah, that thing comes back now I'm gonna hack it to pieces.
They all came here with a lot of hurt.<eos> There's still plenty of that to go around.<eos> But what we can give them is a lifetime of love and prayer.<eos> There's hope, Mr. Decker.<eos> They find it right here.
There's a child missing.<eos> So tell me about Carroll's accomplices.<eos> He used this prison guard to gain access to the internet to create a following, like a cult.<eos> Let's not use that word.<eos> People don't hear it well.
ChuckE. Cheese?<eos> - Really?<eos> - I promise.<eos> Daddy's gonna give you hecka tokens and we gonna play all the games, OK?<eos> And then we're gonna get your favorite pizza, and we'll eat it all up.
Then when you get out of here, I want you to work on making that theory real, okay?<eos> Whatever support you need, I will get for you.<eos> I'll talk to Evan about it.<eos> You don't need Evan's approval to do the right thing.<eos> If it was the right thing, then he would be doing it.
I'm sure we're all asking that question after the events of the last week.<eos> Hello!<eos> I'm sure it's just a shower, we'll go to the playground later.<eos> I got you a hot chocolate.<eos> I don't want it.
So it's a tough place.<eos> Before he was banned, Shane was at a football game,<eos> And all these kids started spitting in this cup.<eos> And next thing I know, the one kid<eos> That used to be a real good friend of Shane's had this cup, And he was just about ready to tip it on Shane's head.
And how they viewed tom, and not the tom that I knew.<eos> When I got up to Martha,<eos> All I could think in my head was,<eos> "I have to kiss the casket for Shane."<eos> And I made my way over to the casket, and I kissed it,
- Are you pulling my leg? - No.<eos> I never joke about the devil.<eos> Do you know I'm very, very bored.<eos> We're having a great, great time.<eos> You cut up the duck. Cook it on a high flame for 15 minutes.
this is the dawn of a new age.<eos> The fifth angel has been born.<eos> An age of darkness will dawn.<eos> The vastness of the dark will drive away the light.<eos> Men will call it thus:
Lair, bear, snare, square.<eos> There's war on a square and all you do is look at is my lair.<eos> We'll submit our song to the Fall Concert.<eos> - That's just in a few days.<eos> - If you want it, you can make it.
- She's waiting for me now.<eos> She's also watching her little brother, her parents are away.<eos> But you're here now.<eos> How often do you see each other?<eos> We're making meringue pie and eating it together.
You too good for this game?<eos> Too good for wiffle ball?<eos> Hey, you know what, Connor?<eos> Just come-- just come closer.<eos> It's Marcus. He ain't going to hit it.
Then it's probably the library.<eos> Racist son of a--<eos> Sodom and Gomorrah.<eos> It's Pierce's special gym.<eos> He never let me use it because he thinks I'm a child.
I married the two of you.<eos> This is not easy for me to say. But if the guy's a pro, you think he's gonna let someone who can I.D. him go?<eos> Then what?<eos> We've got the one thing motivating him to keep her alive.<eos> We stop him before he gets it, she might live.
My baseball career was beheaded on a warm night in Texas many years ago.<eos> So be it.<eos> A new head is sure to grow in it's place.<eos> Or a race car driver.<eos> One head might be selfish and mean, but that doesn't mean the next head to replace it can't still be thoughtful and nice.
I am so embarrassed.<eos> I'm afraid I must ask for your bag.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your bag.<eos> Please hand it over.
I would love your insight.<eos> Dr. Chilton, would you care to assist me with dessert? Pleasure.<eos> I love Norton grapes.<eos> Same color inside as outside.<eos> Peel it... And the flesh is also purple.
He reveres the language.<eos> He knows more about it than most, even most English teachers, and he cares.<eos> What more can you ask from a teacher?<eos> He really cares.<eos> He's scattered, disorganized, never has a lesson plan, or if he does, he never sticks to it.
- A scorpion. - Too obvious.<eos> Stings its mate, a no-brainer for the arachnoid vice squad.<eos> A net thrower.<eos> What's that?<eos> A spider that throws a net on its prey, stings it, and sucks it dry.
Why would you?<eos> They weren't important.<eos> They were only subjects.<eos> That appointment book wasn't in Reuben's office.<eos> Maybe he kept it at his flat.
He's been here ten years, and he said he's staying for life.<eos> I'm out of the game for good.<eos> You're in jail, aren't you?<eos> No, no.<eos> In Mexico, they call it cárcel.
Anyway, we rented out your room. What?<eos> Jimmy, come on.<eos> Don't worry-- we put all your stuff in the car, locked it and parked it on the street.<eos> What?<eos> You got a parking ticket. Where should I send it?
I said no every time.<eos> But she wouldn't stop.<eos> And then one night.<eos> "Put your hand here," she said.<eos> "Feel," she said. She took my hand and she put it on her belly.
And Martha?<eos> Oh, she'll be fine.<eos> Touch and go for a while now.<eos> There's a medicine called Three In One.<eos> The vets won't prescribe it, but ask any dairy farmer and they swear by it.
Of who?<eos> There has to be a subject for such a feeling.<eos> John found a miracle cure.<eos> I don't know where he got it.<eos> Three In One on the bottle, they call it.
You want a nice, cool shoe.<eos> So this is a shoe tree.<eos> You insert this into the shoe and flip on this little fan.<eos> You see?<eos> And what it does-- it cools the actual shoe before you put it on.
Every arena he worked in, he was brilliant.<eos> Certifiable genius.<eos> Genius?<eos> Like he could understand how that thing works?<eos> We've got to find that creature and get it out of here before Kanan sees it.
Yeah, Don, unfortunately, we're under new management.<eos> Very strict management.<eos> What if we don't run this by the partners? What do you mean?<eos> It's not a legal case.<eos> We got the insurance money from Pindy burning down our house. We use that money to buy Don's house, and we sell it back to him once we unfreeze his assets.
All my employees do.<eos> Healey three-inch fisherman-- there it is.<eos> This case is spotless.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> - How often, would you say, you clean it?
I-I mean, if he wants me in the room,<eos> I'll be there, but I'm not gonna watch.<eos> What's your take on the death penalty?<eos> I'm for it.<eos> For damn sure, I ain't for this broke-ass state paying for a bunch of fools on death row to file for appeals, but, yeah, I'm for it, if we use it.
I've got a tummy ache.<eos> Oh, damn.<eos> Better be OK for tomorrow.<eos> Like the shirt?<eos> Why don't you try it on?
We gotta shake up this case.<eos> Bring in girl lawyer.<eos> Yeah, baby! It's like "Matlock" with knockers.<eos> Hey. So we really love this house.<eos> Do you know who's selling it?
A necklace.<eos> She's wearing it in every photo.<eos> - It's like she never took it off.<eos> - Right.<eos> But she wasn't wearing it when we found her.
I've seen this necklace before.<eos> (Megan) Yeah.<eos> So have I.<eos> Where did you get that necklace?<eos> Dr. Murphy noticed that you were wearing it the night of the trade gala, and I saw that you were wearing it the day we came to talk to your son.
- Come with me! Now!<eos> Good-bye...<eos> Forever.<eos> Adam.<eos> - They bought it, right?
Yeah.<eos> Usually my favorite part about dinner is dessert, and my favorite dessert is pudding, and my favorite pudding flavor is chocolate, but my absolute favorite part of chocolate pudding is the skin, and tonight's pudding was skinless.<eos> But don't tell our mom. I don't want to hurt her feelings.<eos> It won't.<eos> I love pudding skin so much, my old mom used to make it for me all the time.
Well, what if it just stays there like that?<eos> It'll sink.<eos> They're gonna be looking for his car.<eos> I know.<eos> Look, if they find it and they trace it back to us, we are totally screwed.
New York is on another planet.<eos> I don't know if she'll get the job, but... I want her to have the option in case things get worse.<eos> So, what did Wilden tell people about his car?<eos> Emily said he reported it stolen.<eos> Don't you think they'll find it?
I will be... taking Hanna to New York with me.<eos> So the promotion wouldn't be here.<eos> No, it's in New York.<eos> Well...<eos> When would you go, if they offer it to you?
So, how long have you lived here with Terry?<eos> About a year.<eos> We used to have a six-bedroom in Streetsville before, but...<eos> - It's a cute place.<eos> - Terry hates it.
Have you ever been to Poplar?<eos> No.<eos> In Poplar, we might have up to a dozen people living in one small house or tenement flat.<eos> When conditions are over-crowded and unventilated, infection spreads with ease.<eos> Meanwhile, someone who is infected unwittingly takes the disease to an over-crowded production line and transmits it to his colleagues.
Can you really be mad at me?<eos> No.<eos> You want a glass of wine?<eos> Oh, it sounds lovely, but the bottle's empty.<eos> Norman and I killed it before we got our nasty on.
Right.<eos> By law, I have to give you this.<eos> Well, if you notice Kieren acting strangely at all, it might be a sign that he's...<eos> Well, there's this illegal drug going around,<eos> PDS kids are calling it "Blue Oblivion". And it's very dangerous.
Because that's a deal breaker.<eos> (laughs) Yeah.<eos> Very interesting, don't you think?<eos> Look, I think you're getting worked up, all right?<eos> I didn't want this double date, you didn't want it.
Through your eyes, brothers, I finally see the world for what it really is.<eos> This city is infested.<eos> 8 million parasites, Scrambling around in their pointless lives, spreading disease, forcing us to live in the shadows, like vermin. No more.<eos> They are the true plague.<eos> Together, we shall rid this city of humanity and reclaim it for ourselves.
As I would take you if your faith required communion with nature.<eos> I don't want to walk!<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna hang this damn cross!<eos> 'Cause it's my religious freedom and you're violating it!
My boy, Potato Chip, told me that when he was down, they used to bring in dope by putting that shit inside birds.<eos> Chickens?<eos> Nah. I think it was like a pigeon or something.<eos> Did they stick it up the butt? Nah.<eos> They put it in a little baggie, stuff it down the throat.
We glue this baby back together, and it won't matter what that damn bird says. Ugh.<eos> Where'd you get this stuff?<eos> These glue fumes are making me feel all gooey.<eos> It's from my super. It's industrial strength.<eos> He said he only says he uses it to forget the past...
Where is it?<eos> I've no idea, I swear, I've no idea!<eos> This parcel contains a priceless holy relic.<eos> It's Welsh gold, inlaid with sapphires.<eos> Someone wants to steal it.
Then why do bad things happen to me?<eos> Years of shit raining down!<eos> A husband who falls off a cliff!<eos> The loneliness that hangs on me every waking hour, and now this?<eos> My one chance of happiness and you're taking it away, snuffing it out before it even has a chance.
All right. Okay.<eos> Michonne.<eos> Hershel told me about the boy you shot.<eos> He had a gun.<eos> Was he handing it over?
The other is Louise Sinclair out of New Orleans, former Blackwater operative.<eos> Another overachiever.<eos> Find out if she ran the plates yet.<eos> We put out an APB in a 300-mile radius of Richmond.<eos> If it's out there, we'll find it. Put the call on speaker.
She wants the key.<eos> For my brother.<eos> Why don't you give it to her?<eos> Because I trust you more than I trust my family.<eos> There's way too much at stake to let either one of them have it.
NYPD.<eos> You were supposed to have eyes on Beau.<eos> So what happened?<eos> Beau told me to wait outside with the car.<eos> When your boss gives you a directive, you follow it.
I had nothing to do with his death.<eos> But I might know who did.<eos> Scarlet... said he guarded this SD card with his life.<eos> Now I know why.<eos> I thought I could use it as leverage against Randolph, but, uh, well, now it's pretty clear he was using it to blackmail someone else.
You're sired to me, Elena. Everything you think you feel, might not even be real.<eos> But there's hope now.<eos> Tell them what the hunter told you the tattoo leads to.<eos> He said there was a cure.<eos> Everyone wants it for a different reason.
He'll lose control.<eos> That's the whole point.<eos> I've exhausted all your knowledge.<eos> Now I have the Professor to help me find the cure, you're just competition.<eos> Whoever finds it first gets to decide what to do with it:
Working late?<eos> Wait.<eos> I got something.<eos> Watch.<eos> You see how he picks up the bag, he scoops it with his forearm?
One who chooses their moment.<eos> And understands the repercussions if they get it wrong.<eos> One well-chosen moment can take you straight to the top.<eos> And one mistake can finish you.<eos> You see, Bea, anger is a healthy emotion on the outside, but in here, unless you've got the stomach to follow through, best to keep it to yourself.
If the department finds out, I'm gone.<eos> Packing up her stuff, is that what set you off?<eos> Did the cops say something to you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Do you want me to take it away for you, put it in storage?
Anthony thinks I'm the mole.<eos> You think I'm the mole... I know that.<eos> I clashed with Hathaway, Hathaway's dead.<eos> I ordered you not to contact his people, the radio's destroyed.<eos> You opposed the Volm mission... Suddenly, you're for it.
And what's that?<eos> Well first off, money and power doesn't mean your shit doesn't stink.<eos> More importantly, the only thing separating me and the future I wanted was will.<eos> I had the talent and the ambition, all I needed was a chance.<eos> The problem is, of course, you're rarely given that chance, more often than not you've gotta take it.
You know how powerful these suits are.<eos> I don't need you to tell me about something I invented.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is there any way we could track the suit if the owner wasn't wearing it?
So I did some research on melamine, it's actually toxic stuff.<eos> They banned it after they found it in baby formula, plastic toys, animal feed...<eos> Could it be lethal?<eos> Enough exposure on a cellular level can cause cancer but it can't cause suffocation.<eos> But something made with it?
We need to move out.<eos> What... what... what do you mean, "we"?<eos> You tracked the yaoguai in a matter of hours.<eos> It took me weeks.<eos> You track the beast, and I'll kill it.
I couldn't tell you.<eos> I needed to keep a clear head.<eos> This is what girls do, they date boys.<eos> So don't go telling me where my heart is.<eos> I gave my daughter life, you will not destroy it.
Your daddy was protecting her honour.<eos> Arlo did that?<eos> Frances took a path I never could.<eos> I'd put down Henry Crowder again, whatever it took, and again and again, same way each time.<eos> Once you make a decision, set down the path, you follow it right to the end, at least, that's the way I always saw it.
Thanks.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> So this sentence here.<eos> "He felt like he was choking inside on some black smoke. "<eos> That, I love. I love that image, but I think it would be better if you just moved it to the end of the paragraph.
- Yeah.<eos> But, you know, I'm probably the only one out there who's actually touched a girl...<eos> So... it's not saying much. Please welcome our next speaker this evening... Mr. Hank Galliston.<eos> I-I used to chew a lot of gum when I was nervous, and I'd forget to spit it out.<eos> So we developed a sign, and she would remind me, i would take it out, and I would stick it under the desk.
It was the last thing he was working on before he was taken to the hospital.<eos> The... there's this part right here that he mysteriously erased before he left.<eos> There's theories that before he died,<eos> Einstein discovered something, an equation that would create a new form of power, but he thought that the people weren't ready for it.<eos> So he erased it so no one would know what it was.
Love.<eos> And what makes you think love can't be seen?<eos> What makes you think it can?<eos> Because I've seen it. Oh? In post-its filled with poems, stuck on my bathroom mirror.<eos> And in a yellow tack given to me every single year on my birthday, knowing that wherever I stick it on the map, that's exactly where we're gonna wake up the next morning.
A nazi officer with my face.<eos> He looked exactly like me.<eos> I dream about a man with a gun.<eos> The location of the cross must be secret.<eos> I will not put it in the mud.
How about it, sugar?<eos> He the minuteman back home, too?<eos> The in-and-out quick like a bunny? Boom, boom, boom.<eos> Now, you better be a fast draw back there, Cinderella.<eos> I get a hold of that little-girl pistol, they be pulling it out of your ass with forceps.
What's going on, Charlie?<eos> You like this place?<eos> It's okay.<eos> You know, this house can be yours.<eos> They're not gonna sell it to somebody like me.
It meant something to Laila.<eos> It means we're getting closer.<eos> We will find her.<eos> I need to know what this is all about, Father Mark.<eos> For thousands of years, Shepherds have struggled to protect the cross from those who covet it...
Well, maybe I could just get a copy of the curriculum, and then I could just teach her some of this stuff at home.<eos> Look, Miss Fox, the kids are fine not being in the gifted class.<eos> They call themselves the "B-Squad."<eos> We even gave them little bumblebee pins.<eos> Well, some of them poked themselves with it, so now they have stickers.
You really got a thing for Mexican standoffs, huh?<eos> I got it.<eos> Open the door.<eos> It's just a wood door.<eos> Why don't you kick it down?
Heracleo spoke the truth, at least upon one subject.<eos> Apologies.<eos> Share drink, and see them accepted.<eos> My cup is spoken for.<eos> I seek not to claim it my own.
I would see such spirit greet newest command.<eos> Speak it, and see it done.<eos> I wish this chest spirited from sight.<eos> A simple task, yet one of grave importance.<eos> Where shall I place it?
No, Mira!<eos> Sacrifices were made.<eos> Where did the bodies come from?<eos> Where did I come from?<eos> Mr. Cutter brought them to us.
But you need to listen to me now.<eos> You need to trust me.<eos> Now, I could take your prize animals to Germany as a loan.<eos> We'll give them sanctuary.<eos> You know you can trust my word on this. And when the war is over, I can return them to you.
I'll stay with you if you like.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Now.<eos> Good work, Jan.<eos> The army's waiting for them in Lomza.
I'm sorry, Mr. Madoff.<eos> The boys wouldn't sign the bond?<eos> I'm very sorry, sir.<eos> Who... did you talk to them or did...<eos> No. Your wife was on the phone with each of them.
Mark and Andrew would've become the owners of a firm that was still in the middle of perpetrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.<eos> Except the advisory was a completely separate business, one in which they had no involvement, so...<eos> But with you dead and Frank probably willing to swear to anything to save himself, seems to me the odds are that as owners as lifelong executives, they'd have gone to jail.<eos> Your sons would be sitting there where you are.<eos> No, well, I protected them.
Cause no one can find anyone.<eos> Their fathers were...<eos> Special seeds in bottles.<eos> Birthday?<eos> We do not call them baby, or kiss..
(VOCALIZING STOPS)<eos> (CREAKS)<eos> It's not easy spending a day in the city with two kids around Christmastime, even if you have taken them to a matinee and outdoor skating.
I was just gonna ask you the same question.<eos> I live here, he's my bro and you've got 15 seconds before I call 911.<eos> - Whoa, whoa.<eos> - I have friends!<eos> How did you meet them, sweetie?
Alphabet time now, Richard?<eos> So we had to... we had to cut away about 2,000 tons of ore when they, I...<eos> I found it.<eos> See, I at first thought it was just a new strata but when I got closer and saw what those taco boys were digging up...<eos> - I made them clear out fast.
There's a place called Sherrinford.<eos> An island.<eos> It's a secure and very secret installation whose sole purpose is to contain what we call the uncontainables.<eos> The demons beneath the road?<eos> This is where we trap them.
That's where I am.<eos> I'm in the bottom of a well.<eos> Why would there be a well in Sherrinford?<eos> Why is there a draft?<eos> Walls don't contract after you've painted them.
Believe me, it feels like my whole life.<eos> I'm making great progress with the parents already.<eos> The usual procedure, sleep deprivation, hunger strikes.<eos> They're very disoriented.<eos> I've got them eating out of the palm of my hand.
Who are you gonna tell, Tim?<eos> Your parents?<eos> Where are the boys?<eos> I told them to stay in the Puppy Zone.<eos> I'm taking them both with me to Las Vegas.
The bodies... are his children.<eos> Out of all my labors... the most beguiling was... attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species.<eos> I hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough... to power the Expansion.<eos> I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.<eos> It broke the Ravager code, but I compensated him generously... and to ease his conscience, I said I'd never hurt them.
You could describe every awful nightmare thing you saw, and what was burned into your head would be burned into their heads forever.<eos> Or... You could hug them tight.<eos> And spare them your honest truth.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I'd hug them.
And other people may...<eos> Were maybe gonna find him, and he wanted to go to a different place, and so he asked us to get him numbers.<eos> Important numbers.<eos> Coordinates.<eos> And we found them in the place he told us to go, a secure military database.
It's called da jue zhan.<eos> A grand duel.<eos> The Hand's version of a challenge.<eos> Their best fighters against me.<eos> If I defeat them, they'll meet my demands.
The Hand sent them over to deliver a message.<eos> - We have to call somebody. - Yeah, I did.<eos> I called you.<eos> I need you to take their bodies to Pelham Bay Park.<eos> Either the cops or the Hand will find them eventually, but hopefully we'll be finished this by then.
You deny it?<eos> Would you believe me if I did?<eos> Stay right there, boy.<eos> Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.
Winter's coming.<eos> I thought Jill was lying at first when she told me you had a newborn baby but that's the miracles of modern science.<eos> You know, I work with a lot of famous doctors.<eos> What do you do for work?<eos> I take famous people and their money and I make them even more famous and even more money.
What?<eos> Not one body near to anything resembling cover.<eos> - That's just fucking weird to me.<eos> - Don't mean shit, man.<eos> Means he took them out pretty fucking fast.
Three months earlier.<eos> I'm curious, did that have anything to do with Endexoprene?<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Your Honor, unless Mr. Murdock can prove my client actually received these hypothetical documents, then...<eos> It's not about whether he received them. It's whether he willfully ignored them.
And even after you take 'em off the count and they're dead... it's still enough to keep you up at night.<eos> Where'd you find this piece of shit?<eos> Warehouse on 151st and Amsterdam.<eos> He was hiring kids out of Harlem.<eos> Using them as a cleanup crew.
That's not allowed.<eos> What do you mean, it's not allowed?<eos> It's a federal crime to feed a wad of feral horses.<eos> We've got enough problems.<eos> You take the flank, we'll herd them back out the way they came.
Meredith parish is much more used to traveling in private jets or limousines, but she's not afraid to get her hands dirty.<eos> Aren't they gorgeous?<eos> Meredith owns a giant ranch across Texas and new Mexico and has turned it into a horse sanctuary.<eos> She just bought 500 wild mustangs that wondered onto a hopi reservation in Nevada.<eos> These horses can run free on my sanctuary, they will never be subjected to ranch owners using them or abusing them.
- What you got there, bratt?<eos> - Glucosamine.<eos> Miss Davis wants to know if she should give it to the horses.<eos> Tits on a bull.<eos> Not gonna help them, not gonna hurt them either.
What's your price?<eos> You say this prep program was a mistake, that it's hideous and wrong and that all horses should be free.<eos> All horses deserve a second chance just like those men,<eos> - they deserve...<eos> - Those men are criminals, who are in jail because they hurt people and you brought them out here and they could hurt those horses.
It's sort of like eating a bag of chips, you know?<eos> It's never gonna actually make you full, and at the end you're sick, but you want to go back for more.<eos> You want more chips.<eos> - Murder is chips.<eos> - Okay, you know what, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I'm gonna find these tapes, and I'm gonna destroy them.
And mankind was good.<eos> But Zeus' son.. grew envious of mankind and sought to corrupt his father's creation.<eos> This was Ares, the God of War.<eos> Ares poisoned men's hearts with jealousy and suspicion.<eos> He turned them against one another and the war ravaged the Earth.
The God Killer?<eos> The weapon that is strong enough to kill a God.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> The gods gave us many gifts.<eos> One day, you'll know them all.
The weapon that is strong enough to kill a God.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> The gods gave us many gifts.<eos> One day, you'll know them all.<eos> This great tower is where we keep them.
Hey, you're gonna get cold.<eos> Alright there...<eos> Don't worry about Charlie.<eos> He doesn't mean any, alright?<eos> The animals, why are they hurting them?
Here you go, baby.<eos> We're gonna be in the back, okay?<eos> Call me if you need me.<eos> I hate those pinches coolers, man.<eos> Fucking hate them.
- How about $80?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Loser.<eos> Two guys, druggies, they tried to trade their stuff for some beer. They had your dog.<eos> I've seen them hanging out down by the boardwalk.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - A Casio!<eos> I need this, I'm awful with time.<eos> Listen, you ever heard of the, uh, Belarus Bowtie?<eos> First you cut off the testicles then you shove them down throat.
- She plays mind games.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Takes hours to respond to texts.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> One of the most annoying things is that she'll make plans and then cancel them, day of.
Please don't talk to me of sense, Brace, because if it is you, I might believe it.<eos> And I have sworn to do very foolish things.<eos> If you're looking for money, those accounts are ten years old.<eos> Where are my father's inventories and his shipping logs?<eos> He burnt them all.
And I would hear her.<eos> Her words are very certain.<eos> How did I not know?<eos> Because the dead don't sing.<eos> If they don't sing, then how do I hear them?
Anthony, I asked you here because you're a creative individual, and you're gonna need every ounce of that creativity to do what I'm about to tell you.<eos> What's that, Mr. Todd?<eos> Do you recall my business rivals and bitter enemies the Mitchum brothers?<eos> You're gonna visit the brothers now.<eos> You're gonna pin the blame for the insurance claim that we conspired to deny for them, a loss of 30 million that hit 'em hard, on the back of Douglas Jones.
Fucking nuthouse.<eos> Fuckingnuthouse.<eos> I better do that.<eos> What'd you want me to do with the crates?<eos> Just leave them.
My mother prefers to call it "creative accounting."<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Ferguson...<eos> Uh, one question.<eos> The dogs...<eos> Roy said that they took them everywhere.
You think I'm entertaining?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think you're... too young to meet teachers in public parks at night.<eos> You don't know me at all.<eos> What I do know is if you join the team, and debate issues you care about, while wearing the skinny jeans you're rocking right now, all the boys will be begging for your number, after you beat them down with your passionate words.
Join me on one woman's extraordinary quest, for though we all have to make tough decisions in life, a few of us will ever make a decision as difficult as Sophie's Choice, by Alan Pakula.<eos> You may keep one of your children.<eos> I-I have to choose?<eos> I cannot choose.<eos> Be quiet, or I will send them both over there.
Today is a tough day for me.<eos> I was just on my way to have a talk with my parents.<eos> What kind of talk, Abraham?<eos> Oh, you know.<eos> I just wanted to share with them that I'm a little different, that I love them, but I also love the way army men look, in and out of their uniforms.
Why?<eos> I tried to see what was inside.<eos> But you wouldn't allow it. Then you came at us, sword drawn.<eos> Ten men, you killed.<eos> Cut them down like they were nothing.
I'm giving the order!<eos> Not yet.<eos> If we don't get these men off the ship, they're dead.<eos> If we don't find a way to harass those guns, everyone's dead.<eos> Harass them with what?
Rotten Row.<eos> They must have known something.<eos> Scientific formulae.<eos> Years of work, probably, and he burned it.<eos> They steal the papers and destroy them.
Still, we can sabotage the rest.<eos> You want me to get the King to Bringle Sands?<eos> An American plane will fly His Majesty out to the Ark Royal but only if we can get the King there in time.<eos> These are the atomic calculations.<eos> Spode photographed them.
- Two kids.<eos> Caught them breaking into 294.<eos> Breaking in?<eos> Well, that's new.<eos> You want me to take them down to the Sheriff's Office?
We might know more than you all sometimes because we dealing with some terrorist shit, so ...<eos> But that's a totally different story.<eos> So I go do my detective work, right? and I start putting pieces together and see this is what I came up with.<eos> They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing them and making them slaves... or sex slaves, not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit.<eos> See I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making them slaves or whatnot... but all I know is they already got two brothers we know and they could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already.
They both got one. Matching.<eos> - Oh...<eos> - Yeah!<eos> They're actually two halves of a whole.<eos> The characters are different, but when you put them together, they mean "fate".
I thought that... that maybe if... if you didn't listen to my tape, then you would still like me.<eos> You would see that I'm not that person.<eos> You're on the tapes?<eos> You didn't know?<eos> No, I haven't listened to them all.
Why can't you leave me alone?<eos> Release the tapes.<eos> Do whatever you have to do.<eos> Just let me be.<eos> I won't release them, if... if you get in the car and come with me.
Are you serious?<eos> She talks about drowning with stones tied to her feet.<eos> She talks about being lost for good.<eos> Mr. Baker... a lot of teens talk about being lost.<eos> Well, God help them if they come to you.
It's just...<eos> I don't know. It seems like they're bored or something.<eos> Like the only thing they even have in common anymore is me.<eos> Parents always think we don't pick up on that stuff. Like...<eos> Not only do they not see me, they don't see me seeing them.
I wanted to honor that.<eos> But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.<eos> There are 14 audio files on there.<eos> You should listen to them in order.<eos> I have the original tapes, and for reasons you'll come to understand, I have them hidden somewhere very safe.
She was in the room that night.<eos> Hiding.<eos> You've heard these tapes?<eos> Yeah. I'm on 'em too.<eos> And who has them now?
Close your eyes.<eos> - What?<eos> - Close your eyes.<eos> The ghosts come and go through our eyes.<eos> If you close them, we'll be fine.
But it came at a cost.<eos> And I wanted more of this.<eos> To create more places like this.<eos> Men and women lost their limbs.<eos> Children lost their parents because I sent them into battle against the wasted when I did not need to.
You ought to be able to crack this without breaking a sweat.<eos> You see, I have a lot of free labor here at the fence... living dead pricks that help keep the riffraff out.<eos> Problem is, they don't keep. They fall apart.<eos> Like that poor sack of... pile of shit there.<eos> So, Dr. Smarty-pants, how do we keep them on their feet?
No.<eos> He just hates interviews.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I fucking hate them, too.
Um, uh, over here maybe?<eos> Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb.<eos> It's a miracle I ever actually destroy anything.<eos> Oh, I don't know, you managed to destroy just about everything today.<eos> The villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...
Mr. Varga.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> See if you can find out what happened to the old pictures.<eos> Make sure they don't throw them out.
All those protests at Harris High are making Vasquez jumpy.<eos> She's going to force a vote on a name change.<eos> What is she talking about...<eos> I told her to give me a couple of weeks. She knows we don't have the votes.<eos> Then we better get them ASAP.
It happens.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I wasn't satisfied with the way our meeting went yesterday.<eos> I felt you weren't, either, and so, those names you requested for cabinet positions...<eos> I have them now.
Well, then how long, Nora?<eos> How long before you move past it?<eos> Move past what?<eos> That you lost your kids.<eos> I did not lose them!
And I walked through Mapleton.<eos> I walked through the town where I grew up... where my parents died, and Matt.<eos> Where you and I met.<eos> Most of the houses were overgrown with weeds, but the streetlights still turned on at night, and that made me feel less stupid about expecting them to still be there.<eos> Still there in the very same house where I lost them.
Most of the houses were overgrown with weeds, but the streetlights still turned on at night, and that made me feel less stupid about expecting them to still be there.<eos> Still there in the very same house where I lost them.<eos> When I got there, I stood behind a tree across the street and I waited because I was too scared to go up and knock.<eos> And then, after a while, the door opened.<eos> At first, I didn't recognize them.
Friend... I have thought long on this.<eos> And I feel in my heart that it matters not who or how thee loves... but perhaps... where.<eos> So, you won't tell my parents?<eos> This is something you must do.<eos> I don't mind you going through my books, but I'd appreciate it if you'd put them back correctly.
I've been told that he departed the island before all of this started.<eos> That he killed two soldiers in the process.<eos> Everyone assumed he'd turned, that somehow one of you had turned him, but that isn't what happened, is it?<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> For how long had he been secretly aiding them?
This whole time you didn't get paid?<eos> Technically, I did.<eos> I even got a bonus after my bravura performance in the Bermuda Triangle.<eos> But then I had to eat all my paychecks.<eos> I mean, I lost them.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Stop right there. All right?<eos> I know what you was planning with Aisha.<eos> But right now, my men got you in their crosshairs.<eos> You can look, all right? But you won't find them.
Agent Conner, can you take Eric to the infirmary? - Sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hey, I sent over those filters for you to look at.<eos> Check your inbox.<eos> What, you already went through them?
Mullins is looking for any excuse to fire me.<eos> I might as well give him a good one.<eos> How long do you need?<eos> It should take me ten minutes to retrieve the schematics.<eos> Send them to Carter's phone when you have them.
It's not just six lives.<eos> God knows how many people could be lost if Jadalla Bin-Khalid launches those attacks. Do you understand that?<eos> You need to tell Rebecca everything you know.<eos> I don't know anything that could help find those terrorists.<eos> Y-You were able to contact them.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Isaac, these men, they respect you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They revere you.<eos> But you're losing them.
You should know I don't do business with terrorists.<eos> I'm a patriot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So those modified semis that you sell,<eos> Jadalla just found them lying around.
And they almost killed me and my wife.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.<eos> I had them!<eos> I found them for you.
We're set. Let's move this wall.<eos> All right.<eos> It's not him.<eos> Jadalla Bin-Khalid's on his way in here. You need to put extra security around him.<eos> I'll put calls into all available off-duty security personnel, add them to the roster as they arrive.
Two years ago, when Carter and his team were hunting Bin-Khalid, they hired Naseri as a translator, before any of us knew who he was.<eos> Naseri used them to get to their highest-value intel asset.<eos> He killed the asset's family.<eos> Decapitated his three children.<eos> Carter found them.
Not just a pretty face, are you?<eos> The Hungarians are known for keeping their word, no matter what.<eos> The problem is, they hold everyone else to the same standard.<eos> She's not giving me a master key and some alarm codes.<eos> She's selling them to me.
No, it isn't.<eos> It's a way-point.<eos> Two features on that island are the markers.<eos> Maybe two peaks or some points along the coast.<eos> You run a line through them, and that direction becomes the course the governor will set to reach our final destination.
I don't think so.<eos> That is my domain.<eos> Give me a call when you get bored of you-know-who.<eos> Can you tell me where you get your blockers?<eos> I make them myself, puttanella.
Did you miss me?<eos> I know you want to tell her to fuck off, but we need information.<eos> You use blockers.<eos> Everyone does.<eos> - Where do you get them from?
Why didn't the charter just announce to the world that Homo sensoriums exist?<eos> Look, we all know sapiens.<eos> I mean, some of my best friends are sapiens.<eos> When sapiens feel safe, they're the nicest people you could meet.<eos> However, feed their inner demons, frighten them, find reasons for them to divide themselves from otherness, and then watch those selfsame sapiens drop bombs on whole cities, drive planes into buildings and happily herd millions of their own kind
They became husband and wife.<eos> At first, they lived with my father's family in Ahero, but I'm afraid the Luo village found a hundred ways to make the new bride feel as if she was a trespasser.<eos> So, when I was only a few months old, my parents went to live in the village that my mother was born.<eos> Now it was my father's turn to be made to feel like he was an outsider who did not belong.<eos> My parents had to leave their homes... to find a city where no one knew them.

I want to know why your men have been following me.<eos> Can I offer you a drink? - Oh.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> - I'll have a bourbon.<eos> I should have told you about my men, but I knew if I did, you would have said you didn't want them.
What?<eos> They got tickets... for littering.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yep.<eos> Then Dean Peterson suspended them for three days.
Very good.<eos> - Too good.<eos> - Not as good as you.<eos> Good enough to find my algorithms.<eos> That doesn't mean they knew what we were using them for.
No.<eos> How are the kids?<eos> They're fine.<eos> And clueless.<eos> My dad is taking such good care of them, they had no idea I was missing, which is a good thing.
Yes.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Think about the way the bodies were disposed of.<eos> I mean, they weren't hidden at all.<eos> He wants us to find them.
That's the whole idea.<eos> I'll take the one with the surfboard.<eos> Ah, my favorite in the entire collection.<eos> It's from a sleepy little surfing town called Sayulita.<eos> You can watch the fishermen bring in their haul at the end of the day, sit right down on the beach, and watch them peel your shrimp for you.
We can't call them that anymore.<eos> Their teacher two years ago had a mental breakdown.<eos> When they were in kindergarten, their teacher went missing halfway through the school year.<eos> This isn't fair.<eos> Can't you split them up so someone else can suffer too?
- This is your classroom. - Are you...<eos> - Kidding me? - No.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I'm scared for you.<eos> Last year, the Menendez brothers ate all of the school's glue sticks, and it only made them stronger.
I can't.<eos> I have diarrhea.<eos> It's really bad.<eos> Okay, okay, that's enough.<eos> Just bring them by when you can.
Yeah. Ooh, Fisher, you can tell us if the science was authentic.<eos> So, a sternum transplant-- is that for real?<eos> Oh, you guys actually read Dr. Brennan's books?<eos> Uh... you don't?<eos> Well, no offense to her, but I find them to be a little lowbrow.
To imagine Austin being five times more productive strains credulity.<eos> Yeah, that does seem like a lot.<eos> Do you have something for me, Dr. Fisher? Yes.<eos> Hodgins got these swab results back from the blunt force trauma injuries.<eos> And he had you deliver them?
You think it was one of his students, Benny? No.<eos> No.<eos> Those kids, they idolized him.<eos> I used to joke, those rich kids were just a paycheck.<eos> Austin, he made them feel like it was something else, like they were friends or something, you know?
You need me.<eos> I need to help Booth, and I-I can't do that until I know my children are safe.<eos> Well, they're-they're with an FBI agent.<eos> That is not enough for me.<eos> We're sending them to a safe house.
All the shrinks say I'm good on that, don't they?<eos> It'd be a very bad idea for me to pass on my genes.<eos> There's no evidence that it's genetic.<eos> Anyway, it doesn't matter.<eos> There's no danger of me passing on my genes, no-one wants them.
Well, you are the producer.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Someone I think you should pass on.<eos> Terence doesn't like how she answered the three imperatives.<eos> Well, we do use them for a reason.
No one's okay.<eos> - Em, she doesn't know.<eos> I don't know what?<eos> That A.D. stopped playing games and started playing God.<eos> A.D. stole Emily's eggs from the donation bank fertilized them and then used them to impregnate Allie.
Did you sleep okay?<eos> I'll go make us some coffee.<eos> Nicole's already asleep upstairs.<eos> I don't know what you've told her about us or what you haven't told her but she's gonna have a lot of questions in the morning.<eos> A.D. stole Emily's eggs, fertilized them and then used them to impregnate Ali.
That's a big question.<eos> Yeah, but you guys are so perfect together.<eos> You're gonna be one of those high school couples that gets married after college, and they have kids, and it's so cute.<eos> I'm sure his parents must love the thought of you as a daughter-in-law.<eos> Actually, I haven't met them yet.
Yeah.<eos> Maybe. I don't know.<eos> Does any part of you think that this wasn't an accident?<eos> Ali and I get the same smoothies every single day.<eos> The one time Holly gets them for us, I have an allergy attack?
We used the party as a cover to check it out and we found the Chaos Killer victims.<eos> You guys are the heroes here.<eos> Not sure that'll be the takeaway.<eos> We're taking the survivors to the medical facility on our campus.<eos> We'll debrief them, make sure they're all on the same page before they have to talk to the press or the authorities.
I can't go back. No!<eos> James.<eos> Reverend Knox.<eos> I hear our queen has been abducted. Is it true?<eos> You might as well tell me the details. I'll learn them anyway.
Why are you so keen to get rid of me?<eos> And how did you get so many men here so quickly?<eos> - We rode as fast as we could.<eos> - Or you took a shortcut.<eos> The bridges that cut through the north... you could only use them with Knox's help.
It's always been there, and it always will be. It's stable.<eos> It's stagnant.<eos> In this life, if you don't move forward, you die.<eos> Now, in five minutes, I'm gonna go down there and convince these rich bastards that our shit comes out gold-plated, that South Texas is the happiest, safest place on this green Earth.<eos> I'm gonna get them to open up their wallets and give us what we need to create a great Goddamn empire.
What?<eos> It's what we call our group therapy.<eos> - Well, it's what I call group therapy.<eos> - And what's the deal with levels?<eos> I prefer to think of them as draconian points earned for good behavior.
Anorexia.<eos> That's when Dad started drinking.<eos> It's the same with Davy's parents. You...<eos> lose a child, you never really come back from it.<eos> So on Tuesday, you took them to their son's memorial on the cliff.
- Er, just after lunch.<eos> - Did you stay with them?<eos> - No, I had to get back to the Visitor Centre.<eos> Then I was stuck there till we closed at five.<eos> - Did you see them in the evening at all?
And you come in here wanting help.<eos> Just give me a little something.<eos> Is there a doctor here?<eos> I'm burning up.<eos> You should have thought about that when you supplied guns to them, assassinated good men.
The weapons, get their weapons.<eos> They are trying to escape without us.<eos> Get to their cell.<eos> Block six.<eos> You heard them, brother.
I feel like I failed you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Because as a mom, it is my job to deliver a world where the values that I raised you to believe in mattered.<eos> And they didn't! They didn't!<eos> I mean, half of our country rejected them!
You started this whole thing.<eos> You told me I was a bad parent, a failure!<eos> Yeah, and all those things are true, too.<eos> - N... - You make those kids whatever they want.<eos> You let them order out and now they don't want any of my cooking.
- Papers.<eos> Infidels!<eos> The infidels are in the airport.<eos> The killers of Ramal!<eos> I've seen them with my own eyes.
I needed to protect you, to-to protect our family, so I picked up your phone from the shop and I took it to Andrew Nelson, my buddy in the computer sciences department.<eos> He did a deep dive, some kind of data archaeology, and he did it.<eos> He tracked those bastards down.<eos> Got their cell information.<eos> So... so I called them, thinking I could-I could maybe
You put the steering wheel on the wrong side.<eos> It's strange leaving here when I've never lived anywhere else.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> Besides, maybe you have seen the world and don't remember it.<eos> Maybe Heart erased all your memories and replaced them with new ones.
♪ [weakly] They're coming...<eos> Get in there.<eos> Look, uh, I used to resist all my urges too, but... not anymore.<eos> It's dangerous, you know, 'cause these... these urges, they keep growing inside you.<eos> Swelling... until you can't control them anymore.
Twist some screws, cross some wires.<eos> Help me make Arthur and Grace go boom.<eos> Don't you have bigger problems?<eos> Two birds, one stone.<eos> When that ogre pounces on those two fools, I'll blow them all to bits.
Now I expect the prisoner to be in my custody in 24 hours.<eos> Am I clear?<eos> - Tracker's live. - Where is she?<eos> The nanites just metabolized.<eos> I'm triangulating them with the Keyhole satellite feed.
Tobias Church. He had all the gangs in Hub City under his thumb just like he tried to do back home.<eos> I'm thinking with Church's demise, it left a power vacuum here, especially in the drug trade.<eos> What's Sonus pushing?<eos> Some drug I've never heard of before called "Sly-Dee"?<eos> It's pronounced "Slide," like in playground because it hooks kids young and makes them move to the big stuff faster.
Hey!<eos> Well, there's the happiest I've seen you since the accident.<eos> Oh, I know, I'm just so grateful.<eos> Although I am gonna kinda miss those glasses.<eos> Well, he still has to wear them for a little while. - Yeah.
I-- well, it's like I said, I knew your-- your children, Taiana and Vlad.<eos> Do you know what happened to them?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They're-- they're dead.<eos> But Mr. Kovar say he's still looking for them.
Oliver, we've been betrayed.<eos> Viktor, he--<eos> I am so very proud of this casino and what it means for our country.<eos> Well, that's why it saddens me to tell you that there was an attempt by Solntsevskaya Bratva to crash these festivities and assassinate every one of these government officials here tonight.<eos> But don't worry. We have them all in custody.
I am so very proud of this casino and what it means for our country.<eos> Well, that's why it saddens me to tell you that there was an attempt by Solntsevskaya Bratva to crash these festivities and assassinate every one of these government officials here tonight.<eos> But don't worry. We have them all in custody.<eos> I am told they-- they planned to stage a gas attack in this very room...<eos> But, uh, sadly for them, even though they were successful in launching the attack... it backfired and, uh, killed every single one of them.
I go back to Russia tonight but leave Star City a little present...<eos> My best men.<eos> Your best men were arrested.<eos> Already out on bail.<eos> I hear they cannot wait to get revenge on vigilantes that put them away.
They had complicated children.<eos> What we have to do... Is we have to leave the past in the past.<eos> Live our own lives?<eos> Live our own lives.<eos> It doesn't mean that we love them any less.
There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.<eos> What about the three bodies at the spice shop?<eos> We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.<eos> I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.
I mean, it's obviously great that you've developed such a strong rapport with her and I know how much you've helped her.<eos> I just think we need to reset the boundaries a bit now<eos> - and just say no more personal calls.<eos> - OK, yeah, sure.<eos> I'll speak to her parents and reassure them, they just felt a little bit undermined.
- Understanding paedophiles.<eos> Nice.<eos> No, no.<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> When a kid who's been abused goes off the rails and does something awful, we don't just dismiss them as monsters, do we?
That's Phoebe station.<eos> I was there.<eos> That's the martian science team.<eos> What happened to them?<eos> Clearly, we used them.
That station so much as twitches while we're swooping in, they're gonna be sendin' what's left of us home in a doggie bag.<eos> He's risking' his ass down there.<eos> How about we do the same up here?<eos> This guy's friends were probably infected.<eos> They would've spread it if you let them get away.
It's gone stealth.<eos> Who's going to explain that to me?<eos> Our missiles, sir.<eos> They're flying blind.<eos> Which makes them essentially useless.
Madam Avasarala, I'm James Holden,<eos> Captain of the Rocinante.<eos> I've seen first-hand the hell that's going on inside Eros, and it mustn't be allowed to reach Earth.<eos> Fred Johnson is honorable.<eos> Give him access to your missiles, and my crew and I will guide them in.
There's only one option left.<eos> A massive missile launch at Eros.<eos> Our missiles have lost their target-locks.<eos> Fred Johnson is honorable.<eos> Give him access to your missiles, and my crew and I will guide them in.
- Hey, Chief, you got a second?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I gotta show you something.<eos> This is all the telemetry on the nukes the UN launched against Eros.<eos> They detonated them after they lost target lock.
I-I met him once.<eos> - He seems cool.<eos> - Yeah. That's the problem.<eos> He's extremely charismatic.<eos> He lures boyfriends in when they're feeling vulnerable and makes them feel accepted.
So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.<eos> I decline your proposal.<eos> Why?<eos> You're not trustworthy.<eos> You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity.
Yeah.<eos> I don't know why I'm watching this.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Let us skip down to the 40th verse.<eos> "Then he cometh unto his disciples and findeth them sleeping."
"Then he cometh unto his disciples and findeth them sleeping."<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Then, in verse 43...<eos> "And he came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy."<eos> And we know that Jesus came back a third time, and found them asleep again.
If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one.<eos> What kind of a servant is that?<eos> The kind the realm needs.<eos> Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty.<eos> As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them.
You're going to jail, Sheriff Platt.<eos> Justice isn't won in the courtroom.<eos> It's won in the street.<eos> I'm on the front lines every day.<eos> And my guys are on the front lines every day, and I treat them as my family.
And just as I don't blame the white man...<eos> I don't want nothing from the white man.<eos> What we are due we'll get on our own.<eos> We'll educate our own brothers and sisters.<eos> We'll raise them, we'll be mindful of them.
Just look at her.<eos> We've only been married three years.<eos> She wants kids.<eos> I told you not to talk to him.<eos> I never... never wanted kids but she wants them so bad.
When have they done that?<eos> I will talk to them.<eos> The papers were in a leather case.<eos> Difficult to mistake for rubbish.<eos> Perhaps they moved them somewhere.
It's a good sign when anything gets stiff.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Fire up them electrodes, doc.<eos> My fifth limb's a-waitin'.<eos> Firing them up now.
Why not 10 or 100?<eos> Those men are out there.<eos> Yes, says one man. Injured at that.<eos> Could be the ether talking.<eos> And if not, we leave them out there to die.
It's vital work.<eos> God's word brings the men peace.<eos> Or brings me peace.<eos> Gives me the illusion that I'm actually doing something.<eos> I'll rescue them myself.
But you're doing great.<eos> - You got this, okay, Julian?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's wedged between my kidney and my inferior vena cava, and it's surrounded by some major blood vessels.<eos> If you hit them, there's a good chance - I'll go into shock.
- I'm not masquerading.<eos> I give a lot of homework. And pop quizzes, right?<eos> You're the best teacher at this school.<eos> Are you mind-controlling these kids?<eos> I made them love history. Is that a crime?
I talked to Damon, and I know what happened to Enzo.<eos> Bonnie... she must be... I don't even know what to say.<eos> I don't know how I can...<eos> Every time I close my eyes, I see it play out over and over again in my head.<eos> And every time I open them, I see Enzo's blood on my hands.
Y'all some bitches!<eos> This is crazy.<eos> You all right?<eos> I just talked to the men I sent to ride shotgun on your ass.<eos> They said you cut them loose.
We already have the best Winchester.<eos> Yes.<eos> But that's not your call, is it?<eos> Or mine.<eos> The old men want them on board.
Seriously?<eos> How?<eos> You American hunters tend to see vampires as criminals, rogues.<eos> One gets out of line, you show up, lop off its head, and leave town.<eos> We treat them more like terrorists.
It's over.<eos> The grand experiment recruiting American hunters has failed.<eos> Utterly.<eos> What would you like me to do?<eos> Exterminate them.
Well, that was unexpected.<eos> I didn't think you left London. I have been tasked by the other elders to fix this rapidly deteriorating situation.<eos> Dr. hess...<eos> These hunters are out of control.<eos> Exterminate them.
What are you two doing here?<eos> Mom!<eos> Sam and Dean Winchester, meet the great Tasha banes.<eos> The kids have told me very nice things.<eos> Alicia basically made them come just in case you were in peril.
I got married six weeks ago.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> Do I tell him?<eos> There's no way she could have known the details of what happened to Trish.<eos> No, we haven't released them and Trish has told nobody but us.
Cos it certainly wasn't your wife, was it?<eos> See, the problem for you is these condoms match the brand of condom used by the man who raped Trish Winterman.<eos> And there are condoms missing from that packet.<eos> When did you use the condoms, Jim?<eos> Who did you use them with?
What's this?<eos> Are you leaving without me?<eos> Brida has gone already.<eos> She's gathering my men... whatever is left of them.<eos> You will meet them where?
"My new roommate interrupts." "Confused, he asks, 'Why would you do that? '"<eos> "So I said, 'I grew up in Chicago, Trayvon," "'where whistling at a pretty girl didn't come with a death sentence.'"<eos> "A few days later, "two white men dragged me out of my uncle's house "and threw me in the back of their truck,<eos> "At first I was relieved. Then I saw him laughing, and I knew it wasn't good."<eos> "The black man held me down while the white men tortured me, "and after my soul left my body, I watched them shoot me, "tie me to a cotton-gin fan, and throw me in the Tallahatchie River."
The point is, I can order you to participate, and you must obey.<eos> [muffled] Now go talk to the woman in the wig.<eos> I can't stand looking at you anymore.<eos> You think he was trying to poison us with those raspberries?<eos> He ate them all.
The front page!<eos> [Lemony] It seemed to the children that they were moving in an aberrant, a word which here means "very, very wrong, and causing much grief," direction.<eos> Things are worse than we thought.<eos> [sighs] They almost always are.<eos> Every moment the children are without us drags them deeper into danger.
What?<eos> Wha...? See? Hysterical.<eos> No, the children must be confused. Dr. Montgomery was taking them to Peru.<eos> Last night he called me to insist on me rearranging my morning itinerary to bring them these passports.<eos> He'd want me to have them.
What are they doing with Uncle Monty's reptiles?<eos> After I called the police, I rang up the Herpetological Society.<eos> They kindly offered to retrieve Dr. Montgomery's reptiles.<eos> "Retrieve" means "take away."<eos> We know what retrieve means. Where are they taking them?
The Rocket 88 deal.<eos> How much money does Chess Records owe us?<eos> Who checks the BMI statements?<eos> Who writes the checks?<eos> Not just signs them, but makes sure we got enough in the bank, and deals with the bill collectors when we don't?
But local boards decide which topics.<eos> And the topics they don't want covered, do we imagine they just disappear if we ignore them?<eos> I may personally agree with you, but when you teach topics that aren't covered by the board, you're telling them about stuff that we've decided they're too young to know about.<eos> These kids know how to Google.<eos> And some people believe that such information will lead to them having sex.
Jesus!<eos> I have a problem...<eos> You've got lice?<eos> No, no.<eos> I was checking bed 5 for concussion, and I saw them.
Hey, are... are you okay, Dr. Williams?<eos> I, um... I have a real phobia of parasites.<eos> How did this thing get in your leg?<eos> Oh, the... the tumbu fly... It lays its eggs in your clothes when they're drying.<eos> And then, when you put them back on, the eggs hatch, and the larvae burrow themselves into your skin.
Scrubbed toilets before coming to Hollywood.<eos> At the peak of the Depression... that's when I first started out... she was the woman every man wanted and every woman wanted to be.<eos> Many think of her as the greatest star of all time.<eos> Now, my dear friend Bette... well, she, quite frankly, was the greatest actress Hollywood had ever known.<eos> During the war, she played all the best roles, and she played them with a...
You got plans for dinner?<eos> I feel like I owe you something for having you cool your heels all morning.<eos> I promised Harriet I'd take her to Perino's.<eos> Bring her.<eos> I want you to take all the costumes and just lay them out in the dressing room and that way, I can go through them and determine which... I said, okay, how about...
Charles thinks that Jimmy somehow took control of your documents while he was working on them at his home.<eos> He believes Jimmy transposed the address numbers.<eos> Transposed the numbers?<eos> How would he even do that?<eos> Charles contends that Jimmy took the documents pertaining to the rosella branch and, while Charles was indisposed, photocopied and doctored them.
Shameful treatment!<eos> What, bringing her out here to California so she could decline in luxury?<eos> You made her use the service entrance.<eos> You refused to let her take meals with your kids, for Christ's sake!<eos> I didn't want her poisoning them with her junk.
Then get one. Fast as you can.<eos> I reviewed the maintenance records, - and everything checks out.<eos> - Check again.<eos> Everything checks out except for this one anomaly.<eos> The emergency oxygen generators are scheduled to be replaced every two years. But Franklin Dutch replaced them after only one.
Yes.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I knew that they would do whatever it takes to get their hands on the blueprints for the KR-20.<eos> - Did the plane crash?<eos> - So I told them you had them.
Rourke and Mayhew operate alone. They have no networks. So that leaves Dudin, Zidane, and Kota.<eos> A Russian bomber, British militant, and an African nationalist.<eos> What aren't we seeing?<eos> Ramadi. A truck bomb killed 133 marines.<eos> And three months ago, intel named Dudin, Zidane, and Kota as key players in the attack. And now they're loose in a city with 34,000 cops, and none of them can help us 'cause our government threw these guys in a hole and deprived them of their rights.
Well, hold on now.<eos> When the police arrived, Larry was wearing his roller skates, but push in here.<eos> There's a bloody print on the wall across the room.<eos> But the skate marks end here.<eos> So, either Larry killed her, took off his skates, walked across the room, then put them back on and skated through her blood...
Knows when to keep his head down.<eos> Wouldn't nobody suspect him make a move like this.<eos> And there's July.<eos> She run rough with the boys.<eos> Ain't afraid to rub their nose in the dirt when she done beat them, neither.
And fully visible member of the Wayne Dream Team.<eos> If you need anything at all, you let me know.<eos> Well, he seems nice.<eos> So do chimps.<eos> Until you dress them up and have them perform "12 Angry Men" for your Yale buddies.
- Well I bet your grandma would.<eos> - What does that even mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Jackie, I just realized I left those cufflinks in Greenland.<eos> I need you to hop on a redeye and have them back in time for my dinner tomorrow night.
Mom... Mom!<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You gotta tell your friends to stop before they get hurt.<eos> You really don't know them at all, do you?
Absolutely not.<eos> It's so hard, Mommy, pretending everything's...<eos> I don't care.<eos> Here for round two?<eos> There are some secrets that are so painful, you not only hide them from the world, but you hide them from yourself.
Can we please be adults about this? Adult?<eos> Wait, I'm being an adult, okay?<eos> This-this is not about me. This is about our children, okay?<eos> This is about you wanting to go out with Sexy Simon instead of spending quality family time with your kids.<eos> You know, this the type of stuff that makes them grow up to be strippers, and I'm not talking about the good strippers, you know, the flexible ones that know how to clap they booty.
Well, must've been tired.<eos> Must've been.<eos> Can't imagine why.<eos> Why do you have my dresses?<eos> Because you've had them forever, mother,
Get rid of your car and phone, things they can use to follow you.<eos> Get a new car in... In otter creek, all right?<eos> Just pay for everything in cash.<eos> Here... here are your clothes.<eos> I don't want them.
No. I think that when people say they're Ravenclaw, they really think that they're Gryffindor but they don't want to sound too braggy.<eos> Okay, wow.<eos> So you've seen one of the movies.<eos> No, I've read all the books.<eos> I had mono in college and my weird theater-major roommate had them, and I read them in a week.
What?<eos> Well, I made that chili thing that you like, and I miss you and I love you and I want you to move back in.<eos> You do?<eos> Look, we all make mistakes.<eos> God knows I've made them.
I buy half my groceries with your empty beer bottles.<eos> Street hockey kids asked me to play goalie.<eos> They think I'm weird.<eos> You scare them.<eos> I've heard them talking.
Seen this or Leonie before?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Hana Reznikova abducted last night.<eos> Her earrings.<eos> Have you seen them before?
Sorry, ma'am, but I thought you should know about this.<eos> When I looked at the forensic reports on Michael Farmer's - and Hana Reznikova's clothing...<eos> - Yes?<eos> Last one to tell tales, but Tim Ifield signed out the reports.<eos> He's been looking at them too.
All right there, George.<eos> We'll get you out as soon as we can.<eos> Me eyes.<eos> Me eyes, w... what's wrong with them?<eos> Don't touch them, George.
Wait till I tell my mum I've been in here!<eos> When I was little, me and my sisters used to watch the Nonnatuns arriving on their bikes with the big black bags on the back.<eos> And then we'd hear that Mrs Mahoney, or Mrs Blewitt, or Cousin Peg had had a little boy or girl.<eos> We thought you brought the baby in the bag!<eos> Yes, they keep them in that cupboard over there.
So I haven't brought anything.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You can bring the snacks next time.<eos> Well, I have got biscuits. But, er... you wouldn't want them. They're broken.
There is still much work to be done.<eos> Will the flowers have a funeral?<eos> They go back to the earth.<eos> As we all do.<eos> I got them from the shed.
And we'll put these flowers in water.<eos> I went and had a rummage in the laundry room.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I loved these clothes.<eos> From the minute I put them on they felt like friends to me.
I'm your profiler.<eos> Even the stamp guy doesn't think he's the stamp guy.<eos> All right, let me walk you through it.<eos> You know what these are?<eos> These are profiles of the Unabomber, and we've got them all.
I can't make her decisions for her.<eos> That's what I used to tell myself about her father.<eos> I found the traitors, but I wasn't the one burning them alive.<eos> I was only a purveyor of information.<eos> It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy...
- I'm such a Wladyslavka.<eos> - Okay, well, just can you get this crap off the roof before Greg finds out?<eos> You're never going to use any of it anyway.<eos> Ooh, are those Venus razors?<eos> Could I have one? Actually, they're "Wenus" razors, but I got them for negative $40.00.
You know, it's typical addict bullshit.<eos> Like going over there was gonna solve anything.<eos> Guys from his old unit?<eos> I don't know, I guess.<eos> You know, I didn't know them.
Open your mouth.<eos> Wider.<eos> Put the pinkies in the corners.<eos> Lift them up.<eos> Pull them down.
Well, it's just right across the street.<eos> You'll be neighbors.<eos> Okay, I haven't spoken to my neighbors in my entire fucking life.<eos> - I don't even know who they are.<eos> - Oh, be glad. I've met them. All right?
I... I don't know how to describe it to you, but... But I know someone who does.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've come to the right place.<eos> Yeah, Liz is the, uh, world's preeminent authority on our parents.<eos> Nobody's been studying them longer.
Where have you two been?<eos> Where's the cake?<eos> Where are the balloons?<eos> Sorry, I forgot to get the balloons last night.<eos> So why didn't you get them on your way in?
I had to have an operation on my spine.<eos> I was 14.<eos> I spent a year in a body brace. Kids at school would call me<eos> The Bride of Frankenstein.<eos> They'd throw my books on the floor. And watch me struggle because they'd know how hard it would be for me to be able to pick them up.
Because I was afraid to go to prison.<eos> Because I thought that somehow it was fair because Noah had totally fucked up my life, and so I-I thought maybe this would make it even.<eos> I mean, just let him go.<eos> You know, let him suffer.<eos> And the kids needed me, and he'd lost them already, and mostly, really, it's because I'm a coward.
Making them guess your true feelings?<eos> Wear this tiara and continue on our fairy tale.<eos> Three offices on the left, two on the right.<eos> Kitchenette's here. And then there's this.<eos> I know there are cracks in the glass, but I think, with a little coaxing, the landlord would be willing to replace them.
It's been taken care of.<eos> Taken care of?<eos> Electors are human beings, Senator.<eos> Push the right buttons, they'll cave to your demands.<eos> So you threatened them?
- Thank you for seeing me.<eos> - Of course. President asks you to do something, you do it.<eos> Liv's been keeping you up to speed?<eos> I've never seen so many Secret Service agents in my life, even as First Lady.<eos> You can't always see them, but you can hear them.
No no! We divide them amongst the factions.<eos> Let each decide for themselves, huh?<eos> Keeping...<eos> Keeping... Keeping the missiles is an act of war which will lead to the end of the Belt.<eos> Using them gets us the same results.
You keep my secrets, I keep yours.<eos> Come.<eos> The boys have just arrived, Your Ladyship.<eos> They're with their father.<eos> I'll see them in the morning.
They called it the phoney war.<eos> A war where nothing happened.<eos> But now, across this green and pleasant land, young men are preparing to see just how real war can be.<eos> I'd call them brave, but only time will tell how true that is.
You can trust Mr. O'Hara, Freddie.<eos> It turns out it's not as simple as we thought.<eos> I've just learnt they found confidential papers in his room.<eos> You don't think he was...<eos> No, he'd have brought them home to work on.
What else do you see for yourself?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I...<eos> I had these plans when I was married to Sol.<eos> I never replaced them, except I'd enjoy having grandchildren one day.
It's nice to know.<eos> And I just happen to be washing these vases, so I have the perfect one picked out.<eos> Abigail says they can go right in the middle of the kitchen.<eos> I'm afraid they'll get knocked over there.<eos> I'll put them in the sun room.
If you want to.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> He wanted to give you flowers? Mm-hmm.<eos> He looked so cute standing there with them.<eos> I think he actually picked them himself.
You left your reading glasses downstairs. I thought you might need them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And, um, you left these downstairs, too.<eos> Since you have your glasses, maybe you want to take a look.<eos> If it's all right with you, I'll read them later.
You're a loose end.<eos> Was anyone else involved?<eos> No!<eos> Let him go.<eos> The kids in that dumpster, we killed them, you and me.
That they report.<eos> And that's just in this country. Think about that.<eos> You know what, Cassidy?<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Seventy million baby boys' foreskins, right? Severed, harvested, piled up. Shoveled into bloody warehouses, and you don't wanna know what they're using them for.
I just have to get more.<eos> Hit it, boys!<eos> And... evil thoughts.<eos> Boys, are you performing miracles?<eos> Jesus is performing them through us.
Geez, we got a situation here.<eos> Call for backup.<eos> - Margaret, don't bring it up again.<eos> Just tell the guys there's a ladder in the garage, or we'll rent theirs, 'cause they'll charge you rent.<eos> And have them climb up on the roof and don't tell 'em we don't have insurance.
- Nope, all over.<eos> One in Nova Scotia 2 years ago, another in Chiapas 5 years ago, and the third in Idaho Falls 18 years ago.<eos> The parents in Nova Scotia are Trevor and Darla Shabtai.<eos> Take a look at Dad's profile.<eos> Their social media addiction sure made them easy targets.
Let's go find out if this ghost is real.<eos> This way.<eos> Aspirateur d'Esprits.<eos> A spirit vacuum.<eos> If any spirits are attached to you, this will pull them out.
There was.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> Why don't you tell us how the fingerprints of your cremated men ended up at a murder?<eos> B-because,<eos> You didn't cremate them, did you?
A friend of mine was murdered.<eos> Do you have a suspect?<eos> We actually have two suspects.<eos> Well, that's good, right?<eos> And not so good, because apparently, you know them... Or knew them.
- Has to do with a lot of trees.<eos> It's like a grove or a thicket.<eos> "Lost to the Boscage for eternity."<eos> So the bodies are never found.<eos> Maybe he does eat them, or he feeds them to his furry forest friends.
- How did that happen?<eos> - We have no idea.<eos> But every one of them has a criminal history of environmental degradation.<eos> Okay, so either somebody carved these ignoramuses' faces into the tree...<eos> Or the tree absorbed them into itself.
I think Eve's looking for a little redemption.<eos> Aren't we all?<eos> Do you think there's anything in those books that could get her into the other place?<eos> They're my mom's books.<eos> I haven't read through all of them.
Except, we're running out of places to look.<eos> Sean... has a friend.<eos> This friend knows things about the symbols that can help us.<eos> So Renard knows about the symbols?<eos> Apparently, Diana drew them when she was with him.
That's for me to know.<eos> But if you ever wish for more, I'll comb the earth in search of them.<eos> Come on.<eos> Aunt Agatha, Drake's here, with a surprise!<eos> Uncle George hates toads. He had them all cleared from our pond.
And from trade, like your... your sponsor, Basset.<eos> We are not in France, sir -- your pitiful attempt at a revolution is doomed to fail.<eos> So commend me to your friends, gentlemen.<eos> All have received favours from me.<eos> As I'll remind them when I see them this afternoon.
And?<eos> His friend Sir Francis Basset.<eos> George and Sir Francis are not that alike, despite current appearances.<eos> True, they're both wealthy, and their power has been generated through the labour of others, but whilst Sir Francis values his menials,<eos> George despises them... .. as do many who enjoy inherited powers.
The Zookeeper, or Dr. Thomas Hornbein, was a psychopath Tribeca put away 10 years ago, back when you were in diapers.<eos> How'd you know about that?<eos> He was a world-renowned doctor of zoology and an extremist in the animal-rights movement.<eos> He preached that humans were the ones who belonged in a zoo, not animals.<eos> So he'd kidnap zoo-goers, locked them in his basement, feed them fruit and peanuts, and parade animals in front of them to laugh and jeer as they humped one another.
It's not about the money, Val.<eos> And you lied to me.<eos> I trusted you and you completely let me down.<eos> Look, I know you have dreams, mija.<eos> I want you to achieve them.
The longer you wait, the harder it gets, so...<eos> Love you, bro.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We donated his clothes today.<eos> Jay and I took them to the LGBT center, and then we went... and put some flowers in the ocean.
Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Heal the world. Hey, Lukey, you want a cookie?<eos> You know, why don't I hold on to these cookies - while you take care of Luke?<eos> - Don't be silly.<eos> I'll leave them in your office until the meeting.
You didn't study carrots in med school, did you?<eos> No. She eats them right off the tray, And then she asks for more.<eos> What about peas?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> She hates them. She pushes them away.
What is this?<eos> Sunny Pines, Manor on the Glen?<eos> - These are palliative care facilities. - Oh!<eos> I left them out for you, remember?<eos> You... You didn't look at them, did you?
- Come on, Worsham.<eos> Such a pleasure to watch and learn from you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did your lawyers receive the contracts?<eos> - Reviewing them as we speak.
Please, take him for an hour, take all the time you want.<eos> Okay, sit down, maybe.<eos> I dated many annoying guys, okay?<eos> They would call me all times of the day "just to talk" or ask me if I'd taken cash out of their wallets, stupid stuff.<eos> And when I stopped having fun with them, I'd leave. Usually wouldn't even call or anything.
He intends to turn Catholics against you.<eos> What import could a place like that have for Knox?<eos> They are hosting a harvest festival.<eos> People travel for miles to attend.<eos> His hope is that they will take his poisoned seeds of discontent and scatter them as they return to their homes.
Remembrances.<eos> How weird.<eos> I've been talking about you.<eos> I'd like to speak with you about the pants.<eos> To see if I got them?
Block letters only.<eos> Amen, brother.<eos> Cursive is bullshit.<eos> So, what exactly is your business?<eos> Basically I buy vintage clothes for cheap, make them look nice, and then sell them online for more money.
You took a payout and you signed a non-disclosure agreement.<eos> That's got nothing to do with it.<eos> They made us all sign those things.<eos> If any one of us breaks it, it negates them all.<eos> Then negate them all.
Zero. 'Cause I'm not gonna be shaken down by the likes of you.<eos> This isn't a shakedown, Mr. Palmer.<eos> Those men are dying from conditions that your company knew about.<eos> Those men signed non-disclosure agreements.<eos> And if they break them, we can come after them for every penny they got.
Stay away from the church!<eos> You don't believe their story.<eos> They haven't been eliminated as suspects.<eos> Still waiting on the DNA results.<eos> At which point, you'll release them.
All right, does Gleason have a car registered in his name?<eos> Yes, he does. 2005 red Silverado.<eos> Hey, Sarge, you gotta hear this.<eos> Sergeant Voight, you've had the boys for 24 hours.<eos> If you don't release them, I'm gonna bring the press up here.
What time is it?<eos> It's, um, eczema by the way.<eos> You were too polite to ask, but I'm pretty sure that you were wondering.<eos> Where are my clothes?<eos> You puked all over them so I put them in the wash.
It's Edie, right?<eos> Why am I here?<eos> Bad luck.<eos> The cops were here before, at the door.<eos> Your friend heard them too.
Fair enough.<eos> All right.<eos> So what you're saying is, I've been living alone for ten years, Keeping to myself,<eos> It's certainly a factor.<eos> It alters your thoughts, but it doesn't dictate them.
I'll let you know when it's ready.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Damn.<eos> The funny thing about feelings:<eos> You know, we think that if we push them down hard enough, that they'll disappear.
[ Sighs ] Tracking the quinjet's proving near impossible.<eos> The saboteurs have projected a false transponder signal while simultaneously jamming the real one.<eos> We have no way to contact the director or the quinjet while this jamming equipment is still active.<eos> This is clearly more than some pissed-off former squidheads.<eos> Someone with means is backing them.
I can assemble a team.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> I think it's time the superior sends some men of his own.<eos> Anton Ivanov, a reclusive industrialist with a submarine.<eos> Coulson: Bingo. You said you wanted to destroy the inhumans and the thing that brought them upon us.
The sick son of a bitch who kidnapped my people and seems to have more than a few skeletons in his closet?<eos> Do you not recognize these men?<eos> - Should I?<eos> - Yes, you should.<eos> Because you had them killed.
You make things from the genius of your mind and the goodness of your heart to help people.<eos> Don't let Radcliffe's actions corrupt that.<eos> You are not responsible for the twisted things he's done.<eos> Wrongs have been committed.<eos> Now we make them right ...
We'll get stuck.<eos> Drones will be here any second.<eos> Drones?<eos> Dwarfs, whatever.<eos> The Doctor invented them.
You're the one who came before.<eos> - I never did meet him.<eos> - This is not a social visit.<eos> Oh, Jemma, if only you knew the trials and tribulations I've endured.<eos> I am fresh out of sympathy for liars who kidnap my friends and replace them with killer androids.
What is Fitz doing with Aida?<eos> I don't know who Aida is, but that's madame Hydra.<eos> Subversives?<eos> They are people who happen to be our friends.<eos> I wanted to help them. You've turned them into prisoners!
No.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> She has Inhuman powers now? !<eos> Can we get a break, please? ! Can we get one break?<eos> Guess they weren't assessing powers at Hydra as much as collecting them.
Which I am not.<eos> You tell your men to stand down.<eos> I will not be remembered as the Queen who drew first blood.<eos> Blueberry Pie.<eos> Blueberries are out of season, so I had them brought in from Portugal.
Culls might not come.<eos> You're a scorpion, Mrs. Scanwell, and I've asked you to sting Margaret Wells.<eos> The deed grants you your own liberty.<eos> It doesn't extend to the children.<eos> If they're slaves, you will buy them back. I can never be a whore.
- Yeah. Good.<eos> Yeah, that's why we're doing this, so you can do a lot.<eos> You are one minute behind schedule.<eos> I'm gonna grab Barros and get him to Edward right away.<eos> Then what? And then I'll meet these brothers sometime that day, and I'll get them to take the money I'm bringing over.
I want to know what I did to deserve this.<eos> The boys just kept coming down into the basement.<eos> For hours, it felt like.<eos> I don't know, two, maybe three at a time.<eos> I knew most of them.
I just couldn't believe they were doing it, that it was actually happening.<eos> But it did happen.<eos> Didn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And who led them on?
Hi.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Very good, I think.<eos> Hey, will the doctor call me when the tests come back?<eos> The lab just sent them up.
Look... I didn't just lose Tara.<eos> I lost a chance at being a father.<eos> And those associates have always been my children to me.<eos> My children.<eos> And the truth is, I've been neglecting them ever since they got here, but that ends this morning.
Boy, you're unusually passionate about kites.<eos> That's awesome!<eos> How have we never talked about this?<eos> Do you prefer single line or double?<eos> Whatever makes them go!
Uh, didn't you also recently discover evidence of an undead anomaly in 19th century Poland?<eos> - Very good.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Rybnik, 1870. Three priests walk into a tavern and, no, that is not the beginning of a joke.<eos> A local farmer set upon them and ate them down to their collars.
But you better be careful.<eos> Because if you're looking at Gibbs, she's going to be looking at us.<eos> And you coming to my lobby in the middle of the day is going to get us all caught.<eos> Gentlemen, thank you for meeting with me on such short notice.<eos> Our pleasure. I assume you looked through the documents I sent over and found them to your liking?
Because if you're looking at Gibbs, she's going to be looking at us.<eos> And you coming to my lobby in the middle of the day is going to get us all caught.<eos> Gentlemen, thank you for meeting with me on such short notice.<eos> Our pleasure. I assume you looked through the documents I sent over and found them to your liking?<eos> On the contrary, we found them most disturbing.
Now there are no restrictions.<eos> You can get a Renaissance painting right on your computer.<eos> All of this is exactly why I need to talk to Alex.<eos> You know, with the Internet, kids see too much too soon.<eos> Then porn makes them grow up thinking that's what sex is supposed to be like.
Well, that's dependent on the next several hours.<eos> No, Ms. Shoemacher, it's Hollow Sky who is dependent on us with our more than generous contributions.<eos> Yes, and believe me, we're very grateful.<eos> I expect that will change when we pull your funding.<eos> If it's results you're after, we'll have them very soon.
I try to help the poor angels.<eos> He's a dealer.<eos> The gear he sells is better than the stuff they buy on the streets.<eos> - All I've ever done is help them.<eos> - The hospital helps them! What you do is poison them, you twisted cow!
Sarge, I think I know that man.<eos> The other day on the Pembridge, he slammed his door on me.<eos> Sarge, do you know them?<eos> Clifford Bentley's lads.<eos> Yeah, I know them.
His life is confined in here?<eos> He's happy.<eos> Would you like to look?<eos> My eyes don't work, and these help me see.<eos> Although if you wear them, I imagine things will look very blurry.
If you were gonna go out and have beers with my friends, you'd invite me along, right?<eos> Of course I would.<eos> I'm not a monster.<eos> I'm sorry you have bad feelings.<eos> For some reason, I'm not having them right now.
I feel like I haven't seen him for days.<eos> Did he ask about me?<eos> Oh, papito.<eos> What happened to your pants?<eos> I ripped them getting out of the trunk.
So after listening to this message, did you call your exhusband back?<eos> Yes.<eos> And what did he say?<eos> He told me that he'd take Emily and Jason away from me.<eos> He said that I would never see them again.
"Always fight for the underdog.<eos> "Never trust the government.<eos> Every human being deserves humanity."<eos> He made me recite the seven principles.<eos> He said the night he learned them from you changed his life.
The divorce was my fault.<eos> I admit that.<eos> The hardest part was not being around my kids every day.<eos> Karen, my exwife, she had the kids during the week.<eos> I had them on the weekend.
Yeah, so have I.<eos> What is that?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> You don't happen to have any more lions in your back pocket, do you?<eos> I want you to get them out of here to the safe zone as fast as possible, okay?
Well, that should get my former teammates' attention, and when they travel back in time to save him,<eos> I'll be there waiting for them with open arms. Well, not too open, I hope.<eos> No, have no fear, Mr. Thawne.<eos> I have no lingering attachment.<eos> In that case, kill them all, collect their fragment of the Spear of Destiny, and bring it to me.
They weren't goods to be traded.<eos> There's that famous Kryptonian exaggeration.<eos> Mon-El, you remember how well your servants were treated at the palace.<eos> Just like family.<eos> Because you stole them from their families.
There's that famous Kryptonian exaggeration.<eos> Mon-El, you remember how well your servants were treated at the palace.<eos> Just like family.<eos> Because you stole them from their families.<eos> We liberated them from greater hardship.
For people in our position, a more realistic time to get a mortgage would be 2007.<eos> We didn't even know each other then.<eos> So, what...?<eos> Why are you wearing no trousers?<eos> Because on top of everything else, I'm fat now and they hurt, so when I got home I threw them away.
If the position of lord chancellor remains open, Spain will try to fill it with one of their own, and granting Spain a presence in our government practically makes France a Spanish colony.<eos> I will not allow it.<eos> Your brother can sign those papers in my blood, but I and France need Narcisse!<eos> I selected those four generals myself, Mary.<eos> I've known them for years. I don't believe there's a traitor among them.
This is an emergency!<eos> Why is Homeworld stealing humans from the boardwalk?<eos> I don't know, but they're only taking my friends!<eos> They even got Connie!<eos> If we don't do something, they're going to take them into space!
It's cool.<eos> And that's all there is to it.<eos> Leslie.<eos> What are the terms of my situation, my working situation with Stephen?<eos> You're both going to perform essentially the same tasks more or less until we determine who's better at them.
Well, speaking from experience,<eos> I figured I was doing her a favor.<eos> Careful.<eos> Lest your insults mar an already tentative peace.<eos> All right, listen, I don't care about our peace, all right? I care about finding these missing kids and wiping out the messed up people who took them.
But to sever the spirit's link, you're gonna have to bury the beads at the root of this creature's power.<eos> Well, how do I do that?<eos> Is there any place that it has manifested itself before?<eos> Vincent mentioned an abandoned house.<eos> This thing lured kids there, attacked them, attacked Vincent.
Previously on The Originals...<eos> When you die, so too does your entire sire line.<eos> The Hollow has Elijah, so we find this thing and its acolytes, we slaughter the lot of them.
This thing has been haunting the city for a very long time.<eos> And before today, the only thing I knew about it was that it was a spirit practicing very dark magic, and it was trying desperately to get back into this world.<eos> And that's why it tried to sacrifice those kids.<eos> That's why it tried to do the exact same thing to Marcel and to Klaus.<eos> Because if it kills them, if they die, it absorbs all of their power.
Gary. He was a good man.<eos> He... he only did good things in this world.<eos> Not like Bruce.<eos> Gary was a father. He had two grown sons.<eos> I never met them, but I...
Hey, housekeeping?<eos> Yeah, no need to go in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How about the towels?<eos> You can just leave them outside of the door.
- No, it's not going to be fine.<eos> As you can see, we've got appetizers coming in from here.<eos> Bartender keeps sending out more rounds from here and here.<eos> And the mains, mains are coming in from the north.<eos> I've never seen them move so quickly.
And nothing perfect exists in nature.<eos> Flaws in all.<eos> Slightly oblong, our planets, the sun.<eos> Like us.<eos> But here, at McMillan, we make them.
Flaws in all.<eos> Slightly oblong, our planets, the sun.<eos> Like us.<eos> But here, at McMillan, we make them.<eos> And we place them in the world.
As were all the others.<eos> Where are they?<eos> In the house.<eos> What? Where?<eos> We haven't seen them.
Can you help her or not?<eos> I am helping! This is me helping!<eos> How did you find out their unique abilities?<eos> Did you bring them in here?<eos> You brought them in here, right, but what activated them?
I actually pissed on the fire hydrant.<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Ethan, I've been meaning to tell you,<eos> I've read all your books and they're incredible, I love them.
Sabine.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> This city, this apartment, There are so many painful memories.<eos> Maybe poland can be a new beginning.<eos> And we get away from them.
No, dude, Maggie pulled some strings and got us on Let's Make a Deal.<eos> Jobs?<eos> Even better... contestants. - What?<eos> - Yeah, and I got you costumes.<eos> People just leave them in the Dumpster behind the studio.
But what you don't know is that your mom just found out that she's going to have another baby.<eos> And your parents have already been stretching their money to make sure that they can pay for your college education.<eos> You don't know any of this yet because you're just a kid and they work really hard to shield you from that stuff.<eos> But, unfortunately, this creates a lot of tension between them.<eos> Sometimes, you hear them yelling at each other late at night when they think you're asleep.
- Aye, he does.<eos> Ah, maybe he means it.<eos> So what's his wife like?<eos> She died when the kids were young.<eos> He brought them up on his own.
Single mother. Three kids.<eos> I-I gave them everything.<eos> Cooking, cleaning... And they weren't easy those kids.<eos> I-I was at the end of my rope.<eos> And then you set them on fire.
So give me what you have on Miriam Attar or get out.<eos> There are calls from overseas, Lebanon and Syria, going to a series of numbers my friends don't recognise.<eos> They believe those numbers are conduits through which Yusef Attar is fundraising and recruiting in the UK.<eos> These numbers, where are they?<eos> Triangulation places them all in a quiet little street in London N16.
We've used him to appraise antique jewelry for us.<eos> If anyone can find an extinct Russian rock, it's him.<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> Doug, any word on John Stevenson?<eos> He's using burner phones, then tossing them.
A deli?<eos> Like, where old people eat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why is it so gross for them?<eos> Like, old people are cute when they're shoving five bucks in your birthday card, but you ever watch them eat?
And raw enough to still feel the pain that delivered you to my doorstep in the first place!<eos> When I was a little kid, we raised chickens, hmm?<eos> And chicks break out of their shells.<eos> That's what gives them their strength.<eos> If someone helps them, they die.
The one where all the people died.<eos> Were you point on that?<eos> I was in Seattle by then, but I was down the food chain a bit.<eos> Bodies were missing brains.<eos> The CSI's claimed fish got to them, but now... Plane crash girl and the super Max body both had brains in their stomachs.
Perfect. 'Cause we all hungry in here, and I just burned a week's worth of everyone's favorite puffed corn snacks.<eos> You've done everything you could.<eos> Man...<eos> All this, uh... waitin' around... makes me miss her even more.<eos> You know, when Cal and I would get bored... we'd make little figures out of popsicle sticks and hide them all over the house for my parents to find.
What deal?<eos> From whom?<eos> With the guys.<eos> They, um... - The ones that run the prison.<eos> - You know? The MCC. They... they said that I would get time off my sentence if I freed them.
You think if I touch that thing, it'll actually move an inch?<eos> It's a fucking helmet.<eos> We have a situation.<eos> Miss Jefferson did not release the hostages.<eos> An inmate helped them escape.
See, I ain't opposed to hitting people on my team.<eos> Stop.<eos> None of that matters.<eos> The hostages are gone.<eos> Mendoza and Ruiz helped them escape.
How'd you get that thing in my bed without waking me up?<eos> Because you're a champion sleeper.<eos> It's the craziest thing.<eos> She will not give up on that kid.<eos> Trophies can boost self-esteem. If you actually win them, like I did.
That's abominable, Albert.<eos> This, this is humane.<eos> You'd burn a man's insides, make him drown in his own phlegm?<eos> They're slaughtering our boys.<eos> Because we attacked them.
And we have no idea where the attackers came from.<eos> Casualties from the Zone?<eos> Eight human dead, 10 subhuman.<eos> The Authority deleted their details from the system when they were arrested in preparation for...<eos> So the rest of them are loose somewhere in the city along with whatever the hell that thing was that attacked them.
Simpler than what's going on out there.<eos> You must've seen a lot in your time.<eos> The thing I remember the most... was this little human girl.<eos> My family told me never to make contact with the humans.<eos> But I used to watch them whenever I got the chance.
Which I don't.<eos> Not anymore. Well, maybe you know somebody who does.<eos> Even if I could pry one open, it's a federal crime.<eos> Look, Stahl doesn't even feel like a man unless he's manipulating a woman.<eos> He crawls inside your head to all the places you feel safe, and he takes them.
Narrow it down.<eos> Of America.<eos> You know what?<eos> You got neighbors.<eos> We don't want them in on our little game.
Albert, I was thinking maybe Mr. Morgenthau could give us some advice on getting our friends out of Germany.<eos> Get up. Let's go. - On your feet, you kike.<eos> - Move!<eos> Move!<eos> Where are you taking them?
Take it or leave it.<eos> I can't be ready sooner than that.<eos> Lights.<eos> I went to get the kids... from... lacrosse practice, but... But they weren't there.<eos> They said we never signed them up.
You don't know that.<eos> What, business opportunity?<eos> Skipping town?<eos> Not telling you?<eos> They were gonna kill him... except he got to them first.
Oh, my God.<eos> Why have we only done this once before?<eos> Because we decided we didn't want to have any more kids.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Oh, God, I love them so much.
You saw them?<eos> Yeah. Right before the ceremony.<eos> You saw them, they had cameras and...?<eos> Yeah, some newspaper assholes.<eos> I told them to get lost or I'd call the cops.
Oh, good.<eos> It looks like you need it.<eos> You have kids, Dr. Carver?<eos> Uh, call me Amos, and, yes.<eos> I do. But I don't see them anymore.
Your mother is coming to be with you.<eos> You've been through quite an ordeal.<eos> Where are my clothes?<eos> Because those are not my clothes.<eos> The troopers brought them for you.
Henry, so glad you could stop by.<eos> I have new renderings.<eos> Read the contract, Burbage.<eos> It's your responsibility to obtain the building permits.<eos> Lord Hunsdon assures me we will have them by the week's end.
For the other side, not Democrats.<eos> The governor's worried. Do you have any numbers?<eos> No, just what we gave you.<eos> I would think that the president might have access to some numbers that we don't.<eos> When I get them, you'll get them.
You guys, I have basically become a celebrity.<eos> I should've started caring about the community years ago.<eos> I could never go into politics.<eos> Men aren't attracted to women in power.<eos> It makes them uncomfortable.
The Excellent or that Porsche?<eos> - That Porsche.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because it's better in every single way.<eos> To prove my cynical colleagues wrong, I invited them to go for a drive.
- She disobeyed my word!<eos> And so now, it is upon us... to show our new friends what comes from that.<eos> Wait, he's baiting us. Trying to draw us out.<eos> Please, I'm so sorry.<eos> Your stitches are a gift, but your eyes belong to the Unseeing, and you don't deserve them anymore.
I always forget how young you are.<eos> It takes time to accept the change.<eos> But... a word of caution:<eos> if you feel the commander's affections allow you to do as you please... Aneela always tires of her toys.<eos> And then she breaks them.
You're gonna let that Killjoy and all of us go, or I'm gonna have your balls and your badge, all of you.<eos> Then I definitely shouldn't do this.<eos> They're called Hullen.<eos> Human hosts taken over by an alien parasite.<eos> Turns them into hive-minded sociopaths.
Specs on the convoy...<eos> only thing I couldn't get was codes for the safe truck they keep the crystals in.<eos> It's all right.<eos> We don't need them.<eos> So if you have all this Intel, why haven't you robbed them yourselves?
Lock the door.<eos> What is all this?<eos> The library.<eos> Whenever we pass a new plasma pool, Gander sends out ships to bring back samples.<eos> And what do they use them for?
I got word to Borna.<eos> Guess we'll see if she likes you more than her last third husband.<eos> If I were you, I'd be more worried about hurting any of her boys.<eos> She's rather fond of them.<eos> And my boys aren't too fond of dirt pirates who rip them off.
This is not okay.<eos> We finally have our secret weapon.<eos> The armada will always have more ships.<eos> So, rangers, we need your people to scout and find an ideal site for war on the ground.<eos> How do we lure them into a ground fight?
Well, we can't just leave them.<eos> We can't give up if there's a chance they're still alive.<eos> There were escape pods all over that station.<eos> I'll contact Mikkei Central and have them divert all available ships to the area.<eos> If your friends have survived, hopefully our ships will find them first.
[MAN] I-It ain't glamorous, but it's an honest livin'.<eos> Not like what your friends are doin' out there on the street.<eos> They're not so bad.<eos> [MAN] Hey, I-I-I'm not judging.<eos> But sooner or later, the system's gonna catch up with them and chew them up.
Because now we're going to respond...<eos> And you're going to help us.<eos> Maybe you should try talking to them first.<eos> Six is the talker.<eos> If he hasn't convinced them by now, nothing we say is gonna change anything. He's right.
I'd like to announce the conspirators have been caught and set a date for their trial by the end of the week.<eos> It is best to move quickly in these matters to give the people the reassurance they deserve.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> Yes, emperor.<eos> We hit them after their next checkin.
You're gonna revive one of them?<eos> Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> You were the one who told me they could be reasoned with.<eos> Yeah, they can also be dangerous. And how would you know that?<eos> We've encountered them before.
A bunch of us are going hunting.<eos> You can join if you're not too busy watching old folks bone.<eos> Middle of the night?<eos> Boars are nocturnal.<eos> Catch them sneaking around in the dark.
It's based on a computer algorithm developed by the Illinois Institute of Technology.<eos> So you're telling me some computer wonk on a college campus can predict the future?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Young men at the top of the Heat List are shooting each other in Englewood as we speak.<eos> And how's turning off their smartphones gonna stop them from killing each other?
Would you like to have a sip of your coffee?<eos> Maybe you'll be in a better mood if you're caffeinated.<eos> We don't ACD drug cases. Your client had a vial of crack in his pants.<eos> They weren't his pants.<eos> Are you kidding me? His wife bought them for him at a secondhand store.
It was completely normal.<eos> Everything...<eos> I'm chill, man.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, excuse me, uh, my son is taking dishes off the shelves and smashing them on the floor.
Must have been you.<eos> He'd never go around with photos of the bastards.<eos> He's put a lot of time into you.<eos> My own children didn't have the drive.<eos> Maybe I spoiled them too much.
Arnold doesn't know Mulligan.<eos> - His name is right there.<eos> - Yes, along with 40 others.<eos> Arnold doesn't have the evidence for 40 men.<eos> He's grasping. He failed to deliver them West Point, and so he's putting on show, he's puffing out his chest.
So, here's the answer.<eos> I was born in India.<eos> My father was a surgeon at Fort William.<eos> And I grew up watching him minister to the poor mongrels of Bengal.<eos> Only at age 10, to see them turn on him, and throw him in a tiny cell designed to hold three men, they put him in with 60.
Those days are dead.<eos> I thought we had an understanding, even outside of court.<eos> I understood.<eos> When you came here with your drunk friends,<eos> I was to serve them their food with a smile on my face, tolerate their slurs, clean up their vomit in the toilet, and thank them for their pocket-change tips.
And Brad hasn't realized what time The Lunch Hour's on yet?<eos> Please don't attack my Brad.<eos> He's the perfect husband and father.<eos> The problem is Leon.<eos> He dropped my cards and put them back in the wrong order.
Aww, he's resting comfortably on a cruller.<eos> Living my dream, buddy.<eos> He won't die, right?<eos> It's illegal to kill squirrels in the Ukraine.<eos> Ever since Putin had them trained as spies.
All right, now give me that paw.<eos> Now here's what I got for you. There you go.<eos> I have a way with dogs.<eos> Well, my marijuana biscuits do.<eos> That's why I call them Hush Puppies.
Yeah, but I don't recognize any of them.<eos> They're all just rando dudes.<eos> - Rando dudes into kinky-ass...<eos> - When we get back to the station, get together with Jimmy.<eos> Well, we need to get those rando dudes sketched before you forget them.
A permanent bond between Wessex and Mercia.<eos> Which one of you is Aethelred?<eos> Alfred forced me to renew my allegiance.<eos> He sent me to kill the Northmen brothers, Erik and Sigefrid.<eos> After taking Sigefrid's hand, I banished them.
In here.<eos> Hey.<eos> So sorry I'm late.<eos> You won't believe what happened.<eos> My neighbor had a massive fire in her kitchen, like, a real fire, and her cat just had five kittens, and she couldn't find them all.
You know them pickers?<eos> Off Jack Madden's farm? - Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're always hanging around, creeping the women out.<eos> And Mia was friendly with them, was she?
No, it's clearly about me.<eos> My actions are and were justified.<eos> What was seized illegally is now mine again.<eos> The foundation treaty is built upon many precepts.<eos> I assume you respect them all, or is it just those that suit your interests?
Don't you let some crush cloud your good judgment, because that kind of thing can get you killed.<eos> And I was just starting to like you.<eos> Almost.<eos> Look. More runaways.<eos> I don't know where we're gonna put them. We're running out of space.
Fast!<eos> - Where are you headed?<eos> - It's fine.<eos> We have other hiding spots.<eos> And did this Wilkins know about them?
Is it a smithy?<eos> A tavern?<eos> A brothel.<eos> I'm going to a brothel.<eos> If you want to know a man's secrets, you have to go where he spills them.
I've done nothing to you, Capulet.<eos> You only hate me for my name.<eos> And you hate me for mine.<eos> The hour is late.<eos> I only had a few moments to spend here, and I've wasted them all with you.
Wait, what?<eos> I think she's 48.<eos> That's how old my Aunt Kim is.<eos> She wears the same clothes as Ms. Snap.<eos> She calls them her truck stop dresses.
- Mr. President.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Sir, there's been a complication in Naruba.<eos> We just got Intel that 15 American humanitarian workers have been taken hostage by Kalame's militia.<eos> Apparently, he's holding them in several different vehicles in his convoy.
I just told her what she wanted to hear so she wouldn't kill us.<eos> I didn't feel anything.<eos> Maybe I never did. What is wrong with me?<eos> Look, feelings aren't like memories.<eos> You can't just pull them out of a file.
- Oh, they're probably not gonna come.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you forget to hand out the invitations?<eos> No.<eos> I handed them out.
I'm not emotional, you're emotional.<eos> - I'm not emotional.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, we got to get it together.<eos> Why don't we poach kids from one of the other two parties and send them out to Randall's?
The Anders covered it up.<eos> He made it look like an accident.<eos> And Vanessa has no idea about any of this.<eos> Explains why her parents were so charitable.<eos> Can imagine the guilt was eating them alive.
Item reference TJI-2 is a hairgrip.<eos> At Michael Farmer's home, we also found said hair grip bearing DNA matching Baswinder Kaur, and a necklace bearing DNA matching Leonie Collersdale.<eos> Tests indicated carpet fibre deposits present on other items recovered from Michael Farmer's home address were absent on the items specifically linking Farmer to the previous victims.<eos> Those items were trophies.<eos> I took the view that Michael Farmer took special care of them, keeping them in a safe place, keeping them clean, and for that reason I discounted the carpet fibre profile.
Oh, come on. You want the job?<eos> Wail in agony.<eos> Okay.<eos> The men never died.<eos> She harvests them for food.
We just need to know what we're dealing with.<eos> In cases like these, the birth parent almost always wins guardianship.<eos> Well, what if... What if he's not a fit parent?<eos> I mean, he's basically been stalking us.<eos> I understand, but the courts are generally reluctant to award custody to someone other than the natural parents, except in cases where those parents clearly abused, neglected, or abandoned them.
You're very important to us, David... to me.<eos> I need you clear.<eos> I need you focused.<eos> This is how we do it...<eos> We look back, we find your powers, we see what triggers them.
The king's name will be cleared.<eos> The bear that took the child has been found and killed.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They found some of the boy's remains where... a bear might be expected to keep them.
The princes.<eos> One of them got away.<eos> "Got away?"<eos> Elizabeth told my physician, Doctor Lewis, years ago.<eos> She said, "If you had two precious jewels, would you put them in the same box?"
She and I met at cooking school.<eos> We were oven partners in the Advanced Baking Course.<eos> You weren't oven partners. Aunt Josephine was desperately afraid of turning on an oven.<eos> Soon we became fast friends, and then one day she said to me,<eos> "If I ever adopt some orphans and then meet an untimely death, promise me that you will raise them as if they were your own."
Unless you are a murderer or a taxidermist, it is rare to have actual skeletons in your closet, as opposed to metaphorical ones.<eos> But as Klaus had just discovered... Dr. Orwell's closet... had both.<eos> Nothing to be frightened of.<eos> I'm sure many doctors have skeletons to study anatomy.<eos> I suppose they could keep them in closets.
I took a chance on treating you like grown-ups. Don't make me regret it.<eos> Now, get back to work!<eos> You'll have to excuse Sir.<eos> He recently cut down on the smoking.<eos> Do you know he feeds the workers gum and pays them in coupons?
- The machine!<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> London 1899.<eos> You have the coordinates already, just send me back.<eos> They're gonna kill Cole and Cassie if I don't get to them first.
One day before this photo was taken, an American journalist living in Surabaya died in a car accident.<eos> Rumor was he used to be a CIA operative who went inside the Islamic Front.<eos> I think Dayana and Mike Murray were the kill team sent in to take him out.<eos> Can we get back to the part where Ryan's not a bad guy?<eos> Okay, you said that the terrorists are interrogating the hostages and then executing them.
They're all owned by the Firm.<eos> Including the church?<eos> No, the building next to it.<eos> They're not even here, are they?<eos> You stashed them in the Rectory.
But there's none of that here.<eos> This isn't the original crime scene.<eos> The question is where's the primary, and who would be brazen enough to do this?<eos> All the roads in Mexico lead to the cartels.<eos> Whoever this kid was, he unfortunately came across them, did something to piss them off, and paid the price.
Any relation to Miguel?<eos> Yeah, brother and sister.<eos> Well, why was the truck towed in the first place?<eos> Because it had a La Santa Muerte altar in the bed.<eos> The altars are illegal, so the police destroy them and impound any vehicle associated with them.
It's what I expected.<eos> The reference pointer was just remapped to null.<eos> So I bytemapped an image of the OS footprint, loaded up a hex editor, and did some educated regex grepping, and...<eos> English, please.<eos> The girl destroyed her texts. But I... Resurrected them.
Then delegate.<eos> - Perhaps we can discuss this in my office?<eos> - We'll discuss it here and now.<eos> I will not allow Faber to be murdered by these bandits.<eos> Giving them what they want will only encourage them more.
This isn't right.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where are the prisoners?<eos> Probably dead already.<eos> I thought your source said they had them, that we'd get them back.
We lived in this little house upstate.<eos> I mean, not as small as yours, of course.<eos> Don't feel the need to include me in your story.<eos> And he was super into model trains.<eos> He kept them in the garage, you know, on of those big pieces of plywood.
In two days, the Department of Defense will be here... in two days.<eos> The minute that they are, I am screwed.<eos> The only way that we can make sure that they don't find out what I'm doing is to catch those animals out there...<eos> Catch them and exterminate them.<eos> And I can't kill them unless I can find them.
-[Ethan] Yes.<eos> Give her the shot at 21:30 exactly, right on the X that you put on her backside.<eos> Yes, it is imperative that you give the shot exactly 36 and a half hours before surgery.<eos> -Do you understand? -[Lisa] Yes.<eos> Then you take her follicles, mix them with my sperm, boom, right?
They killed everyone.<eos> They picked up my baby brother by the neck and bashed his head against a rock.<eos> They cut my mother's head off, stuck a spear between her legs.<eos> My sister and I... Ran.<eos> We hid in the bushes, and we watched them kill everyone in our camp.
Yeah.<eos> Well, which one you want to go with?<eos> Yeah... I don't think so.<eos> Well, we've examined all the risks.<eos> We feel like the benefits outweigh them.
No matter where... where we came from.<eos> And on that day no matter where we came from.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Tonight I can report to the world that Eden and the survival project have conducted a joint operation that has killed s.D. Howarth.<eos> We made no distinction between the terrorists who committed those acts and those who harboured them.
No, I'm not hungry.<eos> Come on. Can't we be civil?<eos> I was always a fine surgeon.<eos> But I am an excellent teacher, and today, I was a complete failure.<eos> I know you thought this program had problems, but it sure as hell has them now.
Oh, I've been watching "The Lunch Hour".<eos> Pretty entertaining stuff.<eos> I find it particularly interesting how you decided to broadcast your love life.<eos> Well, you better keep watching then because there's gonna be a second date.<eos> So I wanna get all these prescription pill bottles and fill them with little white MM's.
First of all, Sly, you should always redirect.<eos> Answer the question you wish had been asked instead of the one that was.<eos> Like when Allie asked me if I liked vegan food.<eos> I said yes. I like broccoli and carrots.<eos> I just left out that I like them next to a steak.
Cars 3 miles away."<eos> Well, that's all great and all, but how we gonna walk through cinder blocks?<eos> Well, maybe we can drill through it.<eos> We can use the spools from the printing press.<eos> If we offset them a foot, we could use them to drill through.
He was crazy one.<eos> They didn't kill anyone.<eos> They thought they were gonna roll a couple foreigners, make some quick cash.<eos> Yeah, these guys are just the neighborhood muscle, nothing more.<eos> Unlike the man who hired them, they didn't have a plan.
The defendant is ordered released on an unsecured bond of $2,000.<eos> An executive dining room.<eos> My goodness, the cell tower business must be good.<eos> You should know, you're handling our contracts.<eos> We were handling them.
Don't testify against Diane. What?<eos> I have to.<eos> Dad, if they're offering ten years, they must have a weak case.<eos> It's for you, too.<eos> You do this, Dad, and if I ever have any kids, you'll never see them.
Hold on.<eos> Here's the problem, Ms. Quinn...<eos> We have a lot of problems here, don't we?<eos> These foundation documents were signed by Maia.<eos> And she signed them, she just admitted, on the night of her birthday party, her 18th birthday.
I hate to be the bad guy here, but millions of dollars were being parked into that foundation to hide them from an SEC audit. That is a felony crime.<eos> Now, unless Maia tells us about Diane Lockhart's advice to her parents, we will stop this questioning now and prosecute.<eos> I need to be 18 for those documents to be official?<eos> Yes. And you were.<eos> You signed them on your 18th birthday.
I thought you were gonna die.<eos> And that does something to a man.<eos> It changes the way he thinks about things... about us...<eos> And he reminded me how important it was to share my feelings.<eos> And I didn't want to let you in the shed without sharing them, so... feelings shared.
Catherine and Heathcliff,<eos> Heathcliff and Garfield.<eos> Kimmy?<eos> Where'd the documents go?<eos> The dog ate them.
Blah, blah, blah, she goes on, but you get the point.<eos> You get on the stand and deny stuff, she gets the last word.<eos> You don't testify; We don't need it.<eos> We do our jobs right, we have this thing won by tomorrow.<eos> Carolyn signed the clemency papers. I'm filing them today.
Focus on Trixie.<eos> And I'm-I'm worried about her.<eos> Have you noticed anything?<eos> You have?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna adopt a dozen puppies, and I'm gonna let them sleep in your bedroom.
"The Blade of Death."<eos> Azrael's.<eos> "The Medallion of Life."<eos> Johnson's belt buckle.<eos> And the key that binds them all together.
We'll fix it.<eos> There's plenty of time.<eos> - Just not for me.<eos> God shattered the Flaming Sword into three distinct pieces.<eos> The Blade of Death, the Medallion of Life and the Key that binds them all together.
- Ruby.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, that's lovely.<eos> Can you rupture something snoring that hard?<eos> Radical theory... do you think that humans snore so that in the caveman days, someone didn't bury them?
You must really want a kid.<eos> I must.<eos> Yay. Right?<eos> Were you hoping for something different?<eos> Not when I bought them.
I'm back on board.<eos> Oh, I'll ride from Boston to the outer boroughs to warn my fellow Colonists.<eos> I'll wear my father's clothes, so they think I'm a man and believe me.<eos> - I've fallen for stuff like that.<eos> - Perfect. So, you tell the Colonists to defend their guns, and we'll make sure that the British - are coming for them.
I'll miss you, too.<eos> Perhaps you can sing me one of your songs to think of while you're gone.<eos> Deb, the thing about my songs...<eos> You're such an amazing talent.<eos> It's as if you read my private thoughts and put them to wondrous melodies.
- What?<eos> ! Well, my father had some once, and I had hoped for a taste, but he fed the remainder to the pigs instead.<eos> The pigs looked at me differently after that, as if they knew something I didn't.<eos> Pigs are very smart.<eos> That's why a lot of celebrities have them as pets.
Dr. Edwards certainly knew, because she was taught... right.<eos> This is not some factory that turns out surgical robots.<eos> We make doctors.<eos> Thinking, feeling, human doctors.<eos> And we will teach them right.
You need to pay rent like real adults, unless you want to go to college, in which case we will completely support you.<eos> I have never felt so unloved.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I didn't ask to have corns,<eos> - God gave them to me.
When my grandmother died, I was eight or something.<eos> I asked my Mom if I could take her to school for show and tell.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She said, "Dead bodies can't stay above ground.<eos> The air makes them sad."
She said, "Dead bodies can't stay above ground.<eos> The air makes them sad."<eos> Yeah, actually, that's not a bad idea. What?<eos> A little show and tell?<eos> What if we put the bodies outside, use them as bait, see what shows up?
You want to give Eileen something that isn't tainted with failure.<eos> Mother has my great-grandmother's ring.<eos> It's gorgeous.<eos> Only problem is, Mother will never let me have it.<eos> She even hides the Bed Bath Beyond 20% coupons from me because she thinks I'll ruin them.
I am investigating possible police corruption, which is what Nick asked us to do.<eos> Do you want me to stop?<eos> No.<eos> But Steve Mason was a good cop.<eos> He had his demons, but he beat them.
They are very bad, you know.<eos> Pigs are actually smarter than dogs, so... poof.<eos> Yeah, I think I saw that on someone's Facebook wall.<eos> Can I have $500 in cash to do an art project?<eos> It's a really special thing I'm working on where I take five $100 bills and I arrange them on a piece of construction paper.
I'll never look at another girl again, I promise.<eos> Uh ,look, here, you don't believe me?<eos> - Look, I'll stab my eyes out.<eos> - No!<eos> How will I get lost in your eyes if you stab them out, baby?
Thanks, Barry.<eos> Those earrings are really nice.<eos> Where'd you get them?<eos> These?<eos> I got them at this awesome store.
I'm not just a king.<eos> Fen's pregnant.<eos> I'm gonna be a father.<eos> Mm. And I would like to raise my child in a world that does not just kill its problems away.<eos> We hear them and we address them accordingly.
Oh, hey, Poodle.<eos> Hey, it's me, Mickey, again.<eos> Uh, remember me?<eos> The one you saddled with your kids, who are awful, by the way.<eos> Listen, I was just... I had this thought that maybe if you had a couple spare minutes, you could give 'em a call and let them know that you fled the country and left them with a total stranger, you stupid, selfish monsters!
- Yeah, yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Well, she did break both of her hips, you know?<eos> So, no, she's not.<eos> These kids have somebody to watch them tonight?
He used to sing me this song.<eos> Even as a born and bred Washingtonian I suspect you are unaware of the secret passageways beneath the city.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Whoa, indeed.<eos> During the War of 1812, these were used to transport munitions, and spies traversed them to vital points around the city.
I give you my word, we will bring him down by hook or by crook, but first we must contain the situation at hand.<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll do it your way.<eos> Now, there are many types of hunger demons that might cause these sorts of symptoms.<eos> The ancient Chinese scholar Pu Songling cataloged them by genus and type in a book called Liaozhai Zhiyi during the Qing Dynasty.
We're so high up my hot dog's going to be brought by a Sherpa.<eos> Hey, Joan, there's open seats lower down... let's go grab two.<eos> No, that wouldn't be right. They're not ours.<eos> Well, actually, no, um, a partner at my law firm has season tickets, and he told me he's having an affair this weekend, and also he's not very good at having affairs.<eos> Well, let's go grab those seats before he loses them in the divorce.
Word spread that Adam had a new supply of owls, and... Owls?<eos> Like-like the birds?<eos> Like the drug. Come on, partner.<eos> Legal chemical supplements.<eos> They're named after Owlsly, the chemist who made them for Adam until they had a falling out.
Jefferson.<eos> How are things down at the lab?<eos> There was a minor setback, but the situation is under control.<eos> You promised me results.<eos> And you will have them.
What are you doing?<eos> I'm just trying to find...<eos> - Isn't that your brother?<eos> - Yeah. They're here.<eos> No, it's fine, I got them. - Please calm down, sir.
The Bureau's gonna hold it against him.<eos> He violated security protocol.<eos> I mean, as a federal agent, he's a high-value target.<eos> You know this.<eos> The brass doesn't like it when you keep them in the dark.
And who doesn't need an extra pair of khakis?<eos> I can't believe they costumed me in khakis. _<eos> - They're so not flattering.<eos> - Relax, Rogelio.<eos> You're only going to be wearing them for a few seconds.
To explain:<eos> Rogelio had not seen Darci since his feelings... mm, came up.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> These three weeks apart were just what I needed.<eos> Whenever my feelings for her would... arise, I tamped them down and reminded myself what I'm fighting for:
Well, that's the Propranolol working.<eos> It reduces your stress.<eos> And the D-Cycloserine will enhance your memory.<eos> So I'll control your environment from here.<eos> As you remember more details, tell them to me and I'll add them to the environment.
Well, we're off to a great start.<eos> I'm loving those napkins.<eos> I didn't think you knew about napkins.<eos> Well, that was a happy accident.<eos> I found them when I was looking for the fire extinguisher.
Oh, please, God, please, send the strength that I need to make it through today.<eos> And I want to...<eos> Lord, are you calling me home?<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> I called them and explained that none of this was your fault... it was all mine.
I thought you were on their side.<eos> A program can't take into account human emotions, people covering for others, people forced to do things they didn't want to.<eos> We're not doing good here.<eos> So what are we supposed to do now?<eos> We get them arrested.
It's like a mass sulk.<eos> Come on.<eos> The sooner we get there, the sooner we'll know the answer.<eos> Yeah, I know, but... Picts, early Celts. Loved stone cairns.<eos> They built them under the ground but close to the sky.
They make deserts and they call it peace.<eos> Yeah, but you've got to love the indoor toilets, yeah?<eos> They're not conquerors, they're cowards.<eos> They're also all dead.<eos> There's an awful lot of dead cowards out there, and I don't believe that you killed them.
Doctor, please!<eos> Listen!<eos> The TARDIS will take you home, return journeys are easy.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Leave the instruments on the current setting, just hit them with a spanner.
What the hell are you saying?<eos> What?<eos> Hey.<eos> You said the diamonds would be at the warehouse. No, I didn't.<eos> I said you'd get them back if you went to the warehouse.
You haven't thrown away those jam jars, have you?<eos> I was collecting them for the spring fair.
And I haven't been good enough for my children.<eos> You wouldn't hurt your son? No.<eos> Your husband wouldn't hurt him?<eos> All the secrets and the lying.<eos> We've both hurt them in our own sort of way.
It's been straining to keep up with your boat for hours.<eos> 40 miles per hour is all he's got.<eos> And I got to slow it down so that Walter can get on the boat.<eos> You slow that thing down, the sharks will be all over him!<eos> And the torpedo wake is agitating them.
It's... it's in... In my rolodex.<eos> Can I go to my desk, please?<eos> Here.<eos> When does the next shipment go out?<eos> Two weeks. What are they using them for?
It's still too small.<eos> I mean, we've met a couple of people over the past few months, but nobody right.<eos> Her students feel very safe at home.<eos> We'll be all right.<eos> We'll get every single one of them.
It's good.<eos> I mean...<eos> It's hard with this job, but... it's good.<eos> We'll figure out Pasha.<eos> We can get them there.
From Dyatkovo.<eos> I betrayed my country.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> I betrayed my people.<eos> Friends, neighbors-- I killed them all.
We don't have the first idea where to look.<eos> Let's start near the shore.<eos> There were several beach-themed paintings at Ryan Decker's home.<eos> They were stylistically bland, but, I think they were created by the same hand.<eos> You think Decker painted them himself.
Well, so, who do you hang out with?<eos> The guys who play Astroline Rebellion, the greatest computer game of all time.<eos> So, kids at your school play that?<eos> No.<eos> I've never met them in person.
Should we make a baby?<eos> Heck yeah!<eos> It's our biological imperative.<eos> Hey, let's call our parents and discuss our options.<eos> Or we could just walk over there, because we love them so much, we live right down the street.
So, first of all, I just have to tell you that I absolutely loved the first 60 pages of Before the Storm.<eos> - Max, thank you so much.<eos> - Loved it.<eos> It's my first stab at a more mainstream thing.<eos> I know I'm very fortunate and blessed, the critics love my books. I just want someone to read them.
Yes.<eos> What is the big deal?<eos> I buy beds for people every day.<eos> Yeah, with their money, not ours.<eos> I know you love your college friends, but when you see them, you all become bitches, all the sniping and showing off.
He's dead.<eos> We think the man who killed him came here with some evidence we're searching for.<eos> What kind of evidence?<eos> Millions of dollars in cash.<eos> We raise horses here and train them, we're not hiding any money.
It makes a lot of sense.<eos> We have a few things to go over, and I have something for you to sign.<eos> Des, the contract?<eos> Des?<eos> These friends of yours... have you known them for a long time?
Mount Pleasant-- is that, like, upstate or something?<eos> I just moved here from Pittsburgh, so...<eos> Cut the crap, okay?<eos> We know you ran away from two members of the Mount Pleasant Citizens Patrol last night.<eos> You led them through the woods to the Metro North station on the other side.
Department of Homeland Security does like its secrets.<eos> Hold on. Someone drove a tanker truck into Mount Pleasant and dumped God only knows how many thousands of gallons of a bioweapon into New York City's drinking water, and you're gonna keep the NYPD in the dark?<eos> For the time being, yes, I am.<eos> The usual suspects?<eos> Already moved off them, actually.
Cece needs a bunch of different guys, so don't judge a book by its cover.<eos> Except when you're talking about models.<eos> Models exist to be on covers.<eos> I think that's an oversimplification.<eos> I think the best models have something to give them a little personality.
Except when you're talking about models.<eos> Models exist to be on covers.<eos> I think that's an oversimplification.<eos> I think the best models have something to give them a little personality.<eos> Something, something that makes them stand apart.
You got no business here.<eos> And you do?<eos> New rule: if Mickey's not here, neither are you two.<eos> Well, I just came by to drop off flowers.<eos> Oh, well, I'll just make sure she gets them.
If that's what you want to think, then think it.<eos> I understand it must be hard for you to accept that the true heir to the great ragnar lothbrok should turn out to be a cripple and a reject.<eos> So this is what the grunting of the little pigs was all about.<eos> No, not there!<eos> Where shall I put them?
Where are they?<eos> Well, one fell to the pox and two with my cousin in Lyon. and Father Etienne takes care of the others.<eos> Father Etienne?<eos> Takes confession and gives money to those who aren't earning.<eos> And, if we have unwanted children, takes them off our hands and places them in a hospital for orphans and strays.
You know, I had a chance to taste the cupcakes in the back. And I'd like to reveal my winner with one last trick.<eos> Mmm, does that sound good to you guys?<eos> - Come on, guys! - Yeah!<eos> This is a cupcake-themed variation of three-card monte.<eos> I'll take the two final cupcakes and place cups on top of them.
All with these Librarians that happen to be in the center of it all.<eos> Yes, they protect the people.<eos> - From these artifacts?<eos> - It's why the Library exists.<eos> So magical items stay in the hands of the people who comprehend them.
These Librarians, they've never lied to you about anything?<eos> Never.<eos> Flynn Carsen always told you the truth?<eos> No secrets?<eos> These artifacts, they have never used any of them?
No, keep going.<eos> I've been studying them since I left the Titans.<eos> They're zealots, extremists.<eos> They'll sacrifice themselves without hesitation to get to you.<eos> So, the quicker we take them down, the better.
my big, beefy brain.<eos> Now if you will excuse me, I have to process...<eos> Aww, you got a little necklace for your glasses.<eos> I had to.<eos> I almost lost them last night during "Wheel."
Would you like some pastries?<eos> They're fresh from the oven.<eos> - My husband has already left for work.<eos> He'll normally eat two croissants in the morning.<eos> If I leave them round the house all day I'll eat them, I know I will.
So, we've got Goldberg's car passing into France through border control at ten o'clock last night.<eos> Which means that if he was shot in the early hours of the morning, he must have driven straight to Arpajon.<eos> It's a blue Renault, registration P3016, and we need to find it.<eos> The Belgian police say that the diamonds aren't at Goldberg's place, which means he must have come to Arpajon to sell them on.<eos> And as they weren't on Anderson when we picked him up, either Anderson hasn't got them or he has yet to shift them.
- If you would let ME finish!<eos> He was doing a runner, he tried to cheat justice by killing himself and he was keeping the body in his bloody car!<eos> We don't know if it was he who put it there.<eos> Somebody may have set him up.<eos> If he's guilty, he'll have Goldberg's diamonds somewhere and when he moves them, we will be watching.
And my old squad's throwing me a sendoff. I gotta go to that, but then... Why not?<eos> New Seattle mayor, Floyd Baracus, has declared a state of emergency in response to the spread of the Aleutian flu, a condition for which he says there is a vaccine, but no known cure.<eos> Big government to the rescue?<eos> I'm sure that'll work out fine.<eos> When none of the Johns brothers showed up to open Wham Bam's, I thought for sure we'd find them out here.
And there she goes.<eos> Mr. Stoneman. I have something to say to you.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> The children in this town have come a long way because of Elizabeth Thatcher.<eos> She has transformed them from sticky, uncivilized little hooligans into... Well... into little people who are, on occasion, quite tolerable to be around.
No!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> They're hijacking her memories.<eos> Infecting them like a virus.
- It's basic time science. - It's time science?<eos> Yeah, it's time science.<eos> You told me that you don't believe in watches or clocks, so I don't really think<eos> - this is a very valid argument.<eos> - No, I said I believe in watches, I just don't trust who sets them.
Yeah, but now I'm just like "eh."<eos> Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is and we can find a quiet path to the crib.<eos> It looks like a map from Dungeons Dragons. Mm.<eos> Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.<eos> Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.
I just saw all these texts between zombie teenagers...<eos> They're saying that Seattle's about to become their personal brain buffet.<eos> That zombies are tricking the CDC.<eos> Peyton, if they think they're still about to have all-you-can eat brains, even after the city gets vaccinated, they must know something we don't. Maybe they're...<eos> I don't know, stealing the vaccines, destroying them?
Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?<eos> Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.<eos> There's another solar farm, five levels above us.<eos> If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...<eos> Then the Cybermen will find them again.
She does "unboxings."<eos> Wh-What is... What the hell's "unboxing"?<eos> Maybe you should look it up. Oh...<eos> Oh, touché, Nellasaurus.<eos> So she orders clothes and shoes to her house, and when they arrive, she takes them out of the box, films herself talking about the clothes and the shoes.
We're soldiers doing the Lord's work here on Earth. Bringing forth God's master plan.<eos> Revelation 14:13.<eos> "And I heard a voice "from heaven say unto me, Write,<eos> Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth."<eos> "Yea, saith the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labours; "and that their works do follow them."
I got her.<eos> Hey, stud.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> I sent them to see a movie-film.
He's accusing me of making overtures to influence Ohio state senators.<eos> When I did that NFL thing in Ohio, I also took some legislators out to dinner.<eos> Applebee's.<eos> That's where they wanted to go.<eos> I unduly influenced them with potato skins and hot wings.
Who the hell ever said...<eos> "easy" and "right" were the same thing?<eos> Look, I'm not saying that I'm some sort of hero or anything.<eos> I've killed several men.<eos> But the thing is that I see them every time I close my eyes.
No.<eos> I mean... I guess there might be one or two tiny things.<eos> Okay.<eos> Like what?<eos> Um... like the dishes and the not-timely washing of them.
There is no pee smell in my house.<eos> I know you don't smell it, but I can, Mother, and other people can, too.<eos> - Well, that's very...<eos> - Let's get these Wee Wee pads.<eos> We don't need wee wee, she's got them.
We don't need wee wee, she's got them.<eos> Honey, those Wee Wee pads should be thrown out.<eos> No, those are the ones she knows to use.<eos> - Ugh. They smell...<eos> - That's why she uses them.
- Me, too.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now, how are we going to get out of the Revolutionary War reenactment?<eos> Oh, Stan cashed in a ton of marriage points.<eos> We call them chips. Uh-huh.
We signed up 25 new people for panda paintings.<eos> Brings the total up to 221.<eos> That's a lot of painting.<eos> What do I care?<eos> We'll just pick them up from the painting people.
Greg!<eos> Did you find that distilled water?<eos> You know that my humidifier's empty!<eos> Why doesn't she ever call you?<eos> Just so you know... if you ever leave me, you're the one who's taking the kids and I'm the one who's seeing them on the weekends.
Oh! Look!<eos> Now your horses came to visit.<eos> No.<eos> Anna-Kat, why don't you tell Mommy what you told me?<eos> I moved them in here because I'll be sleeping in your bed forever.
Last time I overlook that you might be gross?<eos> Okay, please stop narrating all my last things.<eos> There is so much stuff in here.<eos> What's with all these notes from your mom?<eos> She put one in my lunch every day like a crazy lady, - and I just chuck them in here.
We want to believe that we're the best moms for out kids.<eos> It's terrifying when it seems like someone else is better.<eos> You know, I think we need to give each other and ourselves a break.<eos> It's like, we have the same problems, right?<eos> We just come at them from different angles.
Uh, hello, moms.<eos> Kenneth, did you give our disabled children weapons so they could fight each other and you could film it?<eos> No, I'm the good guy!<eos> This is an inclusivity thing.<eos> I empowered them to battle.
Kenneth, did you give our disabled children weapons so they could fight each other and you could film it?<eos> No, I'm the good guy!<eos> This is an inclusivity thing.<eos> I empowered them to battle.<eos> Some of them I blindfolded, and some I...
Please don't think less of me.<eos> Old paintings?<eos> Jessica, let's just get out of here.<eos> I don't have a good feeling about this.<eos> I painted them.
Mm. Sorry, guys.<eos> Big day at work...<eos> Getting a delivery of three dozen racks of ribs.<eos> That's 468 individual ribs.<eos> Well, I already fed the boys breakfast. I got them off to school. Now I just have to clean up the house, do laundry, pick up the dry-cleaning, hit the library, and then try on my wedding dress.
So someone can go to private school.<eos> I can't wait to introduce you to my khakis.<eos> We'll have to divide these since we're getting our own rooms.<eos> How 'bout you take the herbivores and I'll take the carnivores?<eos> Or we divide them by geologic time period.
And, again, thank you for coming to us.<eos> And know that our door is always open.<eos> Our parents just apologized to us from their hearts.<eos> Do you know what this means?<eos> We have them at our mercy.
We were just in the pool.<eos> It was fun.<eos> Really?<eos> Where are your bathing suits?<eos> We dried them in the dryer.
It was fun.<eos> Really?<eos> Where are your bathing suits?<eos> We dried them in the dryer.<eos> And then we put them away in the... d-drawer.
Yeah, I did it when I was having the Bentley detailed.<eos> Let's see what else we're getting.<eos> Hey-o. Yeah.<eos> We're getting all the channels.<eos> Well, I don't know why. I certainly didn't order them.
Boo, Europe.<eos> Hey, you found your chair. Where was it?<eos> Outside, covered in your bras.<eos> Ooh, yeah, sorry.<eos> I read in some magazine that you can revive the stretch by drying them in sunlight.
I was helping him apply for a commission.<eos> We sent off his application to Officer Candidate School a few weeks before he went missing.<eos> In that time together, did he ever mention having any issues with anyone?<eos> Only with Baxter, but... so did everyone.<eos> Collins was the type of person to fix problems, not the kind to start them.
Your college roommate,<eos> Clint, was shocked when he saw the virus you both created was back online.<eos> You took him to your lab, where you froze him in your ice chamber.<eos> Cancer patients.<eos> I could put them into a state of hibernation.
They were madly in love, they... married, they even had two children, twins.<eos> But Monica and I... We began an affair.<eos> I didn't mean for it to end up the way it did!<eos> I was about to begin my doctorate, which probably would have led to a teaching post, a room of my own, very much like this one.<eos> But instead, I divorced my wife, took my babies away, to bring them up by myself, in the Brecon Beacons.
Party's over. Let me get my drink.<eos> Hello, Sebastian.<eos> I thought maybe we could... grab a drink together, clear the air.<eos> I'm feeling like I could use some friends tonight.<eos> Yeah, so you can destroy them later?
"it has to be this momentous video that's going to break "the silence of all these years," you know?<eos> And David said,<eos> "No, I want to do it, like, in your studio,<eos> "it'll be these figures - very simple, rough."<eos> These figures were something I was making fairly exclusively, and did a number of exhibitions of them, and David, of course, loved these figures, you know?
Oh Please stop, please.<eos> A whiff of compassion?<eos> Oh I order you to leave the kids.<eos> That's right But it's a rescue, ma'am.<eos> She had seized them.
People like to change air.<eos> More than he liked the Duke of Lerma.<eos> - And what does that mean?<eos> He was the king's trusted man.<eos> He convinced Felipe III to transfer the court to Valladolid Where he had many lands And sold them in gold.
More than one.<eos> Come here.<eos> Is that your way of thanking me for bringing the tools? - It's a start.<eos> - Mm.<eos> Thought you had them, by the way.
She talk to you?<eos> Girl, will you stop it and get on in this house?<eos> Lord, I'm just glad my kids weren't here.<eos> Where are they? Uh, Johnny got them.<eos> He said he's bringing them back later.
- Exactly. I think Emilio went out after the party that night and finally got himself into something that he couldn't get out of.<eos> Right, okay, shouldn't you be talking to Annalise?<eos> Nope. I am tagging you in, my man.<eos> It's time to show you where the real juice is.<eos> Rosie, I make my reports, and I hand them off.
Oh, let's leave him in the dark as long as possible.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's trash day.<eos> Heather's bins aren't out.<eos> Most people put them out the night before.
And he lost his grip and grazed his little boobies on the pavement, didn't you?<eos> Didn't you?<eos> - Will you stop it, please?<eos> Got some big man boots in London, have you?<eos> Now he's wearing them, but do they fit?
I hate not being able to read Altean.<eos> What is this stuff?<eos> Are you sure you're making food?<eos> You're gonna try and tell me that these aren't cookies?<eos> Okay, I might have overcooked them.
Keep going.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> - Did you get rid of those drugs?<eos> - Don't you worry about that.<eos> You didn't sell them on, did you?
Cassie sent me over to pick up some flowers for her shop?<eos> Yup. I have them all ready for you.<eos> Did Martha and Tom like the chocolates that you brought them?<eos> We didn't stick around long enough to see them get eaten.<eos> Unless, maybe, they threw them at each other.
He's only interested because the Philippines are involved, and he's obsessed with their new president, that Andrada guy.<eos> Like you aren't. Of course I am.<eos> He's a total genuine psycho.<eos> Okay, can we just go with "rough around the edges" for the sake of diplomacy? I'm sorry.<eos> Have you seen the videos he made during his campaign where he dressed up like his opponents and mocked them?
Like you aren't. Of course I am.<eos> He's a total genuine psycho.<eos> Okay, can we just go with "rough around the edges" for the sake of diplomacy? I'm sorry.<eos> Have you seen the videos he made during his campaign where he dressed up like his opponents and mocked them?<eos> And challenged them to kickboxing matches in kickboxing gear.
Your Majesty, you misunderstand.<eos> They're on holiday.<eos> I'm tending the animals until they get back.<eos> Look at how terrified you are.<eos> Has someone taken them?
- It doesn't make sense.<eos> Why does Shepherd care about me so much?<eos> Shepherd doesn't care about you.<eos> Or anyone. Look at her own children.<eos> She loved them, and she tried to kill them.
"Our mother, Edith Kananack," "took $200 million" "from innocent, hard-working Americans..."<eos> These videos were posted together with instructions from the kidnappers.<eos> It's a prisoner's dilemma.<eos> The first parent to pay the ransom gets their kids back.<eos> And the other one gets to watch them die.
The most ironic thing is that the postings were true, because Belfort and others from Stratton Oakmont pled guilty to manipulating that particular security.<eos> And who chased Belfort?<eos> Well, that would be me.<eos> One of the theories we have is that Backpage is, in fact, in a conspiracy with the pimps, that the posting rules are not designed to prevent or to stop human sex trafficking, but in fact, are designed to be a guide to pimps<eos> to allow them to design an ad which helps them evade law enforcement.
Tampa.<eos> Stop using that voice.<eos> - So, Teddy...<eos> - Uh-huh?<eos> I thought your gloves were brilliant... and I entered them into the contest.
No, I meant listening to that conversation.<eos> The gloves are cool though.<eos> Can I have those?<eos> Yeah, I mean, you... you gonna use 'em to, like, fight crime and stuff?<eos> No, I'm gonna use them to make popcorn.
The gloves are cool though.<eos> Can I have those?<eos> Yeah, I mean, you... you gonna use 'em to, like, fight crime and stuff?<eos> No, I'm gonna use them to make popcorn.<eos> Of course I'm gonna use them to fight crime, you dink.
13, 14?<eos> 15.<eos> And where do your adoptive parents think you are right now?<eos> Well, I have no idea.<eos> I haven't seen them in over a year.
It was the day after Christmas-- the Brits and Canadians call it Boxing Day.<eos> We'd been in the tribal regions for months brokering deals with the Hazaras, the Hezb-e-Islami, the Tajiks, you name it.<eos> And we were this... close to getting Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour on board when we ran into some local heroes.<eos> Nothing we couldn't handle.<eos> Except they had some Americans helping them.
Oh, you have that much faith in the voters in Tennessee and Ohio?<eos> They're going to choose you.<eos> All right.<eos> Set up a meeting.<eos> I'll hear them all out.
McGee and I were able to hack the last three burner phones.<eos> Means we can track their locations.<eos> Yeah, well, we can do better than that.<eos> We're gonna draw the buyers to us.<eos> Send them text messages, pretending to be the seller, then sweep them up-- classic false flag operation.
Mental health history.<eos> Don't go there.<eos> We now have to figure out how to play social services.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And if you contradict them, you'll make it worse.
Lieutenant Tamsin Dale's actions make me sick to my stomach.<eos> The arrogance. The selfishness. The carelessness.<eos> This is a young woman who had so much promise. And she threw it away because she thought her opinions were more important than the rules. That her humanity trumped her duty.<eos> But... to remain the greatest force for good this nation has ever known, the Army must study its mistakes.<eos> And if we hide our mistakes and punish the people who expose them, we won't.
Aww, thank you.<eos> Can you believe this weather?<eos> I mean, it's like the sun gave me a hug.<eos> (chuckles) You hate hugs.<eos> Well, depends on who's giving them.
_<eos> Sorry. Bad habit I've developed recently.<eos> Harley killed two more Fillmore-Graves soldiers yesterday.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Lured them into a minefield.
They're goin' back.<eos> BOTH:<eos> No!<eos> (whispering) If we let him take 'em back, they'll be gone forever.<eos> But if we make sure they get to Gabi, we can borrow them, keep them for a long time, and she'll forget she ever owned them, and ipso fatso, we'll own them!
He's ungodly smart. He's got a much broader intellect than I do, and he's magnificent at being able to condense important ideas into just a very few words.<eos> If you're not interested in the economic scene right now, you're mentally dead.<eos> Charlie has no tact.<eos> All right, let's talk a little bit about bankers.<eos> Charlie, on Friday, compared them to heroin addicts.
_ Feeling okay? You care so much now.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Of course I care.<eos> Is that why you called the foster care people on me?<eos> I called them, Ariel, because you are 13 and you need a home.
And not 20 feet away, there are 2 unused beds.<eos> What the hell is wrong with me?<eos> Am I that afraid of those memories?<eos> Maybe it's not the memories you're afraid of.<eos> Maybe it's... replacing them... with something new, because that might be a betrayal.
to be exact.<eos> Which means that generations lived and died. Without ever seeing a championship.<eos> Can you imagine what that does to your psyche? Hmm.<eos> But that city and all those fans...<eos> You know what kept them going?
You know, their reflexes slow down, they get this thing with their thumbs where it locks from doing the same motion over and over and over.<eos> Stenosing tenosynovitis.<eos> It's a repetitive stress injury.<eos> That's what O.G. got, so he switched from playing tournaments to streaming.<eos> He also worked as a scout and an agent, so he would find the best new players and then help them negotiate their deals with the corporate teams.
We're innocent.<eos> And we have files in this house to prove it. I knew it!<eos> I told you guys!<eos> Look, I tried to tell them, - but they're just a bunch of stupid idiots.<eos> - Hey, Chip, how do you think the police found them?
- Well... - Brett, what's going on?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I am batting about a zero with men lately.<eos> Good men, bad men, all men.<eos> I'm either pushing them away, or they're pushing me, and then I look at you, and I think,
I know I would.<eos> So you question a guy that I brought in and vouched for instead of working a case that killed two people?<eos> I can do both at the same time. Trust me.<eos> Dan Llewellyn stood up for a few gay teens a week and a half ago...<eos> Punched a grown bully who was threatening them. Harlan Betts.
Careful!<eos> Come on, you lummox.<eos> It was just strip lighting at first back in '03, but I now supply panel lights, under-unit stuff, LEDs all over Asia!<eos> I am all about the Asian market these days, J!<eos> I just source tech gizmos and bring them back to Europe.
This condo's being built on an old school.<eos> - Anything original still left?<eos> - A few nooks and crannies.<eos> Demons... they do exist.<eos> And now I kill them.
I know, I know. Palmer's inside it!<eos> A couple of cartel guys dressed like EMTs grabbed her, and they're taking her to who knows where.<eos> Hey.<eos> They kidnapped Palmer.<eos> We got eyes on them.
Yeah, no. Please.<eos> Yeah, it's a free country.<eos> I mean, sort of.<eos> I have small children.<eos> Sometimes, I bring them with me.
It's not like there's a book out there on how not to raise your biological children.<eos> What if we're not supposed to?<eos> I mean...<eos> I know we share the same you know, biology or whatever, but<eos> I mean, we don't know them.
I don't think I can get you reimbursed for that. I know, I know.<eos> You think that...<eos> You think this guy made all these?<eos> Nah, I doubt it.<eos> See, these guys share their movies, they pass them around on drives to avoid being traced online.
My behavior was inexcusable.<eos> The past has a way of catching up to you, doesn't it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's just something about this case that I just personalized.<eos> I was supposed to state the facts, as I knew them.
Boss needs these reports clean. No typos.<eos> Cole wouldn't be happy, fc.<eos> Excessive soldering.<eos> This is the original letter.<eos> Look, he punched Right through the paper, Not just crossing out his Mistakes... obliterating them.
The FBI hasn't even shown it to her family yet.<eos> Well, the family was threatening to sue the FBI over not paying Lara's ransom, so I'm not surprised they're being careful.<eos> I remember you were a, uh, liaison to the parents during the negotiation.<eos> Right, of course.<eos> I'll call them right away.
A canvas on which we can paint our hopes and dreams?<eos> It's a smart board.<eos> It's a roster with each position to be filled by the names and faces of our collaborators.<eos> Each time information from the cache is accessed, it gives us a unique opportunity to identify one or more of these faces.<eos> When we find every single one of them, we'll bring them down, once and for all.
That didn't come up in any of our research.<eos> Well, of course it didn't.<eos> It was a best kept secret at the firm.<eos> When he was on his meds, he was one of the finest legal minds on the planet.<eos> When he was off them... well, let's just say he was prone to outbursts.
Obviously, they liked their original plan, because a bomb went off two days ago.<eos> Couple of hours later, I got an e-mail from Alberto.<eos> A big one.<eos> He sent you the files.<eos> And I sent them to Gephardt.
You said we should dig into the files to see if they could help us figure out Gephardt's next move, but he's made his next move: put the files online.<eos> Do you really think he's finished?<eos> I don't know if he's finished.<eos> - Are the files really the best way to find him?<eos> He gave them to literally everyone.
That's great.<eos> Well, the reason why I had to see you is I need you to sign our divorce papers.<eos> Wh... am I hallucinating right now?<eos> I thought I signed 'em, like, eight years ago.<eos> Well, I-I didn't countersign them exactly.
Human anatomy was my Waterloo.<eos> The cadavers...<eos> Yes, gruesome.<eos> No.<eos> I found them compelling.
I've seen seven children through their elementary years.<eos> Some of them siblings, of course.<eos> What do you feel toward them now?<eos> Pride, mostly.<eos> You want to know if I love them?
- Okay, I...<eos> I just, I know... I know how hard this job can be when there's a lot of other life stuff going on.<eos> And Dr. Sun has...<eos> I don't need to see Dr. Sun.<eos> Like I said before, talking about your problems doesn't solve them.
Every three months, the kids will change.<eos> But won't that confuse them?<eos> No.<eos> If anything, it'll reinforce name recognition.<eos> And I'll make little removable decals that'll make it easy for them to switch around.
You two head down, I will help Toby pack up.<eos> 'Cause that is what a good man would do. Some would say, "best man."<eos> Just start packing the manuals.<eos> We'll need to track the gears' heat coefficients once the turbine is turned on.<eos> I will call out the readings, you can jot them down?
If I can study it, somehow isolate the hormones responsible, this embryo could pave the way to reversing the effects of the TXgas.<eos> You really playing the "we have to save the world" card again?<eos> This could be the key to solving human sterilization. We cannot leave it behind.<eos> Sounds like the storm's moving and we got to work fast.<eos> I'll lure them to the backyard.
I had an ex who wore a mouth guard to bed.<eos> - She left that shit everywhere.<eos> - Eww.<eos> Yeah, no, my problem is more clothes.<eos> Just leaves them around for me to find like little sweaty prizes.
Went right past the home of a man being investigated by NCIS.<eos> So, we good?<eos> Well, we didn't even get to the part where you drew firearms on us.<eos> Oh, they were permitted.<eos> A.J., I think these jokers forget that the last time you saw them, you saved their hides.
Well, coordinate with the FBI.<eos> I want you in charge of the surveillance.<eos> You do realize that if Tahir doesn't feel completely safe, he's never gonna reveal Michelle's location.<eos> I... understand... the dilemma.<eos> You tell the children... I love them with every fiber of my being.
I want you in charge of the surveillance.<eos> You do realize that if Tahir doesn't feel completely safe, he's never gonna reveal Michelle's location.<eos> I... understand... the dilemma.<eos> You tell the children... I love them with every fiber of my being.<eos> You're gonna tell them yourself when you see them.
You hang down, stick the landing.<eos> We're really gonna need a new system to avoid your kids. Yeah.<eos> Or you meet 'em.<eos> At worst, I'd break an ankle.<eos> Okay, listen, the truth is I want you to meet them.
He's on to us!<eos> Kick him in the nuts and run!<eos> Me?<eos> Scared of kids?<eos> I don't even hide when people bring them in here anymore.
Legs together.<eos> You know, we could be home watching the game right now, but, no, you had to go and make a big stink about this.<eos> Hey, I'm just trying to be a good son.<eos> I mean, look at this one.<eos> He keeps licking tongue depressors and putting them back.
The horses are approaching the starting gate.<eos> They're all in line...<eos> And they're off!<eos> But it's Blanco de Invierno who rushes and takes the early lead.<eos> Blanco de Invierno leads them into the Clubhouse turn.
No, Epi, no...<eos> When my parents were short one time too many...<eos> He hanged my mother and my father...<eos> From this tree.<eos> I found them like that.
We've been tracking some stolen military equipment.<eos> Sniper rifles and AT4s mostly.<eos> Also quite a few M16s.<eos> Though I hear they're temperamental.<eos> These rebel groups aren't too picky, - and we know who armed them.
Our team managed to cure the animals, but at a terrible cost.<eos> In an attempt to return the planet to the animals, a secretive group called the Shepherds released a gas that sterilized all of humanity.<eos> And then lab-made creatures called hybrids devastated the West Coast.<eos> So a massive barrier was constructed, to protect the rest of North America, but new breeds have started to appear, so we reassembled our team.<eos> We battle on many fronts, searching for a cure to sterility while racing to stop the hybrids and a brutal terrorist who is using them to end the human race.
It's gonna take more than friends to get you out of this one, Jamie.<eos> We have your prints on the door handle, on Leanne's tablet, and on Leanne's body.<eos> And your confession at the scene.<eos> I want to speak to my attorney.<eos> Have you called them?
We weren't together.<eos> I think we need to be together when they die.<eos> Sending you her stupid research and video was the long way round, but... it worked.<eos> Someone's sending me things.<eos> These messages that you've been getting -- you know who sent them, don't you?
- I'm such a shit, Wynonna.<eos> People used to make fun of you when you talked about what happened to Willa.<eos> I was too chicken to say it, but I believed you.<eos> Demons, they do exist.<eos> - And now I kill them. - Come on.
Put some ice and some Jim Beam in there, too.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> - What's Heather doing here?<eos> - Oh, uh... she left some presents here for her nephew.<eos> Uh, so he wouldn't find them.
So, it's up to us to figure out what it is before they get it.<eos> This supposed spill appears to be the next in the ever-growing line of well-crafted fake news...<eos> A viral lie that's cleared out an entire town, spreading fear amongst thousands who can't return to their homes until every water source is tested for contamination, despite EPA and FEMA saying there's no sign of a spill.<eos> Yeah, a story like this is the handiwork of a vast and organized web brigade, also known as "trolls."<eos> Trace the elements, see how it went viral, and find the trolls responsible so they can tell us who put them up to it.
Then what am I remembering?<eos> M-Maybe you had a sexy dream.<eos> Gross.<eos> No, it's very normal for adults.<eos> Happy has them about me all the time.
- We clear?<eos> - Copy.<eos> You want us to grab them after they spike the drinks? No.<eos> We're gonna wait for them to cross the line of consent first.<eos> Till that happens, we just keep eyes on them.
Hey, I haven't seen you in forever.<eos> What are you doing? I'm not Jill.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> I'm a police officer.<eos> Those guys you're talking to... you don't want to know them.
- Tried, but her phone's off.<eos> We're running a trace on it now.<eos> How do six kids and their foster mom just vanish like ghosts?<eos> Amber said the devil was after her and now they're gone. Maybe he was after all of them.<eos> Or maybe he's already found them.
Since the analysis of the medicine came back with nothing we could identify, I decided to take a look at the capsule itself.<eos> How does that help us find the kids?<eos> Only four pharmaceutical companies carry this specific capsule.<eos> We pulled employee records with photos and showed them to Eli.<eos> Meet Dr. S., the one Eli said was checking in on them.
I lost a battle so you could win the war.<eos> I'll drink to that.<eos> My people just sent this.<eos> The accounts where Sandstorm are holding their funds.<eos> You cut them off from their money, you back them into a corner, maybe force them to make a mistake.
Huh? Take it!<eos> Take it!<eos> - Oh! - Don't touch them!<eos> If Thanos hid these artifacts, they must be incredibly dangerous.<eos> Yeah? And I'm gonna make them dangerous to Nebula!
Our ship cannot maintain orbit!<eos> Mantis, Ebony Maw, I believe you should surrender.<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm reading life signs, but they ain't responding to our hails.<eos> Eh, they can sit tight till Nova Corps digs them out.
My cousins.<eos> Yeah, they need a bob or two so they like to help out, you know.<eos> - Both got kids, sure you saw...<eos> - Have you got kids?<eos> No, can't afford them.
Settle down.<eos> Don't fucking take that.<eos> Gimme that back!<eos> I've got kids, you know? !<eos> How am I meant to feed them now?
Mama.<eos> Mama.<eos> Well, hey there, sugar.<eos> I... I brought you some chocolates with coconut.<eos> My chef made them this morning.
No, he's good.<eos> I'll hit that turtle, though.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Boys from Georgia got some good shit right there.<eos> I remember you liked crab cakes, so I grabbed some before the Confederate Army - ate them all.
Five days, that man melted to death.<eos> What happened to the brother in Dallas?<eos> "Where was the secret serum?" is what we all said.<eos> I remember in the beginning of Ebola, there were two American doctors that got sick in Africa.<eos> They flew them in a private jet straight to Atlanta, to the CDC.
Werner would be deeply grateful.<eos> And so, my enemy would become my friend.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Hans was taken by the Taddicken brothers. Known around the world for their savagery.<eos> Yes. That's why Raymond chose them.
I will pee in a cup.<eos> I will do whatever it takes.<eos> My only concern, Ms. Nagel, is the welfare of your child and the environment she'd be returning to.<eos> I was never addicted, you know? I was shot.<eos> The hospital gave me painkillers. - I took them.
They use dirt bikes as getaway vehicles, easily cutting through traffic, which is how they've eluded responding patrol cars.<eos> All right, I talked to an ex-burglar C.I. buddy of mine.<eos> He said the cell jammer came from Bucktown.<eos> This is Jimmy Rickert. Old-school tech guy.<eos> He illegally imports cell jammers from China into the US and sells them through his electronics business to burglars.
Either you're with me or you're with Bunny.<eos> Hank, she said, "There's something bigger going on here."<eos> She wouldn't say what.<eos> Her boyfriend stole 40,000 painkillers.<eos> They're missing, and I think she's got them.
All right, Aidan.<eos> I want you to tuck in on Laurie's side right there.<eos> We're gonna slide these two pieces underneath her until we feel the middle connect.<eos> Really slow, really gently.<eos> Then we're gonna take these head rolls. We're gonna put them on either side of her neck.
Why would you go out of your way to make sure Natalie knew about a diagnosis she couldn't possibly have done anything about?<eos> I told you.<eos> She made a mistake.<eos> And you know what?<eos> Anyone who refuses to learn from their mistakes is gonna repeat them.
Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> All right, everyone.<eos> I know this isn't your first time, but we have no room for error here.<eos> We have passengers boarding planes who don't know their own phones are gonna turn them into hijackers.
Oh, here comes the UPS guy.<eos> Oh, I bet he's delivering those marmalade jars we ordered.<eos> Doesn't that feel like a million years ago?<eos> Yeah, we don't need those anymore.<eos> Sorry, just send them back.
Good, he's been reading the book.<eos> Uh, Dad, you're reading the paper upside down.<eos> Wrong again, idiot.<eos> Chris, what are you doing with Isabella's babies?<eos> And why are you holding them that way?
Anyway, we got to call Child Services.<eos> Lois, if you do that, Chris will resent you for the rest of his life.<eos> Then what do you suggest we do?<eos> I say you let him try.<eos> Trust me, one day of watching those kids, and he'll want them out of here.
What in the Mind of Mencia are you doing here?<eos> My babies!<eos> Isabella, I missed you so much.<eos> Ay, Chris, I missed you, too.<eos> Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be separated from your children, so we've brought them to you.
- Oh, sorry, oh, sorry. Oh, sorry.<eos> Okay...<eos> - If you could just pull that off.<eos> - Oh, yeah. Okay.<eos> Where are we gonna put them?
Walter.<eos> Walt?<eos> Walter, what's happening? Ralph is going after Toby's oil drums.<eos> Now, the steel drums contain chromium, which is magnetic.<eos> Ralph's gonna use them in place of the spire.
Jill Weber, this is Jerry Saltz, esteemed Art Critic for New York Magazine and Lena Dunham's godfather.<eos> Jerry has a few questions for you.<eos> So your photographs are a sublimation of the male gaze or payback for cat calls for men in uniform over a lifetime?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> So you're stripping them naked to kind of further humiliate them or to exploit your power over them?
13 Reasons Why was a really special story to me, especially when I read it for the first time when I was 14 because people were just really mean in middle school.<eos> And it really did change my perspective on how to treat people, because you really don't know what other people are going through.<eos> [Luke] High school can be a tough environment for an individual to grow and to come in their own.<eos> [Langford] One of the big differences about 13 Reasons is that we're treating the audience like young adults, not as teenagers.<eos> We're treating them as people.
But it's so important that the show really depicts that it's not so clear and so obvious.<eos> He's a popular guy, he's an athlete, and that it's so common for a victim to feel like, "No one would ever believe me."<eos> Bryces exist.<eos> They exist on every single campus, and in every facet... of life, and I think there's an immense amount of misinformation for young men around what consent even is.<eos> That's the disconnect in how we're poorly educating men and young women, and how we're failing them, because we're not educating them on what real consent actually looks like.
Would you?<eos> You're the greatest man I know one thing about!<eos> Look at all those voters.<eos> What is our current position on dogs?<eos> We currently have a city employee who rounds them up and puts them to sleep. What?
Grampa, I called to make sure the kids are okay.<eos> They're not okay!<eos> The boy's got sass, and the girl thinks she's Queen of the May.<eos> You leave 'em with me and I'll straighten 'em out!<eos> I did leave them with you.
But where are we?<eos> We're dead.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I'm guessing we're still asleep on the boat.<eos> I think she entered our nightmares and mashed them up in order to communicate with us.
I would have gone with pantagruel.<eos> Oh, and the next time you put your hands on me, you better kill me.<eos> Oh, I think that goes without saying.<eos> - Look, her brother... - Ugh! - shut up...<eos> - Must've brought the cops, and then they double-crossed him and stole the ransom. So I chased them, but then Figgis shot out my tire, and...
Don't worry.<eos> I won't tell.<eos> Happy birthday, Vera.<eos> Why don't you like birthdays?<eos> Ahh, my mother always made a point of forgetting them.
We can't call for backup.<eos> Yeah, we wait, and we could lose them again.<eos> Watch my back. I'm going in.<eos> Okay, now, how did you do that?<eos> So you click the items, and then you release them by pressing L.
Our team managed to cure the animals, but at a terrible cost.<eos> In an attempt to return the planet to the animals, a secretive group called the Shepherds released a gas that sterilized all of humanity.<eos> And then, labmade creatures called "hybrids"<eos> devastated the West Coast, so a massive barrier was constructed to protect the rest of North America, but new breeds have started to appear, so we reassembled our team.<eos> We battle on many fronts, searching for a cure to sterility while racing to stop the hybridsand the rogue Shepherd who created them to end the human race.
We didn't go outside.<eos> They gave us candy.<eos> We played games.<eos> - Like sports?<eos> The teacher called them "guessing games."
No.<eos> No.<eos> No, the Latvian route is defunct, which is... fine.<eos> I-I've many other resources.<eos> No, you should've received those funds. We sent them over 24 hours ago.
Odin's on the ceiling?<eos> Aah! Try upstairs, genius.<eos> He won't appreciate being roused.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, old people get cranky when you wake them up from their naps.
While respecting his anonymity, we need to find out the kind of rope Leighton Thomas uses.<eos> Yeah, I should've mentioned,<eos> Leighton Thomas brought in his ticket stubs for last Tuesday.<eos> He took out tours at 11:00 a.m., 12:00, and 1:00.<eos> So I've I photocopied them.
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Forensic proof we are hunting a serial killer.<eos> These bastards don't stop.<eos> We stop them.
Crafty. Didn't think about blocking Jessica's number.<eos> We have a Mitzi Vandermark situation.<eos> Wait a second. When I left yesterday, everybody was happy.<eos> Those capri pants I made were perfect.<eos> Well, today she tried them on and freaked.
We got these from Nanette Vlasik's lawyer.<eos> A contract between Chief Vlasik and your production company for her to participate on a game show?<eos> Uh, Moving Targets isn't a game show, it's a competition reality series.<eos> The term "reality television" is practically Orwellian, isn't it?<eos> I mean, you take would-be actors, you put them in manufactured situations and then you carefully shape a narrative from hundreds of hours of footage, all to create such groundbreaking fare as Lil' Catwalk,
Yeah.<eos> It does.<eos> Because Acosta was not the only detective who came bearing gifts.<eos> So Marcus brought these over.<eos> He got them from Phil Righetti, who got them from his money launderer, who says they're copies of everything Nanette Vlasik asked him for.

Prelim RepExchange report.<eos> Well, if it's not referring to Richard, then who?<eos> You want a list of Darren Faulkes's enemies?<eos> - Give me the phone book.<eos> - OK. Look, the success of this entire operation depends on us being as hard as them.
Or rather, keeping up with the Folsoms, Bonzi Folsom.<eos> He had the very same model in his apartment.<eos> I noticed it tucked under his desk. Didn't quite fit with the rest of his aesthetic.<eos> Every day, Mr. Folsom uses his Enigma machine to encrypt messages he wants to send to his SBK brethren.<eos> He then takes the ensuing codes and disguises them as filenames on his social media feed.
You think they're the ones who help the gang launder their cash? Unlikely.<eos> By the time they show up on Bonzi's social media feed, these individuals were already dead.<eos> Most of the killings were run-of-the-mill street crimes, never solved.<eos> A carjacking, a couple of robberies.<eos> The messages we found make reference to them as examples.
It was a promotional item that they gave out at a launch party for a new tequila called Plata Fuego.<eos> The event took place at a Chelsea club the same night that Carol Logan was murdered.<eos> That's the only place you could've gotten that shot glass.<eos> Last time Carol was seen alive, she was having dinner with friends.<eos> They said she told them she was going straight home, but you think she lied, ditched them and went out dancing?
Company was using an unregulated well.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Flint right here in Texas.<eos> Those lead lines? Yeah.<eos> Found them on his coworker.
- Bruce: I've seen it on TV.<eos> We could try, at least.<eos> Okay. Hey, guys!<eos> Why don't we just think of the pirates as our new heavily-armed neighbors...<eos> If we leave them alone, they will leave us alone.
You don't understand.<eos> Amber, she knows it were wrong.<eos> But Ruby, she'll never talk to you.<eos> Still thinks them blokes were friends.<eos> If she sees them in the street, she... She waves.
Then he gets out of prison, and all of a sudden, he's all ambitious.<eos> He moves up, starts getting face time with top guys.<eos> Me and Bonzi, we wouldn't let any of our people take their phones into meetings.<eos> Couldn't risk any conversations getting recorded.<eos> They'd turn them over at the door.
Nobody wants an unstable neighbor.<eos> We've identified the culprits.<eos> - We'll lock them up immediately.<eos> - That won't solve anything.<eos> Mr. President, as you already know, there's a war going on between drug cartels, and I guarantee you a jail cell will not stop them.
Because I know that you, against school policy, used artificial food coloring in Amelia's birthday cupcakes even though you said they were from Whole Foods.<eos> First of all, I don't think those are comparable secrets.<eos> But, I would like to say that I don't agree with the school's communist policy when it comes to birthday treats.<eos> Sarah is not allergic to artificial colors.<eos> Her mom just doesn't want her to have them, and then the rest of us have to suffer!
How could Tom have this memory?<eos> Just you and me, arguing on the floor, of a secret NSA facility?<eos> That's exactly what I'm getting at.<eos> By stitching into Tom, we must've opened up a pathway into his empath abilities.<eos> So, instead of objectively seeing his memories, I'm experiencing them through a filter of... my emotional state.
Date of capture... 10 June 1972.<eos> Rosa Estrada, Desert Storm.<eos> Date of capture... 30 January 1991.<eos> Each one of these veterans were prisoners of war since Vietnam.<eos> And lessons they learned from your captivity, helped them survive their own captivity with honor.
What is this?<eos> "Remember, you have Alzheimer's."<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> I'm so sick of finding all these stupid notes in all my shit.<eos> When I find the guy that's putting them there...
Will we stay here?<eos> Until things quiet down.<eos> I don't trust those fucks.<eos> They're going after Chapo now, but then they'll come after us.<eos> They owe us, and I'm gonna make them pay.
She refused to take Cora in.<eos> Cora was lucky to have you.<eos> I wasn't much better than they were.<eos> There were signs.<eos> I ignored them.
You should leave now.<eos> No.<eos> You're leaving right now.<eos> Where are the Speakers?<eos> I've put them somewhere safe.
Five years ago, when we first met, that's what you said to me.<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> After what my father did, I told you I wasn't sure if it was okay if I wrote.<eos> "You love novels, right?<eos> Then just write them", you said.
Yes, it is.<eos> And I'm the mayor.<eos> Step one, be hella charming.<eos> Julia, did you know that, when Roald Amundsen trekked Antarctica, he would feed his weaker sled dogs to the stronger ones so they could travel more efficiently?<eos> He made them cannibalize each other.
Yeah, they really give an air of whimsy to your garage.<eos> As does those super necessary collection of fedoras.<eos> Don't touch those hats.<eos> I wasn't planning on touching those.<eos> I'm saving them for my New Year's Eve party, the theme is Prohibition.
Listen, it is a perk, because now you have a built-in baby sitter, okay?<eos> Who else loves your kids as much as the spouse you hate?<eos> [SCOFFS] Okay.<eos> - And by the way... - Hmm?<eos> He also is gonna take them for, like, a week or more in the summer.
I'm talking about her long life, the source of her immortality.<eos> She draws power from the dark dimension to stay alive.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I've seen the rituals.<eos> Worked them out.
Good. Really good.<eos> I'm working on some kind of next-level stuff.<eos> Case in point.<eos> What is this for?<eos> It catches ghosts and it transports them somewhere else. I don't know where, but I have a feeling it's Michigan.
Amanda Waller has a plan.<eos> Amanda? I wanna build a team of some very bad people who I think can do some good. Like fight the next war, defeat the next Superman.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> You're not putting those monsters back out on the street in our name.<eos> General, we run them covertly. Non-attributed. Strictly need to know.
How wonderful.<eos> We thought you'd just got all fat again.<eos> I'm now the Mary Magdalene of middle England.<eos> Have alienated Mom and Mark Darcy.<eos> Am like tropical female insect that shags men to impregnate self and eats them.
- Watch your step.<eos> - It goes down here. Back in the 1940s, Rustin Parr brought 8 kids up to his house in these woods.<eos> He killed 7 of them.<eos> But Parr claimed that he heard the voice of an old woman telling him to kill the children.<eos> He would take them up to his attic and make one stand in the corner while he killed the other one.
You're not my father. You weren't there.<eos> That wasn't my choice.<eos> I was there when you were little.<eos> Most kids play catch with their father.<eos> They don't go with them to a thong shoot.
It seemed bigger.<eos> It seemed like something soldiers would use, or maybe what they use for deer hunting...<eos> We don't know yet. We need to have the Irish cadets.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Jack loved them.
It seemed like something soldiers would use, or maybe what they use for deer hunting...<eos> We don't know yet. We need to have the Irish cadets.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Jack loved them.<eos> He saw them perform in Dublin last summer.
Make sure they make him look like himself.<eos> I know.<eos> Where are the children?<eos> They're with Maud.<eos> She's taken them to the house in Georgetown.
Sadness.<eos> Compassion.<eos> Desire, maybe.<eos> You're still a young woman, Mrs. Kennedy.<eos> I used to make them smile.
I always have.<eos> And yet, in the days after, directly after, something seemed to change.<eos> In what way?<eos> Before the funeral, the day you moved the casket to the Capitol, well, your children were on full display for the whole world to see.<eos> Well, what are you insinuating, that I exploited them?
It was never going to be you leading that squadron.<eos> That's not the way the world works.<eos> You know he's royalty.<eos> Bridges to office.<eos> You know the last thing I said to my parents was I hated them.
Chicken's dry.<eos> At least it's not dirty like the broccoli.<eos> You might want to cut that up for her.<eos> Those books have your name on them.<eos> I wrote them.
- Shh! It's nap time.<eos> I thought we could repaint the paintings.<eos> You're not serious!<eos> You hate them.<eos> You said that you hated them, so... No!
He'll end up in uniform, like every other mother's son.<eos> That is, if he ever had a mother.<eos> More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub, spawning spontaneously in the sawdust.<eos> You know, a lot of men are scared we won't go back into our boxes when this is all over.<eos> It makes them belligerent.
Let me tell you something.<eos> Dentists are for men what gynecologists are for women.<eos> Once you have them wide open and your hand is inside them... their sense of shame just drops away.<eos> You become trusted with their confidences.<eos> Sometimes, you send them home with a prescription that's a little more fun than what the problem requires.
Ho-ho-ho! Oh, Ernest, it's far too big.<eos> I'll make some nice loose covers.<eos> Came out of a posh hotel.<eos> A bargain! I've made a curtain for under the tank. It'll hide the pipes.<eos> I'll keep my outdoor clothes there. The pipes will dry them off.
The only thing I can think of is... I'd have to train him for free.<eos> That's not a bad idea.<eos> Cholo.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thirty-one flavors and I got them all!
Close of the day, Washoe was trading at 4 cents a share, if it was trading at all.<eos> Washoe Mining, there's this great old land lease... because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<eos> Right! Well, Washoe, Washoe Mining.<eos> You know, carrying'...<eos> carrying' on the business. You know, there's still minerals out there. We just gotta find them, right?
Yeah, we'll be right there.<eos> What's going on?<eos> -We gotta go.<eos> And then I came back from the bathroom and all those black guys from the club were, like, standing around Lenore and Dr. Richards and they were yelling at them and threatening them and they, like, kidnapped them!<eos> And I think one of them had a gun! Did you see where they took them?
He's playing around, suddenly the room's on fire.<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> How did he get the matches in the first place?<eos> They're in the cupboard above the refrigerator.<eos> Uh... Maybe we left them out. I don't know.
My grandpa told me stories when I was a kid... about monsters that he fought in the war.<eos> So there you go.<eos> He was brutally attacked, and in your head, the man who did it was inhuman, a monster.<eos> It wasn't a man, though.<eos> The cops said that dogs, scratched up the screen door, and he chased them off into the woods.
I remember.<eos> You drove these?<eos> Through the Triangle of Death?<eos> Fucking A right we did.<eos> Kip, take these boys over to the cage, get them paid.
Single earner or filing jointly?<eos> Hey, those paintings in your trailer...<eos> - They're real, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You didn't buy them at auction, did you?
They're only calling it a glitch because nobody understands how the algo works.<eos> And if nobody can understand the math, then nobody has to explain the money.<eos> Well, that's why I'm calling you. I want to understand.<eos> Fine.<eos> Algorithms make patterns, they don't break them.
- It's so immature.<eos> - Reprimanding me. - On so many levels.<eos> Because I've got cocks on my wall.<eos> Well, no, they weren't...<eos> I drew them on the wall.
No one's gonna beat your dumpling-eating record.<eos> Someone's about to beat your dumpling-eating record!<eos> Go! Go!<eos> Who's eating my dumplings?<eos> And who's paying for them?
Do you remember what they looked like?<eos> I'm a bit new to the memory thing so I can't say for sure. But something tells me they were mostly blue with...<eos> - ... maybe yellow.<eos> - That sounds right.<eos> Also, I'm pretty sure I'm going to know them when I see them.
Oh oh.<eos> Have I said destiny before?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just so nervous because I'm going to meet my parents.<eos> I hadn't seen them in...
See, I can't. Because I'm not so good with directions.<eos> Well, that's too bad.<eos> A deal is a deal.<eos> You want to find your parents.<eos> That's how you get to them.
- Wait, what is that?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> There were no messages from our galactic party crashers during the first 10 days.<eos> But pretty soon, they had a name.<eos> We called them "the Others."
Stop it!<eos> Shut your mouth!<eos> Look, guys, Alice has the shakes again.<eos> What's with the band-aids?<eos> Rosie put them on, 'cause I had a headache.
If he pleads guilty, I can take the death penalty off the table.<eos> Three years served, 20 probation.<eos> Three years?<eos> There are three dead police officers.<eos> And he didn't kill them.
Being careful about bringing somebody into your family, that's admirable.<eos> That's not judgmental.<eos> And look at me.<eos> I mean, they were right to be worried about their daughter's future.<eos> I don't blame them for that.
Ben, did you bring the divorce papers?<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> Uh, I never got them.<eos> I know you got them.<eos> I shoved them under your door.
I need this so that we don't misinterpret things in there, otherwise it is going to take 10 times as long.<eos> I can sell that for now.<eos> But I need you to submit your vocabulary of words before the next session.<eos> Remember what happened to the Aborigines.<eos> A more advanced race, nearly wiped them out.
The House of Te will fall.<eos> As will the followers of the Iron Way.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My parents were slain by the sword you hold.<eos> On clear nights, I still hear them calling to me from the other world.
I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stops shining.<eos> Gabe, go on up front now.<eos> I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire. Go on. I'll get you a piece.<eos> Say, Rose, you know, I was chasing hellhounds, and them bad men come and get me and take me away.<eos> He come down there and told them they better let me go before he beat them up!
That I wanted to lay up somewhere and forget about my responsibilities?<eos> That I wanted someone to make me laugh, so I could feel good?<eos> You're not the only one who's got wants and needs.<eos> But I held on to you, Troy.<eos> I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you.
You're overextended.<eos> I know.<eos> You need capital to finance the Omni project, which is what your investors are for.<eos> Securitized loans.<eos> Now, if the SEC approve them, you launch your IPO.
He's gonna have left time-bombs, trip-wire emails, the whole lot.<eos> You gotta clean it up.<eos> You can't just, you know, disappear this guy.<eos> We have guys, you know, we have cleaners.<eos> You know, that's what we call them.
But they were also using the cigarettes to burn me.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> All over.<eos> I was naked.<eos> Mr. Clyde tried to stop them, but that just made them laugh harder.
They don't know the first thing about it, you know?<eos> It's the most important part of the game, hands down, and yet it is a complete mystery to them.<eos> Yeah, no shit, but it's almost like they view us as a necessary evil.<eos> Well, yeah, man, we kind of are, you know?<eos> But that doesn't make them bad guys.
Your grandma baked me a cake. Said I was a hero.<eos> Later that day we found out we blocked the water all right. We sent it upstream.<eos> The whole Lang farm washed away.<eos> While I ate my hero cake, their horses were drowning.<eos> I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.
We needed a needle and thread.<eos> Or... duct tape.<eos> For what?<eos> To make a sleeping bag out of our clothes.<eos> We cut up our jackets and we taped them together and made a big, wide sleeping bag.
And I liked your books.<eos> Maybe not Lost Language of Ideograms.<eos> But the others.<eos> Okay.<eos> I read them all.
Look, I didn't even know Tom Soberin was here.<eos> I was hired by a man named Sterling Whitmore.<eos> To do what?<eos> Study a design, an invention.<eos> Anyway, every night I had to turn in my notes, and every morning I would get them back.
To stop working on the design and see him.<eos> Just like at school.<eos> So I called the university and they told me he was here, at the Mayflower.<eos> When I went to my apartment there were men coming out of it.<eos> I've been dodging them ever since.
Same reason I didn't get tenure.<eos> The ideas that got support were the ones that could be weaponized.<eos> That's why he stopped labeling his diagrams and started splitting them in half.<eos> Splitting them in half?<eos> He knew someone would exploit them. Yeah.
What about the next slide?<eos> They're on the move in what?<eos> These guys were ready for a walk.<eos> They're happy they're going home.<eos> We just picked them up on a police scanner.
We got an anonymous phone call an hour ago.<eos> Confirms everything I've been telling her.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You sent agents to Detroit and Philadelphia.<eos> You've been crying wolf so we wouldn't send them here.
That makes good sense.<eos> I like that.<eos> They are unrelated, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, they might be the tiniest bit related if you was to look at them in a certain way.
Thoughts were rolling through my mind.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> I hated the bank that fired my mother.<eos> Even if the bank had a hundred reasons, they still hated them.
I'll give you five big ones for everyone.<eos> I'm not an idiot. Thirty big. Seven.<eos> Thirty big.<eos> All right, I'll tell you what.<eos> I go in there. I will sell them for at least 30,000. I'll take the 30 percent commission.
I know someone works for the watch company.<eos> I got them at a good price. How many have you got?<eos> Two for you.<eos> Eight for his friends.<eos> Yes, we will take them.
Anyone who knows anyone, right,<eos> That's the people that will help you reach the people Who stay in the hotel or in the restaurant.<eos> Those are the people you need to know.<eos> As I said, these bankers were all corrupt.<eos> Darkweb wanted to punish them, so he wanted to push his shoulder to fight for the cause.
Because you're about to ruin this deal with that fat mouth of yours.<eos> What makes you think you can talk to me like that? I protect my interests.<eos> My money paid for things, as much as yours.<eos> Where did you find these guys?<eos> Not one of them seems to know who you are, so where did you find them?
We snatched... a gravity module of the back of Zhong's perimeter patrol unit.<eos> - Just what I need to finish that PEC!<eos> - PEC?<eos> Polaron Energy Converter. Oh so cool.<eos> I told you his clowns almost caught... but Vix lost them in a warp chase through a shards field.
This is Emperor High Intercontinental Champion Zhong.<eos> Just following up my message I've sent you a little while back.<eos> You know the one.. about me taking control of your planet!<eos> I've got my Kraken in custody and things are moving along nicely.<eos> You know the drill, hand your world over to me... or I destroy them with the Kraken slick!
Leaving Tanzania now.<eos> Get your passports out.<eos> Amy, can you grab my passport?<eos> Move it on, move it on.<eos> Make sure you got them all.
They're kids. That's what they do.<eos> - I thought they were here with you.<eos> - Well, they ent.<eos> Should be here.<eos> Sorry, but that's what happens when you send them to school.
I was, we were hoping that you would... tell us about what happened yesterday in Egypt.<eos> I'm afraid that's classified information.<eos> I don't mean to be rude... but how did you get in here?<eos> I have level-five clearance.<eos> Ever since the world found out about mutants in '73... there have been cults who see them as some kind of... Second Coming or sign of God.
They were supposed to be back any minute. We... We heard this crash outside.<eos> Grandma rushed outside, we followed her.<eos> It was a drunk driver.<eos> He'd been doing 60 in a residential neighborhood.<eos> Hit them right as they turned into the driveway.
Travel's really good for college applications.<eos> Have you taken the PSATs yet?<eos> You need to sign up right away.<eos> May! Oh, my God, your earrings! Where'd you get them?<eos> Thank you. Actually, my dad brought them back from New York.
And mine have been exhausted by the many years of wandering.<eos> So I think it is better to bring my life to a close at the right time, with my head held high, a life in which intellectual work has always been the purest joy and personal freedom, the greatest commodity in this world.<eos> I give my regards to all my friends.<eos> May they live to see the dawn after the long night.<eos> I am too impatient, I go before them.
Too smart, and you'll lose compassion, like your brother.<eos> - Caleb's "damaged"?<eos> - Yes.<eos> For nearly 200 years, the greatest scientific minds have lived here to test a theory.<eos> If we can rescue genetically damaged people from the toxic environment in the fringe. And put them in a safe place like Chicago, then perhaps over time, man's genetic material would heal itself. Return to its original form.
- My dad?<eos> - Alright, I'll see you back at base. - Yep.<eos> This is not a humanitarian mission. We're not saving kids, we're stealing them.<eos> This is what we do. Now you know.<eos> David takes them out from here, wipes their memories with the gas, and raises them in the bureau.
with his best wishes.<eos> All right.<eos> What's this about?<eos> I want to congratulate you on your many recent successes.<eos> I've been following them with great and particular interest. As all of us in our community have.
I heard from akasha.<eos> No my, my brother-in-law said he, came to Brooklyn lookin' for work or a girlfriend or some shit.<eos> Is he still cross-eyed?<eos> Who's akasha?<eos> So, akasha, this poor fucker used to get in trouble with the screws all the time because they could never tell if he was lookin' at them or not.
So what are we called, then?<eos> All right, what about...<eos> The Rabbits?<eos> What's the story with you and rabbits?<eos> I don't know, I just love them.
So what's it all about?<eos> I think she's just an amazing human being.<eos> I've never seen anyone like her.<eos> The way she talks and looks.<eos> She wears these sunglasses, and when she takes them off, her eyes are like the clouds clearing past the moon.
It refers to women who are fours back home become tens when they ship out and when they're back stateside, they become fours again.<eos> Are you saying I'm a four?<eos> I'm saying you carry an orange fucking backpack.<eos> I've seen people with actual experience make bad decisions here.<eos> So while you're outside the wire with my men, you will in no way distract them, understood?
Come on, Abby.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> We're going to see Leslie. We have to go.<eos> I'm visiting with the children.<eos> We have to see them at the house.
See, it ain't a time for begging.<eos> It's time for praying.<eos> You are a coward.<eos> You left good men behind.<eos> They trusted you and you ran out on them!
I'm not done...<eos> Not yet.<eos> And it's not done with me either.<eos> Those men left me with nothing...<eos> I'm gonna leave them with less.
Are you doing overtime in a bank robbery?<eos> You're ripping people off even now!<eos> Bitch!<eos> Diamonds.<eos> He gave her diamonds and she swallowed them.
Let's keep moving, everyone.<eos> The candidates don't really speak.<eos> They don't need to.<eos> They communicate like a unit.<eos> We encourage them to indulge only in the necessary and not the pointless.
Come on.<eos> Sansa.<eos> Sansa.<eos> Tell them to settle down!<eos> Stay here. I'll lure them away.
Let's get those nits out.<eos> I don't have nits.<eos> Nits like clean hair.<eos> Daddy told me.<eos> Okay, well, then you certainly don't have them, Grumpy-stiltskin.
I can hear them.<eos> The nurses.. talking about me.<eos> And I can hear their thoughts.<eos> You can hear their thoughts?<eos> You know, they think I can't hear them, but I do.
- You got it. Now, is she okay?<eos> - 'Cause she seems upset.<eos> - No, she's good.<eos> The crying's actually, like, good for kids' lungs.<eos> It makes them strong or something, you know.
I have Varga for that.<eos> All that I need to rule this coven... and end the march of the Lycans is your blood.<eos> What about the bodies?<eos> Sound the alarm.<eos> Have the council find them.
Stop right there.<eos> Where are you taking these prisoners?<eos> These are prisoners.<eos> Yes.<eos> Where are you taking them?
Where are you taking these prisoners?<eos> These are prisoners.<eos> Yes.<eos> Where are you taking them?<eos> I am taking them to imprison them in prison.
I am taking them to imprison them in prison.<eos> - He's taking us to...<eos> - Quiet!<eos> And there's a fresh one if you mouth off again.<eos> - We'll take them from here.
They've no reason to expect us.<eos> If we can make it to the ground, we'll take the next chance.<eos> On and on until we win... or the chances are spent.<eos> The Death Star plans are down there.<eos> Cassian, K-2, and I will find them.
This is Admiral Raddus, Rogue One.<eos> We hear you.<eos> We have the plans.<eos> They found the Death Star plans.<eos> They have to transmit them from the communications tower.
He just has it.<eos> And he always knows the perfect thing to say.<eos> You okay, babe?<eos> Okay, so just when my daughter doesn't want me around anymore, my parents need me more than ever.<eos> So I go with them to get groceries, to their doctors, and to physical therapy.
What if I said Miles Davis pissed on it?<eos> It's almost insulting.<eos> Is it true?<eos> When are you going to unpack these boxes?<eos> When I unpack them in my own club.
Yeah, that come into our state creating all kinds of problems.<eos> Apparently, a Deputy Price arrested them yesterday afternoon.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> So they held them for a couple hours.
Probably the sheriff, too.<eos> Lord.<eos> - Well, this whole mess is in my lap now.<eos> If I don't charge these bastards, then King yells and I'm letting them get away with murder.<eos> But if I do charge them, then all the Southerners scream about how I'm taking orders from the Negroes, and all this two weeks before the start of the goddamn convention.
All right, now let's you and me understand something here.<eos> Those people are Democrats just like you and me, but those good old boys from Mississippi, they locked them out.<eos> Well, now, they got locked out because they're not registered to vote.<eos> Because they wouldn't let them register!<eos> They beat them and shot them and lynched them.
We probably shouldn't hit her if we want her to talk to us.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You were supposed to get those guys off of me.<eos> Do you know who they were?<eos> Do you know who sent them? Yeah.
Possibly 3 casualties.<eos> They're armed and extremely dangerous.<eos> I repeat, do not go anywhere near them.<eos> They have some kind of skin disease that will eat you alive.<eos> So if you see them, don't hesitate to shoot them on site.
Are you aware of recent theories concerning what is known as paranoia?<eos> Oh, sounds Serbian.<eos> A woman will call on you, Lady Carmichael.<eos> I want you to take her case.<eos> But these enemies, how are we to defeat them if you won't tell us about them?
Oh, sounds Serbian.<eos> A woman will call on you, Lady Carmichael.<eos> I want you to take her case.<eos> But these enemies, how are we to defeat them if you won't tell us about them?<eos> We don't defeat them.
So I can see assorted pictures you've posted.<eos> - That's creepy.<eos> - It's a little creepy.<eos> But you haven't posted in a while, not since this.<eos> But I gather you're not married or you don't have any kids, or if you do, you're embarrassed by them, so you don't post any pictures.
- That drive culminated in a John Smith field goal attempt for 52 yards.<eos> -How you feelin'?<eos> I meant physically.<eos> - You're allowed to have ice chips.<eos> I'll get them for ya, if you let me hang around and watch the game with ya for a bit.
♫ It was so tra la la and so la di da ♫<eos> - Where were we?<eos> Oh, men, you said we need to give them what they want.<eos> Well, what do men want?<eos> - Just a pretty woman to love and to take care of them and to make them feel like a man and to give them total freedom in whatever they wanna do or be.
Seriously?<eos> Now I'm taking wardrobe advice from a bunch of Swamp Things...<eos> Hey!<eos> Living in an underground amusement park, and have, forgive me, the most pretentious names ever.<eos> Uh, excuse me, I named them.
Except for him, the cops show up... and these guys are still in the bank and they kill his family.<eos> Now I want you to imagine that right now.<eos> Soon as you leave here, the first call you make is to a funeral home to pick out a casket for your wife.<eos> And then they show you the special caskets for the children.<eos> And all the different colors and pillows and cushions inside and you're sitting there thinking what pillow would make them more comfortable fighting the realization that they're already dead so they don't give a flying fuck what color they're buried in, you motherfucker your wife is alive!
- I'm good, thanks.<eos> - Okay, thank you.<eos> - Thanks for taking the time.<eos> - Where did you see these guys?<eos> I didn't see them, I saw a black SUV racing off down Oak Street after the robbery.
Would you rather I did a rat satire?<eos> A what?<eos> A rat satire.<eos> An old Scottish custom.<eos> If you had rats in your house, you could make them go away by singing to them and telling them how poor the eating was where they were and how good it was elsewhere.
I'll not have my kin die for nothing.<eos> And what are you to do?<eos> I'll take Claire to safety.<eos> Then I'll turn back... back to Culloden, and fight till it's done.<eos> I'll guide yer men to safety and set them on the path home.
For happy wife, a most distressed widow.<eos> For joyful mother, one that wails the name.<eos> O, thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider, that foul bunchbacked toad!<eos> I had a husband till a Richard kill'd him.<eos> Thou hadst two sons till a Richard kill'd them.
The dog is dead!<eos> O, thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile, And teach me how to curse mine enemies!<eos> Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days.<eos> Compare dead happiness with living woe.<eos> Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were, And he that slew them fouler than he is:
They'll lead us to the docks.<eos> The mech shafts?<eos> Half those things are collapsed.<eos> I've been a cop here for years, I can't even find my way through that maze.<eos> Which is why the OPA uses them as smuggling routes.
Guess I got to keep practicing, huh?<eos> Wanna see how I did it?<eos> What you got there?<eos> When they first dug these tunnels, they put markers down so the workers wouldn't get lost.<eos> The OPA uses them to mark the route to the docks.
But my real name's Nam Sookee.<eos> Raised by Miss Boksun, top purveyor of stolen goods.<eos> I was able at age 5 to tell a real coin from a fake.<eos> Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai, and studied pickpocketing from Kutan, but these babies will never learn such useful skills.<eos> Abandoned as newborns, we'll wash and feed them, then sell them to Japan.
At least they trained us.<eos> Come.<eos> We need to start preparing.<eos> The deserters will be here in a matter of hours.<eos> Please, take these instruments inside and sterilize them.
Thank you, Elizabeth.<eos> His anxiety isn't going away.<eos> He seems more... Detached. And some of his behavior is similar to the first week's.<eos> How accurate would you say these memories are? 80 percent.<eos> I recorded them almost immediately.
We came upon the bodies on our way here.<eos> Half a dozen men?<eos> Your best hunters?<eos> They obviously had help.<eos> I didn't think Lady Sansa killed them all by herself.
- How does he want the money delivered'?<eos> I'm to put it in a bag and get on a train for Hamburg tonight at 7:15.<eos> He'll call me on the way and tell me where to hide the bag and then I'm to get off at the next stop.<eos> As soon he has the money, he'll release the children where they can be found.<eos> If we don't do as he says or if we tell anyone he's going to kill them.
Why?<eos> You promised to help.<eos> You promised.<eos> And now Elias is lying upstairs.<eos> My children. I won't see them again.
Do you want to get better or not? I do.<eos> I just...<eos> Then throw out the Paco Rabanne and the chopsticks. Start taking your antihistamines.<eos> Pick up some Saran Wrap and Crisco.<eos> Apply a large dollop to each foot morning and night and wrap them up.
Sorry.<eos> Grab your stuff.<eos> How's the feet?<eos> So, hey, I brought you some clothes.<eos> You can collect them after.
Our priority has been print.<eos> But not for readers.<eos> Pandora!<eos> We've always been against authorship.<eos> My text belong to whoever reads them.
'And in time, their bewildered "whys" 'would meet with a one-word answer.<eos> 'No-one foresaw this, 'or that a scandal would be sparked that would rock the world for years.<eos> 'And there was love, because love grows when nothing else is certain, 'changing its shape, to fill the space required. '<eos> The docks are brutal and I need men that's fit for them.<eos> Men give you their lives, at least respect them.
Yeah, and perhaps he was workshy.<eos> The docks are brutal and I need men that's fit for them.<eos> Now, if you need a worthy cause, Miss, I suggest you find a Seaman's Mission.<eos> Men give you their lives, Mr Gibson.<eos> At least respect them, even if you won't protect them.
Sorry, Sassenach.<eos> I must give the prince some credit.<eos> Turns out he has a fighting man's heart, even if his generals don't.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Even if you had talked them into taking London, might not have been able to hold it.
If we try to protect only ourselves... without looking out for those people closest to us... then we lose.<eos> Pop never forgot his people.<eos> Where some people saw hard rock kids... he saw precious jewels.<eos> He reminded me that diamonds are formed by pressure... covered in dirt.<eos> But then you polish them... and they shine.
So let's say our perp did hit him over and over again with a blunt instrument until he's dead.<eos> The trash bag is for the clothes you're wearing.<eos> Every stitch goes in.<eos> Jewelry, too.<eos> Spurlock will incinerate them.
I'm out.<eos> My family is no longer to be associated with what you all do.<eos> I need to move in a more legitimate direction. Need?<eos> That's a weak hand you're playing.<eos> My cousin has valuable assets and connections. I'll give them to you... for a price.
Forget Cage.<eos> The cops are gonna flood this place in a minute.<eos> No.<eos> We're staying.<eos> Nobody leaves. Not until we have them.
- I appreciate your concern.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> I need you at 100%.<eos> I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.<eos> Well, the hostages have all been consistent that Luke Cage never held them at gunpoint.
Oh, well, well, who said that?<eos> The Turd Sandwich?<eos> In your campaign, you said that you will deal with our country's immigrants and enemies by personally "Fucking them all to death."<eos> How do you plan to actually achieve that?<eos> Well, Matt, I don't think I said I would fuck them all to death.
Well, there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's fuck them all to death!<eos> Fuck them all to death.<eos> Let's make this country great again.<eos> Fuck them all to death!<eos> And then I'm gonna take all the drug pushers in our country, and I'm gonna fuck them!
Amberle told him that the Ellcrys was communicating with her.<eos> Giving her visions of the future.<eos> I dismissed it until I found this in her room.<eos> Demons?<eos> She sketched them before the Druid showed up.
Now, that's a goddamn lie.<eos> Roger's the one who stole your damn tools.<eos> Why should I believe you?<eos> It's true.<eos> Roger went into your truck and took them.
You weren't supposed to say anything.<eos> She said... She was gonna ask you to fix it anyways.<eos> Really?<eos> Let me borrow your phone.<eos> There's no way that guy will sell them to us.
Come back here, you.<eos> Hey! Stop.<eos> Stop!<eos> What happened in there?<eos> When I went in, he was talking to a man... so I went right for the tools and took them and ran.
It's the 12th time I've laid my head in this shit hole.<eos> Just waiting for them to come and take me up to The Factory.<eos> Go and work for those bloody rabs.<eos> You ever seen one?<eos> No one ever sees them.
I'm the Proxy Governor of our little block here.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> To turn crisis into opportunity.<eos> Even the most successful men make two or three critical mistakes in their lives.<eos> It's what they do afterward that defines them.
The hosts are supposed to stay within their loops, stick to their scripts with minor improvisations.<eos> This isn't a minor improvisation.<eos> This is a fucking shitstorm.<eos> We recall all remaining updated hosts tomorrow.<eos> Examine them one by one, decommission the faulty ones.
If I did know, I wouldn't tell you, and I don't.<eos> Would you like a beer?<eos> Jesus, Anna!<eos> For fuck's sake, I could lose my job.<eos> I've seen those before, those markings. I saw them on a boy in the clinic.
No, Roy managed to put you through Madam Posh boarding school, got your mum all comfy in a nice facility and now he's snaffled up the Kettering Pub, all on a copper's pension plan.<eos> You should talk to Lofty Sullivan.<eos> Ten months in remand, all on the gospel word of your old man.<eos> Kettering Incident time.<eos> It's all in his files, if he hasn't conveniently lost them.
- I help rescue them.<eos> - It's true, all right?<eos> He helps out with wildlife rescues.<eos> They rescue injured sea life, they nurse them back to health or they have them put down.<eos> I don't care if he grills them with a side serve of chips. He's going inside until I know whose damn blood it is.
- What's this? - I'm not sure but, look at the pattern, on the side.<eos> It's the same as the markings on Kade and Chloe, and mum.<eos> Eliza has those markings.<eos> - Eliza?<eos> - Yeah, I saw them.
It's the same as the markings on Kade and Chloe, and mum.<eos> Eliza has those markings.<eos> - Eliza?<eos> - Yeah, I saw them.<eos> Apparently I had them when I was young, I don't remember.
Well, I'm still taking a break.<eos> Man's gotta take a leak.<eos> We're here with bank manager, Lillian Brandt, who is one of the hostages in this crisis.<eos> Can you confirm that he killed all the suspects?<eos> No, he stopped them.
Well one thing we must acknowledge as a leader in this field is our responsibility to shape our society.<eos> If you look where we've come, or arguably where we've fallen to, you have to ask yourself what happened to our humanity and where did it go?<eos> In my new position, my focus is to return the spotlight to the gamers.<eos> I find that the single most important thing.<eos> And hopefully if we're smart enough, we can remind our consumers to engage in balance, to remember what makes them human in the first place.
I fear it would bring you peace. Son of a bitch.<eos> And I will see you hang.<eos> If your misguided sense of justice requires that I hang for my crimes,<eos> surely you can understand that you must hang there beside me... For yours.<eos> The bodies you have piled up do not disappear when you bury them away, out of sight.
We need to control and I mean control... What happens next.<eos> From the inside.<eos> You think it was ranchers behind this?<eos> No, no.<eos> Thomas paid them off.
Is there a lot of people out there still?<eos> Packed, right?<eos> Is this the cheeseburger?<eos> Kato, you like them burgers, huh?<eos> Oh, I love them.
He has got to be lead man.<eos> Happy New Year, dear.<eos> Have a good one?<eos> Linda, where'd you put my O.J. files?<eos> Cochran's team took them. All of them.
Happy New Year, dear.<eos> Have a good one?<eos> Linda, where'd you put my O.J. files?<eos> Cochran's team took them. All of them.<eos> What do you mean he took them?
All right.<eos> What?<eos> Has Ito ruled on the tapes? Not yet.<eos> And we're fighting to keep them out.<eos> But while we were reviewing them, we heard something... unexpected.
My, my, Shelly.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm checking for lumps.<eos> I didn't like hearing about those polyps.<eos> In my mind, I see them dangling like stinky grapes in her colon.
I can't do both today.<eos> You are wrong to trust these men.<eos> I don't trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest.<eos> They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.<eos> You don't know them.
You are wrong to trust these men.<eos> I don't trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest.<eos> They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.<eos> You don't know them.<eos> You don't understand them.
Resist the foreign invaders.<eos> Our queen has an even better story.<eos> Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that.<eos> The people know who brought them freedom.<eos> Yes, but do they know who brought them security?
I remember when the players came to my village.<eos> I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.<eos> Just like you.<eos> Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.<eos> I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.
Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.<eos> I'm not going to the Riverlands.<eos> What, then?<eos> I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows.<eos> I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.
Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses.<eos> It's between the living and the dead.<eos> And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.<eos> Is this true?<eos> Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men.
It's between the living and the dead.<eos> And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.<eos> Is this true?<eos> Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men.<eos> I fought them at Hardhome.
Amberle told him that the Ellcrys was communicating with her.<eos> Giving her visions of the future.<eos> I dismissed it until I found this in her room.<eos> Demons?<eos> She sketched them before the Druid showed up.
We even spread a few ourselves, hoping to intimidate our enemies.<eos> But Pykon was a military outpost, nothing more.<eos> My parents might disagree, if I could dig their bodies up from beneath your floor and ask them.<eos> I know you hate Elves, but we don't murder prisoners of war.<eos> If your parents were prisoners here, we would have released them when the war ended.
Marcelo, what did you think of the first half?<eos> - Can I borrow him for a minute?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - When will we get the results?<eos> - The lab will send them to me next week.
- 130 here, and my father even more.<eos> Including calves: 200.<eos> They never come out?<eos> No hoof problems?<eos> - I clean them daily.
But one note is equivalent to 50 Chinese notes.<eos> The people of my province voice concern.<eos> - Which province, again?<eos> - Wuji.<eos> Ask my subjects in Wuji if they've lived better under the Cricket Minister Jia Sidao, the corrupt pretender I saved them from.
- Bad wine.<eos> - In every province?<eos> As it turns out, yes.<eos> Orders are orders.<eos> And you follow them like a good foreign errand boy.
Permission?<eos> I do not need permission.<eos> The king needs my sons and I to support him.<eos> The king knows you sail upriver to buy slaves at favorable prices.<eos> He knows you're trading them for English guns.
Up, up, up, niggers!<eos> Get up!<eos> Move!<eos> On your feet!<eos> Get them moving, Mr. Peck!
Brian is full of determination. But, your daughter, her intelligence is very high. Perhaps the highest among all my children.<eos> This opportunity could be very valuable to her.<eos> Allow your children to come with us to King's College... and I will find a way for them to enter school, eh?<eos> You speak no sense.<eos> Let them come... and when we return, I will put them in private classes with the best teacher in Kampala.
These two children are not "our" children.<eos> They are my children.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I just meant...<eos> - Me, I carried them in my body.
Oh, I don't know. Not Jessa.<eos> Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.<eos> That is such fucking bullshit.<eos> I just spend all my time trying not to sink to their level, which is really hard.<eos> When I saw them last, I said, "Good day, sirs and misses,"
They're gonna pay for what they've done.<eos> Hello, Jim. Please step aside.<eos> This is the name of the man who killed your parents.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> No! Tell me who killed them!
My stupid parents are borking each other.<eos> And my mom thinks she knows all the worst things that my dad did, but she has no idea.<eos> She doesn't even know that he cheated on her with her best friend, Sheila Bodden.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah, I saw them.
Oh, man, look at him.<eos> This is bad.<eos> He hates standing up.<eos> To conquer my fear of businessmen, I must walk among them.<eos> I will shake their clammy hands and listen to them talk about things like how hard Wednesdays can be.
I'm really seriously not even thinking about laughing.<eos> - It's routine, it's procedure.<eos> - It's wank, it's toss.<eos> You want the dates and times?<eos> No. - Shall I e-mail them to you?
So brazenly?<eos> The cops will tap the phone.<eos> Those assholes will prevent the 3 Kings from meeting up.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> The cops want them too.
I wanted to boogie and so did Michael.<eos> He got up and started dancing on the table and this security guard came up and tried to take him down, so I punched him the fuck out.<eos> And then this other guy comes up and Michael hit him.<eos> He hit him so hard, his hair fell out.<eos> And then these two Korean twins came on to us so we took them into the manager's office and we started pumping away at them.
Mom, it... smelled like gas and overheated all the time... and it was just old.<eos> What?<eos> Well it wasn't always old.<eos> It just got that way all of a sudden.<eos> You know... when the firemen come... people don't usually invite them over for dinner.
- Something borrowed, something blue?<eos> - Yes. All right, I'm gonna go get dressed.<eos> It's a brave new world, Fiona.<eos> Nice ghetto job on the windows.<eos> Yeah, some drunk asshole smashed them with a tire iron.
Just saying this is the hallway up here.<eos> You feeling all right, Mr. Gamby?<eos> You look a little pale.<eos> Oh, it must be me.<eos> I tend to have this effect on men, leave them breathless.
The Middle East, Budapest,<eos> Argentina, St. Tropez, the Caymans...<eos> You're seducing me with nostalgia?<eos> No, in your bathroom, I discovered all the hotel toiletries you've pilfered during our travels. Huh.<eos> You've certainly earned them, though.
Very good. Well, have a nice time.<eos> I'll just be a minute.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> I brought you some flowers.<eos> Why didn't you give them to the maids?
Look, Mr...<eos> Collins.<eos> Mr Collins, it's blank to me.<eos> Mr Ertun, let me explain.<eos> And to be completely honest, I haven't read the documents either, and I'm supposed to be signing them.
What's your explanation?<eos> You're just like that baby... born in the fire.<eos> There was evil there that night, but... I had nothing to do with it. It was those men who ripped that baby from its mother.<eos> And what happened to them?<eos> Government troops captured them.
All right.<eos> We'll try and look after you.<eos> This work, it's not death and glory stuff.<eos> Not heroics.<eos> We work like the wolves do, watch and wait, and pick them off at their weakest point while they're retreating.
What I'm saying is that it's a better topic for an ethics class, or-or bio theory, but not biochemistry.<eos> So, you don't believe superhuman creatures exist, then?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Genetically enhanced human beings? Beasts?<eos> Or at least that's what the blogosphere's calling them.
I will keep your secret parts grabbed.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Remove your shoes.<eos> It's a pension for retirees, they sleep until late.<eos> They grumble if a sound wakes them up.
We gotta get this lockdown lifted and get everybody out of here.<eos> No, we can't.<eos> We've still got 24 hours.<eos> We have to get everybody out of here!<eos> Delina, if we don't catch the killer in 24 hours, we'll get them all out.
Like you were innocent, and helping with a murder investigation.<eos> I'm sorry if I sound callous, but I assure you I had nothing to do with that young man's death.<eos> Why were you meeting with Jason?<eos> I meet with programmers all the time.<eos> You mean you steal them from other companies all the time.
Thank people.<eos> Congratulate those who work well.<eos> And remember birthdays.<eos> Of course I do!<eos> I remember all of them now.
Well, what...<eos> Well, I don't think that this really falls under my job description.<eos> Well, it does today, Mr. Russell.<eos> And you're gonna be just fine.<eos> Keep them in this room and do not let them out of your sight.
We must get back to the monastery.<eos> Hold!<eos> They're so young and excitable.<eos> I found him, children!<eos> Never pay attention to anything that goes on around them.
- Still...<eos> You're forgetting about the 500 dead kids in Gaza!<eos> Don't throw Gaza at me.<eos> I'm British, not Israeli.<eos> You support them, though.
Anyone home?<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> It's very quiet in here.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> Vladka's taken them to the park and then they're gonna collect the girls from school.
Jimmy, where were we?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I was saying...<eos> Getting documents from some of the clients...<eos> We definitely have some pack rats, God bless them.
- I have it in my shop.<eos> What I sell to my customers who, usually in a moment of passion, want to poison their enemies, is bitter cascara.<eos> The effect is most immediate.<eos> The stomach seeks to purge itself, and... then, well, you get the idea.<eos> Then it makes the enemy suffer visibly, but it doesn't kill them.
How many people heard you?<eos> Only a few, but I guess it was a good bit of gossip to share.<eos> Oh, I suppose the assailants were customers at... at Maison Elise.<eos> Aye.<eos> Aye, and if we find them, they may lead us to St. Germain.
And perhaps Louis, having had his show, would be appeased and set them free.<eos> This potion will give you your answers, Sire.<eos> We may have a death... or two.<eos> But I ask one thing:<eos> if both these men survive, you will set them free.
I know what you're all feeling.<eos> I've been there myself.<eos> The fear.<eos> The self-doubt. But our men are depending on us.<eos> And we will not let them down.
If we want to make money, we need to honor ancient Irish traditions, like serving an irresponsible amount of booze to people who are genetically predisposed to having alcohol problems.<eos> - Right.<eos> St. Patrick started that tradition, and that's why we celebrate him today.<eos> Yeah... No, that's not what he did.<eos> No, he-he played the flute for some kids, and then he lured them into a cave somewhere,
♪ Songs of hope ♪<eos> - This type of ware is generally referred to as China painting.<eos> Now, in the late 19th century and into the early part of the 20th century ladies of fashion would get together at China painting parties and paint these plates, or blanks.<eos> So, all these blanks have a mark on the back of them.<eos> We won't turn them around. But they all say "Limoges."
- Did you brush your teeth?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> -Really?<eos> 'Cause your toothbrush is in here and there's a bottle of water.<eos> -Mom, I said I brushed them.
How?<eos> I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.<eos> I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.<eos> But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.<eos> But if their identity lies in their stories, I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
It was always, "I'm hurting, Sally."<eos> "Can you hook me up, Sally?"<eos> Except for Nick Harley and Tina Black.<eos> The musicians?<eos> I saw them once. At the Troubadour.
It'll kill them.<eos> I'd rather die.<eos> You're not saving anyone.<eos> What do you think's gonna happen to your children?<eos> It won't take long for Iris and Liz to mow them down.
There's a lot of moving parts...<eos> - Unbelievable, man!<eos> - There's a lot of moving parts.<eos> Right, okay, uh...<eos> We told him to abandon this quest. Honey, if I had eyes, I'd roll them.
When Ms. Blake reached her full term.<eos> It's a classic reaction, they're like animals and they want me to become one of them.<eos> - There was no infantile disease.<eos> No one showed 'em how to handle babies.<eos> The cries got to them.
Grieving over who we were only gets in the way of who we need to become.<eos> [footsteps] Those men out there in the hoods... who are they?<eos> They call themselves the Messengers.<eos> The Twelve.<eos> That's what Peters called them.
Mr Gordon, how lovely to see you.<eos> Mrs Edwards.<eos> - How are the provincial stores?<eos> - Ticking over.<eos> The chief's lucky you keep such a close eye on them.
How are you feeling?<eos> The bullet fragments in Mr Spector's body contained no iron, so he had the MRI scan this morning.<eos> There's an absence of evidence for established infarct... ..but a suggestion here of a loss of grey white matter differentiation.<eos> Now that may be in keeping with ischaemic insult in the frontal temporal lobe region, but I can't say it explains the memory loss.<eos> I'll pass the results on to Dr Larson and he can include them in his assessment.
How did you, um...<eos> Oh, uh, just gave her another spritz.<eos> What the...<eos> - Why are they crawling? - Oh, sorry.<eos> I turned them into little, wiggly pugs.
From a battered wife threatened by a bullet, to fending off her violent husband with a.38.<eos> Guns as tools of female empowerment.<eos> What's the saying?<eos> God created humans...<eos> Samuel Colt made them equal.
A senator's priority isn't representing the people, it's keeping his ass in office.<eos> That is so cynical.<eos> "Cynical" is a word used by Pollyannas to denote an absence of the naivety they so keenly exhibit.<eos> Wow. You settle in fast.<eos> If senators only care about protecting their position, wouldn't that make them slaves to public opinion?
Esme, get me a bio on Wendy Furniss, please?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Harwood Norton's CEO?<eos> Mmm-hmm. Second largest employer in Virginia.<eos> Both senators are teetering, but if I can get her to reach out to them...
I'm including myself as part of the team.<eos> I wasn't cool enough to relate to college kids when I was a college kid.<eos> I'll forward you the details.<eos> You again.<eos> I called them and I specifically asked for Mark.
Yousef Bashir, Tariq Mazari, and Salim Khan.<eos> Which of them was driving it the night it came into Manhattan?<eos> None of them.<eos> He seemed upset that these guys wouldn't get out of his cab.<eos> He wanted them out, in no uncertain terms?
Why do you think these guys are acting this way?<eos> Why do you think that guy went up and shot five servicemen in Chattanooga? Because they loved him?<eos> Because we treated him well?<eos> Because we don't plaster their names as terrorists all over the media?<eos> No! - Because we hate them.
Because we treated him well?<eos> Because we don't plaster their names as terrorists all over the media?<eos> No! - Because we hate them.<eos> - We do not hate them. I will not...<eos> No, we do not hate them. And I will not allow for that.
No, I can't look at those.<eos> They're right over there.<eos> These files are classified.<eos> They're the property of the Department of Defense.<eos> Well, I've had a look at them.
You're not saying you believe him?<eos> Just hold on, Agent Einstein.<eos> You're talking to a scientist.<eos> Uh, forgive me, Assistant Director. It may sound insensitive, but the suggestion is pure science fiction.<eos> What I'm saying, Agent Einstein, is that the facts, as I understand them, cannot be discounted out of hand.
Absolutely.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, great. Just let me...<eos> Just let me drop off my packages at my apartment.<eos> All right, do you want me to grab them for you?
Votes in favour of a raid.<eos> Do you want to use your double vote or should we save up time?<eos> Let's go on.<eos> The place has access by two gullies.<eos> They will enter through the nearest to the path. - we will wait for them in the second.
- The prisioners are here, idiot.<eos> I see that you take good care of those men.<eos> It is my obligation to give them counsel especially when they are going to die in a few hours.<eos> No, they're not going to die.<eos> Napoleon has pardoned them.
Don't worry, I'll interpret.<eos> I don't understand at all. Houdini congratulated me. - and wants to continue working with me.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> That he was pleased to meet the man with the x-ray eyes.<eos> Gromek told me that I'm the perfect spy. that I had proven my powers to him and had hidden them from the journalists.
- and you get new credit cards.<eos> - I'm so stupid!<eos> You're not stupid.<eos> I lose my wallet like three times a month.<eos> My wallet must've slipped out of my pants when I took them off.
Daniel...<eos> I think you're right about everything. I have no doubts, but... I'll have to ask you to accept some of the paintings that were rejected.<eos> I heard you've rejected all the local painters.<eos> Don't get me wrong but... I don't know a thing about art... but you're leaving this town tomorrow and won't come back.<eos> I'll have to put up with them here, you know?
Douglas.<eos> Of course, now we've identified several prospects currently in development.<eos> Next-gen antibiotics, immunotherapies, and some potentially ground-breaking advances in the soon-to-be huge market of food allergy drugs.<eos> By fast-tracking these projects, Davis/Dexter's future growth is all but assured.<eos> That is, of course, unless someone beats them to market.
-Your honor, -we are so understaff-- -understaffed, okay.<eos> Ms. Diaz, you're sure there's no family in the area?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Mr. sanjuro, please see if you can arrange short-term foster care for the children?<eos> Please keep them as close to home and school as possible and make certain that Ms. Diaz has full-time access. Now, everyone take out your books.
The children just got home.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I had to get some milk.<eos> I was just gone a minute.<eos> Um, I didn't have a chance to call, but I told the kids i was gonna take them for some dinner and ice cream tonight.
I got no problem.<eos> Judge, I know I haven't been any kind of father, but those kids are still my flesh and blood, too.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanna know them is all I'm saying.<eos> To look at them.
Is that Jess?<eos> Jess.<eos> It's awful.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I'm sure Cece has her flaws, but I just can't see them.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> - How about this one?<eos> - Too big for the sling.<eos> So, do you think Eleven was born with her powers, like the X-Men, or do you think she acquired them, like... like Green Lantern?
- Oh, those.<eos> Nothing, just... some ideas for a graphic novel I'm drawing with a friend.<eos> Really, it's just there by mistake.<eos> The Brooklyn Academy of Art doesn't believe in mistakes.<eos> Give me the professors' names and I... I will end them.
Come on, guys, are we solving this, or am I gonna find someone else who can?<eos> All right, then.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> I sent them to Nancy's so we could do this.
Four ice cream sundaes?<eos> They're, like, $12 each.<eos> I thought it would be nice for the kids to have one while we're talking.<eos> Ah, I have a really great idea.<eos> Why don't we make them at home?
Oh, no.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Did you see the comments on the press release?<eos> I, like many people, do not read the comments.<eos> Let me read them for you.
My orgasm.<eos> It's genius, right?<eos> - That is...<eos> - It gets better.<eos> You know those kids' cards when you open them and they play, like, "Who Let the Dogs Out"
- Here.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Take this and go.<eos> Now!<eos> Go! I'll hold them off as long as I can.
Are you going to ride back up into the hills to look for them?<eos> I'll send for the rangers.<eos> We'll go back up there in force as soon as they get here.<eos> But, miss, in truth, if there is a merciful god, those men are dead already.<eos> Father wouldn't let them roam this close... to dark.
My parents...<eos> They hurt them.<eos> Limit your emotional affect, please.<eos> What happened next?<eos> Then they killed them.
What about you, Juanico?<eos> How far can you count?<eos> I know all the numbers off by heart:<eos> One, two, three, four, five, seventeen, forty and twenty-three.<eos> I see that you know them very well.
He left the keys in the ignition, then he ran that way.<eos> The minibus taxi belonging to the football team was... Came to rest here.<eos> Point-blank range.<eos> The gun they found was registered in Leon's name.<eos> He dragged the bodies over there, then he lined them up.
And how do you know this?<eos> You don't wanna ask.<eos> What else, Pierre?<eos> What struck me is that these warders, they get to know the men that they have to hang.<eos> They're their caretakers, then they haul them out, string them up.
We didn't do the killing, the hangman did.<eos> Yet you've told the court that you had to pull prisoners up by the neck and drop them again, haven't you?<eos> Yes, but we didn't actually touch the prisoners.<eos> We only touched the rope. It was what the warrant officer told us to do!<eos> But you dropped them again so that their necks would break cleanly, didn't you?
I'm close to finding our saboteur.<eos> That tracking data you gave me... it's time stamped.<eos> But once I cross-reference it with sat tracking, we're gonna figure out who programmed him to try to smuggle out our data.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Look... when our corporate overlords realize that we have saved them from corporate espionage, they are going to be grateful.
- So they have.<eos> But this new legislation's bound to affect them more than anyone.<eos> It is a compromise, naturally.<eos> Whelan, the man's not a complete imbecile!<eos> For years, we've let the native princes run their own states without interference, and suddenly, we're inviting them to give it all up!
I assume he was there to foment violence and got caught up in a shooting.<eos> I asked them to send up his death certificate from Sind.<eos> Here.<eos> Yes, his own identity papers.<eos> I can only assume he must have planted them on some corpse.
I mean, that's almost Gussie Mae's monthly salary.<eos> $70, that thing better serve me drinks and cure my rheumatism.<eos> I think I'm gonna have to wait till spring - to get it up and running.<eos> - You have those tools?<eos> Yeah, I got them tools.
That's right.<eos> I want six guys.<eos> And I want real guys.<eos> Thank you, Manfredo.<eos> I'll be expecting them within the hour.
We're not here on a pilgrimage, we're preparing a case.<eos> Okay.<eos> These are the remains of Crematorium ll.<eos> The buildings were deliberately demolished by the Germans in the autumn of 1944 to destroy the evidence of what they did here.<eos> They dynamited them again one week before the end of the war.
That is true Indian ivory, brought back by my husband's grandfather, the admiral.<eos> Listen, you must store it very, very safely.<eos> How shall we reclaim it?<eos> Please be careful with that, please!<eos> McClellan's got them turning tail.
Member of a terrorist organization.<eos> The Brotherhood is a peaceful movement.<eos> This peaceful symbol was drawn in a man's blood.<eos> Listen, we know you're holding these subhuman fugitives in the Zone.<eos> Hand them back to us and we'll forget you had anything to do with it.
Miss Hammershøi, with your background from good schools, including girls' schools, I will ensure you understand the need for discipline.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're probably aware that the beating was abolished earlier this year?<eos> But Gudbjergs mission is more important than the frivolity in Copenhagen.<eos> The boys ended up here because no one else can control them.
Wander on the rooftops.<eos> You have to be there for them around the clock.<eos> In the most important period of their lives.<eos> Else it's not fair to them.<eos> If their uncle could have done it, he had brought them home now.
In the most important period of their lives.<eos> Else it's not fair to them.<eos> If their uncle could have done it, he had brought them home now.<eos> But it was their own idea to wait until after sunset.<eos> Their uncle would pick them up and hide them until it was OK.
Not exactly this crowd, but your Freaky Leekies really ran with the ball, didn't they?<eos> Neolution is an open-source concept.<eos> We embrace the fringes.<eos> They're fiction to our science.<eos> Well, your book inspires them to play God... to tinker on themselves in basement labs.
Take care.<eos> See you, kid.<eos> First, the flowers.<eos> Now, chocolate.<eos> You sent them to yourself.
I don't know how many showed up.<eos> We gave them the option...<eos> Only nine people are out.<eos> Your employees must be very loyal.<eos> We think of them as part of the family.
Did it get messy?<eos> You know what it is?<eos> Somebody going, "I'm hearing a noise in the basement. Go see if we've got rats."<eos> Well, you know, then I'm the one. I got to go in and start rooting around.<eos> And I got these guys -- they're looking at me like -- you know, like I-I was accusing them.
What was that?<eos> That was close.<eos> Oh, it's nothing, sweetheart.<eos> It's just fireworks.<eos> We set them off all the time.
Canceled until further notice.<eos> You don't need it... not anymore.<eos> You're the best P.M. on the floor. You know it.<eos> They're fucking sure of it.<eos> Those animals are used to you putting them down now. Hardly even whimper as it happens.
Why do you think so?<eos> You've released him, so he can't be the killer<eos> But... should I be afraid of him?<eos> No<eos> But the phones? You remember who you sold them to?
- Size two?<eos> Ms. Caruso, the president sends her apologies, but the position has been filled. - Ooh.<eos> - Right this way.<eos> Okay.<eos> And if I need more clothes, then I'll have you or Mom send them.
It's not being delayed.<eos> It's being refined based on testing, people.<eos> No, no.<eos> You can't say that. That makes it sound like the clothes did bad on the test.<eos> Or I can say my dad stole them to sabotage me.
I mean, listen to her, she's right.<eos> I mean, as much as it would bring me joy,<eos> - it's not the right time for that. - No.<eos> No.<eos> We got the shareholders right where we want them, we just got to push.
She did put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger, and told an eight-year-old boy that it was his fault she was the way she is.<eos> Just turns out there was no bullets in the gun.<eos> Well, if she didn't die then...<eos> No... my mother died the day that they locked her up.<eos> And then remember how under Reagan the government took all the mentally ill patients and dumped them out on the street?
Then it had us pick up the same packages later and deliver them to their original addresses.<eos> The building directory shows no tenant in Suite 908.<eos> My training driver says packages have been going there for weeks.<eos> Looks like they're all from electronics companies.<eos> It could be that the Machine is rerouting them, looking for something to help it rebuild.
When you do the kind of work I do, steeping yourself in conspiracy theories day in, day out, you get good at recognizing patterns, and sometimes the patterns are just coincidence, but sometimes... sometimes they're real.<eos> Tonight I'm announcing this discovery on the air.<eos> I'm hoping my listeners will help figure out what the messages mean and who they're coming from.<eos> These messages are a secret for a reason, Max.<eos> You sure whoever's doing this is gonna be happy you're exposing them over the air?
Minding their own business.<eos> What's a respectable neurosurgeon doing in a crack house?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The werewolves, they're meeting out front all hours of the night.<eos> I heard them. Yeah.
I think they're...<eos> I think they're voting on a new head of the syndicate.<eos> But<eos> He put a bug out there for me by the trash cans.<eos> We're gonna tape everything they say and we'll bust them on a RICO statute.
She emailed.<eos> She used the word "bully."<eos> Sounds like you haven't been keeping your promises to me.<eos> Fix it.<eos> Do you remember the night we pretended we were in real beds and we described them to each other?
Good.<eos> Feel all the branches on it, and the leaves.<eos> You're climbing a tree!<eos> "'You don't know what these beans are,' said the man to Jack.<eos> 'If you plant them overnight, by morning they'll... Up, up, to the sky.
In the next room.<eos> So... the other day I found myself feeling, uh... resentful.<eos> -That ever happen to you?<eos> My subjects seem... so united.<eos> They... have this tribalism that sustains them somehow.
The Many-Worlds theory?<eos> Well, no, not exactly.<eos> More like, uh, reality forking off into a different path.<eos> No, look... imagine a garden of forking paths.<eos> So, my subjects have touched on them in their NDEs, but now... now, Leon, they are uncovering a technology of movement that-that could allow them to travel to different dimensions, maybe even stay there.
- That's a misplaced adverb.<eos> Yeah, I told them to just really focus on creativity in this assignment and let everything else go.<eos> But that's not proper English.<eos> Yeah, and they can focus on proper English in another assignment.<eos> I appreciate your creative approach with these kids, but I know them, okay?
When it should be here, with the sea.<eos> Abrecan, look around.<eos> Your people are nervous.<eos> The pandiri are late.<eos> Some think you missed them again.
Well, I couldn't.<eos> That's not very fair.<eos> Some people can't even have babies.<eos> And the ones who can...<eos> they don't even want them.
Can you just check the napkin thing there for a microphone?<eos> For a microphone? You're kidding me. What, what are you nuts?<eos> You're kidding me. What, what are you nuts?<eos> No, just check it.<eos> They put the microphones, they can plant them anywhere.
That's what I was trying to do.<eos> You scared the crap out of me!<eos> Let's have a drink.<eos> Which one is mine?<eos> Don't worry, no one touched them yet.
I'd love to take that handsome face of yours and have you co-star with me in my next picture.<eos> I... no.<eos> But thank you?<eos> She's my secret weapon, Jack.<eos> When we get to D.C., those old senators won't know what hit them.
Uh, Chip didn't tell you about our arrangement?<eos> You know it's not really marriage for love so much. It's more for the green card.<eos> How do your parents feel about that arrangement?<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't see them, you know, so much.
- Fuck.<eos> - Don't fucking move!<eos> - Get down on the fucking ground!<eos> - Healy hates bike thieves.<eos> He treats them like proper criminals.
They're Kyra's style. I mean, I can see her in them.<eos> Are we able to cut them?<eos> Is it possible? They'll be too big.<eos> Let me look into this.<eos> I'll get them for you from the studio.
You know how they make this stuff?<eos> The animals are bred for death.<eos> These animals don't have any thoughts.<eos> Okay? They eat and they shit.<eos> God gave them to us to kill and eat.
Chief among them... healer.<eos> Individualistic, nonjudgmental, an idealist, guided by her own core values and beliefs.<eos> I have always thought the same of her, but a healer wouldn't lie.<eos> What do you believe would cause a person like her to keep secrets from her family?<eos> Oh, healers' gentle nature and dislike of negative emotions causes them to avoid conflict at all costs.
What you talking about?<eos> It's got into you.<eos> Shut up!<eos> The jinns don't like the full moon.<eos> It makes them mad.
Ok, Commander.<eos> Let me ask you this.<eos> Do you honestly believe that there are enough smart people on these 13 stations to save us, that their calculations are right, that there is enough air to last two centuries, enough food?<eos> A.L.I.E. 2 will run all the possibilities.<eos> She'll see the mistakes before we ever make them.
You're absolutely right.<eos> So, um... what happens to humans if they're... runed?<eos> They usually die.<eos> Sometimes they go crazy.<eos> When that happens, we call them the Forsaken.
- Mmm-hmm. - Are you afraid of bugs?<eos> There are bugs under those cups and I can't kill 'em.<eos> 'Cause it's, like, inhumane or...<eos> Ew, no.<eos> No, because they're gross and I hate them!
I ask someone where you live, I... I hope you don't mind.<eos> From myself and my men.<eos> These really aren't necessary.<eos> You can say, "I'll put them into water before they die."<eos> Very well. I'll put them into water before they die.
Did you know that cats actually do watch TV?<eos> - It's a thing. - Huh!<eos> So, I'm the squirrel and my mom is the cat, because I don't care.<eos> And that's my husband.<eos> It is interesting how you put them in order like that.
I'm sorry.<eos> I should have... Done more for him.<eos> He chose to run. That's not your fault.<eos> The road they used to bring the wounded men up from the barges -- I've heard them call it "mercy street."<eos> Because it leads them here, where they might be saved.
How those men got into your house.<eos> There were no signs of forced entry.<eos> As lawmen, we are trained to consider every angle.<eos> Such as?<eos> Perhaps you invited them in.
We go for that train now, them catchers be on us in no time.<eos> No, we split up.<eos> No. It's me and Henry.<eos> You and Zeke.<eos> We go in opposite directions, we'll draw them away from you.
Mr. Falcone was right!<eos> I stack bodies for a living. Just like he uncannily predicted.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Hey, we both needed a fresh start.<eos> And when these two age-appropriate bodies rolled in... no one claimed them for a week, I... fake-cremated them.
- 'Cause I couldn't pop a fucking wheelie. - You couldn't pop a wheelie?<eos> And I didn't fare too well on the psychological exam.<eos> That I believe.<eos> Wow. Now, where did you get these dead bodies?<eos> I found them dead.
- No, it's only been a few days.<eos> He's still processing it himself.<eos> What do the PMs know?<eos> That I need them to close down the positions, not stampede the fuck out of the corral.<eos> But they're instinctive creatures, and without knowing exactly why, they feel antsy, which leads them to feeling restless, which leads to motherfucking anarchy if we don't rein it in.
These dicks just got a good story.<eos> The bogeyman, he ain't shit.<eos> Well, how do you know?<eos> A month ago, we took his guys out PDQ.<eos> Left them in pieces and puddles.
I can't bear it!<eos> I burned that paper that they gave me.<eos> I have a plan!<eos> The sons of liberty threw tea into the harbor. And now we just sit around drinking it.<eos> We beat them back at Drewry's bluff.
- Awesome.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are the kids home okay? Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> I saw them with Bruce Layner, and it seemed like he was drinking.
You always said that the desperation is what gave you an edge over the rich kids.<eos> They are the rich kids.<eos> Where are they gonna get their grit?<eos> All right.<eos> We'll put 'em on a fishing trawler for the summer, stick them in the Foreign Legion.
You have heard this man.<eos> He speaks the truth.<eos> We will not walk like sheep to slaughter.<eos> We will make refuge on Musa dagh.<eos> And if the turks will not leave us in peace, we'll fight them from every rock.
We just widened the perimeter.<eos> Well, if you need a break, I can stand around here and look annoyed and impatient for a while.<eos> You have kids, Detective?<eos> Why do people keep asking me that?<eos> Well, some agents think having kids makes them better at working kid cases... makes them more intuitive, more empathetic.
Yes, yes, I would. Even though Mr. Asher was innocent?<eos> He may have been innocent of taking Adam, but, um, he's not innocent.<eos> He was a convicted sex offender, Julia, after all.<eos> Let's not forget that. And statistics show that sex criminals re-offend exponentially more often than they don't.<eos> Even after incarceration, treatment, reha... after our best efforts at rehabilitation, we let them report their own whereabouts?
He must know that we're right behind him.<eos> I got a theory, but I don't think you're gonna like it.<eos> Okay, we're listening.<eos> Guess how Dominic takes out his enemies?<eos> He blows them up.
Yeah.<eos> I'm glad you saw it and reacted the way you did.<eos> Hey, give yourself credit.<eos> You got with it pretty quick.<eos> We protected them. Yep.
Let me try some.<eos> You know, our history teacher...<eos> She told us this totally crazy story.<eos> During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran sent children and old folks to clear mines.<eos> They sent them out as scouts.
Come with us, and we walk away.<eos> Walk away from what?<eos> By other of the Commander, you have been surrounded by an army of the 12 clans.<eos> In every direction, warriors wait to kill anyone who attempts to cross the blockade,<eos> To greet them as we greeted those we caught outside your walls today.
Sinclair.<eos> We're too late.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> He didn't kill Monty or Raven. He would have left their bodies.<eos> He took them somewhere.
Yes.<eos> Well, can I ask why?<eos> We're sending them to the ground.<eos> We have 99 prisoners here.<eos> We've divided them into small, more manageable groups.
- What you teach them will...<eos> - Well, I've taught them nothing!<eos> They don't care, so they don't learn.<eos> They don't pay attention because they don't think they have a reason to.<eos> Let me tell them we're sending them down,
But for my end, I'll put up a first edition of my new book, The Great Boer War.<eos> Sir, I can handle this case myself.<eos> Without help from a writer and a magician.<eos> I'm quite familiar with police protocols.<eos> Yes, you regularly mock them and us in your stories.
Well, there's Chloe, Madison, Ana...<eos> You know what?<eos> None of them were you.<eos> Duh.<eos> We can have this conversation, or we can go back to my place and enjoy the new tricks we both learned, without worrying about how we learned them.
Then you understand.<eos> Let us speak to our son.<eos> My son...<eos> Look into my eyes.<eos> Did they look at you when you killed them?
And the men from your past?<eos> The ones who used you.<eos> The monsters.<eos> Will you forgive them?<eos> Would you have me forgive them?
It was a false alarm.<eos> Dad told me what's going on.<eos> Who'd want to do this?<eos> My parents... - They're not bad people.<eos> - They're successful, rich, which makes them a target for some very bad people indeed.
He's the only one that can tell us what happened to Abbie the night she disappeared.<eos> I'm gonna get a warrant to tap his phone.<eos> You know, I took this biology class in college.<eos> We learned about an experiment where they train a bunch of dogs to bring back a toy duck.<eos> Only, when they set them loose in a field, no duck.
Some cops want him off the street, others think he's making our jobs a whole lot easier.<eos> But if you ask me, it's only a matter of time before the wrong person gets caught in the crossfire.<eos> Yeah, you put it that way, I guess copycats were inevitable.<eos> No, it's not the first, just the latest.<eos> Yeah, we call them "Devil Worshippers."
What the hell is that?<eos> You could call it "work product."<eos> Morgue reports generated by the shooter who attacked you in the hospital.<eos> And all of these people were... were killed by the same man?<eos> He's tracking gangs to their home turf and taking them out with military precision.
I noticed 'em on TV.<eos> They're Francis' mother's earrings.<eos> - They look like they're over a carat.<eos> - Two carats.<eos> No doubt she stole them from someone.
Milkin will be staying with this man, Anton Khalski.<eos> He owned the second-largest bank in Russia until Petrov seized it in 2013.<eos> Khalski fled across the border to Estonia.<eos> We'll have Milkin's plane fly to Tallinn, then he'll travel by boat to Khalski's summer house on Saaremaa.<eos> Tomorrow we'll unfreeze Milkin's American assets and transfer them to Khalski's Swiss accounts.

Yeah, well, when I got out of the hospital, it turned out there had never been a S.H.I.E.L.D., just Hydra hiding behind one.<eos> I signed up to protect the world from these dangerous alien elements.<eos> We still do that.<eos> The hell you do.<eos> You use them, unleash them.
You were probably cleaning up some mess of theirs.<eos> How did you get the location of our compound?<eos> Coercion, by any chance?<eos> I'm sure it was all aboveboard.<eos> We're solving problems, not making them.
The same Young Offenders as Martin.<eos> Different dates, different years.<eos> So why was he trying to track 'em down?<eos> He was always collecting things.<eos> Never let me touch them.
We do, and, you know, we don't need some stupid psychiatry book to help us.<eos> Psychology.<eos> Bow was right.<eos> You do your best to raise good kids.<eos> And whether you like it or not, as they get older, you have to trust them and support them, even if you don't always understand them.
First thing in the morning, I'm gonna call a lawyer up, and I'm gonna let them know that we're leaving our kids with my family.<eos> Wait.<eos> Your family? Mm-hmm.<eos> Why not my family?<eos> Because they're our children and we love them?
You killed them?<eos> The Khan's sons aren't capable of walking half a day to a way station?<eos> Then why, Orus, have they not arrived at a way station?<eos> The Vice Regent's horse... fell on his leg.<eos> And you left them there.
We butcher 'em.<eos> I believe that's what I'm paying for.<eos> And the men from your past who used you.<eos> Will you forgive them?<eos> Would you have me forgive them?
- Yeah. And Quinn.<eos> I mean, you know their history, right, Gary?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. So, it's gotten crazy ugly between the two of them.<eos> I mean, look, I owe them my career. I love them.
I can't.<eos> - Madison...<eos> - No, actually, she can't.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because I have them.
There was a graveyard of bones on that planet, right?<eos> And it controls these organisms?<eos> That's one theory.<eos> We do know that they eat living flesh.<eos> What if it also uses them to reanimate dead flesh?
Such a shame.<eos> I won't be able to tell Mick he was right. Mick?<eos> My colorful friend, who was convinced you were planning on killing me.<eos> Your friends seem to have abandoned you, but no matter.<eos> Chronos will track them down.
It's not real.<eos> I mean, the place is, I just...<eos> I don't have a job there.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The last couple of years have just been a lot harder than I made them sound.
- Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I just...<eos> I-I can't believe that this happened.<eos> - Where are the bodies?<eos> - They took them to the morgue.
I disagree.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> So this is what's going to happen now.<eos> I'm going to take these plates, I'm going to put them in one bag.<eos> And then I'm going to take your bodies, what's left of them, and I'm going to put them in another.
Like children, no?<eos> Barbara.<eos> But can we live without them?<eos> Memories are what our reason is based on.<eos> If we deny them, we deny reason itself.
Let them in.<eos> Hold weapons!<eos> Surround him!<eos> They retreated into the woods!<eos> Hurry and we'll catch them!
- Why?<eos> - That's rather a long story.<eos> Then tell it.<eos> I will if you sit.<eos> Why is it men always resist doing what's best for them if they think it makes them look weak?
Why is it men always resist doing what's best for them if they think it makes them look weak?<eos> Especially when the advice is advocated by a member of the opposite sex.<eos> I suppose we're just proud.<eos> Well, I'm all for pride, but there are limits.<eos> - I've never known them.
I didn't eat or sleep for a year.<eos> Do not worry. I haven't completely lost it.<eos> Not yet anyway.<eos> You mourn the loss of your power?<eos> I once sensed every element that binds this world, felt them as one breathes air.
I have a book shop.<eos> I love reading.<eos> Especially about theater.<eos> My weakness are the classics.<eos> My wife made me discover them.
Twenty-three of them.<eos> Which means you're going to go back to the station and you're gonna go through every missing persons report for the past two weeks.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> You got it, Parrish?<eos> Who found them?
The Dread Doctors would have designed those talons with a specific frequency.<eos> For a specific person.<eos> As a genetic Chimera yourself, I would've thought you'd understand how often the body rejects an organ.<eos> Especially from an outside donor.<eos> If he puts them on, then...
Somethin' about memories.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Have you ever had a dream that's, that's so real that you thought it was a memory?<eos> Okay, in this dream, I'm lying in bed with Claudia.<eos> It's a couple of weeks before we graduate from college and we're talking about the future and kids and what we'll call them.
Mail!<eos> Hi there, hero.<eos> You've been out a long time.<eos> And if you bring the deserters back to me, then you shall have your leave, Salvatore.<eos> Does the offer still stand if I bring them back dead?
The ancestors, they're close.<eos> Go! Go! Walk in the bar!<eos> You have no right.<eos> Those dark objects are my family's legacy.<eos> Well, that's funny because I seem to remember my brother Kol making them, so perhaps they've been my family's legacy all along.
Go! Go! Walk in the bar!<eos> You have no right.<eos> Those dark objects are my family's legacy.<eos> Well, that's funny because I seem to remember my brother Kol making them, so perhaps they've been my family's legacy all along.<eos> Give them back, or I will take them back, and I swear you will regret this moment.
And as you rot in the ocean, remember my face, Tristan, 'cause it's gonna be the last one that you ever see.<eos> Tristan de Martel guided this organization for centuries.<eos> I will not allow that defeat to hamper our cause.<eos> Those dark objects are my family's legacy.<eos> Give them back or I will take them back and I swear you will regret this moment.
The numbers haven't moved in a week.<eos> I swear it's gonna come down to the 15 remaining undecided voters.<eos> Well, I will hunt them down for you one at a time.<eos> Will you take them to the polling place?<eos> I will carry them on my back if necessary.
I want you to take me to a movie.<eos> I want you to hold my hand in a restaurant.<eos> We should've waited for Spencer.<eos> No, we have to get there before Sara has a chance to take Emily's eggs out of the mini-bar.<eos> I don't think she shoved them in there with those $7 orange juice.
I wanted to see for myself, and I thought maybe there was an old freezer or something down there.<eos> There's nothing. No electricity, no nothing.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> We could've gone with you.<eos> I wanted to go alone, in case I found them.
'What are you doing!<eos> ? ' Let's go, Sergeant.<eos> Erm, where to, sir?<eos> Am I psychic?<eos> Get every available man and spread out till we find them.
Well, I'm pretty sure that threatening the daughter of a police captain isn't legal, counselor.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Overruled.<eos> You know, the fact of the matter is, I've seen your client in his little hidey-hole with his little men.<eos> Ghosts he calls them.
What about the daughter?<eos> Class president, academic decathlete, gymnast, basically a 16-year-old badass in the making.<eos> She never even missed a day of school.<eos> Until her parents met Damien Darhk, I'm guessing.<eos> She said we left them there to die, and we did.
Now that's very important, son.<eos> 'Cause a man's only as good as his savings.<eos> And I never spent the one!<eos> Good man.<eos> Now I want to spend them all.
I know what I'm doing, and, um, maybe I've changed my mind.<eos> You're not saying you want kids?<eos> Are you or...?<eos> (laughs) You should see yourself right now. - It's like sheer panic. - No.<eos> No, I'm not saying I want kids, but would it be so horrible if I did want them someday?
Do you want children?<eos> It's all you talk about.<eos> - That's what I'm doing right now.<eos> - You're right, but you're obsessed with your sister's children.<eos> You asked me what I do, I said I brought them here, I brought them there.
How long have you been drawing these?<eos> My whole life.<eos> Started with stick figures.<eos> Got better as I got older.<eos> My mother hated them.
Chill out, McGruff the Crime Dog.<eos> I rock this stuff like I was born wearing it.<eos> Hey, my sunglasses!<eos> I've been looking for those!<eos> Well, apparently, you missed my face because that's where I've been holding them for you. You stole them.
It can't go on like this !<eos> Stop summoning me to school all the time !<eos> What actually happened ?<eos> He won't wear trunks ?<eos> Make him put them on !
No. No, you can't.<eos> You think of hell as pitchforks and frying pans.<eos> Do you know what the torture really is ?<eos> "The Son of Man shall send forth his angels.<eos> "They shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and shall cast them into a furnace of fire."
We got a great start, and I knew i had a great chance to win.<eos> And now the mclaren mile sport is having gearbox trouble.<eos> Already the Ferrari grip on the race tightens.<eos> The le mans raceing 1965 was an absolute barserker because, the cars were quick, the cars were running quick, but we had all kinds of engine problems and vibrations.<eos> What happened was, they got some new head bolts and they didn't check them out, and all the head bolts stretched.
For the benefit of the tape, we are now showing Mr. Sarwar a CCTV image that we received.<eos> Would you mind having a look at that and telling me whether or not you recognise either of those two men?<eos> The one on the left is Eddie Kerr.<eos> The other one is Danny Torr.<eos> Never seen either of them before.
Okay.<eos> There's no way he's getting off this base unless he learns to fly.<eos> Actually, Daisy could fly him out.<eos> She's nowhere near here.<eos> If she hacked into the Quinjet systems and reprogrammed them for autopilot, she could fly him out from anywhere in the world.
Don't bother to ring the bell.<eos> No, you just walk right on in.<eos> It's that kind of neighborhood.<eos> Savage doesn't think I recognize him, which means he won't try to kill me.<eos> He can't steal my powers before I've found them.
Hypothetically... you could put your house to right with pure iron.<eos> Only the good stuff, mind.<eos> Nothing younger than 200 years or so.<eos> But it'll use your own noise against you now, so you must be careful.<eos> Traffic, talking, children playing... it'll suck up the sounds of life and spit them out as destruction.
He had these rings...silver.<eos> You couldnae miss them.<eos> You living on Shetland?<eos> No. Just...travelling around.<eos> I got them in Lerwick.
You couldnae miss them.<eos> You living on Shetland?<eos> No. Just...travelling around.<eos> I got them in Lerwick.<eos> I didn't know they made them any more.
You sure your boy can handle that?<eos> You just worry about your men.<eos> Make sure they stay away from her.<eos> I don't need 'em complicating things.<eos> My men, they never see the long game. Only care about what satisfies them right now.
Start with him.<eos> He's the one that turned those people into Inhu...<eos> Primitives.<eos> Primitives.<eos> I call them "Primitives."
It's more of a movement.<eos> It's an underground railroad for parents who lost their kids to the court system.<eos> - This is a real thing?<eos> - Since the '70s.<eos> Volunteer families hide the kids, move them from house to house, city to city.
When I got out of the shower, Rhys was on the phone speaking Punjabi.<eos> He thinks I only speak Hindi.<eos> Not that he's ever asked. And what was he saying?<eos> Apparently the diamonds in the bracelet came from India 200 years ago before the British walked in and stole everything.<eos> So he's selling them back?
Which they won't use.<eos> Counterfeiters never use their own money.<eos> You think they'll try to sell it?<eos> Not if they're smart.<eos> Not if the FBI's looking for them.
All right.<eos> I wanted to ask about the clothes that he was wearing that night and if he still has them.<eos> Okay.<eos> I-I think so.<eos> If y'all haven't washed them yet, put them in a paper bag and just tape it closed.
What are you doing down here?<eos> Just looking in the freezer.<eos> Why?<eos> And what are those dead animals doing out?<eos> Maybe because someone took them out of the freezer to make room for something else, something bigger than a dead skunk or pheasant.
You had a big scary slide like this, too?<eos> Not your slide, Steve.<eos> My slide.<eos> My dad wrote these clues for me when I was a kid.<eos> He'd hide them all over the yard, and I'd look for them.
That's beautiful, Mr. Smith.<eos> I believe that I could never buy the mineral rights from you or your son.<eos> Great.<eos> So... about my fence?<eos> Which is why I bought them from their actual owner.
May God, who enlightens every heart, help you know your sins and trust His mercy.<eos> Your sins, Voiello?<eos> Tommasino, don't waste my time.<eos> My sins have to do with high finance and diplomacy.<eos> Even if I were to confess them, you wouldn't understand a thing.
Prepare the Sistine Chapel.<eos> The time has come to address the cardinals.<eos> They're still there.<eos> I'm going to turn around, and they'll still be there.<eos> I'm going to turn around now, and I'll see them:
What did you have me sign the other day?<eos> A simplified procedure for ordaining new priests.<eos> And why did you have me sign it without talking to me about it first?<eos> I had the documents delivered to you the night before.<eos> - I assumed you had read them. - No.
See you around.<eos> You're home from work early.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I, um, left my favorite socks here a few weeks ago.<eos> Was just looking for them.
I mean, we... you know, we accomplished something. We... we took them down.<eos> - Then why does it feel like they're still winning?<eos> That what we did made it worse, not better?<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> We didn't finish them off.
If we're going to even consider doing this, we shouldn't give them any reason to do more damage.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> I'm Chief Technology Officer. I qualify.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> If we're gonna pay these bastards, I want to be the one that faces them.
It doesn't help.<eos> Go on.<eos> Pray.<eos> But pray with your eyes open.<eos> You can spare them.
Now, ever since vampires took over this city, those same spirits have been restless.<eos> And the covens will never know peace with the Mikaelsons living here.<eos> Now, my guess is the Ancestors see Lucien as a weapon.<eos> Use him on vampires, right?<eos> Use him on the family that begot them.
Then do you mean... do we still search through the travellers?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> - No...<eos> - I meant I will take careful action.<eos> We need to capture them in one swoop and not alert them.
I come up positive in the middle of all this?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Just... There used to be signs. You know, you would...<eos> You would put on your corny music or roll a joint or there'd be a bottle of red.<eos> Have the signs changed, or am I missing them?
I sure as hell wouldn't worry about that.<eos> Thank you for traveling with the Transitional Authority's Red Line from Westwood to Larchmont in 15 minutes, all day, every day.<eos> How's the gardening?<eos> Well, that's our business, isn't it?<eos> Planting seeds, watering them, hoping they'll grow into something useful.
"Amor verus numquam moritur."<eos> "True love cannot die."<eos> Oh, how I've missed this jewel.<eos> Now, it's your turn to pay up.<eos> I wish I could retrieve your memories, but I no longer have them.
Oh, how I've missed this jewel.<eos> Now, it's your turn to pay up.<eos> I wish I could retrieve your memories, but I no longer have them.<eos> What? Where are they?<eos> I fed them to a memory demon for safekeeping.
My lair can offer you protection no Shadowhunter ever could. No!<eos> No, I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> Don't be a fool.<eos> Your mother would want you to live.<eos> Then help me get my memories back from whatever demon you gave them to.
Apparently, I'm not the only Shadowhunter who enjoys the company of a Fair Folk.<eos> Maybe if more Shadowhunters exhibited such good taste things would be different today.<eos> The scouts are dead.<eos> That's who you're mourning.<eos> Valentine killed them, right?
I'll talk to my father.<eos> He knows the Law better than anyone.<eos> Sometimes it isn't clear who instigated the fight.<eos> The Accords are a fallacy.<eos> Everything about them, down to the blasphemous magic that binds us all to their stupidity.
Father Lucas!<eos> Father Lucas?<eos> Hi.<eos> Two young boys are at the gate and want to talk to you, they are producing a movie.<eos> You can have them come in, please.
They lied to you.<eos> This is the truth.<eos> The truth is winning.<eos> The police want DNA samples from the team.<eos> If they can't get them willingly, they'll make arrests and file charges.
We can't do that if people aren't acting in concert.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Nobody is trying to hurt your boys.<eos> We're trying to put them in a position where we can use the resources we have to protect them.<eos> So you need to explain to them this is it, or not only will we not protect them... We will put them front and center.
So you believe her disloyal?<eos> What motive does she have to lean to loyalty when she brings you to mind?<eos> We do not act, you and I, whether it is with fury or another's idle tongue-we must ask is all I say.<eos> And this great action you describe?<eos> Our vases, I have a sense of where Croker may have hid them.
What the hell was I supposed to do?<eos> Not kill him, for one.<eos> His use to us dead is exactly nil.<eos> That man, Nathaniel, what... what is it that he hunts?<eos> The chaos back there, the unleashed fighting dogs, he is releasing them, not fighting them.
Do I hear $950?<eos> The new notebooks like Toshiba's T-1000,<eos> Tandy's 1,100-FD and Zenus Mini Sport are in the $1,000 to $2,000 range.<eos> At the high end, about $4,000, Compaq LTE 286.<eos> We had companies like Dell Computer actually begin to build better and better products, and they were selling them at a lower price.
-Yeah, no, not congratulations.<eos> More like con-fuck-ulations... or whatever the opposite of congratulations is.<eos> Why?<eos> You get to go find your kids. You get to fuck 'em up yourself instead of having someone do it for you.<eos> Even I find them, I'm not gonna get 'em.
More like con-fuck-ulations... or whatever the opposite of congratulations is.<eos> Why?<eos> You get to go find your kids. You get to fuck 'em up yourself instead of having someone do it for you.<eos> Even I find them, I'm not gonna get 'em.<eos> The state won't give them over unless I got an apartment.
Okay.<eos> Just for a minute... try... try to be Frank Castle.<eos> To be solely fueled by... by a single cluster of seconds.<eos> One moment in... in your entire life... And every time you close your eyes, you relive that moment.<eos> And every time you open them, you find only the... the briefest peace before you realize that that nightmare is real.
Including the idiot officer that got 'em trapped in the first place.<eos> If you had to sum up Frank Castle, how would you do it?<eos> I would say Frank Castle is a man who would gladly give his life to keep others safe.<eos> And the crimes he's accused of today?<eos> Could the man you knew have committed them?
I'll be thinking of you ♪<eos> - ♪ Look in my heart ♪<eos> - ♪ And let love ♪ - ♪ Keep us together ♪<eos> Your friends have time-jumped away.<eos> We've lost them.
The hell you talking about?<eos> So, answer me this: So, you engage in turf wars, yet nobody actually owns any turf?<eos> Get back, freak!<eos> All right, let's finish this.<eos> And-and those trousers. I mean, you wear them so low that, well, your ass is exposed to other naughty men, and we all know what kind of danger that can bring, don't we? I mean, you can park your bike in there.
I don't know what they are.<eos> Symbols?<eos> Designs maybe?<eos> Well, not a lot of places do that kind of body modification.<eos> Malcolm and I will try to find who put them in.
Did you hear that?<eos> Yeah, generic Satanist.<eos> What about the, uh, subdermals... she know what they mean?<eos> No.<eos> Says Rose brought them in herself. She was super secretive about 'em.
Just don't.<eos> Please.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Miranda Crane is in town.<eos> She is a lightning rod for bigots, hippies and aliens, and yes, that is the order in which I detest them.
You got to shake up the competition.<eos> I'm playing with the depth of field.<eos> Stop covering your cock.<eos> Why am i completely sure that your kids are gonna walk in right now?<eos> Ingrid took them for breakfast at the sherry-netherland And then shopping at schwarz.
You haven't got it in you.<eos> Is it important?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've just Vimmed the sink.<eos> I didn't know which were your favourites... so I got all of them.
I haven't found that bit yet.<eos> Well, you can't have looked very hard.<eos> Is it really all it's cracked up to be?<eos> Someone who's always there for you.<eos> Knows your thoughts before you know them yourself.
I've moved on."<eos> But Mark Hickman hasn't moved on.<eos> He starts following Rachel.<eos> To check on her security.<eos> No, Chief, that's not why guys follow the women who break up with them.
They weren't the only bodies we found.<eos> What the fuck are you talkin' about?<eos> James said he found priests in the basement for an exorcism.<eos> Like fucking human pin cushions, there were garden tools sticking out of them.<eos> So to answer your question, I don't fucking know if she killed them.
It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know.<eos> Stuff no-one else in the world does.<eos> Moving on might be hard, but... ..we have each other.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> Leave your peas if you don't want them, Sophie.
Except for the fact that after we spoke with Mariana, I called Flintwood.<eos> They said you're doing fine... better than fine, actually.<eos> So what the hell is going on?<eos> I didn't want to tell you guys this, but...<eos> Some of the kids on the team take steroids, and they were pressuring me to take them too, so we could be, you know, the strongest team possible. And these kids... they're really good, like, way better than me.
The crisis today is the moments of life. All black folks who are livin' today... Are still not understood by some people to be of the same substance and value as those of other people, mowing' their grass on a Saturday afternoon,<eos> watching the Sun set over the ocean for the first time, singin' in your car, setting' at the table with your granddaughters...<eos> Just being a human being! - Yes!<eos> - Yes. These... these black deaths that we hear about every day now... Go on, now.<eos> [Cheering] And finally, and I'm here to remind our guests, the brave men and women who police our streets... [Cheering] ...and god bless them all sincerely for doin' a job
- All right.<eos> Cops used to be heroes.<eos> Now we're like antibodies.<eos> Body gets sick, body sends in antibodies to deal with it.<eos> After the sickness is taken care of, the body expels the antibodies or destroys them.
Want some?<eos> Do you have ADD or ADHD?<eos> Neither, but I told my doctor I did.<eos> I was like, "I can't concentrate. I keep interrupting my friends when they talk.<eos> It's pissing them off."
- Morning meeting, people, let's go to it, come on.<eos> Paxton.<eos> What have we got?<eos> Not enough at the moment, it seems... So, Chinese contacts, e-mail, coal write, if you have to, ok?<eos> I want results and I want them no, so move!
Can you do that?<eos> - All right, listen up!<eos> - From everything we know, the terrain this side's gonna afford us the most direct approach.<eos> That's gonna make for some hard going.<eos> There are trails. We are staying off them.
The middle of Manhattan around Central Park is basically under our control.<eos> So is Staten Island, Red Hook, parts of Queens near the shore.<eos> We're pushing the munchers further out.<eos> Did you just say "munchers"?<eos> It's something this guy I know calls them.
Our legion is spread out in the grid you suggested.<eos> We are on the highest alert.<eos> You believe the Ancients are located nearby?<eos> I do.<eos> The sun-hunters are clever and elusive, but we've seen them surface near there before, only to lose them each time.
You believe the Ancients are located nearby?<eos> I do.<eos> The sun-hunters are clever and elusive, but we've seen them surface near there before, only to lose them each time.<eos> The Ancients need sustenance, yet cannot forage for themselves. - No!<eos> No, no wait! - So when the hunters go out and search for food, we must track them back to their lair, but without being seen.
They're coming from everywhere, Fet!<eos> - You ready, little bastards? - Forget the wire!<eos> Just pull the pins and toss them!<eos> I gotta make sure that the silver spreads throughout the cavern.<eos> It's gotta go off at the right height, or else we're not going to get all of them.
- Cheers.<eos> Yeah, it's just... mm, yeah.<eos> It's just the GPS tracker on Lobos...<eos> She obviously told the assailants where to find it.<eos> You said you saw them go right for it.
Bled right out.<eos> And what is that?<eos> That's a fog cutter... 10 types of rum.<eos> I didn't know there were 10 types of rum.<eos> Mm, used to be a time I could name them all.
No, that's how, not why.<eos> Your father never told you?<eos> No.<eos> Otto recoded his white blood cells to fight off death.<eos> Now we're using them to fight cancer.
It's...<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw you and screw this.<eos> There were monsters, they were real, and they were after me.<eos> And now no one's gonna stop them.
Yeah. We just want to have a talk with him.<eos> Listen, I can't help you.<eos> We don't mention their names for a reason.<eos> They make all this possible.<eos> We turn them in, we go against our community.
What do you mean?<eos> He was a giant.<eos> Like this.<eos> A-and he killed my friends.<eos> He tore them apart.
I was just talking to her.<eos> I know. You were her last call.<eos> But she had gotten the crime-scene blood results.<eos> We got cut off before she could give me her report.<eos> I had them sent here to me.
The same person lived at them.<eos> Albert Lin lived at the first crime scene from 2008 to 2012.<eos> He lived at the second from 1978 to 1985, and then it was condemned and torn down.<eos> The empty lot.<eos> The only thing these places have in common is that Albert Lin called them home.
He can't stay on the street and - take the blame for what we did.<eos> - He's just a kid.<eos> Children know more than you think.<eos> They know, in their blood, right from wrong and no one pays attention to them.<eos> It makes them invisible. It makes them better fighters.
So what's next?<eos> Like you said... there's going to be thousands with bigger troubles.<eos> Okay.<eos> You checked the explosives?<eos> - Yeah, I just have to rig them up.
Well, you ain't gonna find her, she got murdered.<eos> Yeah, I know, yeah.<eos> What do you know about her?<eos> Selena was working for these guys.<eos> I'd seen them around, didn't like their faces.
It must be urgent.<eos> It is.<eos> A group of Scots raided an English troop encampment to take back some stolen grain and were captured.<eos> Stephan, my father and brothers are among the hostages.<eos> My mother fears Queen Elizabeth will make an example of them.
- They are starving.<eos> - Dear Lord.<eos> These children are victims of the crop blight in Scotland.<eos> Hunger affords even the innocent no mercy.<eos> Neither do you, forcing them to make the arduous journey across the channel.
What do you want, Mr. Lawson?<eos> Well, you know, Ms. Underhill, America loves a good story, especially one with a hero and a villain, but you know what I think they're gonna love even more?<eos> A story with... two heroes.<eos> Thank you for trusting us with your care.<eos> I already said good-bye to them once and then again at the cookout.
In his study.<eos> How long ago is it since you saw his dark grey suit with the blue thread through it?<eos> The fact is, I don't look after his clothes.<eos> He's very...particular.<eos> He presses them himself?
Armed.<eos> One of my men tried to stop them.<eos> And they killed him.<eos> No, please!<eos> In the ensuing struggle I managed to disarm them and killed them myself.
No, no, guys, please.<eos> I'm just really trying to find the writers.<eos> - I'm gonna try them again.<eos> - Oh, uh, the writers?<eos> - Uh, Pache took them out to lunch.
Why?<eos> This is great.<eos> Have some dog.<eos> Why are you not sad?<eos> Because we're gonna destroy them.
Kate was onto Liam.<eos> She started an investigation into his activities - not long before she died.<eos> - How bad is it?<eos> He stole the identities of four of our investors and opened up unlimited lines of credit.<eos> If we can't protect our investors, we'll lose them.
He's in San Diego.<eos> I'm flying out tonight.<eos> Nice.<eos> You need DEA backup on this thing?<eos> Should I call my guys, have them meet you on-site, lend a hand?
If only we could go back to the way things were.<eos> People change, but... when you love somebody that much, hang on.<eos> Don't let go.<eos> What do you say to another drink?<eos> I would love to, but I promised my colleagues that I would help them with a project.
I'm...<eos> I'm... Hey, I know. Maybe I should give the plane tickets to you and Iris.<eos> Nice little romantic getaway.<eos> You two could get started on giving me a grandchild.<eos> No, I want you to use them.
Once they leave the Union, states like North Carolina are just gonna fall in line like trees in a hurricane.<eos> - Don't know nothing about that, ma'am.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> You read the newspapers.<eos> Matilda sneaks them from the kindling. I've seen her.
Fa.<eos> Papa, he trying to take my boy.<eos> Massa Tom, why you start fighting chickens?<eos> Gamecocks, George, not chickens.<eos> And I fight them 'cause they're magic.
Ain't no bird gonna get above him.<eos> Ain't no bird gonna beat him.<eos> You think you can throw me out like some used-up old bird just 'cause you kissing Massa's ass?<eos> I raised these birds since they was chicks.<eos> But I trained them right.
You toss away money like you feeding it to the hens.<eos> All your bragging and carrying on,<eos> I know how much time you spend with my birds.<eos> Folks say birds are stupid.<eos> Birds know who they can trust, know who love them.
Your gloves. You're not wearing gloves.<eos> - Well, I...<eos> I just took them off.<eos> Uh... I don't know. On the way back?<eos> Tony, did you see where Dennis took them off?
A giant thing...<eos> And he got in with the female, and put her in a family way.<eos> And you were... So excited when the bunnies was born.<eos> And then, you came out one morning, and they was all dead.<eos> That bugger got in there in the night and killed them.
Should just make it one country.<eos> Oh, it-- it's okay, boys.<eos> It-- it's just a car.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Loud sounds spook them, and quick movement too, so go slow.
Mrs. Willis, were you going to say something?<eos> What? No, I... It's been a long couple of days.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry. Of course.<eos> Mrs. Said, I can reach you wherever it is you're staying and give you updates as I receive them.
So, is the plant inside the seed?<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> - How does it fit in there?<eos> Well, it's like when you were a baby, and me and your mum, we fed you, gave you milk to drink and then you grew from this to this!<eos> It's the same with these seeds - we'll water them, keep them warm, then they'll grow.
But that was, like, the most important thing to you.<eos> I can't have my vagina associated with palm oil.<eos> Done.<eos> So I can have my paintings back?<eos> I will put them in your car myself.
Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> One day you're going to get out of the house and meet real people.<eos> And Chris, the boxes are still here.<eos> You said you'd sort them.
MAN: (OVER LOUDSPEAKER) Attention!<eos> Processing of women and children civilians will commence immediately.<eos> Have all personal papers ready. LIZ:<eos> You're wasting battery.<eos> They're not going to let us keep them.
Keep in family groups and you will be processed shortly.<eos> Kath.<eos> I've just been working at the hospital.<eos> Three soldiers have been hit by a petrol bomb.<eos> I heard them describe who did it.
The more we have, the stronger we are.<eos> Hey, these guys are hardcore.<eos> They've got tanks and assault rifles.<eos> We've got something for shooting rabbits.<eos> And you want to talk about numbers - they've got them, not us.
Yeah!<eos> Let's go. Come on.<eos> Good job. Sam got the elevator.<eos> Those guys, they're everywhere, OK?<eos> I saw them in the monitor.
- No, it wasn't.<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad! Dad!<eos> Three soldiers have been hit by petrol bombs.<eos> I heard them describe who did it.
- I can't do this.<eos> - Yes, you can!<eos> Other countries won't get involved.<eos> Don't we have treaties?<eos> I can't really see them rushing in and dying to save us.
After what he's been through?<eos> Maybe it's not so bad.<eos> - Yeah, how's that?<eos> - Now we have someone on the inside.<eos> If the prisoners know we're trying to break them out during work detail, we'll have a better shot.
Maybe it's not so bad.<eos> - Yeah, how's that?<eos> - Now we have someone on the inside.<eos> If the prisoners know we're trying to break them out during work detail, we'll have a better shot.<eos> But when we get them out, where do we hide them?
He wanted to protect you.<eos> We... We all just want to protect the ones we love.<eos> I can't stop thinking about my brothers.<eos> Still out there.<eos> No one is protecting them.
He had the crowd calling for the Queen's head.<eos> After we get Aramis back, we need to recover the Spaniards.<eos> In the wrong hands they could be used against Her Majesty.<eos> He's right.<eos> They're not going to just hand them back to us.
When the time is right, perhaps we can use them as proof of the Queen's desire to appease her brother at France's expense.<eos> We will be the heroes.<eos> Better make sure the Musketeer doesn't die until after the handover.<eos> Don't disappoint him, Grimaud.<eos> We'll use Aramis to draw his friends close, then slaughter them all.
Why, so you can tell me that it's only available online?<eos> Sir, is there a problem?<eos> Yes, there's a problem.<eos> Nothing on the website is in the store.<eos> Well, some items, like the throw pillows, are online exclusives from our warehouse, meaning if you want them you can purchase them online.
Oh, well, my mother was hot for everyone, except for my father.<eos> Yeah, so not a... not a great example for me, if you know what I'm saying.<eos> Hey, I think Dean's lucky to have parents - who are still in love.<eos> - Oh. Mine never really were.<eos> It's great, you know, until you walk into them one day when you're home for Christmas and you see them doing things you never want to see again.
That's what you found on his phone?<eos> I thought you were just gonna get his contacts.<eos> Yeah, I was, okay?<eos> But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.
What are you doing?<eos> ! - Is that Stacey North?<eos> - Yep.<eos> That's her.<eos> Oh, why is she licking the bagels and putting them back?
- All right, okay. Look, they just want to feel like they're being heard.<eos> Don't say "no" to their notes.<eos> Just try something like, "Well, that's interesting.<eos> Let me think about it."<eos> Then can I ignore them and do whatever I want?
What, are you jogging with leprechauns?<eos> Well, these are the only things that match.<eos> Except they don't. Did your mother lay out your clothes every morning, too?<eos> [Chuckling] No.<eos> Sometimes she laid them out the night before.
Then why is he on the run?<eos> Flowers for Peter Hudson.<eos> Yeah, just put them anywhere.<eos> Wait. What's all this?<eos> I didn't know what kind of flowers you liked, so I got them all.
In China, when somebody dies, we get rid of bad spirits with fireworks.<eos> We don't need that.<eos> Hello, Mr Detective.<eos> Evening.<eos> Is it true that you catch missing cats and don't bring them back?
They've got to go somewhere.<eos> Outdoors?<eos> Where they came from?<eos> God!<eos> One collects them, the other executes them.
Well, there weren't any Finns.<eos> Anyway, he seems to enjoy being strong and silent and... well... male.<eos> - So he's like Mr Darcy, in ...<eos> - Yes, I know what book Mr Darcy is in! Thank you.<eos> And for all the failings of English men, at least I understand them.
He thinks he's special.<eos> That it's him the demons are feared of.<eos> - I'm just scared you're not gonna be able...<eos> - Then go.<eos> Fear gives them strength, and if that's what you bring here, I don't need you!
Sir, are you all right?<eos> I'm quite all right.<eos> Really, there's no need to make fuss.<eos> Is there someone I can call?<eos> 'Harry Selfridge doesn't so much push boundaries of good taste as dance across them with a cocktail in one hand and a chorus girl in the other.'
Kentucky, you have 53 votes.<eos> How do you cast them?
The Commonwealth of Kentucky, home of the Derby, the Wildcats, and the birthplace of bourbon, for Vice President of the United States casts 13 votes for Secretary of State Catherine Durant,<eos> 11 for Senator Joseph Baker of Nevada, nine for Governor Randall Smith of West Virginia, seven apiece for Governor Jill Haley of Florida and Congresswoman Sharon Pierce of California, five for one of our own, the Mayor of Louisville, Jill Carson,<eos> and one vote for the First Lady of these United States, Mrs. Claire Underwood.<eos> Louisiana, you have 61 votes.<eos> How do you cast them?
Although President Underwood's critical condition pushed him to the top of the donor list, he was fortunate to have received a donation in time.<eos> Many status one, or most in-need patients do not receive a transplant in time to save their lives.<eos> - Tennessee!<eos> You have 77 votes.<eos> How do you cast them?
Let's talk once we get the final numbers.<eos> Will do.<eos> Bye. Texas, you have 237 votes.<eos> Do you have my call list for tonight?<eos> How do you cast them?
Unbelievable!<eos> Well, not so unbelievable.<eos> Forty-four votes for Catherine Durant, 35 votes for Claire Underwood.<eos> Louisiana, you have 61 votes.<eos> How do you cast them?
Yeah...<eos> We are. We are safe.<eos> Let us delight in that.<eos> 900 days we were apart.<eos> And I counted them, every one, and I bled each and every hour.
Jabas Starling ran away.<eos> Inspector Reid has taken leave of his senses not for the first time.<eos> Deaths.<eos> They are not marked here.<eos> He is not taking them to the pits, or he must document them.
Inspector Reid has taken leave of his senses not for the first time.<eos> Deaths.<eos> They are not marked here.<eos> He is not taking them to the pits, or he must document them.<eos> Where's he putting them?
- It is that.<eos> I can't help but wonder why a speedster needs a car.<eos> Because I am no longer a speedster.<eos> You've lost your powers?<eos> I gave them up to save Wally, Joe's son.
It's not a... it's not a big deal or anything.<eos> Sounds like a big deal to me.<eos> - I got nine subscribers.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't even know three of them.
Okay.<eos> - [sighs] I hate balloons.<eos> - Well, we need them.<eos> Balloons are like our souls.<eos> They want to go up, but can't, and when you pop them, they scream.
Cool.<eos> Hey, can I talk to you for a quick minute?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> You don't notice anything different about Dennis's dogs, by any chance?<eos> - Nope. - I was walking them the other day, and we ran into this little Jack Russell Terrier.
Bravo!<eos> The crowd's cheers heralded the arrival of the King's car, bringing Their Majesties and Princess Margaret to the airport for a last farewell to the Royal travelers.<eos> Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were off on a Commonwealth journey.<eos> Nineteen hours later, the Royal plane landed at Nairobi.<eos> Ahead of them lay a 30,000-mile trip that will take them, in five months, to four continents.
That I know of.<eos> Really?<eos> You know, what you do with grown kids?<eos> Guilt trip.<eos> Make them feel guilty.
Really?<eos> You know, what you do with grown kids?<eos> Guilt trip.<eos> Make them feel guilty.<eos> Make them feel like absolute shit.
- Don't, Hannah.<eos> Don't get weak on me.<eos> I can confirm that that is an area where our focus is, but that's about as much detail as I can go into.<eos> Have the kidnappers made contact?<eos> And if so, did you put them in touch with Ahmadi?
If the media plays that video, I look like a traitor.<eos> We tell them it's a precondition.<eos> If they share it, the deal is off.<eos> How do I know you won't?<eos> I can't force you to believe me... but we are hours from finding them.
How do you do it?<eos> How do you deal with all this nonsense?<eos> Oh, well...<eos> You know, it's like feeding animals at the zoo.<eos> Dangle a couple kippers out for them and they dance and keep them locked up in their cages the rest of the day.
It's gonna be okay.<eos> No, not if OPM knows they're alive.<eos> Did you actually see Caleb check "yes" for deceased?<eos> There's no way that Caleb would do something like that.<eos> He knows what my parents mean to me. He's the whole reason that I met them.
Easy does it, buddy.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Found him.<eos> He's clear.<eos> "Do you understand your rights as I've explained them?"
Don't listen to her.<eos> Let go of the trigger.<eos> Think of the families.<eos> Are you a mother?<eos> Think of all the children that are waiting for them to come home.
Wow, okay. You're gonna deflect by bringing up my resurrected parents?<eos> Caleb said you still haven't reached out to them.<eos> Don't you at least want to know why they left?<eos> How do you know that they'd even tell me the truth?<eos> I mean, it would be one thing if I could look them in the eye, but it's not like I can ask them to risk coming to the U.S. to show up for my graduation.
I mean, it would be one thing if I could look them in the eye, but it's not like I can ask them to risk coming to the U.S. to show up for my graduation.<eos> You could fly to them.<eos> And miss my last few weeks of training? No.<eos> T...<eos> I don't know them.
Not now, Alex.<eos> Her parents, Laura and Glenn Wyatt?<eos> They're still alive.<eos> They faked their death after 9/11 because they were selling weapons to the Taliban.<eos> For 15 years, Shelby's been protecting them, moving illegal money.
If you'll just take a seat, I'll put your name on the list.<eos> Go!<eos> Well, you can attack me all you want, Shelby. We both know you're not answering the question.<eos> My parents are dead.<eos> They died five months ago in a small plane crash in Jordan trying to outrun authorities that had been chasing them since they escaped.
It's twice what it should be.<eos> Respiration is off the charts for a human being.<eos> The way he's changing, the heightened metabolism, accelerated healing...<eos> We saw that in other animals.<eos> Yeah, mutation made them better, stronger, right?
Thanks.<eos> But I think he was right.<eos> My life is a failure.<eos> Well, you still got your kids.<eos> Yeah. I mean, I know you don't see them much, but that's just a phase.
They fucking left us.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I checked... They're gone.<eos> I went around every single bar I could find, which was one, and nothing, nobody's seen them.
- Okay.<eos> - This a bad time? No, no, no.<eos> We gotta get this done.<eos> So have you told the kids about Ty?<eos> No, I just... I wanna wait till we find them, and the longer they're out there, the harder that's gonna be, so let's get this affidavit filed and we can get this arrest warrant.
Yes, sir.<eos> They're here.<eos> Think the mission's compromised?<eos> I'm not sure. - No.<eos> They got no idea we're after them.
They're here.<eos> Think the mission's compromised?<eos> I'm not sure. - No.<eos> They got no idea we're after them.<eos> By the way, why were we after them?
I was brought in to assess the books by an antiques dealer friend of mine.<eos> They were hidden in the attic of the house.<eos> - Then Josef must have been a Grimm or a relative of one.<eos> - I mean, he could have inherited them, had no idea what they were.<eos> - However he got them is not important. The fact that they exist is a miracle.
♪ I am sorry.<eos> I get carried away.<eos> - How much do you want for the books?<eos> - Well, handling such material is very dangerous.<eos> But in spite of the fact that they are priceless, I will let you have them for $100,000.
- You tell them anything?<eos> Oh, God, you don't think they could find him because I made that phone call.<eos> They could've gotten a lot of information about your uncle.<eos> - Well, if these guys are Black Claw, maybe HW's got something on them.<eos> - Well, your uncle bloodied them up, so... one or both of them could be needing a little medical help.
To bring doctors in from the university?<eos> I don't approve it.<eos> Why?<eos> These men... Are doctors in classrooms.<eos> They look after books. And an audience. I've rarely seen them care for the sick.
So, what do you bench press anyways, Cameron?<eos> Why?<eos> Saul the Tarsus, later known as the apostle, Paul. He hated this new religion called Christianity.<eos> As for Saul, he made havoc of the Church.<eos> Entering into every house, and hailing men and women, committed them to prison.
This one usually stays in the bag though 'cause three phones would look ridiculous.<eos> Plus, you pretty much got the day-to-day handled over there anyway.<eos> Well, not today.<eos> The bookkeeper dropped off these spreadsheets.<eos> I need you to decipher them, please.
They don't want to earn their way to the top.<eos> They just want to leapfrog up there.<eos> So I did what I had to do.<eos> But, yes, I should have told you.<eos> I'll never take them again.
It's not just what Keller said about how I live like a 20-year-old.<eos> It's also what Whitcomb reminded me of.<eos> How I wanted to live.<eos> It sounds like you had very specific goals when you worked in Brooklyn.<eos> Yeah, but why did I abandon them when I left?
Okay, so we have to coordinate efforts...<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> I was, uh... I was just looking for my files.<eos> Your files?<eos> Yeah. I sent them over to 125th yesterday.
Only a handful of people knew about the Meliorn op.<eos> And everyone knows she's sleeping with him.<eos> You know what, Lydia?<eos> You're no better than Valentine.<eos> But at least he had the guts to tell Downworlders to their faces he wanted them all dead.
At her request, yes.<eos> And I knew it was only a matter of time before you came to me looking for the antidote.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> My friends, Jace Wayland and Magnus Bane.<eos> They were with me, but I lost them in the fire.
He was set up by his own partner, Tommy Markin.<eos> I spent all these years wanting to believe that he died for the right thing.<eos> I'm not so sure now.<eos> Principles are a bitch, man.<eos> I avoid them at all cost.
Sorry.<eos> Is this about the headphones?<eos> - What headphones?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I didn't take them.
It is I who should ask your forgiveness.<eos> The greatest kindness you could do Honoria is to save her from the name Barbary.<eos> FRANCES:<eos> Papa? HONORIA: Whatever do you mean?<eos> These gentlemen say that you are expecting them.
Of course we're happy.<eos> I could not be more so.<eos> And yet?<eos> My brother will not forgive me. And Andrew's children decline to meet me.<eos> Not that I blame them.
The fox led us a merry dance, but we got him in the end.<eos> You were expecting Mr Tankard?<eos> He will no longer attend.<eos> I feel, as a principal shareholder, it befits me to take a more robust interest from now on.<eos> Perhaps you will kindly outline your suggestions and I shall give them my best consideration.
I'd always wondered what it was like for Brian, when he was on NZT.<eos> I figured he felt numb, like a human calculator.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Every part of you feels alive, open... the air crackles with information.<eos> You breathe it like it's oxygen. It's as if you'd been running with weights on for your entire life, and suddenly, you took them off, and this was the way you always were meant to be.
You can't take NZT anymore.<eos> Okay, so, let's review.<eos> Jarrod Sands... and a group of five or more other people are holding Piper Baird, who, as most of you know, is kind of my girlfriend.<eos> Anyway, Sands is in jail, and he's not talking, so we don't know who the other members are.<eos> Thus, I have decided that we will refer to them as... the Legion of...
You know, before she died, she confessed something to me.<eos> That attack on...<eos> On Ada Pavlovik, years ago...<eos> It was her.<eos> He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
Why?<eos> He's his religious counsel.<eos> Why don't you get to your point, Sarah?<eos> What if Tom's behind the killings?<eos> He's orchestrating them from behind bars... having someone... carry them out?
Alison Sutherland lied, Marjorie Travers.<eos> So, what, you think this is some big conspiracy?<eos> Connect the dots.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> Why don't you connect them for me?
The pledgets we use have radio-opaque threads.<eos> They show up on X-ray.<eos> I called Dr. Bell. She said Hope Zion's never even used these pledgets before.<eos> So, how did it get inside her?<eos> Well, Dr. Bell said they still use them in The Caribbean,
That's all right. I grew up with brothers.<eos> Says that you, uh, live on the west side.<eos> That's a long way to come to Hope Zion.<eos> The doctors at the Gen are all quacks. - Mm.<eos> - My mother hates them.
My parents are bad, but even they don't deserve to be turned to stone.<eos> Curse you, Bill!<eos> Why must you take everything we love?<eos> Guys, don't you see?<eos> Our friends need us, but we only save them if we fight back!
This one does.<eos> She's got all the control now.<eos> She'll be coming.<eos> Okay, so I didn't have much time with the notes.<eos> Phyllis gave them to me this morning.
In my old hood, they called me the sales tiger.<eos> I could sell anything.<eos> I once sold a comb to your bald-head daddy.<eos> I think we got this.<eos> Yeah, I got a Saturday meeting today, so your bald-headed daddy is gonna take those cookies in to my co-workers and unload them on them.
You started with a lesson about selling cookies.<eos> Now the D.A. is involved.<eos> Is this even about Maizy anymore?<eos> Cheaters need to pay.<eos> And if you don't call them out, they're just as guilty.
What were all that about?<eos> Just stuff getting on top of me.<eos> Well, don't let it.<eos> Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say because you're a man.<eos> And men never let stuff get on top of 'em, so it doesn't affect them.
Just stuff getting on top of me.<eos> Well, don't let it.<eos> Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say because you're a man.<eos> And men never let stuff get on top of 'em, so it doesn't affect them.<eos> You mean, men don't get things out of proportion, so it doesn't affect them.
Shit.<eos> That's why he tried to whack venganza.<eos> He knew it would force a meeting of the lords.<eos> Those skulls are her bodyguards.<eos> He sent them back with her.
I'm Holly, his girlfriend.<eos> Is that my mother's ring?<eos> Yeah, I bought it out of hock, where you put it, and then I gave it to her.<eos> Look, Ma, Holly and I got a lot to do today.<eos> As soon as Tasha brings the checks over, I'll bring them by, okay?
The world is changing, Miss Fletcher.<eos> Science got sexy.<eos> Yeah, but your benefactors- I can't seem to find any of them.<eos> Very simple reason for that.<eos> I killed them all, buried them in my back yard.
No man worthy of the title leaves a baby alone.<eos> - How did you find me?<eos> - I tracked the gemstone inside you.<eos> Your powers, they don't belong in this world.<eos> They're an anomaly. You promised me you'd never use them.
A horrible, nasty job. Tell 'em.<eos> Tell 'em about her blood.<eos> Tell 'em why she's out there struttin' around in that little girl's body.<eos> When the culebra Lords came to our realm,<eos> Amaru followed them here.
You said he was the slave master.<eos> Where are the slaves?<eos> Shit.<eos> They were all in here.<eos> (sighs) She's already taken them.
All behind us.<eos> Hugo's got a crew I'ma hook up with, and I don't know how many guys.<eos> He's not what you'd call a communicator.<eos> So you link up with Hugo's crew as planned.<eos> I'll help ambush them, take over the prison break.
I organized my escape.<eos> I know every detail of the government's plan to move me.<eos> Yeah, we know you got a fucking rat on the inside.<eos> Mm-hmm, and when my "rat" on the inside realizes that I haven't made it to my destination, he's gonna get Angela's beautiful brown eyes, you know?<eos> He's gonna come out, and he's gonna scoop them out and fuck it.
It's round the corner from Downey's hotel.<eos> Police collected fragmentary evidence from the scene.<eos> You sound surprised.<eos> Some constables embrace Sherlock Holmes's methods.<eos> The majority renounce them.
I'll go. You stay with Adam.<eos> I'll return him.<eos> Mm.<eos> What do you do with the cupcakes you don't sell?<eos> Uh, we donate them to a food bank.
No, but my son had his appendix out when he was five.<eos> I'm pretty sure I didn't put it back in.<eos> Uh, you have three kids, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Maybe you mixed them up.
I was looking out for those kids.<eos> Yeah? In the supply closet?<eos> Jordan and Travis come from dysfunctional homes.<eos> There were abuse issues.<eos> I helped them through it.
Honey, I said that when you didn't need the surgery, when I was trying to talk you out of doing something that wasn't necessary, when having it wasn't potentially going to save your life.<eos> This is different.<eos> The result is the same.<eos> You know, I'm gonna have scars and I'm gonna have hard, artificial breasts that I can't even feel.<eos> I won't have nipples unless I get them tattooed on.
He said he'd die if I left.<eos> What about Lesley?<eos> She's lost the will to live.<eos> If she and Trevor were to die, the children could have no better parents than you and me.<eos> Now what if we could help them?
Emme...<eos> Okay.<eos> Preliminary exam confirms these bodies match those previously found.<eos> I need full forensics.<eos> The more we know about how our team took them out, the safer we'll be on our next op.
If it is a trick, how is it done?<eos> Oh, you're not buying into this, are you?<eos> Well, either you're right and she's kidnapped Helena Wood or you're wrong and we need her help.<eos> Another girl is missing?<eos> Yes. So if the spirits really can help you, let them.
No, of course not.<eos> Wait, you taking advantage of me?<eos> I'm a passionate woman.<eos> It's in my blood.<eos> I have urges and sometimes I act on them.
Confined to that dreary hotel room, I'd grown desperate. But I went only to the butcher shop.<eos> Bram, your teeth they're like fangs.<eos> I've always had bad teeth.<eos> They've grown worse in recent years.<eos> I hide them, by not smiling or engaging in conversation.
That needs a cool head.<eos> And you are a hot flush.<eos> Do you know the most frequent customers to my shop are from Parliament and the pulpit?<eos> The men who uphold the social order of this country are not only rank hypocrites, but their tastes... ..beyond the limit.<eos> I'd have them dragged out into plain sight and torn apart.
Ah, pain.<eos> Pain...<eos> Pain...<eos> Is this the place?<eos> Is this the wicked place where they lock them up, Mr Verloc?
To raise capital in preparation for war.<eos> What war?<eos> Ours.<eos> Holt just gave us a detailed list of every member of the Vehm.<eos> So it'll just be a matter of time before we have them all in custody.
I was in a hurry, and I must have put the ring in my pocket--<eos> Would you mind turning those off?<eos> I'd be delighted.<eos> Hey, we know your gang is hitting jewelry stores all over the city.<eos> All right, I want names, and I want them right now.
Once upon a time, there lived a woman in the woods.<eos> She was neither purely evil, nor purely good.<eos> She gathered unwanted children and gave them a home in which to stay.<eos> She promised them they'd live forever and a day.<eos> She changed them into colors, so beautiful, so bold.
I'm more of a Wizard of Oz fan.<eos> You just can't beat a farm girl in great shoes.<eos> Every culture has their version of a mythic creature who takes children. The Germans have Der Grossmann, the Mexicans-<eos> - La Llorona.<eos> But there are whispers that Lady Ambrosia is not a myth, that there's a real woman out there-- takes unwanted children and raises them with the promise of eternal youth.
- Now--<eos> - Now wha--<eos> Make her go to sleep.<eos> I think Mother hurts the children.<eos> I don't think she turns them into butterflies.
They're homeless.<eos> I'll call you when I decide to race the Iditarod.<eos> Ah, you know what?<eos> Forget it.<eos> Just forget it. I'll take them back.
If they have Ethan, if he leads them here...<eos> Well, you can't let that happen.<eos> You know, what we do matters.<eos> Unwanted children feel loved here.<eos> We keep them safe until... we have to let them go.
- They remind me of...<eos> - The finger painting.<eos> That's the same pattern that was painted on Ethan and the other two kids who escaped.<eos> Same dark edges, same spotting.<eos> So whoever was holding these kids was painting them like butterflies.
They help prepare for the celebration while the wrapping of the butterfly child continues.<eos> Where is she?<eos> We call it The Colony-- an abandoned schoolhouse, Route 2 south of Richmond.<eos> After our son died... she wanted to save other children.<eos> She turns them into butterflies, sets them free s-so they can stay children forever.
We have a major national security breach, anybody with a tree to shake's been ordered to shake it, see if anything falls out.<eos> This is the Reddington tree.<eos> How can we help?<eos> Two known terrorists penetrated the Port of Tampa 14 hours ago.<eos> German BND had them hard on the radar and we lost them.
Two known terrorists penetrated the Port of Tampa 14 hours ago.<eos> German BND had them hard on the radar and we lost them.<eos> The terrorists?<eos> No. The Germans.<eos> Seems someone some leaked documents implicating them in a cover-up, and they think it was us.
Luckily for you, Harold, I poke my thumb in many pies.<eos> This one is particularly profitable, so I've associated myself with some of the players.<eos> Can your associates find the truck?<eos> Their methods are breathtakingly simple.<eos> Place their own tracking devices on cargo containers, track them out of the port, and attack them when they're most vulnerable.
I have to get back to you on that.<eos> Nik, do something.<eos> I checked with Aram.<eos> Those cables belong to a cross-country fiber optic network.<eos> Whoever tapped them can intercept digital communications across half the eastern seaboard. Hold on.
What is that?<eos> It's an old telecom project to provide data coverage to every corner of the Earth through a network of 73 satellites.<eos> Anyway, the company went bankrupt and the project was abandoned.<eos> But the 73 satellites are still out there.<eos> You think our target is using them?
So the Russian diplomats tattooed her, wiped her memory, and dropped her in Times Square to help them smuggle?<eos> She hasn't been with us long enough to be useful to them.<eos> She doesn't have any access to the intel they'd need.<eos> Her tattoos led us to the Russians!<eos> They're solving crimes, not enabling them.
He was going for his gun.<eos> He's dead.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> Sloane and her team are gonna pick up the Russian diplomats.<eos> If they don't go down for smuggling, we've got them on espionage and conspiracy.
Becca has us.<eos> Those -- those boys -- they need me.<eos> You know, and you -- T-they need somebody like you, too, at that school.<eos> Yeah, documenting the sins.<eos> I'm not leaving them.
Nobody visits me anymore.<eos> The 67 paintings that you gave me in 1945 for the first exhibition are here in storage.<eos> I will put these here too.<eos> They will be safe.<eos> Safe, but no one will see them here...
Your phone?<eos> The car keys.<eos> - And his glasses, where are they?<eos> - I've got them.<eos> Come, I'll give them to you.
- They get this from somewhere.<eos> You wanna blame someone?<eos> You wanna blame people?<eos> You have pushed those kids away from you.<eos> This last year, you have shoved them away.
Then you need to stand up for what's right, not for what's black.<eos> Y'all need to respect.<eos> If you handled your kids better...<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. L-listen, it's not about that.<eos> You pull our kids out of school, you suspend them, - you were name calling.
Have fun.<eos> Uh, Grace?<eos> Did I leave my glasses just over...?<eos> Well...<eos> I-I-I'm just gonna check - if maybe I left them in Leslie's...
I'm trusting.<eos> I-I really am. Very trusting.<eos> But I'm not stupid.<eos> So you know, Leslie... she's very careful.<eos> Any documents that might be in her office end of the day, she'll shred them.
All you care about is winning.<eos> The story plays really well, though.<eos> Heartbroken father who builds ships in a bottle reconstructs incriminating evidence so he may speak truth to power.<eos> But sooner or later, people are gonna put together his wife manipulates images for a living.<eos> So they create some documents, shred them, then put them back together.
But... how... how is that...<eos> You were born in Pretoria, South Africa.<eos> Your real name is Alice Kruger.<eos> Your birth parents were antiapartheid activists.<eos> The government had them killed... in your own home.
Otherwise, our best bet is to catch the hacker.<eos> Why... why is she here?<eos> She's FBI. - Where's my sketch guy?<eos> - Dev quit. He moved back to Oregon with his cats.<eos> This one will tattle to all her little FBI friends. Next thing you know, this whole place will be infested with them.
No job for me?<eos> I need you to help me up.<eos> I think I'm stuck down here.<eos> What are you really up to, Red?<eos> When my boys were little and we lived in a shit neighborhood, I kept them busy.
It's cold.<eos> Big city?<eos> Little.<eos> Do you like tacos?<eos> I've been making them at least once a week because they were Adam's favorite, but...
Thank you, Principal Egan.<eos> I'd like to use this tree dedication to honor Adam's love of learning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My, um... my son would be honored.<eos> I hope other students are inspired by Adam's example to put down roots of their own in pursuit of whatever makes them passionate.
Don't know him.<eos> When do they start counting all the votes?<eos> - Not till the poles close. - Oh.<eos> I never knew how it all worked.<eos> Did he make you wear them a lot?
Very important to a beekeeper, but it's not the last thing<eos> I wanted to have said to the love of my life... the man who wakes up singing in falsetto.<eos> I kid you not.<eos> "It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day."<eos> The idiot who asked me to marry him three days after we met, and the sap who makes the same disgusting molasses Christmas cookies every year because his grandmother made them, and I eat them.
Humans respond to fear in two simple ways:<eos> fight or flight.<eos> _<eos> Our friends used to tease us that they didn't like socializing with Matt and I because we were too perfect.<eos> They'd get in fights in the car on the way home from dinner with us because... we made them feel like they weren't as in love as Matt and I were.
So, you helped him build this?<eos> And you didn't tell me?<eos> It was a theoretical conversation.<eos> I drew up some preliminary plans.<eos> I didn't know he was gonna use them.
- Ralph?<eos> - What the hell is taking so long, man?<eos> - We got the cash from the ATM, but the mom, she's all upset, and she wants to talk to the kids before she goes in.<eos> - No. No, that's not part of the deal.<eos> She sees them after.
No. Now!<eos> I have to know they're okay.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - It's under control, Joe.<eos> She just wants proof that we didn't kill them.
- Negative. She did say this is going to be a crazy weekend with the boys.<eos> Something about a kung fu workshop.<eos> Taekwondo tournament.<eos> - Yeah, like I said.<eos> - Alicia's taking them today.
No probation. Nothing.<eos> All thanks to his father.<eos> Which is why Michael Dunham had to die.<eos> He paid off those cops.<eos> I begged for them to get justice for my family and they told me to let it go.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't want to argue over something that's actually a good thing, so...<eos> I made what you wanted.<eos> Was very sweet, but I felt bad about changing your work, so I went ahead and sent in the original drawings.<eos> And they loved them. - Really?
One of my agents consulted him.<eos> Yes, consulted him, a civilian.<eos> And you consented to this?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's also come to my attention that Special Agent Patterson removed several highly classified files from this office illegally and left them in Mr. Wagner's possession.
- I know that.<eos> - No.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> I know how freeing it must seem to walk away from all of this, but running from your problems doesn't fix them.
We just got played.<eos> Oh, my God, that was exhilarating!<eos> - You got 'em?<eos> - Oh, no, the paintings!<eos> Yes, I have them.
And as we all know, he's pretty comfortable taking risks.<eos> What about the paintings?<eos> The Degas was real.<eos> Why were the others fakes?<eos> They weren't, until Crab scanned them, which I was very strongly against, if you'll recall, and he was very particular about what order we did them in.
- you won't ask a ton of questions? - Okay.<eos> I was wrong about my parents.<eos> They weren't interested in getting to know me. - They just wanted my money again.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I thought when you met them, everything was fine. And...
That's Ryan's truck.<eos> Open the passenger door.<eos> You had your chance, Alex.<eos> Get in.<eos> You have more instructions, and if you don't follow them to the letter, I'll kill Simon and set the nuke off right now.
Hey.<eos> Bro, what's up?<eos> You're fired.<eos> What?<eos> We will pack your personal effects and have them brought to the house.
A few are abandoned or closed for renovations.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the unsub passed up secluded areas where he could have delayed the discovery of the bodies.<eos> Instead, he did the opposite.<eos> He left them in public places.
Just visiting.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> You are standing in the middle of Main Street, so, you know...<eos> I must say, I do love the irony of your job.<eos> You watching children, keeping them safe, keeping them close.
You keep your eyes open, watch what we do, and you lend a hand where you can.<eos> You can start by bringing water to those men.<eos> There's just too much spoil to move.<eos> So, I was wondering about rigging a rail line, the type that miners use for ore carts?<eos> The Army used them for short-run cargo, so I imagine they've got some going a-begging.
I'm going to apply a small amount of Neomycin...<eos> Yes, I know the process.<eos> And you're a pale shade of CASTOR, aren't you?<eos> Your brothers may be lackeys, but at least they're men.<eos> As I have never met them, I don't carry the same... antipathy towards my siblings as you.
She'll be safer with her own people.<eos> And we'll be safer without her.<eos> You need to keep your distance from Maggie and stay focused on your work here at Hilltop.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> We don't bury our dead. We burn them.
Shit!<eos> Psst! You know, from this angle, your nose hairs are pretty prominent, no?<eos> -Oh, my God.<eos> -Look at that.<eos> - Well, she used to trim them.
I wanna take a shower.<eos> Feel like myself again.<eos> And then tomorrow, I'm gonna wake up and try to see all my kids.<eos> Walk across all five boroughs if I have to.<eos> I'm gonna tell them I'm gonna get them the fuck out of foster care.
Are you trying to get fired, Nancy?<eos> Oh, we know you can't fire anyone.<eos> Louis also paged me that.<eos> Fire won't kill a pigeon.<eos> I've seen them shuffling out of burning buildings in Kuwait.
Can I get a babyccino and the check?<eos> What do you mean you can't spend time alone with the kids?<eos> They love you.<eos> You're their favorite.<eos> Yeah, that's because I only see them for a little bit every night.
They love you.<eos> You're their favorite.<eos> Yeah, that's because I only see them for a little bit every night.<eos> I give them a tight-two.<eos> I blow in, dazzle them with a two-minute tornado of fun, then get out.
You're always around.<eos> You're my buffer... The bad cop to my good cop.<eos> Wait, I thought I was the good cop...<eos> Enforcing rules so that they can learn to live in society.<eos> You're the bad cop... Giving them treats and then confusing them by making them think frogs can say the name of a beer.
Of course.<eos> There's plenty of tables.<eos> Sit anywhere you like.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't know if you know this, we don't get tips on those orders, so if you let them eat here, we'll have to clean up after as if they dined in.
How long until you can see my husband?<eos> We're pretty backed up.<eos> I'm gonna guess a good six hours.<eos> Six hours?<eos> We don't normally take people who let their children cut their cast off because they were afraid of boring them and move them to the top of the list.
I was just encouraging his love for the game, which would hopefully turn into a lifelong father-son connection.<eos> You made it into a competitive thing.<eos> We're both mad at Emery, I know, but at least we get to go to his matches and watch him win.<eos> Did you bring my glasses?<eos> Yes, I-I got them, I got them.
We use it to cool the Core conduits.<eos> And you built this whole thing yourself?<eos> That is impressive.<eos> I got you some guys.<eos> Where do you want to put them?
They're signaling one another.<eos> They're trying to box us in.<eos> Feeders are smart that way. Way worse than ferals.<eos> We'll never make it if we stick together.<eos> I'll hold them here. You get them back safely.
It's radiation.<eos> It's radiation!<eos> This whole place is contaminated.<eos> What?<eos> These soldiers must've holed up in here when their base fell... until the radiation got them.
Can't do both.<eos> It's for my parents.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's ok.<eos> I kept them safe after the rising.
It's for my parents.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's ok.<eos> I kept them safe after the rising.<eos> Brought them here.
So you said they keep the kids at a separate part of the camp?<eos> - Away from the others?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's like the children are special to them or something.<eos> You know, they don't make them work hard, they don't feed on them as much as I can tell.
- I finished your laundry.<eos> - Oh, Thanks, buddy boy.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> I found something really interesting in your dungarees.<eos> More interesting than you calling them "dungarees"?
I'm going, Liv.<eos> Sorry. Old habits.<eos> No worries. See you tomorrow night.<eos> Billy took Project Mercury to the "Post".<eos> Then they must not have the documents yet. If they did, they would've already published them.
Let's see who it is.<eos> Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Well, I didn't erase the appointments,<eos> I just accidentally moved them all to Friday at 10:15.
No, I did not reject it.<eos> I gave up my powers to save someone's life... To be a hero.<eos> I nearly killed myself trying to get them back, when you brought me here, wherever here is.<eos> - That's not what we meant.<eos> If you would rather have given these powers to somebody else, why did you give them to me?
I know. I... I got a taste of what it's like to keep a secret from a friend.<eos> I don't recommend it.<eos> Well, we planned on telling you when Daisie got back.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She pulls men into her orbit and eventually crushes them.
Previously on "Berlin Station"...<eos> Are you familiar with Aleksandre Iosava?<eos> Potential overlap with the Boston bombers, supposedly reformed.<eos> Been so busy watching him, haven't paid any attention to her.<eos> So, she's sending men out, not bringing them in.
People like Iosava smear my family's culture and yours with blood.<eos> What kind of Islam do you want your children to grow up with?<eos> Bora.<eos> Once again from the top.<eos> When I look at them, I see compromise, the whole fucking bunch of them.
I mean, I don't like to put labels on it.<eos> I'm not comfortable with that, but uh, shooting at Jihadis affects a man, you know?<eos> How did you get past it?<eos> First you have to, uh, clear your mind.<eos> And then you, uh, check out your problems. And one by one, and you solve them.
- I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't--<eos> We got separated.<eos> I almost lost the kids.<eos> You brought them back.
I don't remember my nephews being made out of candy.<eos> - Gobble, gobble, gobble.<eos> Look at those children.<eos> Little miracles, right?<eos> They're adorable, not that I value them based on their looks.
In 23 years!<eos> I'll get 'em.<eos> All these years I carried you, when no one wanted to work with you.<eos> I still managed to get you jobs.<eos> And then you would flake, or sabotage them, or get wrapped up in some crisis or emergency or vague sadness.
No, of course not. I always get out of it.<eos> The fines are very reasonable.<eos> You don't just throw those things away?<eos> Gentlemen, let me tell you what I see.<eos> I see two able-bodied, entitled young white men who lucked into more money than most people see in five lifetimes, and who, if they hadn't had their millions stolen, would have promptly squandered them on more things
The defendant recorded Abby's name on that wall? - Yes, he did.<eos> - How many names had he recorded before hers?<eos> - Were the other members of his club more successful this year?<eos> Well, they claimed to be.<eos> And while interviewing them, it became clear that Chris was getting taunted as a failure who needed to step up.
Any signs of a struggle?<eos> Yes, people tend to resist when other people try to kill them.<eos> Well, thank you for that.<eos> Since you're the expert, why don't you tell us whether or not the killer left any trace.<eos> Because killers always make a point to leave evidence linking them to the murder?
You cut her loose, she'll be setting in motion a bureaucratic process that could take months to resolve.<eos> I'll take that chance.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> Got it, Lieutenant.<eos> The one thing I can't figure out is why there's lines through these names as if someone's crossing them out.
I broke it off no matter what she says.<eos> It's you and me all the way, baby.<eos> He's never gonna leave her, is he?<eos> It's Dr. Stein, the anesthesiologist.<eos> He takes the organs, and I sell them on the black market.
I'm not sure I do know what you...<eos> Hold on a minute.<eos> I used to wonder if it was all men or just Fitz that suck the life out of you.<eos> Now I think it's all the powerful men.<eos> They've been told their whole lives they deserve everything, they should have everything, and it makes them so weak.
It just sucked for me because I didn't have a date.<eos> Nobody wanted to go with fatty Patty.<eos> I thought nobody asked you, and I didn't want you to feel bad like I did.<eos> I'm happy sitting here watching "Carrie" with you.<eos> No, honey, trust me, you don't want to be my age and regret that you didn't get dressed up and have a glamorous night with your friends and impress them with how well you do "the Tootsee Roll."
I certainly would like to see justice done, but as an officer investigating the case,<eos> I feel that I also must tell you that I am confident that Tyrone Hensdale did not steal the truck that he was driving.<eos> Mr. Olson claimed otherwise.<eos> Joe Olson is afraid that he will be charged with obstructing justice.<eos> Your Honor, I brought along with me my case notes in the hope that you would consider them before sentencing.
Most of you go insane.<eos> These memories...<eos> The girl.<eos> My daughter.<eos> I want you to remove them.
Man, that was fast.<eos> I said I'd do it. I did it.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Uh, in radiology.<eos> Yeah, but I'll make sure she gets them.
- Yeah.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Hold on tight.<eos> - All right.<eos> Looking back, the signs were there... we just didn't see them.
You have to control it.<eos> - Your grandfather lost control and...<eos> - And what?<eos> He was obsessed with the idea that he could move objects through thought control.<eos> Looking back, the signs were all there. We just didn't see them, or we didn't want to see them.
OK.<eos> Relaxed as you can.<eos> Right.<eos> Four dice in the tube.<eos> It will rotate and jumble them.
Like everyone.<eos> They scare and fascinate me. But I'd like to see one.<eos> Well, they're a pain in the ass.<eos> And not just here.<eos> I know, but we can't kill them all.
But they need to taste lead, they're not stupid.<eos> They won't hunt deer or boar if they can chow down on sheep.<eos> Whereas, if they take a few bullets from time to time...<eos> Anyway, what do you care if there are wolves here or anywhere in France or in Europe?<eos> You don't see them.
- He tagged me.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Right? !<eos> - So like him.<eos> - Dumb! You know what, that's, that's a crazy thing to do, but honestly, when we focus on men, it just makes them more powerful.
How many men did you bring with you?<eos> Enough.<eos> I figured I'd give you the chance to come quietly.<eos> Ling Ling, cover your ears, close your eyes.<eos> Don't open them till I tell you.
Nergüi.<eos> Nergüi.<eos> No name.<eos> My family was traditional.<eos> On the day I was born, they wrote names on slips of paper and placed them in the millet bowl.
You've got to know that's where this is headed.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Did something happen to the van?<eos> Yeah, that was the clone people.<eos> That was the second time I killed them there.
Something like that.<eos> Anyway, I remember we ate at a diner just outside Kansas City.<eos> You asked the waitress for MM pancakes. She said, "That's not on the menu."<eos> And you like it how you like it, so you said, "You got MMs, right?<eos> You got pancakes. So you bring them to me and I'll put them in there myself."
Me, too.<eos> And you shall prove it by buying the first drink.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe our invitations got lost in the post.<eos> Or perhaps they're having them delivered personally by one of their footmen.
Take that, Indigo.<eos> It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> - I have one question for you, Max.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?
- Uh-uh. - Why not?<eos> I thought this was an all-male spa.<eos> Boy, she cuts right to the chase, doesn't she?<eos> I wonder what her story is.<eos> From the looks of it, she washes the towels and then folds them.
This is everyone who has passed here.<eos> Now, uh...<eos> This guy, Jake Townsend, had beef with Harold, but it wasn't over blue pills.<eos> Whoa. Jake filed a formal complaint against Harold?<eos> Yeah, apparently Harold was stealing his pension checks and cashing them for himself.
If this really is the Banshee I've been looking for...<eos> Eileen, in my experience...<eos> Revenge is not all it's cracked up to be.<eos> Killing this Banshee is not gonna bring your parents back.<eos> I never met them.
Are you the idiot who's been calling every 30 seconds?<eos> No, I'm the idiot who cracked the case. I got a name and an address.<eos> Seriously?<eos> That's amazing!<eos> Meet me in Hancock Park. We'll wait for the biter's parents to come home, we'll give them a good talking to.
This is taking care of her?<eos> Yes. If we coddle her, we're just encouraging her to be injured.<eos> Where did you learn that?<eos> From my mom.<eos> When we were sick, she'd take away our pillows and give them back when we got better.
You just have to know how to find it.<eos> That's what you take away from that story?<eos> That my mother loved me?<eos> Okay, with all due respect, a mother's love...<eos> That's the bare minimum. I mean, geez, serial killers have mothers that love them.
I'm gonna figure out where she is.<eos> That's not cool.<eos> What?<eos> Your friends don't know all your passwords?<eos> Mmm, not sure I would call them friends, then, Darryl.
- Stop what, dearest?<eos> That.<eos> Oh, you mean, um, the passive-aggressive calm?<eos> See, I'm just trying not to kill you for smearing your mental breakdown all over me.<eos> If I make it all the way over there and those stupid-ass glasses are still on that stupid-ass face, I'm gonna break them into tiny pieces and shove each and every one up your self-righteous...
Julian told me that bouncers know when a driver's license is fake, but with a passport, they don't look twice at it.<eos> These are the other passports he had waiting.<eos> - You recognize them? - I don't know them...<eos> Take a closer look.<eos> Maybe you've seen them with Julian?
Yeah, but all we've got him doing is buying fake ID.<eos> He would have been out in a couple of hours.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How did it go with the passports?<eos> Nothing in our database, None of the frat brothers recognize them, and the feds are taking their time getting back to us.
I'm actually in gumford.<eos> I'm in your room right now.<eos> I bought you some cookies and hot chocolate.<eos> Oh, thank you, mom!<eos> Well, just leave them in my room and go home.
I haven't eaten since breakfast, and all I had was a luna bar and three grapes.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I found sue.<eos> She's holed up in the library, so I guess I'm just gonna head home.<eos> But, hey, there's hot chocolate and cookies here if anybody wants them.
- I got a pulse right here.<eos> Did you two take any drugs tonight?<eos> No, ma'am, no. I don't take any drugs.<eos> Your parents know you're here?<eos> Called them on the way over.
Well, she's not coming out anytime soon.<eos> Let's go dig into that penis.<eos> Let's go, Mom!<eos> I can't find my new earrings!<eos> That's 'cause I'm wearing them!
Baracus was here recently.<eos> Dale was right.<eos> The Baracus abduction wasn't the Chaos Killer.<eos> It was Boss's goons trying to make it look like the Chaos Killer.<eos> I'm assuming Boss sent them to thank Baracus in person for all those indictments.
Good.<eos> Jack.<eos> Monty's got something for us.<eos> You told me to look for patterns.<eos> Now, the thing about looking for patterns is you start to see them everywhere, even in places you don't expect.
Um... thank you, Eddie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're calling us a controversial fringe movement.<eos> Do you know what they do to controversial fringe movements?<eos> They set fire to their buildings and stand around and watch them burn.
There's nothing more you can do here but wait.<eos> There's everything you can do by Carla's side.<eos> Go on. I'll watch this one.<eos> Go.<eos> All right, I'm gonna name three objects, and I want you to repeat them for me, okay?
If we're going by the rules, it's not approved for an O.R., either.<eos> It's experimental.<eos> Also, it's our only option.<eos> I'm gonna close my eyes.<eos> When I open them, I don't want to see you here.
Oh. Oh, look at him eat like a gorilla!<eos> Oh, good heavens, Pat.<eos> - You know what?<eos> - Hmm? I've been wondering what to do with my Bears season tickets when I die.<eos> I was going to give them to your cousin Gary, but he's still living with that Sikh girl.
So fun!<eos> They've got whack-a-serf.<eos> - We have to play.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Just give me your boots so I can take them to the cobbler.
I hear the Americans are coming... and people say they're coming to liberate us.<eos> Liberate us from who?<eos> From ourselves?<eos> But I've got faith in our soldiers.<eos> I'm sure they'll stop them at the beaches, just like you said.
Now what do we do ?<eos> You're accused of looting...<eos> Tell him what happened.<eos> We were out looking for something to eat and he saw a dead soldier so we went over to him.<eos> The soldier was hanging from a tree and we saw he had new boots, so I said, let's take his boots he doesn't need them anymore.
Holy Mother... give us a break!<eos> For God's sake... two stupid boots.<eos> - For God's sake!<eos> - Two!<eos> - And he didn't even put them on.
You were the one she wanted to take revenge against.<eos> She tried to hold you up on the divorce, right?<eos> Claimed a chunk of the proceeds from your books.<eos> After all, she helped you do the research.<eos> That's why you had them pulled, to spite her.
They're naturally beautiful. And in the right light, that is about as close to perfect as you're ever going to get.<eos> I mean, that is who we all want to be.<eos> How did they die?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> Where did you meet them?
I mean, were you ever worried about people staring at you?<eos> Well, I was, but, you know, people don't really notice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What'd you, um, what did you do about the... about the... about the nipples?<eos> - I had them tattooed.
I was afraid of that.<eos> What am I looking at, Ravi?<eos> Matricide.<eos> These six young zombie rats are clones of New Hope.<eos> The remains you see here are those of the mother that gave birth to them.
I was a hell of a dungeon master.<eos> If players screwed up, they did something dumb, they paid the price.<eos> But... as they were bleeding out on the battlefield, there was always the Hail Mary.<eos> The god call.<eos> That 1% chance that the god that they worshipped would come down from the heavens, smite their enemies and save them.
I said, "What's new?" but sure.<eos> Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?<eos> Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?<eos> You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.<eos> Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.
Mosquitos.<eos> Louisiana state bird.<eos> Oh, he has at least a dozen of these bites on his ankles and arms.<eos> And judging by the inflammation, recently acquired.<eos> I've taken samples and given them to Sebastian to analyze.
She doesn't like to call them.<eos> It's no biggie for us, though.<eos> Yeah, never a big deal when grown men drive teenage girls home.<eos> Mind if I download video off your cells?<eos> Unless you want us to get a warrant, in which case, we take your phones and get them back to you when we can.
O.J. went to USC in 1967, so he's plucked out of the black community, out of black consciousness, and he's submerged in an all-white university.<eos> And I say this, and I don't say it facetiously, but he is seduced by white society.<eos> USC controls TV, Hollywood, banking, finance, law and medicine in Los Angeles.<eos> The alumni are very powerful, and their whole existence revolves around the success of the football team.<eos> And O.J. is leading them to glory.
You know, it's safe to walk down these sidewalks at night and you don't have to worry about, somebody jumping out from the bushes and hitting you on the head and taking your wallet.<eos> We don't want to fool ourselves into thinking that we don't have things that go on here, but we take a pretty proactive approach and... you know, we try to deal with things swiftly.<eos> Something that comes in as a sexual assault, certainly raises your ire.<eos> Based upon the information that was given by the girls, we had a list of names of people that had been at this house.<eos> We were able to round them up, bring them in, and we went from there.
There's no one here named Xi.<eos> The department has been keeping an eye on you since June.<eos> We may not have all the information we want about you, but we do know your name.<eos> Three members of the Snake Eye Boys were ambushed at an arcade last night.<eos> We suspect you paid one of their fellows to double-cross them.
Probably administered in his food.<eos> Made it impossible for him to breathe.<eos> Suffocated in his armchair.<eos> Sven would've realized that when he went to insert these eyelid caps.<eos> Morticians use them so the eyes don't open during the viewing.
Isn't it great?<eos> Yeah, there's a line of, like, 20 people out the door.<eos> What are you guys doing back here?<eos> Oh, I just had to refresh on peanut butter bombs.<eos> I've been giving out samples all day, and people are eating them up like they're curing cancer.
You've seen the City of Light now.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> There's peace, happiness, safety.<eos> Why would you want to deny that to anyone?<eos> She's torturing people to get them here, Jasper, taking their memories, controlling them.
Who's after you? You just knocked out the bad guys.<eos> Looks like we weren't the only ones who called for backup!<eos> They're gaining on us fast. Okay, the weight of the trailer is killing your RPMs. They'll be on you before you know it.<eos> Tell Gallo there's a switchback at the end of the canyon.<eos> He can lose them there.
There's been a string of murders... junkies.<eos> Look at the marks on the bodies.<eos> - They're just like Columbia. - Yeah.<eos> And the junkie we found in McCarthy's warehouse.<eos> You think he killed them all?
Finnerman will send you straight back to your cell.<eos> You may never get out.<eos> Do you know any other Hunters?<eos> Only my parents.<eos> But the Hunters killed them.
Who told you we had anything to do with them?<eos> Musa.<eos> Well, he's lying.<eos> You saw the Quins capture them.<eos> If Musa had my parents, he would have used them to try and turn me.
The operation has changed.<eos> They led you here like lambs to the slaughter.<eos> I have come to set you free!<eos> We're gonna have another Waco on our hands. No.<eos> We have the terrorists exactly where we want them.
Dunning mentioned banking records.<eos> Yes, Farris had accounts in Switzerland, and the Cayman Islands.<eos> Would you be able to tell if there was any activity on these accounts in the last 24 hours?<eos> I checked.<eos> Someone cleaned them out late yesterday morning.
Well, no wallet or phone, but he did just take out $200 at an ATM around the corner.<eos> So, likely a mugging.<eos> He's still a foreign delegate.<eos> You want me to get the feds involved?<eos> No, I'll notify them, but a mugging on the streets of Manhattan is strictly NYPD.
- To confess.<eos> - You're the murderer?<eos> - Yes. I am.<eos> Then how do you explain Meg's bloody clothing?<eos> I used them to mop up the blood and then I panicked and I threw them away.
Oh, no, you should hold them.<eos> No, you're her friend.<eos> - [Charolette] Okay.<eos> All right. - I'm your friend, too, by the way.<eos> [guests chuckling] Father in heaven, we ask your blessings upon these rings, that you bless the hand that gives them.
Mr Garrity, may I ask you, do you recognise the names Mr and Mrs Weston?<eos> She mentioned them?<eos> I wonder what brought that back?<eos> Wasn't their real names.<eos> Just what Doris called them.
Provenza: We may not have been able to connect him to the courtroom massacre yet, but we've arrested his 10 Little Nazi conspirators, connected them to the poisoned Thai food, and you know, Captain, one of these guys will crack.
Honey, the piece is not about you at all.<eos> It's about Dean.<eos> I know that, hon.<eos> That's why I'm up here pouting.<eos> Neal's notes, I took a picture of them while he was in the bathroom.
- What was that?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Could Mitsuha...<eos> Could she have persuaded them? Is it my fault?
- You know we're under liquidity pressure.<eos> - When do you think I can start that?<eos> - It's going to go great.<eos> - Do we want to change horses?<eos> - I want you to sell them again.
There was something going on.<eos> - In the courtyard?<eos> I went to the window.<eos> She was out there with some men.<eos> Can you describe them?
The search for the two convicted felons intensifies tonight.<eos> Troopers from four states and law enforcement personnel from several federal agencies have converged on the scene.<eos> Both Yates and Rudnick were serving life sentences for multiple counts of rape and murder.<eos> They should be considered extremely dangerous.<eos> Officials are cautioning that anyone who sees them or has information on either of the two men should not attempt to interact with them.
Including the computer in Commissioner Malone's office at the Academy.<eos> Bardot must have snuck into Malone's office, used a portable password cracker on it.<eos> That's what he got at the black market with the five grand he squeezed out of Chambers.<eos> Flanagan used Bardot to get these files.<eos> After he got them, he turned on his own mole.
I had one when I came in.<eos> Here.<eos> Is there a problem with the opera tickets?<eos> No.<eos> I want you to have them.
Because you're on your phone all the time...<eos> Oh, my God. I went to take a shit. I didn't take my phone with me.<eos> [Levi Felix] We're here today for a mini digital detox.<eos> So, today, we're gonna go through a few practices and exercises.<eos> Uh, one, A, to gain some mindfulness and awareness around our devices and how often we use them.
Look at the victim, Booth.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Just bones, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, the killer lived with the remains, and when he looked at them, he didn't see a skeleton. He saw... a living person he could interact with, and that's what I see as well.
Now, I believe when the bullet passed through her body, it hit the surface she was lying on, causing debris to blow back into her ribs.<eos> Debris that was hard enough to cause pitting on the bones.<eos> Got something for you.<eos> Dr. Hodgins. Do you have the results of your swabs of the injuries?<eos> Yeah, I ran them through microspectrophotometry, and found traces of steel and also carpet fiber.
Why not go to Kamenna?<eos> Machk will demand retaliation against the Brown brothers.<eos> He's probably already moving on the Low River camp.<eos> Brown is our competition.<eos> Why not let the Lake Walkers destroy them?
I am not a monster.<eos> Then why?<eos> Because the time of the gods has finished.<eos> Their power fades while their worshipers die.<eos> When they're weak enough, I will overthrow them.
You made possible my ascension;<eos> come. Witness my glory in full. (thunder rumbles)<eos> You lied to me.<eos> My friends didn't betray me.<eos> I betrayed them.
I don't know what he's in for. Drugs maybe, but...<eos> You found the earrings.<eos> - Didn't we buy those in Mexico?<eos> I thought you lost them.<eos> Yeah, well, I... I found them.
Lo and behold.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, Noah. It's just I can't stand to see you like this.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> It's Tuesday. They're in school.<eos> Last time was Saturday. You didn't bring them then either.
You know what?<eos> Let me finish up for you.<eos> Guys, what do I do?<eos> What's the best way to break up with someone without hurting their feelings?<eos> Well, when my time with a partner is over, I take her to my cabin on the beach. After a few days of crying, journaling, and orgasms, we write our farewells, put them in a bottle,
Why? Because he believes their circumstances to be the same.<eos> We've been through Trager's life with a fine-tooth comb.<eos> Now, this guy doesn't have conventional criminal ties, yet he managed to hire two different killers in two weeks.<eos> It's possible Nieves knows the identity of Lily Cooper's murderer, but I think it's more likely that he intuitively understood where Trager found his second killer.<eos> He's getting them from his own student rolls.
Oh, that's awful!<eos> Let's do another one.<eos> What are those shots called?<eos> Brain bombs.<eos> Mimi made me do them when I broke up with Xavi.
Huge kickbacks from a private prison in texas.<eos> According to judge caldwell's financials, He's got a sweetheart deal With a company that runs a detention center in el paso.<eos> He literally gets paid for every bed he fills.<eos> So, marco shakes down the immigrants for money.<eos> Sooner or later, they run out of cash, And then caldwell ships them to texas.
-Complete what?<eos> -The cathedral.<eos> I told you to put away your drawings.<eos> You will lead the life of a banker, not an artist.<eos> I have put them away.
My niece and Ormanno appear inseparable.<eos> Look at them.<eos> And it seems like yesterday that we were that age.<eos> I remember thinking myself something of a poet.<eos> I wrote you several heartfelt verses, I went to your window to read them, and how was I repaid in my efforts? - With a bucket of slops.
Up until now, the fossil bones have been the main focus of the dig but the rock that surrounds the fossils also holds important information.<eos> The nature of the layers of rock in which these fossils lie can tell us a great deal about how they got to be where they are and how old they are.<eos> Some of these layers are volcanic ash which must have come from a volcano erupting every now and then somewhere in the neighbourhood.<eos> And this ash around the bones can tell us how old the fossils are.<eos> Scientists worked out that all these fossils dated from the Cretaceous period but better than that, they dated them precisely to 101,6 million years old.
Maybe we should just wait.<eos> We need to just tell them.<eos> Your...<eos> Your friends, Miguel and Alejandro,<eos> We think when they cut across the field to go off to the next farm in order to catch the bus... somebody robbed... and killed them.
More than 100,000 people a year comment on our news stories.<eos> Different identities.<eos> We get more than half a million comments a year.<eos> I don't read one.<eos> - Don't you have people reading them?
- You will.<eos> This is why we wanted you to have it, love.<eos> Okay?<eos> We believe in you and your dreams.<eos> If you stay focused, we know that you'll achieve them.
Well, you can't seriously think that we're gonna sit around and wait for you to talk about it?<eos> You must respect our process.<eos> You're harboring the known perpetrator of a terrorist attack.<eos> So let me lay out our process:<eos> you're gonna open your gates and hand over Tuwala, or we're gonna break them down.
I'm sure you've enjoyed having the money, but I need it back now.<eos> - We can't.<eos> - You can't?<eos> We used a lot of it.<eos> We exchanged them for kroner, and invested money in our garage.
Do you know that vampires walk in the day?<eos> And they don't turn into bats.<eos> And they only feast on blood when they're hungry.<eos> - That's fascinating.<eos> You learn all kinds of things when you track them all over the world like I have.
Standing in Fillory was the greatest moment of my life, and not just because, as I later found out, the air is .02% opium, which is a pretty unfair trick to get you to love a place,<eos> Oh, uh, oh, so... if you're a real fan, you totally recognize this from the books... this iconic scene, right?<eos> Jane falls into a trap and is saved by passing Magicians, but you didn't know is I am in that scene, bitches.<eos> Struggle, struggle. Tighter, tighter.<eos> Okay, do you see them yet?
I got to go.<eos> - Am I forgiven?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Coming over later?<eos> You know, I do have some documents for you to sign, so I'll bring them over.
Yes.<eos> Yes, he... he dates men.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Um, they usually don't have names.<eos> He just... brings them by, uh, doesn't even introduce them or anything.
The Feds got something on you?<eos> Nothing I can't handle.<eos> Ray, when I get into prison, after I stole Sully's money, I knew there'd never be and end to it unless I... unless I put 'em all away, and I did.<eos> I sang.<eos> And one by one, the Feds arrested those cocksuckers, and brought them in, and kept me protected.
Hey.<eos> So far, all of the prisoners who sent Judge Rodman hate mail are still in prison, and all of the victims have alibis.<eos> Hmm, well, I may have found the next great motivational slogan.<eos> Picture it, "You dumb bitch,<eos> I'm going to rip out your eyeballs and feed them to you."
Citizens of the Underworld, from now on, this is what happens to anyone who deals with these so-called heroes.<eos> So, who's next in line for their help?<eos> Oh.<eos> No?<eos> Mm. It's hard to be a savior when no on wants you to save them.
What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Ben, listen to me.<eos> Just bring back the list before Bin-Khalid's people find you.<eos> Yeah, Maybe I'll find them.
I wish I could be of more help, but I have no idea how the notepad ended up at a crime scene.<eos> Client, associate?<eos> It could be anybody.<eos> I mean, I got a zillion of these things. (CHUCKLES)<eos> Saw an infomercial about how people use them to help remember stuff.
Whatever you're doing here, your own people don't know about it, and I'm all you've got.<eos> So are we gonna fight some more? Or are we going to behave?<eos> What's your plan?<eos> We plant these motion sensors at the end of both halls.<eos> When Chambers trips them, take her down.
They all do.<eos> Hundreds of heartbroken women come to me, but they never learn.<eos> I mean, a month, a year, however long later, they all come back -- same story, different man.<eos> So you tweak the curse?<eos> Now it not only punishes the cheaters, but the foolish women who want them back.
We could do like a... like a point/counterpoint kind of thing.<eos> Like I would say something like, uh...<eos> "Let's get rid of pennies," and you would say...<eos> Of course we should get rid of pennies!<eos> They're annoying to own and make you feel bad when you throw them out.
Okay.<eos> Honey, I got some vase options.<eos> What happened?<eos> Um... what do you think happened?<eos> I think she saw those flowers as the shallow, transparent gesture they were and shredded them to pieces in a justifiable rage.
How cool would that be sitting on my shoulder my half shirt flapping in the wind?<eos> You're not getting a bird.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> People that have birds and walk around with them on their shoulders --
Are they gonna hurt me?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No one's gonna hurt you, Neil.<eos> No one's gonna hurt you, but, uh, you see, the thing is you're the only one who's seen them, so we need your help.
and "squash champion," and I came up with a name:<eos> Marshall Winthrop.<eos> Winthrop was this world-champion squash player. He won a bronze medal at the Olympics.<eos> But beating his opponents on the court did not satisfy him.<eos> He hated them for losing.
But beating his opponents on the court did not satisfy him.<eos> He hated them for losing.<eos> He considered it a sign of disrespect to the game he loved so much.<eos> He started cruising for squash opponents on Craigslist.<eos> He drew them in with the promise of a game against one of the world's best. But all of them lost not only the game, they lost their lives.
Yes, you did.<eos> I saw you at the funeral.<eos> So I went to the funeral.<eos> Big deal.<eos> I was their teacher, and I walked out on them.
After that, they were putty in my hands.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I helped you do this.<eos> What?<eos> You got them out of the inner city.
I just want to keep them away from this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pippa...<eos> Did you kids get any sleep?<eos> You mean after you kicked them out of their home at 2:00 in the morning?
- Thank you for meeting me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I don't have a lot of... people I can talk to.<eos> I'm staying in a hotel.<eos> I miss my kids. I want them with me.
Well, then I saw how happy he made my daughter, and I was completely won over.<eos> You know, it feels really good to be supported as a couple.<eos> Only good news today, Dixon!<eos> Well, the building permits were denied again, Mr. Mason.<eos> Darn it. You'd think my lawyers would be able to push this stuff through considering how much money I'm paying them.
- Anything new?<eos> - We're on the way to the airport.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> If they have plane tickets, you should take them now.<eos> We'll take them at the next exit.
Come on.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I was just thinking about those little kids.<eos> I mean... a lot of people let them down.
Thank you.<eos> Eve.<eos> Adalind has her powers back.<eos> I know.<eos> How long has she had them back?
I promise I will explain to you once and for all why I did what I did.<eos> Ok, it's over.<eos> You did great.<eos> You did great.<eos> We'll keep bodies on ice for as long as 3 or 4 months. If nobody claims them by then, they get buried on the city's dime.
I am going to start the paperwork with you, sir, right here.<eos> So, if he disappeared, why didn't you go looking for him? We did.<eos> The last place we thought he'd go back to was the dorms.<eos> He's tried to run away before, so...<eos> These bruises on your face and arms... how did you get them?
Where are his parents? New York.<eos> And he's not allowed to talk to them.<eos> Those are the rules.<eos> It's tough, I know.<eos> We push them hard, and sometimes this even Works.
You can't put her in a crate.<eos> That's cruel.<eos> It's not cruel. It's a dog crate.<eos> It's a crate specifically made to put a dog into.<eos> People also put dogs in sacks and toss them in the river.
You wore one for a whole week.<eos> Oh, it really was just a happy accident.<eos> I-I had pinkeye.<eos> Fourth graders are filthy.<eos> Either way, it kept them off my back till Larry Bean got lice. Oof.
I mean, we need the absolute best, and we pay accordingly. I see.<eos> Oh, wow!<eos> That Lucian Freud is one of my favorites.<eos> You know, that's the only self-portrait he did with his children?<eos> And then he, um... he stuffed them in the corner as like a... as a joke.
So, the position is front-facing. We need a people person with great contacts.<eos> Yeah, you need investors, you need branding executives, you need PR reps.<eos> No, I... I know a bunch of those.<eos> But we also like our executives to have an art background with taste. I mean, someone like you would actually be great.<eos> We need to fill the position in two months, so once you put together a short list of candidates, I'll premeet them and then Emmett will...
Danny Wheeler, you are on trial for breaking my heart.<eos> And you're right... we should ask other people if I overreacted.<eos> So you want to put me on a fake trial using fake jurors to decide whether you're gonna forgive me? Pretty much.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But those jurors aren't fake. I paid them $20 to stay late and I even found a judge.
About 8:00 a.m. - And who's Shawn?<eos> - He's one of the radio DJs.<eos> He's mentoring me.<eos> Did you see your parents when you got home?<eos> Yeah, I woke them up.
Because I love being able to choose whether or not I want to change a dirty diaper. And I want that choice.<eos> My needs are important, like Tiago said.<eos> And I know I don't want to have any more kids.<eos> So, uh, I shouldn't leave the door open.<eos> And I know you want them.
I just put my epithelials on the sleeve of my lab coat.<eos> We all do that any time we put something on or take it off.<eos> What's that have to do with China?<eos> That's where the clothes were made.<eos> The only skin cells that I found on the inside of the garments were from the Chinese worker who made them.
This isn't us going down like Gerald.<eos> You know, this is us going to jail for running paper agents and bilking Uncle Sam, for fuck sakes.<eos> And by the way, if you're looking for a proper place to jump, this is not it.<eos> I got dibs on the TV Tower when the time comes.<eos> I took the files out last week, and I fixed them. I fixed them.
When... when you brought the files to the safe house the other day, did you sign them out in the log?<eos> So, you really did need them.<eos> It wasn't just an excuse to see me?<eos> Is there a good answer to that question?<eos> Yes, I signed them out.
- What is this?<eos> - That is why we are here.<eos> We'll need access to every file, folder, and Post-it note in this facility.<eos> Where there's a paper trail, there's Thomas Shaw to light it on fire and burn us alive.<eos> I took the files out last week, and I fixed them.
Well, initially, that was my first thought.<eos> So, I had somebody check it out.<eos> There were three suspicious tickets purchased.<eos> Berlin to Istanbul, one-way, in cash.<eos> So, she's sending men out, not bringing them in.
We had a plan.<eos> Well, I think it succeeded.<eos> I followed Ruth Iosava today.<eos> Been so busy watching him, haven't paid any attention to her.<eos> So, she's sending men out, not bringing them in.
Peter and I..<eos> You're in love.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Not the other ones.<eos> No, the other prisoners, I helped them.
And at first, I was alone, but then I-I started to see things.<eos> What did you see exactly?<eos> My husband.<eos> He was dead.<eos> I closed my eyes, and when I opened them... he was gone.
I am going to hunt fascists.<eos> Ready?<eos> Now.<eos> Hey, Bill.<eos> I want you to watch them closely today.
I've been holding you back?<eos> You forgot to wear pants to a business meeting.<eos> How dare you?<eos> I did wear pants.<eos> I just left them in the bathroom.
- Abby's processing it for prints now.<eos> - Spoke with Director Vance at the summit in Brussels.<eos> He wants to be updated hourly.<eos> - Released from the hospital and his parents brought him here.<eos> I escorted them to the conference room.
Hey, the kids are getting dropped off here in a little.<eos> - Oh, the kids are coming here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So he's just, he's just pulling, pulling everything off the shelf then, huh?<eos> Yeah, listen, I-I need you to drive them to Lizzie's basketball game for me because I might have to stay here late.
I'm a little nervous, I must tell you.<eos> But I would like it to go through smoothly, without incident.<eos> I'm cautiously optimistic that it will go quietly.<eos> I can understand that a country can only change at its own pace, but until then, it isn't just the buggery law.<eos> It's the complete absence of legal protection for queer citizens that renders them invisible in the eyes of the government.
- Uh, yeah, you know?<eos> - Or a family that cares. - Uh-huh.<eos> And, you know, Taja, we were talking. And she would tell me, "You know, Mom, you don't know how lucky you are to wake up and everybody sees you as a woman."<eos> And we can't get so caught up in what's, you know, society expects or dictates to us or what our church says because your children are your children.<eos> And your kids need to know that, no matter what, you love them and you accept them unconditionally.
He's in prison.<eos> He'll never be free again.<eos> We have crippling military debts.<eos> France is in debt to her soldiers who fought on Scotland's behalf.<eos> You and father executed 13 knights on the trumped-up charge of heresy. Simply because you couldn't pay them.
But why spare us?<eos> They want the world to think that we did this... killed the generals to get out of paying them.<eos> Murdered them, like the knights before them.<eos> And the world will believe it, as history repeats itself.<eos> But we had the money. - We were repaying them.
It's just the surveyors at Brockley Combe. Pay it no mind.<eos> Why do they have to blow great holes in the valley, ma'am?<eos> They're surveying the land to see whether it's capable of taking a viaduct over the valley.<eos> A viaduct?<eos> ! They're here because Mr Appleby petitioned for them to be here, so we will make them welcome.
I could hear them... .. screaming... .. and crying... .. for days.<eos> And then... .. it stopped.<eos> They were only workhouse boys.<eos> What did it matter?<eos> And now... I hear them again.
Are you sure you saw them?<eos> Maybe your mind's playing tricks on you, too.<eos> - Maybe you're hallucinating.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> Because my wife saw them, too.
- Your book proposal.<eos> First of all, it's a really great start.<eos> I love the world.<eos> But I thought I'd do the 10,000-feet notes first, and then we'd go page by page, hmm? Hmm.<eos> How about you literally throw them in the trash?
And one of the reasons that I thought it was important to tell the story of Olympic Games was not simply because it's a cool spy story, it is, but it's because as a nation...<eos> We need to have a debate about how we want to use cyber weapons because we are the most vulnerable nation on earth to cyber-attack ourselves.<eos> If you get up in the morning and turn off your alarm and make coffee and pump gas and use the ATM, you've touched industrial control systems.<eos> It's what powers our lives.<eos> And unfortunately, these systems are connected and interconnected in some ways that make them vulnerable.
Imagine for a moment that not only all the power went off on the east coast, but the entire Internet came down.<eos> Imagine what the economic impact of that is even if it only lasted for 24 hours.<eos> Newsreader:<eos> According to the officials, Iran is the first country ever in the Middle East to actually be engaged in a cyber war with the United States and Israel.<eos> If anything they said the recent cyber attacks were what encouraged them to plan to set up the cyber army, which will gather computer scientists, programmers, software engineers...
-Le Chat Club closed due to rats.<eos> -Again?<eos> -We got parking meters.<eos> -Where?<eos> No one would pay so they took them out.
I am so sorry for the wait.<eos> -Paris, that's fine.<eos> -Don't stand there shaking. Just go.<eos> Apologize to your parents.<eos> Tell them you'll pay them back for the semesters you studied Buffy the Vampire Slayer's effect on the feminist agenda.
What is that, hotel lingo?<eos> -The ones who are here are B-level kids--<eos> -Call them something else.<eos> These younger, less-credited thespians, they all use their original names.<eos> No one changes them anymore.
You have your business, the kids.<eos> The kids hate me.<eos> They like the nanny.<eos> Last Christmas, they cried until she came.<eos> I don't blame them. I like the nanny, too.
-We're still paying off the last nanny.<eos> Guys, I will take the kids to get something to eat. -Really?<eos> -You'll go upstairs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes. - And bring them down?
Guys, I will take the kids to get something to eat. -Really?<eos> -You'll go upstairs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes. - And bring them down?<eos> And take them out and bring them back?
-You'll go upstairs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes. - And bring them down?<eos> And take them out and bring them back?<eos> Or leave them in an alley.
-Oh, my God, you're at Condé Nast. -No.<eos> -Still catching up?<eos> I'm gonna write a piece that's gonna knock their socks off at GQ.<eos> Those are people who care about their socks.<eos> They don't get them in bunches of three at the street fair.
It was at the bottom of a box, under an old toaster and a broken Slinky.<eos> I'd drop by more yard sales myself, but you have to step into people's yards.<eos> Oh, with their trampolines and their "Kiss the Gardener" signs.<eos> With your approval, I would like to petition the national board to fund the purchase of a top-notch display for the diaries of Abigail Franklin.<eos> -After we authenticate them, right?
I have named Queen Mary Stuart as my successor in exchange for choosing her next husband, and I choose you.<eos> It's the Red Knights.<eos> Catherine, watch out!<eos> "Your debt will be paid."<eos> You and Father executed 13 knights on the trumped up charge of heresy, simply because you couldn't pay them?
Hope this doesn't go back too far.<eos> There are a few things I did as a teenager that I'd rather not... Rather not...<eos> When is he supposed to wake up?<eos> We want him to stay asleep.<eos> He needs to be able to access his memories without any outside stimulation causing them to go away again.
I'm sorry.<eos> So, Don is at the top of the hill, and I'm down at the bottom, the kids are on the sled, and the snow was like frozen, thick ice.<eos> And I think, "It's okay.<eos> Even if they come too fast, I can stop them."<eos> Well, Don let them go, and they are starting to rush down the hill.
I'll tell you where I am-- I'm right here, standing watch over your a.m. commute.<eos> As you loyal listeners know, I served seven years in the Navy.<eos> Shaped me into the adorable deejay that y'all know and love.<eos> That's why I founded Youth Stripes.<eos> Work with at-risk kids, help them find a path to success, which for some includes military service.
And no trace of the missing money, either.<eos> So he wasn't embezzling from Youth Stripes?<eos> Oh, yeah, he was. He just was savvy about it.<eos> He created a fake online persona, and he used various aliases.<eos> Used them to set up accounts in the Caymans and to communicate with his partner in crime.
You broke the washing machine.<eos> You put too many bath sheets in it.<eos> What's a bath sheet?<eos> Looks like a regular towel, only way bigger, so if you put more than one in the machine, it derails the basket.<eos> Why do we have them?
So you got my message.<eos> If they intended him harm, he might be on the lam.<eos> Any progress identifying them?<eos> Marcus just passed Bader's phone records on to Narcotics.<eos> Missing Persons already went through them, but now that we know what we're looking for, maybe something will leap out.
I'm sure you could imagine. Yeah.<eos> So let's talk about my brothers.<eos> I have so many questions.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> Last time I saw them, they were fine.
Are you sure, Benedict?<eos> Judging by the cannonading last night, sounds as if you have enough on your plate.<eos> Oh, that? No.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> We have occasional interlopers up here. Our gunners scare them off.
- My guy.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, excuse me for a minute. I have to go feed the meter.<eos> Uh, excu... before you go, can you please fill us in on all active pranks at this table?<eos> I think you found them all, okay?
Franklin Township.<eos> Eight men and one strumpet.<eos> Wasn't sure what to do with her.<eos> Right, well, clear the barn out.<eos> Separate the prisoners. I'll question them one by one.
Were... were you pressured?<eos> Did you aid these men under some sort of threat?<eos> I didn't aid anything.<eos> I helped plan the ambush.<eos> I led them back to my house when our plan went wrong.
Look what happened tonight.<eos> How many people...<eos> We haven't even processed.<eos> And our kids?<eos> Are we putting them in danger?
So I'm a saint.<eos> No.<eos> No. You're broken too.<eos> You're afraid and and insecure.<eos> But I know all the broken places. You've shown them to me.
Great.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Bye.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I, uh, spotted some backlogged dictations, so I've been transcribing them.
Thank you.<eos> Dr. Virginia, before you go...<eos> I've been reading your book looking over the files.<eos> There is a revolution going on here.<eos> The problems that you treat, the way that you treat them without mocking or judgment...
Like it or not, you are now consultant deputy for the Black Badge Division.<eos> You need to be smart, discreet.<eos> Especially<eos> - when you're hunting demons.<eos> Wyatt Earp's kills; - Daddy called them revenants.
Trying to have - a moment with my family!<eos> - He'll tell me the numbers!<eos> Pretty sure this is illegal.<eos> Sam wants the numbers.<eos> Stan knows them.
Stay back!<eos> We got hostages!<eos> Go!<eos> Hostages. Good, right?<eos> Means they're not going to kill them.
Yeah, if you want them to die now, go ahead.<eos> Tell Crazy Eyes not to hurt them.<eos> Not so tough without Wyatt's gun, eh?<eos> "With bare hands," that's cute.<eos> - We're just letting them go? - No.
It's been shut down for years, but the building has never been leased since because of a Radon leak underground.<eos> So it's empty.<eos> Yeah. Well, it has significance to the unsub. It's likely he would take the boys there.<eos> What do you have, Hotch?<eos> We think he's taking them to 8879 Rincon Street.
There are good ones and bad ones.<eos> It's my job to keep the bad away from the good.<eos> Well, I disagree.<eos> You're right. Your job isn't to change people, but you supply the most important service a government can supply to its citizens. Justice.<eos> That's what's make them change.
Beginning after World War II, the industry put a lot of effort into selling Americans on the processed food wonders that it had invented to feed the troops.<eos> Canned meals... freeze-dried foods, dehydrated potatoes, powdered orange juice and coffee, instant and super convenient everything.<eos> Processing food is extremely profitable, much more so than growing it or selling it whole.<eos> Writer Laura Shapiro recounts the shift toward industrial cookery was mainly a supply-driven phenomenon.<eos> [Laura] So the food companies come out of World War II, they had to get their product into people's kitchens and then they had to get them used in a lot of different ways.
They're actually trying to engineer your cravings and get you to eat as much as you possibly can.<eos> Western countries are straining with the public health problems caused by this kind of food.<eos> Diabetes in America is up to 8% of the population and Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes, now is afflicting children.<eos> In 1980, you could not find a child with Type 2 diabetes.<eos> And just like cigarettes, just like pesticides, when people wake up... to the problems of these products, the industry turns away and sells them to the developing world.
They will have no idea about coconut oil.<eos> Once you have changed people's taste buds, you've changed the way they eat.<eos> It's difficult to turn it around.<eos> [man on TV] With beef and fresh veggies, and drizzled with Pizza Hut's special sauce, the new cheeseburger...<eos> [Michael] One of the problems with industrial cookery is that they take these really wonderful but labor-intense foods, like French fries, and they cook them so well and so cheaply that you can have them every day.
But it's essential.<eos> If you don't do this, you don't get the nutrients out of it.<eos> Wheat, even in the form of milled flour, is hard for our bodies to digest.<eos> One of the advantages of the long sourdough fermentation that Richard has mastered is that it allows bacteria to fully break down the carbohydrates and the strong, stretchy gluten in the dough.<eos> It also releases the healthy minerals in the grain so that our bodies can more easily absorb them.
Is he OK?<eos> - Lewis!<eos> - Is he OK?<eos> I know it doesn't look like it, but this is the opportunity to get Troy back off the gangsters!<eos> If we free ourselves from the gangsters and organise ourselves... .. the humans won't know what has hit them!
And if they band together, they'll destroy you.<eos> You said that you buried the bodies!<eos> Instead, their heads end up on pikes.<eos> How did this happen? !<eos> The Red Knights must have followed us the night we left the castle and dug them up.
You don't like me.<eos> But I need a favor, and there's no one else I can ask.<eos> I have to access some records, and I can't use my code to log in.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because no one can know I looked at them.
I've dealt with these two particular cops before.<eos> Last time was about a year ago.<eos> When were you gonna mention that?<eos> Well, nothing stuck, and accusations against Vice cops are a dime a dozen.<eos> But if I get them in here, and they are part of a high-level investigation, they will have to give that up in order to save their shields.
Binoculars.<eos> I have a pair at home.<eos> I use them to watch birds.<eos> I mean, there aren't a lot of birds, but I do like to watch them.<eos> I mean... it's not like I use them to watch my neighbors.
And what happens then, Grace?<eos> We have all this power, but what kind of people are we?<eos> Our daughter locked away, for what?<eos> Ken, do you know when it's time to let go of your children?<eos> When you don't recognize them anymore.
Great.<eos> In here.<eos> I made pierogi.<eos> Missing the 'old country'?<eos> My mother used to make them for breakfast just like this.
All right, boys, Alicia's gonna be here in ten, so I want those teeth brushed, faces washed, flies zipped...<eos> - No.<eos> Not a discussion.<eos> Scoot.<eos> Okay, I don't know who those kids are, but I'm keeping them.
We're doing VIP packages now?<eos> Uh, yes, we are, thanks to your "anything for a buck bloke."<eos> - Wes!<eos> - Yes?<eos> Satan's spawn... I mean, uh, Staton's spawn, is going to spend the day with his godparents, God bless them.
There they are. There they are. I told you they'd be here.<eos> - I can't see inside. - There they are.<eos> That's part of the deal.<eos> Yeah, well, we're doing a Missing Persons piece, so if I can't see the goddamn hostages, we don't have a story.<eos> - Where are they taking them?
I had to improvise.<eos> The over-the-counter stuff wasn't working.<eos> That's Frank and that's Sully.<eos> - Hi, guys. - Hey. How you doin'?<eos> I've asked them very politely to make sure that Marty stays alive, and if he doesn't, then I will cut their thumbs off and feed them to the squirrels.
Aye, ma'am.<eos> I was plagued with a fever and have come back to convalesce.<eos> Well, doubtless you'll enjoy exploring the coves hereabouts.<eos> You looking for smugglers, are you, sir?<eos> But surely after your last visit, you've quite put them down?
Out of sail-making?<eos> Or selling your friends?<eos> Get out! Now!<eos> And take your nasty suspicions with 'ee!<eos> It's you who should get out, Charlie, before your friends realise you've betrayed them.
Uh, I'm a fan of "Four legs good, two legs bad."<eos> I'm guessing you're not here to wax poetic about 20th century authors.<eos> I find nothing poetic about a government agency watching passively as two Turkish agents rob, maim and murder American citizens.<eos> You mean the Celik brothers.<eos> You expect me to believe that the NSA is surveilling them because they are not spies?
I'd rather have root canal on my nuts.<eos> I need to find a few million dollars by sunrise.<eos> Is that all?<eos> It's for the nurses.<eos> It will carry them for the next three years. Hmm.
Young Clenna?<eos> She's on her way, Sir, as we speak.<eos> Middle of the night. We come out of the forest and we work quietly.<eos> Three, maybe four barrels of gunpowder. That should be enough.<eos> We place them at the back behind the tents, there out of sight.
Michael, I'm not going out there.<eos> There's wolves out there.<eos> What?<eos> Wolves.<eos> Lord Benton told me about them. I heard them howling.
By joining a band of Druids?<eos> Bash, you've seen how they live, hand to mouth, how they are persecuted.<eos> I've seen other things, too.<eos> Mary, I've seen the dead.<eos> I've seen them walk the halls of the castle.
What any IT officer worth his salt would do.<eos> I'm maintaining our system, so it appears we're still a functioning law firm to the outside world.<eos> Can you electronically serve legal notice to every partner in the next two hours?<eos> As long as you've got their official business addresses, I can do it in the next two minutes.<eos> Well, it's a good thing I have them right here.
Still can't ignore it.<eos> I remember that.<eos> The media said it was this big distribution ring.<eos> It was just two guys and personal use.<eos> Was Major Hamilton close to them?
I have.<eos> Go insane otherwise.<eos> How are the kids?<eos> Not sure tonight.<eos> Tried a Skype call, but my darling mother had put them to bed early so she could watch her favourite TV show.
She's already facing a full public hearing.<eos> Did you forward that text to anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Well, did one of Keisha's flatmates get a hold of your phone, or...<eos> I didn't even see them.
Although, I might.<eos> It's probably best that we don't touch Heather's desk. I know.<eos> It just seems unbelievable.<eos> Yeah. Hey, you taking some time off?<eos> I'll have to write the report for the Governor and then I'm going to pick up the kids, take them on a treat overseas somewhere.
Sorry.<eos> You don't say "good job"?<eos> Well, we try to not put subjective labels on our children's work.<eos> Good, bad, those words can have a negative impact.<eos> Instead, we encourage them to simply enjoy the process.
- Just shut up.<eos> Just shut up.<eos> Then Val made pot stickers for Santa Claus, which no one has ever done in history.<eos> And guess what?<eos> Santa ate all of them.
Pierre's just told me that his sister's to be married to a wool merchant, and a rich one at that.<eos> He's risked life and limb to deliver her to her future husband, and now he wants compensation for his troubles.<eos> He wants to ransom off his own sister.<eos> With his sister none the wiser, we'll hold on to them for a few days until we can collect the ransom from the fiancé.<eos> After we've split the money with Pierre, we'll send them along to Falkirk.
Do you still hide in the shadows?<eos> Cross the field, Queen Regent.<eos> I will take no step further until you produce Charles.<eos> You were given instructions.<eos> If you hope to see your son alive, you will follow them.
But does Ava's death really hurt your case against Dwight Darnell?<eos> For the murders, no.<eos> But without Ava, connecting Zyklon to Dwight is impossible.<eos> The brotherhood inspired these killings.<eos> If we don't stop them, worse things could happen.
Fellas, I can't make it to Atlanta with the cigars.<eos> I mean, who is this guy?<eos> He's a promoter, Vince Packard.<eos> He works with rock bands.<eos> We just need someone to drive them to him in Atlanta.
That's all.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> I told the lawyers to settle.<eos> Pay them out, and get it behind us.
You understand that.<eos> Right?<eos> It's easy to figure out what you should've done when you replay it.<eos> I found something.<eos> You see your mistakes, you know how you'd correct them.
This is what I wanted to show you.<eos> See the reflector there on the guardrail? Yeah.<eos> There shouldn't be any red reflectors along that stretch of road.<eos> Department of Transit only uses yellow reflectors.<eos> Layla put them there so she'd know exactly where to hit.
Can I help you?<eos> We heard it's first drink free for everyone dressed as zombies.<eos> - You did?<eos> From who?<eos> - Me. I had some business cards in my pockets. So I handed them out at the convention.
What about the accounting ledger that you were supposed to go over?<eos> There was nothing around Michael when I found him.<eos> So whoever killed him might have taken the documents and was waiting to shoot you.<eos> Who else knows about these documents?<eos> I found them on my father's computer, and then I destroyed the hard drive.
I'll take them right now.<eos> How did you know I was here?<eos> My son can't keep anything from me.<eos> Well, then you know that he asked me to hold on to these documents.<eos> And I have decided that it's best if I have them.
We traced the shotgun to Noah Brenner.<eos> It looks like he's our shooter.<eos> - Do you know why?<eos> - No, not yet. But the answer has to be in those papers, so we need them for motive.<eos> I will bring them back to BPD.
That's up to you.<eos> Do you have something you feel like you'd like to hide?<eos> Hey.<eos> The funeral home sent over their files.<eos> I, uh, just left them on your desk.
The adult guests were sitting around the pool while the kids played hide-and-seek.<eos> They alibied each other.<eos> Detectives also cleared two of the staff - that were working in the kitchen.<eos> - What about the kids?<eos> Police interviewed them, but nobody saw anything.
Like one of her patients.<eos> It could be why he killed her.<eos> This woman, she was the only person who cared about these guys.<eos> I mean, she... she knew what they were.<eos> She didn't give up on them.
I told you.<eos> Pennies.<eos> Not pennies, David.<eos> Wishes.<eos> I don't care who's making them. Let's get out of here!
Or I can cash them all in today and make this the greatest Mother's Day of my life.<eos> What the...<eos> You kept all those?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Through the years, you've given me many coupons, and I've been saving them all for a rainy day.
At least four of them are packing.<eos> We should be tapped into surveillance now.<eos> Let's see what we get.<eos> Where are the other two men?<eos> We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
You have to stop him, Heywood.<eos> But he's picking up the hammer.<eos> Think of something.<eos> Your Honor, uh, we've not seen the back up documents ever.<eos> That's because you never requested them.
Brick could be lost in the woods.<eos> But it's up to him to find his own way home.<eos> See, that's such a great idea.<eos> It is, isn't?<eos> Makes them more self-sufficient.
Why are we hiding them in the bedroom?<eos> Sorry we're early, the traffic was light.<eos> Oh, you must be Zach.<eos> Mom?<eos> Grandma likes the flowers. She's pulling them out into the living room.
Are you suggesting that Mr. McVeigh is lying here, Ms. Westfall?<eos> No, Kurt is one of the most honest people I know. I... I do think he had reason to spin his results.<eos> I think that's fair, given the make-up of the defense team.<eos> Nothing further, Your Honor.<eos> Ms. Westfall, even if what you say is true... Mr. McVeigh oversold his conclusions here... there's no reason to believe that he didn't equally oversell them to Governor Florrick?
Does it remind you of anyone we know?<eos> He made her look just like Dr. Brennan.<eos> If you come up with anything, just let me know, all right?<eos> Thanks. You got something?<eos> Ah, I just got off the phone with the thrift store where Bones donated all her clothes and no one remembers who purchased them.
Thanks for taking the time to see us.<eos> Dr. Faulk, I must say the decor here is unlike anything<eos> I've seen in a psychologist's office.<eos> These firing neurons are quite beautiful.<eos> Oh, I'm glad you appreciate them.
He did it.<eos> Look, all I'm saying, Bones, is take a look at his file.<eos> His parents were murdered when he was seven-years-old. What?<eos> You think that a first grader is capable of murder?<eos> I'm not saying he killed them.
No way, these are my socks.<eos> No way.<eos> Booth, I know they're your way of keeping your individuality at the FBI, but you don't need a hundred pairs.<eos> I do need a hundred pairs.<eos> I wear these socks, I actually put them on my feet.
I have my 20/10 vision back, and I don't need to squint anymore.<eos> That's too bad. Why?<eos> You really like those glasses?<eos> They were sexy, Booth.<eos> I mean, you know, I was kind of hoping you'd wear them to bed.
Alex's allergies.<eos> Didn't know you could be allergic to carriage leather.<eos> Still, just so much good family time.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> You could blow off the convention. We could stay here for a romantic few days but never tell the kids because we just made them go home? Yes!
Look, the FBI and the CIA used to be able to do whatever they wanted in the name of national security, but over the years, laws have been passed rightfully -- to keep us from crossing the line.<eos> We believe that some people in the Agency decided they're done with these laws.<eos> They want the old ways restored -- no accountability, no rules, no oversight.<eos> Now, whoever this rogue group is, they've been growing within the CIA for years with their own nefarious agenda, and we need to stop them.<eos> The recruitment is happening on The Farm, and we believe Owen Hall, who is the head instructor, is finding the right candidates and indoctrinating them while training them right alongside the other students.
They're coming.<eos> The three girls barely made it down the driveway.<eos> The inspector...<eos> The messages will come.<eos> The girls will bring them!
He didn't call me though.<eos> He's got something else on his mind.<eos> You know when he's gonna show up?<eos> - He was just here to get the papers.<eos> Where is he selling them?
- Previously on Scream...<eos> - Hey! Welcome home, girl interrupted.<eos> I had some issues and I dealt with them.
No, it cannot be gone.<eos> I mean, they-they can't just take it away like that.<eos> You can't just pull out a building like it was a bad tooth or something.<eos> It's New York City, Hanna.<eos> They tear things down as quickly as they put them up.
Yes, I think I would.<eos> I saw they kept the big gates out in front.<eos> Yeah, they did.<eos> At night, boys from town used to rattle sticks on the bars.<eos> Somebody would dare them to go to the nut house after midnight.
I thought, "well", "what better way to get to them without anyone suspecting me?<eos> "I could take the chanels out, and everyone would just suspect the other Green Meanie."<eos> So why did you start eating all that hair?<eos> I went to the hair salon and paid them for the droppings on the floor.<eos> And then I went home... And I pounded them.
- And you.<eos> How are you?<eos> And the kids?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> Emma's 13, Edward's 11, both at boarding school, - so I don't get to see them as much as I'd like.
Hey, Bos. Bos, you got a sec?<eos> Real quick.<eos> Bos.<eos> Hey, listen, look, I know you hate these meetings.<eos> Oh, yeah, compared to a prostate exam, no, I positively love them.
I made a hundred mothers just like me.<eos> A thousand mothers... grieving.<eos> This is not your fault.<eos> I thought losing my...<eos> Emma... was the worst thing ever... ever... but all those children... I killed them.
This is a win for us.<eos> This is the third raid of the campus in two weeks.<eos> And it's not going to stop.<eos> These prayer spaces are a problem.<eos> Religious extremists use them to spread their message, to radicalize other students.
Well, at least Angela Merkel wasn't naked.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Did we have fun? - We had a great time.<eos> Good.<eos> Staring at the poll numbers all day won't change them.
We're so close.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You're nowhere near done.<eos> I'm staring at a floor covered in names.<eos> And I'll kill every last one of them.
When we wrote music together... you not only tolerated a vampire, you fell in love with one.<eos> Play that song and you will have something to hold onto.<eos> Like I do.<eos> I have always wanted to be loved by someone in the way that you loved me.<eos> And I would rather have those memories than any future where I destroy them.
No, we were equals.<eos> We weren't great or powerful, because we stood only in relation to each other.<eos> You think you made the archangels to bring light?<eos> No.<eos> You made them to create lesser beings, to make you large, to make you Lord.
- Well, I do love surprises.<eos> - That's the point.<eos> For the record, I don't like to be surprised.<eos> Never?<eos> When I was a kid, at Christmas I would sneak down, open my presents and rewrap them.
- Absolutely.<eos> Oh, and if I come back after school too?<eos> - I love the enthusiasm.<eos> - Great.<eos> Oh, and if you haven't gotten those tickets for that play, they're selling them at my school, so I can get them for you.
So I'm gonna go.<eos> Why is she wearing her crush boots?<eos> - Her what boots?<eos> - Her crush boots.<eos> They kill her arches, so she only wears them when she's trying to get someone's attention.
Now they will know what it is to be afraid.<eos> During these attacks, over 50 cartel members were killed and hundreds of millions of dollars of cocaine destroyed.<eos> But it wasn't without a cost.<eos> Six soldiers gave their lives to help eradicate those who would poison, corrupt, and kill our children.<eos> Today, we honor and salute them and their families for this ultimate sacrifice.
I'm just pointing out the fact...<eos> This is over.<eos> This is the army, drew.<eos> This is not a democracy.<eos> We have orders to follow, and follow them, we will. Okay, so just to hell with the Hippocratic oath, then.
Okay.<eos> I'm not scared of nothing.<eos> Okay, well, I like your bracelets.<eos> Are they helping with your arthritis?<eos> Sí. My curandera gave them to me.
Irina's father in Moscow.<eos> Any news on Martha?<eos> No.<eos> I want someone to contact her parents soon.<eos> I'll have the Centre call them when they think it's safe.
And I said 'How can I help you?<eos> I know nothing about autism.<eos> You've come through the wrong number.'<eos> And she said: 'No, doctor.<eos> My child has terrible gastrointestinal issues and no one will take them seriously.'
"Seizures, a severe headache, a change in behavior or consciousness, or difficulty walking. "<eos> Following his fibril convulsion that he had the same day of the MMR we were told to take him home.<eos> He slept in the bed with us for the night. He seemed just very, very sleepy.<eos> In fact, he didn't really ever wake up to the Billy that we had before.<eos> For me, it became really necessary to start looking at Headquarters CARD what types of medical issues are these children going through, Headquarters CARD what are the other factors that have affected them, that have brought them to this level of symptomology that we call autism.
Liar.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, what's up with those fliers?<eos> Did they find the creep who put them up?
You're right. You're right.<eos> I'll do whatever you say.<eos> Gary, Gary, you told me your kids love you.<eos> You told me that you were their hero.<eos> All right, now I know you love them.
Oh, well, here.<eos> Let me at least help you with dishes.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> You know, it's okay.<eos> I'm just gonna throw them in the recycling anyway.
It ends with a ceremony at Hendee's headquarters.<eos> The press from New York is covering it.<eos> This race is about three things.<eos> Number one, sales.<eos> We need dealers to survive. And this is how we get them.
Butch.<eos> Posting bills without permission is illegal, so most of the time, I would do it at night.<eos> He came with me.<eos> To make sure I was safe.<eos> So he knew about the two locations, thanks to you, but you think he chose them himself?
Can you believe it?<eos> Luca actually fell asleep in my arms.<eos> - Sounds like he's crying.<eos> - Nope, nope.<eos> Uh, it's just, uh, um, a documentary that I-I'm watching about helicopter parenting and how the the kids get so sad that the parents are always calling and checking up on them.
See, you're young, you think life is too short.<eos> No.<eos> Life is too long.<eos> Fill the time, go have kids.<eos> Look, I get why kids could be amazing, but I don't think I should have them unless I really, really want them.
Just keep the radar equipment behind.<eos> Pandova, we need to move!<eos> I grew up in Oklahoma, I know what a tornado this size can do.<eos> Which is why we have to move.<eos> This twister will rip up earth five-feet deep, destroy the remains, scatter them up to 20 miles, and it never ends, no one gets closure.
What you are talking about isn't a military tactic.<eos> It's mass murder, and you know it.<eos> The problem with the War on Terror is that it's not terrifying enough.<eos> ISIS doesn't deny their attacks.<eos> They film them, publicize them, brag about them.
Close your eyes.<eos> What?<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> What for?<eos> Well, you'll not find out till you close them, so...
I'm sure it won't last.<eos> Where are we on the home healthcare aide?<eos> Sam is sending the court order over to the ISP.<eos> It's the only way they'll turn over Eduardo's home address, but we do have access to his texts.<eos> Tess and Frankie are going through them right now.
Get some cash, drive yourself down to Cabo.<eos> You're old enough.<eos> You deserve Cabo.<eos> My parents would so come after me.<eos> Not if you tied them up.
So now they got half of California on this thing.<eos> - They killed a cop?<eos> - Off-duty.<eos> He was doing security for a merchants' group.<eos> Well, I hope you catch them.
Are you listening?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I forgot. I got to pick up rent checks for Smurf.<eos> Right now?<eos> Yeah, she needs them tonight.
Sandra: When Patrick told me you were in danger, I realized it was time to reach out.<eos> Why didn't you arrest her, charge her with murder?<eos> Smurf didn't set the fire, she made Pope do it.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Pope hated my parents, but he wouldn't kill them.
That son of a bitch tried to scalp me.<eos> I shot him.<eos> But these signs, they point that way.<eos> Kerosene.<eos> All right, so he does his housework, rolls the bodies into the rug, puts them in the cart, wheels it down to the water.
He burns the cart.<eos> Covers his tracks.<eos> Well, he have weighed the bodies.<eos> Already on it, Reid.<eos> My guess is he probably weighed 'em down just enough to let the current take them all the way to the ocean.
So anything heavy in the water would most likely be washed aground.<eos> Just after this meander.<eos> Good Luck Hope.<eos> 11:00 tonight, the tide at its lowest.<eos> After that, the current will wash them away into the Thames.
A newspaper is a device for making the ignorant more ignorant... ..and the crazy crazier.<eos> And this is...everyone else.<eos> APPLAUSE Dave...<eos> He's worried that this is affecting the kids.<eos> Nobody's going to take them away from you.
Right there.<eos> Okay.<eos> You do the talking.<eos> So, what's our plan?<eos> Well, if things go easy, we sneak in while everybody's asleep, find the Confederate plans, and grab them.
I've been nothing but scared since my suit was destroyed.<eos> I've been terrified that I have nothing to offer the team.<eos> But you have to get over your fears if we're gonna survive this.<eos> We've only seen these things downwind from here.<eos> We can pick them off in this valley until they're all gone.
- Time jump. - Time jump.<eos> - Time jump.<eos> Course plotted for Central City, 2016.<eos> If you're such BFFs with the Dominators...<eos> Then why don't you call them off?
- Time jump.<eos> Course plotted for Central City, 2016.<eos> If you're such BFFs with the Dominators...<eos> Then why don't you call them off?<eos> We know you sent them packing once before, back in 1951.
If you're such BFFs with the Dominators...<eos> Then why don't you call them off?<eos> We know you sent them packing once before, back in 1951.<eos> That was just a reconnaissance mission.<eos> What brought them back?
All right.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Caitlin, I've been going over the data we collected, and I found some disconcerting results.<eos> Your body's chemistry is changing in ways that I don't fully understand, but one thing is clear.<eos> These powers you have, the more you use them, the more difficult they're going to be to reverse.
- You're a fake.<eos> Let me prove my worth.<eos> If I fail, I will right back to my Earth.<eos> If I succeed, I will have done some good with my life.<eos> Caitlin, these powers you have, the more you use them, the more difficult they're going to be to reverse.
I was able to I.D. the genie based on your description.<eos> Good work.<eos> Laugh it up, you guys.<eos> I still have two wishes left.<eos> I'm not above using them for evil.
- Terrorist.<eos> - Terrorist, yeah. yeah.<eos> I don't think they're terrorists.<eos> I don't know what they are.<eos> I see them as two abandoned bags at the airport.
What about the girl who got away from you?<eos> So, everyone is not secured?<eos> We will find them.<eos> Not standing in here.<eos> If Tahir's smart, he'll round up all the students and staff and secure them in one location, probably the gym or the cafeteria.
Rats?<eos> You delivered rats?<eos> Well, it's not about the rats, it's about the mites that are on the rats.<eos> Please, just stop talking.<eos> Health inspector detects them, shuts down the restaurant.
Well, you can tell them Homeland will cover it.<eos> It's not our responsibil...<eos> Are those chocolates?<eos> I... enjoy chocolates. Mmm.<eos> Tim sent them to Paige.
Bureau put together a pretty impressive rap sheet.<eos> Yep. It had to be impressive, so he'd be attractive to these guys.<eos> This is the Philly Black Mafia.<eos> According to Joe White's contact, these guys were a street gang who controlled vice, drugs, even some cops.<eos> The FBI put together a task force, went in, dismantled them from the inside out using undercovers.
Everybody, just take a deep breath.<eos> You pull that trigger, and you'll tell the cops exactly where we are, quicker than Duclair ever could.<eos> Trust me, they're out there, listening.<eos> They're waiting for us to give up our location.<eos> That gun leads them right to us.
What?<eos> What about all the other towns, John?<eos> Delle Seyah's planning rations for the whole mood.<eos> Millions will die.<eos> How do we save them?
So I went up there.<eos> There he was, walking out.<eos> I grabbed him, I tried to drag him into my car, but...<eos> But what?<eos> He knew that I was... liberating meds from patients and selling them on the street.
I pulled all active and passive cellphone signals originating from the cell tower that served the empty house.<eos> Must have been hundreds.<eos> Try thousands.<eos> Which was daunting.<eos> But then I screened them against phone signals along the route the right-hand man took from the crime scene to the house, and those IMEI numbers started to shrink until... only one remained.
- Get me five of Haldol. - Get them off of me!<eos> - Page Doctor Charles.<eos> - Got you.<eos> - Ellie, there's nothing there. - No, no, no!<eos> - Ellie! - Get them off!
I have a son.<eos> I would do anything for him, but do you understand what's happening in your body right now?<eos> The proteins from your placenta are poisoning your blood, and at any moment you could have an eclamptic seizure that could kill you and this baby.<eos> Ms. Desai, your boys would rather spend 100 Chicago winters in a shelter than a lifetime without their mother.<eos> Don't orphan them for this money.
Toddlers love classic slasher flicks from the 1980s.<eos> Just kidding. We're gonna go see Dory for the eight millionth time so I can stab my eyes out with a fork.<eos> Kev, I don't think we should let Yvon keep feeding the babies.<eos> The knife thing. I know.<eos> That, and I don't like the way he looks at them.
Weren't you taking them this morning?<eos> No, I was parking and re-parking the boobie van all day. I thought Svetlana had them.<eos> Since when do I take babies anymore?<eos> They're with my father.<eos> You let him take them?
One of them. The other two are his step-grandchildren through marriage.<eos> Has the parent of the two stepchildren been contacted?<eos> I'm here. It's me. The babies are mine and his.<eos> Yeah, she's my wife.<eos> The guy who took them is my other wife's dad.
Too long.<eos> Hey, you need to take a couple puffs from your inhaler.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> I checked every closet on the floor.<eos> I knew you'd be in one of them.
Come on. It's the patients getting screwed now.<eos> You're really gonna go there?<eos> You're gonna put that on us?<eos> You need to take those handheld urinals and shove them straight up your...<eos> If could find them, you know?
Please let me handle this. Do you understand?<eos> Callie.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Can I go? Yes.<eos> Oh, hey, we need to clean out the house, so I need you to take those case files back to wherever you got them, please.
- No!<eos> Those missiles came out of no where.<eos> They were circling.<eos> Damn things can loiter at high altitude for hours.<eos> - James didn't even see them coming. - Unh-unh.
- Uh-huh. And it's Josh's new assistant.<eos> He asked you out?<eos> Uh, no, I asked him.<eos> You know how shy guys are.<eos> You gotta be a little more forward, smile more, laugh harder, and, you know, when that doesn't work, you just corner them and ask them out.
What if I can't handle the fast-paced living of Pigeon Forge?<eos> It's just one summer. You got to at least try it.<eos> And if it doesn't work out, you can always come back home.<eos> It's like my boots.<eos> They didn't work out, so I took them back and got a bunch of T-shirts, huh?
- I-I don't know how you do it, Mer.<eos> - Do what? Love your kids like this.<eos> I really love them.<eos> - They love you, too.<eos> - No, I love them like... If something happened to them, I would die.
I was with a friend.<eos> Friend?<eos> Demons don't have friends.<eos> Someone who's been helping me do some soul-searching.<eos> What, like hunting them down and killing them?
Where are you?<eos> (car alarm chirps) No, no, no!<eos> Put me down!<eos> I have rights!<eos> I know 'cause I memorized them!
House?<eos> What house?<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> "If you've come into contact with contaminated hair"--<eos> Okay, kids, I want you to take off all your clothes and chuck them in the dryer now!
Very small.<eos> So I strangled the too.<eos> They were small.<eos> They wanted to sit next to each other...<eos> So I put them next to each other.
She was weak.<eos> The children were, were...small.<eos> So I strangled them too. Both.<eos> They were small.<eos> They wanted to sit next to each other, so I put them such.
No, damn it!<eos> The sunglasses, don't take them on.<eos> Have you been after him too?<eos> Take it easy. Now let me be.<eos> The two children were very small, so I strangled them.
The sunglasses, don't take them on.<eos> Have you been after him too?<eos> Take it easy. Now let me be.<eos> The two children were very small, so I strangled them.<eos> They wanted to sit next to each other, so I put them next to each other.
I led him around the crime scene.<eos> We had already found the bodies. Interrogation was confusing.<eos> We had to check the information on the spot.<eos> He showed us the place, but he didn't knew why the bodies were not there.<eos> As if he was afraid that he hadn't killed them.
Dag wanted me to tell you to scare you off.<eos> So we have to find out if Dag killed our friends.<eos> Jessan, Osvald and Lippi.<eos> They found out what you were up to and now they're dead.<eos> Did Dag kill them because they had found out your secret?
You okay, Lex?<eos> Yeah, no, um...<eos> I'm not.<eos> I send Brooke flowers at least once a day.<eos> She never accepts them.
I'll make friends with the elephants.<eos> We have to get away from him.<eos> Okay, I'll make the call.<eos> Now, you're gonna have to help me pack up all our things.<eos> I got to look for our passports, 'cause I think your father hid them.
I tried to bring too much of myself to the job, and I'm sorry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Go ahead, Murphy Station. What's your progress?<eos> Mr. President, we've been actively tracking a purchase of explosives by two high-ranking members of Hizb Al-Shahid.<eos> When our operatives followed them after the purchase, we got something we weren't expecting.
I mean, she's into some, like, weird kinky shit, but you'll like her.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've got some work crap I have to take care of and try not to shoot myself.<eos> There's beer and leftover tacos in the fridge.<eos> ♪ Actually, don't eat the tacos because I can't remember when I bought them and they probably have food poisoning.
Leave me alone. I got nothing left to give you kids!<eos> You did this to me!<eos> But for all us eighth graders, the last week of school meant one thing.<eos> All right, boys and girls, today begins Freshman Fear Week.<eos> This is when upperclassmen hunt down terrified incoming ninth graders and throw them in the showers.
Okay, so what's your solution?<eos> Routing numbers.<eos> It's how banks move money.<eos> And our subscribers pay by checks, so their account numbers are already on file.<eos> Okay, you sell me Superman. Mutiny pulls funds directly from my bank and deposits them into your account using our own ABA routing number as a pipeline.
How'd you know that?<eos> So... if it's not this blood pressure medicine,<eos> - what is it?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> These strokes, if it's not about the blood pressure medicine, what's causing them?
How do you know this?<eos> (SIGHS) I hear them.<eos> Good.<eos> Keep walking.<eos> Sound relates them to you.
It was old, decayed.<eos> Ah, a fascinating description.<eos> You see much for being blind.<eos> Well, I know what they look like.<eos> I saw them when I had my sight.
That's because denying is the first reaction to a failure.<eos> Three failures, Doctor.<eos> We tried 3 times to make them...<eos> you know... Yes.<eos> However, Clarissa sees them as personal failures. - Excuse me a minute.
- Come on, go ahead.<eos> - No, you go ahead.<eos> Come on, put those few little flowers.<eos> Paolo loved wildflowers.<eos> Where did you pick them, sweetie?
We're talking about kids fighting in cages and people betting on them, here in Sweden?<eos> Yes and I'm not surprised.<eos> When did you find that out?<eos> We'd known for a while and it's always been our priority.<eos> Why not stop them before then?
Be reasonable, man.<eos> Look, I didn't kill anybody, okay?<eos> I'm the cleaner, that's it.<eos> You're just the cleaner. Yeah.<eos> You're just the guy who chops up the bodies and dumps them in a vat of acid.
They don't have a choice.<eos> I've willed it so.<eos> One of them will lose.<eos> So, if you're not gonna choose, then I guess we'll just let the boys settle it amongst themselves.<eos> All right, I didn't cut them into star shapes like Seline does, but I've got some really cool
Quite.<eos> Our engineers have spent years blending sorcery and technology.<eos> For instance, we don't always decapitate vampires.<eos> Inefficient, really, especially for large nests.<eos> We irradiate them, reorder their DNA.
Was it dinner?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Oh!<eos> Geez!<eos> Can somebody tell me why I'm paying for cellphones every month when nobody's gonna use them?
Along with our best chance of striking back at the Pons.<eos> So what do we do, drill through the casing and vacuum out the crystal?<eos> It's too volatile.<eos> We add water.<eos> Turn them into liquid, siphon them into a canister using a pump.
And it's my fault.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Tommy and tracy...<eos> The turkeys...<eos> They're just gonna shoot them, for nothing.
Hey, I'm going to get you some water, okay?<eos> Be careful.<eos> I'll go quick.<eos> Are the boys in the hospital?<eos> Yes, I moved them to the maternity ward.
Did you hear what I said?<eos> They're holding conscious synths somewhere.<eos> We need to find them, get them out.<eos> Then what?<eos> What will you do once you've freed them?
They're holding conscious synths somewhere.<eos> We need to find them, get them out.<eos> Then what?<eos> What will you do once you've freed them?<eos> We protect them. Keep them safe.
He wrote the original consciousness code for them.<eos> They are still alive.<eos> They are out there somewhere, living in secret.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> Because Leo Elster has been protecting them.
Remind me.<eos> It's from the Song of Songs.<eos> "When... "the day spreads and the shadows flee, I will go to the mountain and heights of incense."<eos> Got to work out why these two things relate.<eos> What makes them inseparable.
Shoot!<eos> Shoot!<eos> That's an order!<eos> Shoo"<eos> We bid farewell to these war heroes, with eternal thanks for their endeavor. May God reward them when He receives them in Heaven.
What do you mean?<eos> Look, look at them.<eos> At a moment like this, no one knows what happened to their families.<eos> We don't even know if your damn friends are infected!<eos> But allow them in here? ! Huh?
What if he wants to have children?<eos> Wait, you can't have children?<eos> Yes, well... no.<eos> I mean, I think I can.<eos> I just, I mean, what if he w... What if he wants them sooner than I do?
And she eats him alive.<eos> In fact, it may be the toxins that she is after.<eos> She can't produce such chemicals herself.<eos> So she tricks and then devours males of different species to obtain them.<eos> If she can't get males to come to her, she goes after them.
Hey, how's old Tommy Rendon?<eos> - Uh... - Kids on the radar for you yet?<eos> Ooh, no.<eos> No, I...<eos> Tom wants them, but...
- Uh... - Kids on the radar for you yet?<eos> Ooh, no.<eos> No, I...<eos> Tom wants them, but...<eos> If it was up to me, we'd just get them out of a vending machine like everything else in Japan. - Like what?
(sirens approaching) But it doesn't sound like you've got much of a head start now.<eos> There must be something in Molly Ryan's flat, - something we missed.<eos> - Don't get your hopes up, mate.<eos> Crime scene techs scoured every inch of this place.<eos> If Luc left his bloody clothes anywhere, we'd have found them.
There must be something in Molly Ryan's flat, - something we missed.<eos> - Don't get your hopes up, mate.<eos> Crime scene techs scoured every inch of this place.<eos> If Luc left his bloody clothes anywhere, we'd have found them.<eos> Maybe he didn't leave them in the building.
Fucking twat.<eos> What a fucking idiot!<eos> If that shit gets out, that's my wife out the door.<eos> Then there's the kids, she'll take them.<eos> Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind she'd take them and she'd win.
Seems like mental health issues.<eos> He's got some interesting views on roaches, by all accounts.<eos> I'm putting his info in your Mass system now.<eos> Been complaints lodged against him going months back.<eos> Locals claim that he let roaches cross his land, left food out for them.
I'm Karin Parke.<eos> Did you pack a bag?<eos> - Yeah, it's by the door.<eos> - Right, let's go.<eos> - Rasmus got a track on them?
The name of the girl who stabbed you?<eos> You don't know any of these things, do you?<eos> Don't you think that's odd?<eos> It's fucking taking my memories!<eos> Overwriting them, technically.
Hey, Ma. Hey, Hannah.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm glad you're here, Josh.<eos> Look, do you want any of these bears?<eos> - Otherwise I'm throwing them out.
- Everyone's listening.<eos> - You always do this.<eos> You say you don't care and then you hold onto it to win a bigger argument later.<eos> It's so manipulative.<eos> You put your feelings on credit and make me pay for them later.
Okay.<eos> - Okay. - Ah.<eos> It will be so good to get out of Los Angeles just for a day.<eos> - And to be together.<eos> - Oh, and by the way... - Mm-hmm? I cut out some articles in the newspaper and put them together for you.
- Okay. - Ah.<eos> It will be so good to get out of Los Angeles just for a day.<eos> - And to be together.<eos> - Oh, and by the way... - Mm-hmm? I cut out some articles in the newspaper and put them together for you.<eos> I'll give them to you at the hotel.
No, you like to let them hang themselves.<eos> Morning.<eos> Hey.<eos> Here are my scheduling sheets.<eos> Last Chief Res gave them to me.
I promise you one thing:<eos> if things get out of hand and I can't control it... we'll leave the country.<eos> Okay?<eos> Javi, where are the fucking spotters?<eos> Carrillo went a different way. He, uh... he cut them loose.
Business hasn't been affected by what happened at La Catedral, nor by what you did.<eos> Well, business can always get better, right?<eos> Business was pretty good.<eos> And a large part of that was due to a guy they called the Lion.<eos> You might remember him as a Medellín hustler who used to stuff bricks of cocaine into his jacket and smuggle them into Miami.
The Lion had been running Pablo's Miami operation for years, and gotten rich too.<eos> But the moment Cali offered him a better deal, he welcomed his new partners with open arms.<eos> I mean, who could blame the Lion?<eos> Pablo was on his way out and Cali was the future.<eos> He had introduced them to Pablo's bankers...
Are they real?<eos> Yes, Colonel.<eos> I verified the frequencies.<eos> The codes are the same ones Escobar's wife is using.<eos> -He'll use them when he calls her.
- Of course you can't, because it's a KERS system like a Formula One car.<eos> It's got a V12 engine and an electric motor, but they are integrated, they work together, you can't separate them.<eos> - You should have thought about that, shouldn't you?<eos> - Bad planning.<eos> With James reduced to the role of onlooker, we lined up the P1 and the 918 on the start line, but then, instead of revving the petrol engines, we shut them down.
Yup.<eos> And now it is time to reveal those times.<eos> Let me just make it absolutely clear.<eos> We don't know what they are.<eos> The producers have kept them from us.
No problem!<eos> Thank you, Don Salvatore.<eos> This is it!<eos> How much do we get from ten kilos?<eos> You make them 30 for a street value of 2.5 million, right?
Why are you sleeping in your car?<eos> Uh, I'm tired all the time.<eos> I call it Momstein Bar.<eos> I try to power nap when I can.<eos> Yeah, you got to take them here and there, right, Mama?
They're starting to get a little impatient.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Portia Lin is on this station.<eos> Probably Boone as well.<eos> - I want them found.
Um, I want to believe that good things happen for a reason, and that we're not just a... bunch of molecules smashing into each other.<eos> But... I don't know.<eos> What about you?<eos> Well, if you talk to other priests they will tell you they heard God's voice,<eos> His... actual voice, calling them to serve.
Or someone else will die.<eos> Blair.<eos> What's Cricket's favorite song? Why?<eos> What do you care why?<eos> Is this that thing that straight guys do when girls reject them?
- Yeah.<eos> - Who ordered them? - No one, they did it alone.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - They're like rabid dogs.<eos> No one in the clan can stand them, but they're Genny's friends.
There's something about me.<eos> Or there's something about them.<eos> The people that she's with.<eos> Dariela, did the horses target any of the others at all?<eos> No. It's like they didn't even see them, like the animals are with Jackson.
But we're too close to standard flight paths.<eos> It'd be different if we had an EMP on board.<eos> I could build an EMP.<eos> Now you want to kill the pilots?<eos> The electromagnetic pulse won't kill them, it'll kill their planes.
We just played our last card.<eos> The gas is going to drop, and the world is never gonna be the same.<eos> We made the animals our enemies, the monsters.<eos> But we're the monsters.<eos> And now we're gonna punish them for our mistakes.
Well, we have experience tracking animals.<eos> Not like these.<eos> They're reclusive, secretive.<eos> I've lived on this island for half my life, and I've only seen one in the wild.<eos> What if we lure them out? Sure.
We'll figure it out, Mitch.<eos> Well, that's easy for you to say.<eos> The serum cured you. Clem still has the ghost gene.<eos> Once they drop that gas over Maine, she's got less than 12 hours to live.<eos> Why would the Shepherds help us make a cure to save the animals and then drop a gas that will kill them?
It looks like...<eos> Pierce knew that his X-rays were affecting the animals.<eos> He developed a chemical compound to... sterilize the Triple-Helix animals.<eos> Which is why the environmental events stopped.<eos> But if he sterilized them, they couldn't reproduce.
Wait, I've seen that before.<eos> They're the same.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is what Pierce used to fix the animals in 1895.<eos> He sterilized them.
Our child could be one of the last children born.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Unless it's already too late.<eos> My father always said that one day, the animals would reclaim the planet.<eos> He made sure that the TX gas formula helped them to do that.
Oh yeah.<eos> So smart.<eos> My doula's a Sherpa.<eos> -Oh. My doula is a three-month-old baby, so she, like, gets it.<eos> Oh, hey, but right when the baby's crowning, we're gonna take a bunch of rose petals and shove them up my pussy so when she's born it looks just like that scene from American Beauty.
Are you...<eos> Are you hearing this?<eos> Ms. Carpenter, this is the best way.<eos> We do this, we get these guys, camp can continue.<eos> But if we cause panic or if we don't get them, then that's it.
Well, you should be.<eos> They killed Dave and Cricket.<eos> Nobody be a hero here.<eos> Take care of each other.<eos> And call us the minute you have eyes on them.
The demon.<eos> Its name is Malphas.<eos> "He is the great prince of hell.<eos> He will fool you with good familiar spirits<eos> And use them to betray you."
Hi, Tom.<eos> I guess if you're watching this<eos> I'm either dead or I'm in a coma near death, or you've just chosen to ignore my note, in which case I should've gone with Michael Ondaatje.<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> - All I want you to do here is find the most impressive private investigators in the city and then I want you to get them to look into what the heck is happening here.
I believe that we have an undetermined threat out there, and I don't like it.<eos> Not one bit.<eos> You claim that you have unique insight into these subjects?<eos> Well, I am giving you one last chance, Colonel.<eos> Bring them back in yourself, because right now, they are merely another loose end that needs to be snipped.
And the bodies from the penthouse still haven't turned up.<eos> We're starting to think they were stolen.<eos> - We pulled them.<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> The FBI pulled them.
It came to us from another dimension or something.<eos> And then... And then we figured out that we could... we could swap bodies with it.<eos> We started with animals at first.<eos> It was a spiritual thing.<eos> But then we realized we could... we could kidnap rich people and swap bodies with them, and then, when they outlived their usefulness, we'd just kill them and... and swap back.
The chili is very meaningful for the Baniwa people.<eos> Under their own tradition, when a young girl gets married... the first gift from her mother is chili seeds.<eos> And they plant, and they harvest without over-pressuring nature.<eos> But it's important to understand... nowadays, women work planting food, and men work in... not so good activities, like illegal mining, because they didn't have jobs.<eos> And mining takes them far from their families.
Everything about her said "chef."<eos> You know, she was tall and she was poised, intelligent, and this very, very talented person.<eos> You cannot decide to be a great chef.<eos> You either have talent or you don't.<eos> When the dishes come, you eat them with your eyes.
In Mexico, we grow up eating mole.<eos> It is central to Mexican cuisine.<eos> If you're celebrating something, then you're having mole.<eos> Mole is chaos.<eos> There is ingredients from almost everywhere in the world... and when you put them together, it makes sense.
He grew up in the restaurant.<eos> But since Valter was already a sommelier... it had to be me.<eos> The first years were extremely difficult.<eos> I knew how to make pasta at home, but that didn't mean I knew how to cook.<eos> I had so many questions, and I had to deal with them every day.
You get what he calls Indian foie gras, which is goat brain, which is a delicacy in India.<eos> He often introduces it as Indian foie gras, without telling people what they're eating until they've had it.<eos> Then it's a big surprise. You've just had some lovely goat brain.<eos> Eventually, knowing that everybody, somewhere in the back of their head, has that desire to have a good curry and some good freshly-baked naan bread, he delivers that.<eos> He does the curries, but he does them at the end of the meal.
Oh, please.<eos> Good leaders care about the people they lead.<eos> That's what good leadership is.<eos> Like Mr. Fairbrother.<eos> The kids are terrified of him, but he loves them like his own children, and nobody needs goggles made of prophecy glass to see that.
If the cops bust him, I'll be free. And we can go home.<eos> I wish we could stay here forever.<eos> Can't we?<eos> You have the most beautiful eyes.<eos> I hope the baby gets them.
Conservationists use them to catch and collar medium-size game.<eos> Big cats, wolves, pronghorn.<eos> So what's your take on these missing guys?<eos> [chuckles] Just another entitled asshole and his lackey.<eos> If my career weren't on the line, I'd let them stay lost.
So we sell two products here,<eos> NasaPRO and NasaPRO Silver.<eos> We aim this at seniors.<eos> Now, you can't legally call it medicine because it doesn't technically work and it is technically chalk, so what you're gonna want to do...<eos> You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake medicine.
What do you want?<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, this is gonna sound a little odd, so don't laugh, please. But I'm quite keen on horses.<eos> I grew up on a farm in Lincolnshire, rode and took care of them as a lad.
You should have got what was coming to you after spitting in that guy's face.<eos> Why you...<eos> It is impossible to accept the premise of the story, a premise based on the profound American misunderstanding of the nature of the hatred between black and white.<eos> That time is now.<eos> The root of the black man's hatred is rage, and he does not so much hate white men as simply wants them out of his way, and more than that, out of his children's way.
- Argh! - Jesus.<eos> Singh, come here.<eos> He's girlfriend's gone missing. Maybe you...<eos> Do I look like a counsellor?<eos> You face your demons and you conquer them.
You got it wrong, brother.<eos> You and every one of the Red Hand are gonna die for what you did here.<eos> Hey, we had nothing to do with these killings.<eos> We were cutting down our friends to bury them.<eos> Yeah, well you dropped them right on us man!
Kingston hasn't checked in with the DEA since yesterday, and so far, no one can physically locate him.<eos> He goes dark a lot for his cover.<eos> He poses as an arms dealer.<eos> We've got to stop your boss before he sells those missiles.<eos> All right, we believe the cartel will use them today.
They won't let you. I can extend my visa.<eos> Have you seen this place?<eos> Their families have been killed and their villages have been destroyed.<eos> When all this ends, and we pull out, there's gonna be thousands of kids wondering who their mothers and fathers are.<eos> Harry says they call them 'children of the dust'.
If she'd come in earlier...<eos> I can't see anything in her history.<eos> Her mother was probably given DES.<eos> Diethylstilboestrol? They've discovered it can cause incompetent cervix syndrome in women whose mothers took it.<eos> It's supposed to prevent miscarriages, and now it's causing them. There's an irony.
She's afraid of hospitals.<eos> Maybe if she stopped having children out of wedlock... Hey, I'm working on it.<eos> I'm working on it, OK?<eos> Cynthia, your adoption forms? Yes, Matron, I've got them.<eos> I know you've got them.
Maybe if she stopped having children out of wedlock... Hey, I'm working on it.<eos> I'm working on it, OK?<eos> Cynthia, your adoption forms? Yes, Matron, I've got them.<eos> I know you've got them.<eos> I want you to sign them and give them to me.
I've read Roltikkon can form telepathic connections by making physical contact with the dorsum of the tongue.<eos> How do you think she learned English?<eos> She's my ex.<eos> I don't strictly date aliens, for the record though.<eos> I do like them more than most humans. Why?
He's searching for a way home.<eos> Thrace is 700 miles away through hostile territory.<eos> His target is the Cisalpine pass, a break in the Alps leading to the homelands the barbarians left behind.<eos> Word of Spartacus' victory at Vesuvius spreads.<eos> Barbarian slaves from across the Republic flee their masters to join the man they believe will set them free.
The scouts are upon us.<eos> Get it covered now.<eos> We can't strike until the vanguard has passed.<eos> We wait for Varus.<eos> If we hit them too soon, they'll regroup.
Now, you crawl back to Rome and you tell them this soil is already rich with Roman blood.<eos> And if they come back, they will bleed by my hand and for generations to come.<eos> For the first time in nearly 300 years, the barbarians are shifting the balance of power against Rome.<eos> Still determined to conquer Germania, the Empire launches a series of attacks over the next eight years.<eos> Arminius repels them all.
Gold cannot buy you respect.<eos> They don't need to respect me.<eos> They need to fear me.<eos> The barbarians have the advantage over the empire for the first time in 700 years.<eos> Victims of Roman cruelty and violence for generations, they showed no mercy as they begin to dismantle the empire that once forced them into submission.
Theodoric has fallen.<eos> His men have scattered, as have ours.<eos> Where's Attila?<eos> Retreated behind his own wagons.<eos> We engage with them again at dawn.
They live here.<eos> Thank you so much for your hospitality.<eos> Want your shorts?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Why don't you just toss them to me?
You ruined them.<eos> Emily... Did you not see all the glitter and the macaroni?<eos> Those paintings looked way better after I got to them.<eos> I was helping you.<eos> I put everything into those paintings and you destroyed them, Miranda.
I know; I gotta go find the kids.<eos> But we need you here.<eos> I understand.<eos> Give me an hour.<eos> If I don't find them, I'll come back.
Everybody said he was insane.<eos> - I know what that's like.<eos> - Yeah, I bet you do.<eos> And the same principle applies to radio signals.<eos> I transmit them through the ground, immune to the effects of the apocalypse.
- Let us go and you won't die.<eos> - Oh, you got that backwards.<eos> We're here with soldiers.<eos> Better trained than you.<eos> We don't meet them in 15 minutes, they're gonna blow your heads off.
You'll have your 15 minutes, Senator...<eos> Me, a man who-who had two people on his staff killed<eos> - by Syrian terrorists...<eos> - Senator Wheatus, please!<eos> We don't know who killed them - or even if anyone killed them...
Oh, thanks, Henry.<eos> Whoa!<eos> New boots.<eos> Oh, yeah, just got 'em.<eos> Saw them in the store, and I was just like, "Whoa!"
That is so, so, so great.<eos> - I hate your boots.<eos> - What?<eos> I told you that I loved your boots three years ago, and I was lying, and that lie has haunted me ever since, and people tried to tell me it was fine... just a nice, little white lie in the form of social niceties... but I disagreed, and then yesterday<eos> I thought you were gonna die, but now you're not dead, and I can finally be honest and say that those boots are terrible and hideous and I hate them.
That'll explain the battle damage.<eos> And you're confident these men won't betray you?<eos> They swore an oath of loyalty.<eos> Presumably the same oath they swore to the standing Emperor.<eos> The standing Emperor has lead them to an unwinnable war.
DJs! Uh-oh,<eos> Japanese businessmen!<eos> ATM with giant service fee!<eos> Aw, we'll never make it to the game.<eos> Our kids were depending on us and we let them down.
Japanese businessmen!<eos> ATM with giant service fee!<eos> Aw, we'll never make it to the game.<eos> Our kids were depending on us and we let them down.<eos> You let them down. You.
To destroy a dead man's good name while his wife sits in the other room chewing Valium?<eos> I'm here to protect the firm.<eos> You say potato.<eos> I didn't destroy your life.<eos> When you sent those texts to Woody Hammond, you sent them to his company-owned cell phone.
Misty, prep a chair.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was just dropping off a box of cat toys to your dad, but I didn't want to wake him, so I was going to leave them.
I don't know, maybe.<eos> But not now.<eos> Not while I still am a kid.<eos> God, I'll tell you one thing, though.<eos> No matter what happens, I'm not raising them in the Middle of Goddamn Nowhere, New Jersey.
You know how I told you that Nighthorse was going to help me get my bar back?<eos> Well, it happened.<eos> How exactly did you and Nighthorse make it happen?<eos> I found ledgers proving that Malachi was using the Red Pony to launder Mob money.<eos> I showed them to Jacob, and he fired Malachi from the casino.
Sarah Keaton was the driver.<eos> Hello?<eos> I need condoms and a bottle of Baileys.<eos> Come again?<eos> I'd go buy them myself, but Imran's paparazzi's crawling around the hotel, and...
This is a raid!<eos> Nobody move! Against the wall!<eos> All right, turn around, hands on the wall!<eos> Your gambling hall on 4th ave, the cops are raiding it!<eos> I thought we paid them off?
Capone is convinced that "big Jim" is onto their bootlegging business.<eos> Fearful that "big Jim" will order a hit on them,<eos> Capone isn't sure what to do next.<eos> There's no question that colosimo was dangerous.<eos> If he had learned that there was a plot against his business, I'm quite certain he would've killed them himself.
I think Woody's invading your dreams.<eos> I always thought my dreams were just mine.<eos> But then I met a woman who had the ability to enter my dreams, and I realized she wasn't the only one.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think you dream of Woody because Woody is entering your dreams and manipulating them so that you think you're in love with him.
That is nuts."<eos> So, would you say she's controlling, manipulative?<eos> If I biffed a tennis match, She would take away my sheets and pillows.<eos> But that is what made me strong.<eos> My friends had chill parents who didn't push them,
There are just too many of us.<eos> If we can't make the workshop safe for long-term habitation, we're going to need to start considering deploying the dome on the surface.<eos> Then the next ship that comes will be a rescue mission.<eos> We've got eight months.<eos> We're going to use them.
I was getting high with my friend Maria.<eos> I won't deny that.<eos> But all I did to those kids was try and help them. Help them how?<eos> Me and Maria got hungry so we went to get something to eat.<eos> That's when we saw them.
The whole Neighborhood is offline. We only get the welcome channel.<eos> I would love to not watch TV, but you canceled school.<eos> [gasps] What have you done to me, you monster?<eos> Look at all these dishes piling up.<eos> I used to just throw them in the sink, and they'd be magically cleaned by morning.
Is that allowed?<eos> Not really.<eos> But it is a time-honored tradition.<eos> Say no more. I got it.<eos> You know something? As much as I've always wanted to be around humans, I think I've missed a big part of what makes them wonderful.
Severance pay.<eos> Love it.<eos> Good looking out, boss.<eos> Peace!<eos> You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake allergy medicine.
Hit by a drunk driver.<eos> Jesus, that's...<eos> I'm sorry, Mike.<eos> Yeah, it was a long time ago.<eos> Kevin, I understand the instinct to protect your children, but what are you protecting them from?
Can I just... What happened to your teeth?<eos> Some guy cut me in line at dinner.<eos> Called me a fucking Jew.<eos> And I said, "Fuck you, you're a Nazi."<eos> Guard hears this, comes over, takes them out with the stick.
- Yeah, well, she certainly was...<eos> - Yeah, she was great.<eos> It was...<eos> It was the voice she used... for the pigeons.<eos> She always made them sound so rude, you know?
They'll each have two agents, 24/7.<eos> Kids are gonna love that.<eos> Make me the bad cop if you want.<eos> It's not a choice.<eos> Until we figure out who's threatening them, it's a national security matter.
Thank you.<eos> Mmm. Madam Secretary, do you know why civet coffee isn't bitter?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Th-The beans are gnawed on and digested by little animals called civets, but the bean's core is too hard to digest fully, so eventually they poop it out.<eos> Farmers gather them.
OK, guys, welcome.<eos> My name is Morpheus and I'll be your quizmaster this evening.<eos> Can I get a glass of water up here, please?<eos> Now, I appreciate the spirit, but can we keep the team names clean?<eos> As I do have to read them out.

_<eos> _<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> So, the Chens fought back the only way they knew how.<eos> They prayed to their ancestors and they made offerings to protect them from evil.
And then, there were the others.<eos> Here, look.<eos> October 3, 1952.<eos> Three hunters staying in the house.<eos> Something made them turn their rifles on each other and blow their heads off.
Crazy I got this patient today.<eos> My experience, we get the patients we need.<eos> You've created a monster, you know that?<eos> Turns out, the English language is primarily comprised of buzzwords for borderline personality disorders.<eos> Now that I know them, I can't have a conversation without immediately seeing the psych in people, which is clearly an impulsive reaction, which, by the way, could also suggest a borderline personality disorder.
Are you now?<eos> Oh, self-medicating.<eos> Those bone-restoration pills you've been stealing don't relieve pain.<eos> Are you using your arm gauntlets?<eos> They don't work perfectly, but we specifically designed them so that they...
Am I the bird or the stone?<eos> These are...<eos> Inhuman asset numbers and GPS coordinates.<eos> Why do you have these?<eos> Snagged them from a group of Watchdogs on my way here.
Eat me.<eos> It's all I'm good for.<eos> Rose: Now, now, that's not true at all.<eos> Sure, all these places have been explored before, but they haven't been recorded so intimately as they have been in this journal.<eos> It makes them new and special all over again for any reader to experience.
No. I just thought we were having a nice night.<eos> Well, we're not.<eos> And why has that happened, then?<eos> Because someone needs to realise who rules the fucking roost around here!<eos> Guys, why not get your dicks out and measure them instead?
Hey, Casey?<eos> Casey?<eos> Casey, are you okay?<eos> Jesus told his apostles how to cast out unclean spirits.<eos> "Fear them not," said the man, "for there is nothing covered
Yeah, I bet you will.<eos> I don't like the way that she rubs off on you.<eos> The samples are there, ma'am.<eos> Take them or leave them.<eos> But if you leave them, we'll never know, will we?
You know, I haven't called her.<eos> Oh, don't worry about Margot. She's a big girl.<eos> - And not the type to wait by the phone.<eos> - Want some cookies?<eos> Sam stopped by with them.
Why do you want it?<eos> Tell him, Ezra.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need it to save our friends.<eos> A Sith, Darth Maul, has them.
I want to make bruschetta.<eos> Oh, can't the kids just walk?<eos> You know I like to watch two full movies before I go to work.<eos> No, Peter, they can't walk, it's three miles.<eos> Fine, I'll take them.
Check it out. You're already a meme.<eos> Aw, man, Chris, this computer is telling me that you done Swifted up.<eos> Why would she do something like this?<eos> Because this is what Taylor Swift does.<eos> She gets into relationship with guys, sabotages them, and then writes angry songs about it.
Oh, I won't.<eos> Now, if only the meal would cook itself, huh?<eos> Parents of Quahog and weekend dads playing three minutes of catch, do you know that the number of childhood vaccines has tripled in the last generation?<eos> And why is that? Because heartless corporations make billions of dollars by foisting garbage and poison upon our children.<eos> We demand that these vaccines be tested by independent researchers, not by the companies who make them.
Obergruppenführer Smith, I have an order for your arrest.<eos> Joe: No, hold on.<eos> The Obergruppenführer is here with critical intelligence that the acting chancellor needs to hear.<eos> I have my orders.<eos> And I'm countermanding them on my authority.
If you have a time-efficient alternative to store this bone flap and preserve it, then I'm all ears.<eos> Okay, Mr. Dolson, I have veal sandwich from Papa Alfredo's I've been wanting to eat all morning. So let's make this quick, shall we?<eos> I told you I don't remember.<eos> That might work with Cagney and Lacey here, but I've been around the block a few times, and I'm not buying it.<eos> Neither are the cops when I call them.
Are you gonna torment the living till they feel as bad as you do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Worth a try. I know what your parents did to you.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - Why are you protecting them?
Because I was bad.<eos> They tried to fix me, but they couldn't.<eos> You're not bad, buddy.<eos> There's no such thing. Then why did they do it?<eos> Because they were hurting, and they were in pain, and no one helped them.
Hunky Mama Cat said, 'Where's Patches?<eos> '" Daddy does voices.<eos> Daddy also gets nine hours of sleep a night.<eos> "Hunky Mama Cat does every last thing for her kittens.<eos> She feeds them, she plays with them, she licks them clean."
She even had the special golden corporate credit card.<eos> And Peter, the president of the entire corporation, e-mailed Hunky Mama Cat and offered her her old job back!<eos> It was the best moment.<eos> I mean, they want her so much that after 12 years, they're still coming after her.<eos> And every morning, there's a box of pastries, and I don't know who brings them, and I don't care!
Easy breezy.<eos> Jordan Wahlberg? !<eos> You just took two New Kids on the Block and mashed them together.<eos> Jordy is much more than a name.<eos> He's got big plans, and I put them down in this dossier.
We only need to keep our ears open.<eos> Are your ears always open for the Blessed Juana?<eos> - Always.<eos> When she was fifteen she went to see the children at the hospital and always brought tangerines with her.<eos> And she didn't care whether they ate them or not. But she wanted them to peel them and to play at squeezing the peels, and spray each other with the bright and unforgettable scent of that fruit.
He thought you would get it before going to the post office.<eos> I made $5.<eos> - I'm not haunted by O'Connor.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I built a career following orders, and I almost followed them into tragedy.
They're eager to get started.<eos> They'll have the sketches when they're ready.<eos> Are we waiting for Monsieur Trouvier's approval?<eos> No.<eos> Monsieur Trouvier will see them after they've been executed.
-Who? -He couldn't fire me.<eos> That would be too obvious.<eos> -Billy?<eos> -There were three rolls from the show in that bag, Lewis.<eos> That's why he didn't want me to develop them.
Probably hoped that it would devour what was left of me.<eos> Claude?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Those months I went away I wasn't with my aunt.<eos> I spent them in a convent.
- Lana, no, you can't just...<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I spend my life writing laws in a way nobody can figure out what they mean.<eos> I know every trick in the book. I invented some of them, but this... this is like the Picasso of legislation.
All of them.<eos> And we were next.<eos> Aah! No!<eos> Stop!<eos> Who killed them?
It's a win for Viv.<eos> And by the sound of it, she could use it.<eos> Me... I've already won.<eos> My kids will always be mine.<eos> I can't lose them to anybody.
My... my grandson Jagger needs immediate medical attention. He's right here.<eos> Clearly, he's on his deathbed.<eos> Mom, I told you, we don't need to be at the hospital.<eos> Well, the other parents agreed with me.<eos> Because you freaked them out over simple colds.
I did a lot of research.<eos> - I was in chat rooms.<eos> - In chat rooms?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Listen, there's not a single actual study that links vaccines to any of the... the dark fantasies that you people have about them.
They'd go out on adventures together.<eos> Cruises, skiing, horseback riding.<eos> That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.<eos> Oh, and did they have kids?<eos> They did, but the mommy and daddy didn't like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage
Bernadette, come on, look, you're overthinking this, okay?<eos> You're gonna be an amazing mom.<eos> Even if you don't believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.<eos> Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers.<eos> Our neighbor found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.
Impressive thinking on the fly or wrong time to do a victory lap?<eos> Okay, stop yelling at me.<eos> I got it.<eos> How are the kids?<eos> I hosed them off.
And, baby... you're a very wise man.<eos> The entire bomb squad is searching Griffith Park for more booby traps.<eos> They had to close the park.<eos> The last time that happened was 50 years ago, when the animals escaped the L.A. Zoo.<eos> Well, I hope they found them all.
Nobody knows what that is.<eos> I have a silver medal... from the Olympics.<eos> Oh, were they out of gold that day?<eos> Okay, gay athletes, stop fighting.<eos> I mean, have you seen them out there?
I want to stay here. I like my new friends.<eos> Lucy.<eos> You go.<eos> Do not threaten me, young lady.<eos> Do you want me to pike them?
My dear, dear cousin, it is a terrible sight here in Christian England to see a young woman with so little idea of where to find true comfort.<eos> Your suckle lies here, dear Rachel.<eos> Take these pamphlets to your heart.<eos> I'm sorry, Drusilla, it would be falsehood to take these.<eos> - I shall not read them.
But it's still too early to know.<eos> We've only just begun our investigation.<eos> Can you tell us if anyone survived?<eos> I'm sorry to say no, there weren't any survivors.<eos> Coroner's in the process of identifying the remains and, as soon as we can, we'll release them back to family.
Outmanned. Outgunned.<eos> I'm the only one that made it out.<eos> Your men... they last long?<eos> Wish I knew.<eos> I left them behind.
Yeah, but the impulse is still there.<eos> How do I get rid of that?<eos> Thought and action are two separate things.<eos> We can't always control our impulses.<eos> What's important is what we do with them.
There's also some gaps there, big ones... where I don't remember much of anything.<eos> Well, childhood trauma can affect the way the brain stores memories.<eos> Young victims of abuse often cope by disassociating from the event.<eos> Which means that the memories of the abuse are forgotten and often only recalled much later in life.<eos> But I don't recall them.
I'm sorry.<eos> - Do you need a doctor?<eos> - I need a break.<eos> I keep running into those faceless men.<eos> It's like they want me to lead them to my son.
That your handiwork?<eos> Guns are not my thing.<eos> Lie to us again, and I'll figure out the exact chemicals you used to dissolve that serial number off that pistol, cook up a batch and put your hand in it.<eos> Just airing out this dump.<eos> The guys who hired you to do the gun work, where do we find them?
Shots fired!<eos> Everybody down!<eos> Blocked the bullet.<eos> We have Diaz to thank for it.<eos> Guy I shot is willing to dish on his S6 buddies and the people who hired them, if prosecutors go for life over capital punishment.
Well, technically they're not required.<eos> And in many cultures, a furry panty is considered a pant.<eos> Sounds like you don't know how to put 'em on.<eos> No, I, uh... I know how to put on pants, Roberta.<eos> I mean, sure, no, I mean, I didn't used to wear them, but now you know, just...
On my command.<eos> Syndulla.<eos> At last we meet face-to-face.<eos> Step forward, alone, and turn yourself over as promised.<eos> Not until you release them.
He was also assaulted with a friend a few weeks before, after leaving Synagogue.<eos> We don't know if it's related.<eos> It could be nothing.<eos> So, when he called Haris Rexhaj on the 25th, just before he was murdered, the real Cohen had been dead for up to 10 days.<eos> So, the killer keeps the victims' phones and he uses them as bait for the next.
The DNA test results you requested?<eos> The blood on the lead pipe?<eos> You're related.<eos> Shane was not gay.<eos> You bash innocent men and you throw them to their death.
- Uh, that's Thomas Katz?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And who's this young boy here?<eos> It... it wasn't like there was a regular gang, you know?<eos> Hammers would pick up random kids, feed them fish and chips, make them feel special.
[TORI] All of our victims live in Bondi.<eos> So does Real Man.<eos> But why was he at the beach that day?<eos> Because he's thumbing his nose at us.<eos> So the killer keeps the victim's phones and he uses them as bait for the next.
I know how it worked.<eos> Who the fuck are you and what the fuck are you talking about?<eos> You stake out a beat, you and the Pointers.<eos> It's all right, mate.<eos> You bash innocent men and you throw them to their death.
-Not at all.<eos> You thought you were just coming to dinner.<eos> I did.<eos> And I was looking forward to this meal, and now I'm absolutely not.<eos> First, we're gonna take these electrode pads, and he's gonna put them on different places on your arm. Same as me, look.
Make no mistake, they are planning a war.<eos> Make it personal.<eos> That's how you get them to do what you need them to do so we'll win.<eos> Today we're gonna run you through a series of scenarios to give you a better understanding of what assessment means.<eos> Many locations will be familiar, but just because you've seen them doesn't mean you know them.
No.<eos> I did.<eos> You were drugged 77 minutes ago.<eos> That's 1 hour and 17 minutes of your life that are unaccounted for.<eos> Although, it looks pretty obvious how you spent them.
Yeah, and I keep telling you we should be.<eos> Yes, it costs money now, but we'd be saving so much money in the future.<eos> I stopped listening after you said "it costs money now."<eos> Illegal immigrants keep coming onto our shores.<eos> The federal government won't stop them, yet makes us pay billions to take care of them.
Do you know who the original illegal immigrants were?<eos> The Pilgrims.<eos> This country was founded by illegal immigrants.<eos> Like my porcelain Colonial mice figurines. I know.<eos> And I respect them.
What are you talking about?<eos> Tate's fees haven't been paid.<eos> Do you remember what it was like before we found him somewhere that got him?<eos> When it was just Mum looking after him?<eos> Hayley, they might be looking at his accounts, but that is a long way from freezing them.
It's actually The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.<eos> Loved it.<eos> But I knew the reason why we stayed in was that my father didn't want me running five houses ahead with my buddies, while I tried to acquire as many double polysaccharide nougat treats as possible.<eos> He wanted me home with him.<eos> He knew that when kids get older, you lose them, so he wanted to spend the time together.
What about the fight Ducky said he was in?<eos> Maybe he came back to finish the job.<eos> Our only witness is dead.<eos> Okay, what would I tell my students in my GPS forensics class?<eos> I would have them go back and reconstruct a timeline of Bruno's movements.
The abducted aid workers are part of an NGO operating out of Florida.<eos> They're called The International Collective of Doctors.<eos> They pride themselves on being the first to arrive wherever they're most needed.<eos> Yeah, well, they might want to rethink that.<eos> Do we have any idea who grabbed them and why?
Yeah.<eos> Let me talk you through this.<eos> What I've done, I've built a frame out of hazel, through which I have weaved English flowers and shrubs.<eos> It's basically a hedgerow.<eos> Better still, it is growing, because I've planted them so it's got compost and soil to provide the nutrients required to let my car flourish and bloom.
There's no power assistance, so it's incredibly heavy when you're parking, there's no feel when you're on the move.<eos> And then, and this is its party piece, just occasionally, it'll go violently left or right for no reason.<eos> Whoa! You see that?<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> But look at it this way, we could all probably find fault with our children, and yet... we still love them.
The GT40 may have been faster, but it was still fragile.<eos> At the 1965 race, six cars started, none finished, and the Italians humiliated Ford once again.<eos> So, untold millions of dollars had been spent since the first GT40 emerged from this building here, and yet not one car had even finished the race.<eos> So Ford now faced a difficult choice - he could throw in the towel against Ferrari, or he could fight on.<eos> What he actually did was he had some business cards printed, and he distributed them to his Le Mans team.
Eight years ago, the owner died and then there was an ugly inheritance battle between the survivors, which ultimately killed the company.<eos> It happens.<eos> Well, these were private contractors working in Iraq, making a lot of money.<eos> Just because the company they worked for went belly-up, that doesn't mean they're not still doing it.<eos> Which takes us back to the question, who were these guys working for and why did this woman kill them?
[Tom] One morning, John McAfee called me.<eos> And he said, "I need to chastise this guy. And he said, "I need to chastise this guy.<eos> To teach him a little respect." So John asked me if I could bring three guys up here. Three bad, mean‐ass looking guys.<eos> To slap him up a little and tell him, "Be careful." So I did.<eos> [Nanette] Where did you find them?
[Tom] In a place called George Street in Belize City.<eos> They were very much a part of the bad boys of George Street.<eos> They were paid 3 grand, U. S.<eos> I brought them up to Orange Walk. They knew what they needed to do.<eos> I left them here.
I was, i was, uh...<eos> People keep bringing me things, like I forgot how to cook.<eos> Mm, there's no room in here and I don't know where to put all of Frank's food.<eos> You have a lot of pickles.<eos> I hate pickles. Mm-hmm. But he loves them.

We already rejected that.<eos> And, anyway, Drew's source hasn't called him back.<eos> Uh, that's stunning.<eos> It's a "Yes."<eos> Tell the bookers I want them in my office in 10.
After what he did?<eos> I have to be practical.<eos> It is the best way.<eos> It is our way.<eos> I will send messengers to him and if he kills them, I will know where he stands.
Be safe.<eos> I will.<eos> Don't come back unless you have seen or done something extraordinary.<eos> Otherwise, you will not be in the stories and what will I be able to tell our children about their famous father, Bjorn Ironside?<eos> Tell them that... I love them.
I think I have a solution to our problem.<eos> We can lift the ban on imported cheese.<eos> There's a ban on imported cheese?<eos> Not all of them.<eos> But raw milk cheeses have relatively harmless levels of bacteria, and the FDA banned them pending further study.
I gave them hope and I don't think there is any.<eos> Well, you really know that, though?<eos> I didn't give them an honest assessment, though.<eos> I let my feelings get in the way because I so much want Hayley to pull through.<eos> I didn't act professionally. I didn't prepare them for...
So, you're telling me the hostages, this attack, the bio weapons, the First Lady is all for computer drives?<eos> Those drives contain decades worth of intelligence gathered through surveillance systems the leaders were here to dismantle.<eos> Classified intercepts, clandestine operations, millions of e-mails, text messages.<eos> You want to get to them before the terrorists do.<eos> The terrorists already have them.
I think he's just a weed guy.<eos> Oh, he thinks he's just a weed guy.<eos> Oh, no, man.<eos> I haven't sold E since college, but, uh, I sell mushrooms. They're fun.<eos> I'm doing them tomorrow for my birthday actually.
After everything you did to me and my friends?<eos> Well, if that's what you assumed, why even bother saving me, then?<eos> Because that's what heroes do, Zelena.<eos> They save people.<eos> Even the people who have hurt them in... unimaginable ways.
That's the fourth time they've cycled out hostages.<eos> And this group includes one of your friends.<eos> She's not my friend.<eos> These two terrorists who just returned have Swahili accents that are different than the last two who were here.<eos> I think they're cycling terrorists out and bringing them back in dressed like us.
Most of the time, he-he pretty much didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> But... if he was watching football, he let me sit and watch the game with him.<eos> As long as I'd sit on the floor and I didn't talk too much.<eos> I always imagined that when I had kids that I'd watch the games with them, too.<eos> Except i-I'd let them talk... As loud as they wanted.
Yeah, we found a matching boot print in your wife's blood.<eos> Puts you at the scene of the murder.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> I'd already given those boots away by then.<eos> Do you remember who you gave them to?
I mean, we're all that's left.<eos> Whether it was by, you know, chance or fate, there's something that brought us all together.<eos> We can't just go off into the night.<eos> Oh, don't make one of your dumb-ass speeches, Tandy.<eos> Oh, hell, I have heard them so many times, I know them by heart.
Not withstanding our respective vomit, Mr. Palmer, we continue to do our jobs.<eos> That's all anyone can ask of us.<eos> Well, thank you, Doctor.<eos> With that in mind, I'm going to go take the victim's personal effects up to Abby.<eos> Yes, I'd take them up myself, but she still thinks I'm sick, despite the fact that I have kept dry toast down for 24 hours.
This was the boys last night.<eos> Security camera across from the cornfield picked it up.<eos> If they were moving in that direction, it probably means they were tracking the Henson twins' disappearance.<eos> It's kind of a local legend.<eos> Anyone else see them?
It does this.<eos> When you rode by us earlier, we thought maybe you wanted to help.<eos> Let me ask you this... what way did Allie and Johnny go that night?<eos> They cut through the corn and past the Ridley farm.<eos> But I found them that night and Elliott's pond. And I told Coop that back then.
Church is one thing, but, like, the black church...<eos> Being attached to, like, a pastor, and then<eos> I'm gay...<eos> What would happen if we took the blur away from your face, and you were on the show?<eos> It would directly affect my parents and their ministry... and the people that follow them.
Ed, when I met Samanthia, math was her least favorite subject.<eos> Now she's doing fractions and loving it.<eos> And yeah, she's didn't win a demathlon medal and I know that stung, but it made her want to get better.<eos> And isn't that what school is for?<eos> Look, I think challenging your children prepares them for the real world.
What am I doing wrong?<eos> That sounds like a morning question.<eos> No, seriously. Why do all the kids want to go with you?<eos> Frankie, it doesn't matter.<eos> Here's the thing. I wouldn't take them anyway.
Why did you wait so long to tell us about you and Grandma?<eos> We were afraid your father couldn't handle it.<eos> But he surprised me.<eos> He put big-boy pants on.<eos> Maybe for a minute, but then he went to his room and wet them.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Wow, it's so calm this morning.<eos> - Did you already make lunches?<eos> - Nope. I signed them up for hot lunch.
- Ooh. They say it's bigger than the blizzard of '75.<eos> Ha! Take that, '75.<eos> No, the airports are closed.<eos> How are we gonna get to my parents'?<eos> I mean, I have a suitcase full of matching sweaters and I need some old people to wear them.
Mr. President, I came out of retirement to serve again because my country needed me.<eos> I just helped your nominee, Peter MacLeish, through a speedy Senate confirmation, and this is my reward?<eos> To be libeled by one of your staffers?<eos> Senator, we were all thrown by these leaked documents.<eos> I just think we should be going after the people that leaked them, not the people that wrote them.
They were the first to not bear children.<eos> And they taught us... that the true path to building a superior society... is merit.<eos> And the only way to evaluate true merit... is through the Process.<eos> Because you will know for certain that you've earned these privileges.<eos> You fought for them and deserve them.
I grew up on a farm where I cut down many trees.<eos> I've seen photos.<eos> It was a dairy farm. Not a lot of trees.<eos> Yes.<eos> Because I cut them all down.
Okay, remember, but we're gonna call on these guys' signal.<eos> So, once they hear it, they're gonna know the cops are coming. They're gonna rush the house.<eos> So, we'll have to hold them off until help gets here.<eos> Based on the distance to the sheriff department substation, I estimate 15 minutes before we get help.<eos> How do we hold them off for 15 minutes when all we have is decorations, food and gifts?
City released it six months ago.<eos> When Fillibert got the permit.<eos> City approved Fillibert because of the vets, but he wasn't the only one with eyes on the land.<eos> Developers been wanting to rezone it for commercial use for years.<eos> Vets beat them to the punch, kept it residential.
Where are the LeGrands?<eos> There was a trio of post-Impressionist artwork here.<eos> The paintings, where have they gone?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> They pulled them down to pull some cable.
They're three screen names owned by one man.<eos> Why don't you just tell me what's going on here.<eos> There was a great deal of chatter on the Dark Web about the heist yesterday.<eos> Most notably these three posts.<eos> I compared them to internal stock exchange employee e-mails.
I don't suppose you know where she is?<eos> She's with her friend, Amy.<eos> They're in Lymebridge.<eos> She's somewhere in those woods.<eos> You find her or I'll cut off your genitals and feed them to the badgers.
Do you want some of my nonna's spicy chicken?<eos> No, I don't want any of your nonna's spicy chicken!<eos> What is up with you?<eos> Why did you leave me all those messages?<eos> If you'd listened to even one of them, you'd know.
The Legions of Hell will pour into this world.<eos> Are they really going to pour out of her twot, like on the poster? No.<eos> That was a screw-up by the designer.<eos> Anyway, so tens of thousands of people will become possessed.<eos> They'll turn on their loved ones and slaughter them.
You see up there?<eos> That's where you're going to open the gates of hell.<eos> And that's when the fun really starts.<eos> By fun, I mean apocalyptic slaughter.<eos> You think I'm going to fire up and open them for you?
I like that about us.<eos> Me too.<eos> Let's get this shit storm started.<eos> Since the dawn of time, demons have walked among us.<eos> Most of you can't see them.
When we make a choice, as a company, what matter is what does the most good for the most people.<eos> Your, your suit, claims that you patented all the elements contained in Ms. Ketchum's product.<eos> Is-is that right?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> You had all the pieces, but you haven't put them together this way yet?
Well, good.<eos> Then find him.<eos> Uh-huh. Agent Gibbs.<eos> We have phones, you know.<eos> Well, none of your people seem to hear them ring.
- You haven't been sworn in. Details.<eos> Wallace didn't leak the grand jury minutes.<eos> Then how did you learn the identity of the key witness?<eos> From the grand jury minutes.<eos> Wallace didn't give them to me.
He looks familiar, but...<eos> - Give me a sec. Let me grab my glasses.<eos> - Okay.<eos> These chimes, how long have you had them?<eos> I got them in Cabo about 20 years ago.
Just get your shit.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Yeah, my roommates are gone. They're not home.<eos> It's like I never see them.
Jeff, I'm so sorry to hear that.<eos> Well, I'm around if you need anything.<eos> What I need's a drink. You in?<eos> Russian Immigration detained the Iranian physicists before they could leave Russia.<eos> They've got them in holding at their building in Khotkovo.
I thought we could talk more freely this way.<eos> Very well, I'll start.<eos> You postponed the vote in the Security Council.<eos> Perhaps you didn't have the other members' support and are angling for a way out.<eos> I have the votes, I'll use them if I have to.
Kids make mistakes.<eos> It's what they do.<eos> Sometimes, that's all they do.<eos> But our jobs remain the same.<eos> They fall down, we help them up.
Hey, it's Nick from The Great Gatsby.<eos> I just checked in, and somebody left their teeth here.<eos> I-I don't know, it's just a set of teeth.<eos> I-I guess men's?<eos> No, I'm not putting them anywhere. You come and get them.
So, have you found more subversives?<eos> Actually, sir, we've... (CLEARS THROAT) Lost some.<eos> Two workers went missing after your speech.<eos> We found their uniforms.<eos> I am confident we will locate them once we issue an alert.
The catfish has been exclusive to New Jersey.<eos> I was keeping tabs on the case from afar.<eos> All five videos got shot in my jurisdiction.<eos> I have questioned each of the pervs that have lived to tell the tale and none of them ever said anything about a gun.<eos> The guy that lured them used his size against them.

Tried that the last time someone accused me of something I didn't do.<eos> Won't make that mistake again.<eos> We were able to access your TrueRomantix account.<eos> We read the messages that you sent to a 14-year-old girl named Ella May.<eos> That's great. I read them, too.

I gotta pick up a pair of ruby earrings I pawned before I went into hiding.<eos> Neustadter's like six hours away.<eos> I'm not so sure we can get there and back in time.<eos> Jake, there's no wedding without the earrings.<eos> My grandmother wore them on her wedding day, and said they blessed her union.
- What if there was something in the universe that could prove to you that you should still get married?<eos> What would that be? Finding his grandma's earrings.<eos> Or we could cut Rosa's ears off, and then it's like the earrings don't even make sense.<eos> Thank you! Someone's trying to help.<eos> Okay, so the earrings. Maybe somebody bought them before the place burned down, right?
- You and me both, sister.<eos> Rosa got drunk, and then every time I sent someone in to help her, she got them drunk too!<eos> It's like she was trying to tank this thing.<eos> Yeah, well, Pimento called off the wedding three times because of the universe.<eos> If I didn't know them any better, I'd think they don't even wanna get married.
I just feel like we were rushing things.<eos> We love each other, but we haven't even really spent that much time together.<eos> We've never even been on a real date, so we're gonna start there.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Thank you for the presents. We're keeping them.
Hey.<eos> So Chief Simonds is being, shall we say, uncooperative?<eos> He's stonewalling us on the fire files.<eos> Man really holds a grudge.<eos> - Shall I, get them a different way?
The heaviest bird of all.<eos> This time there's more than enough transport to go around.<eos> Soon, almost every ostrich has its own passenger.<eos> But free riders are only tolerated for so long.<eos> What the bee-eaters really need is a creature so big it won't even notice them.
Now, that grass is not only withered and frozen, it's about to be buried.<eos> Sixty million tons of snow now blanket this herd's territory.<eos> Pushing through deep snow is exhausting work, and the bison are now slowly starving.<eos> Just keeping warm saps huge amounts of energy.<eos> Their thick coats can insulate them down to minus 20 Fahrenheit.
As the calves appear, so too do the leaves of the newly sprouting grass.<eos> And the calves must strengthen quickly.<eos> Within days they will have to keep up with their parents on a never-ending march.<eos> At one day old, they're already faster than an Olympic sprinter.<eos> They're testing the legs that will carry them thousands of miles, better to learn their limitations now.
- Do you get it?<eos> - I get it.<eos> Aren't those the copper pipes for our bathroom?<eos> These are extra.<eos> I'm gonna use them on another job.
Aren't those the copper pipes for our bathroom?<eos> These are extra.<eos> I'm gonna use them on another job.<eos> Oh, at another job.<eos> Oh, it... and he left with them.
I've got it now.<eos> I will tell my family I was on a mission, and everyone at the church, that I was at conversion camp again.<eos> Okay.<eos> And you can go.<eos> I'll tell my friends that I'm going to a new boutique firm and we're very competitive, so as long as I can assure them that it's a step down, they won't care.
- Uh, yeah!<eos> That's what you get for trying to manipulate your parents!<eos> - So these terrified kids are actors?<eos> - Uh, well, no.<eos> But one bad experience isn't gonna ruin them for the rest of their lives.
Listen, if we move the fifteenth north, to Dacia. We take the twelfth...<eos> After inadvertently starting a war for the throne,<eos> Faustina knows she must return to her husband... and try to maintain her place as Empress.<eos> Faustina, unfortunately, overplayed her hand.<eos> The great women in Roman society always supported their men, elevated their men, pushed the men that they represented into greater positions of power, greater positions of competition, and helped to drive them forward.
It was posted in the forum.<eos> This was my gift.<eos> My name is nowhere on here.<eos> They offer their assistance, and then they do this?<eos> Now my soldiers think their Emperor places no value on their service. That only the Senate honors them.
Only contempt for everything the Rome you and I know stands for.<eos> To name a freedman to rule over the Senate!<eos> As resentment against her brother grows in the Senate, Lucilla sees an opportunity to further her plan.<eos> But she's not the only one in the palace with an agenda.<eos> Slaves were instruments. They were extensions of whoever owned them.
- Hi!<eos> - Hello.<eos> Do you love our sweaters?<eos> I thought they would be perfect for the Snow Ball dance.<eos> I got them at the store where you buy things that go with the other things.
It's morning.<eos> You fell, you fell asleep. Yeah.<eos> I just...<eos> I know that Benson Durant did not maintain his security cameras outside his meat shop.<eos> They were all down. But I noticed there were shops on either side that had working cameras, so I called them and asked them to send me footage.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Did I hear that you said that you made cookies? Yeah.<eos> You didn't make cookies, you bought them at the store.
Let's track her down.<eos> So far, no luck finding payments from Earl to Harold Redding.<eos> But we are getting Harold's old financial records from archives.<eos> We got lucky.<eos> Bank never got around to destroying them.
So you weren't marrying him for the money, then? So you weren't marrying him for the money, then? Would you blame me if I was?<eos> Would you blame me if I was? What about your first husband?<eos> What about your first husband? You've got it worked out.<eos> You've got it worked out. Lines up her men like toy soldiers,<eos> You've got it worked out. Lines up her men like toy soldiers, picks them off one by one. picks them off one by one.
You snap back like you always do.<eos> He snaps at you. You snap back like you always do.<eos> And it escalates like it always does. like it always does.<eos> Men always disappoint, don't they?<eos> And that's why you have to punish them. And that's why you have to punish them.
I told them what they can do with that wire.<eos> It's just like you said.<eos> SBK was my family, they brought me in, got me stuff I couldn't get on my own.<eos> Pretty soon after that, I was doing that for other guys.<eos> I brought them in, taught them what they needed to know.
Am I sending it too early?<eos> I hate to be on the top of the pile.<eos> You always throw out the first pancake.<eos> I'm not sure it works that way.<eos> Yeah, when your mom makes pancakes, we sometimes throw out all of them.
- Yes?<eos> The mermaid... slurped the fish up.<eos> Gee. There's no way.<eos> The Mermaid Princess is friends with the fish.<eos> She never eats them.
[Mary] They had been missionaries in the Philippines for 16 years.<eos> Martin flew a plane.<eos> He would deliver food and goods that the missionaries there needed, and Gracia worked the radio.<eos> They had a really nice, peaceful life there.<eos> I started searching for anything about this group of people who had taken them, what they had done with people before...
NEEZA: Bring it here, precious.<eos> In such matters one can never be too careful.<eos> Listen.<eos> The very air hums with evil spirits that would beggar me if they could.<eos> This keeps them at bay.
But he's not relying on the power of prayer.<eos> Instead, he's got a master plan.<eos> It involves his ravishing young wife and her regular conjugal visit.<eos> But Ronaldo isn't interested in getting his wife's clothes off, because he wants to get it on.<eos> No, he's getting his wife's clothes off... because he wants to get them on.
The pirates were operating almost in a perfect negotiating environment.<eos> They were never going to be bothered by law enforcement<eos> There was no real prospects of a military intervention.<eos> No one was knocking at their doors at five o'clock in the morning.<eos> No one was really looking for them.
I refuse to live like an animal.<eos> I refuse to live broken.<eos> I refuse to live under occupation.<eos> This feeling will never change until we restore all our lands... and live in peace like the rest of the world.<eos> [speaking Hebrew] As the soldiers arrived on Friday morning, I saw them scrambling to be first to get their vests and weapons so as not to miss this fight to protect their home.
And by the 20th of May, Pierre's father passes away.<eos> On Monday, the passports arrive in Taiz, and the visas have been granted.<eos> We will go collect them the afternoon.<eos> Our children, Peter and Lisa, they were gonna watch TV.<eos> There was no problem leaving them.
[man speaking Arabic] Do you have the hostages?<eos> [Yolande] The voice that's coming across that radio... [man speaks Arabic] Have they been delivered to you?<eos> just rips through us.<eos> Taiz is dangerous now.<eos> It's crawling with police looking for them.
So then he sticks it in the little hole of the handcuff, and he springs it open. And we think, "Oh, it's Hollywood.<eos> It's so fake."<eos> But that image stayed in my brain.<eos> [woman] Christian Peacemaker Teams remain very disturbed by the abduction of our teammates.<eos> We pray that those who hold them will host them with the grace that so many of us in CPT have received as guests in Iraq.
But, rest assured, the finger on the trigger will not be mine.<eos> As you know, over 20 years, your Uncle Sergei amassed a portfolio of business and property interests throughout East Berlin.<eos> I've come equipped with a... a map of the city, if I may?<eos> Berlin is presently divided into four major territories.<eos> I call them "kingdoms." Nice dynastic ring to it, no?
Just how these animals make these places their own are amongst the most incredible stories in the natural world.<eos> I hope you've snuggled up nice and warm, because it's time to meet the amazing animals that spend their life in the snow.<eos> Each year, up to one third of our planet is transformed by snow into a sparkling world of wonder and white.<eos> The animals who live here must adapt to this dazzling change.<eos> How they rise to the challenge of living in the snow is what sets each of them apart.
Hopefully, Mum has a plan to keep them warm and safe.<eos> Overnight, temperatures drop to minus 12 degrees.<eos> Dawn.<eos> The storm has passed. But, what about the cubs?<eos> Their mother led them to a sheltered spot and kept them warm through the chill of the night with her own body heat.
I mean, the music we're making...<eos> It's my new life.<eos> I'm not going back.<eos> Your parents cool with that?<eos> How come you never mention them?
Yes, sir. That's what the head said, too.<eos> Charles ardai.<eos> Headmaster.<eos> Quite a problem these cell phones have caused now, isn't it?<eos> The devil's intercom is what I used to call them. Nice.
The fuel for my magic is life.<eos> We only have enough prisoners to send through our strongest warriors.<eos> But that will be enough.<eos> The enemy is weak.<eos> When we arrive, we will take them as fuel!
- Fight your own wars!<eos> - Your Majesty.<eos> Commander.<eos> The orcs are building a portal, through which they plan to bring an army.<eos> If we do not stop them now, we may never get another opportunity.
For many moons, he was thought to be an evil spirit.<eos> A ghost in the trees.<eos> They speak of his power over the animals of the jungle.<eos> Because his spirit came from them.<eos> He understood them and learned to conquer them.
The forts are done, but the army has not come.<eos> Where are they?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They were supposed to be here months ago.<eos> But they said the King is yet to pay for them.

In the war,<eos> Hitler left hidden revenge squads all the way back to the Rhine.<eos> I saw what those German soldiers were capable of.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> He fed them... special drugs... to make them addicted to the blood of children.
A beautiful soul.<eos> So many memories.<eos> Wouldn't even know where to begin.<eos> But I do know this.<eos> I would trade every one of them for one more minute with our daughter.
And 2 1/2 months later, the baby was born. A little girl, Amanda.<eos> But one day you decided to give her up for adoption.<eos> It's breaking your heart, tearing your guts out and that's why you pretend to be so foul-mouthed and cool.<eos> Exactly twice a year on each of your parents' birthdays, Doreen and Frank,<eos> On their birthdays, 11/16 and 10/23, you call them in Cincinnati and tell them you love them, they reply "We love you too, honey bunny."
We can be seeing the enemy even when the enemy is hiding.<eos> Come.<eos> There you go.<eos> See our guys.<eos> Look, we are taking them.
There's patterns in everything and everyone.<eos> What's mine?<eos> You want to be famous.<eos> Your parents, teachers, all told you one thing, one way to be, and<eos> - you ignored them.
He was neither tall nor handsome, charismatic or amusing.<eos> In fact, he appeared to be exceedingly dull.<eos> Because of this boy's apparent shortcomings he was bullied mercilessly and relentlessly by the other children.<eos> Year merged with miserable year as life continued to be a living hell.<eos> But what the other boys didn't understand about their victim was that he didn't see them as enemies.

Nina Reiser was president of her school's Parent-Teacher Association.<eos> She chaperoned field trips.<eos> She did the class laundry.<eos> Nina's children were her entire world.<eos> She would have never, ever left them willingly.

I had the most publicized trial in years.<eos> Would you be interested in following the story of a murderer who took a plea bargain?<eos> But I thought you said you did it for your children.<eos> I did. Everything I've ever done was for them.<eos> But you insured that you would never see them again.
It happened a million years ago.<eos> Parents.<eos> - Did he just say "Parents"?<eos> - It's the brains.<eos> If he doesn't eat them, he gets smarter.
Your rolling ass cheeks tell me what it must be.<eos> By the way I need my ball sack emptied before lunch.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> What is that?<eos> Tribe leaders in Africa chew them for unbelievable strength.
I've learned from your strong personality.<eos> You are the ultimate leader.<eos> You are my role model.<eos> And now the prisoners are like obedient slaves begging for mercy.<eos> I got them down on their knees.
- What do you got?<eos> - What if we work backwards?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> From what? - From the directories.<eos> We've been using them to confirm bad priests.
- We're not torching shit.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Here is what we're gonna do.<eos> We take out the teeth.<eos> We saw them into manageable pieces, melt them down in acid.
It is impressive.<eos> But you have made a mess of the nerves.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> The oculomotor nerves.<eos> You haven't connected them properly.
That's the man.<eos> - That's the man I'm after.<eos> - Thank you for asking. You're welcome.<eos> Now, I shall bring you your assignments piecemeal.<eos> You will complete them in a timely fashion, whereon I shall apply them to a larger... whole of my own device. Questions?
So, how far did you say that watering hole was?<eos> - I got a job for you.<eos> - I'm not really good at jobs.<eos> I need you to keep on the dodge and sidle up the loblolly, past them hornheads just hooting and a hollering, and score off them rustlers.<eos> We'll cut dirt and get the bulge on them.
Now, assuming they're alive, we got 33 men down there.<eos> They are running out of food and water. But there is adequate air.<eos> We know that they can survive for a period of time if they are relatively healthy, but we don't know that.<eos> Some of them could be injured. Some of them are in the early or later stages of silicosis. Miner's lung disease.<eos> What I do know, is that if we don't get them up fast, we're going to be bringing up 33 corpses.

Miner's lung disease.<eos> What I do know, is that if we don't get them up fast, we're going to be bringing up 33 corpses.<eos> Here's what we know.<eos> The men were working in the lower half of the mine when it collapsed.<eos> That puts them here, at the refuge.
We found them.<eos> Now we got to get them out.<eos> Nobody has ever done anything like this before.<eos> God bless our miners!<eos> God bless them!
Or you'll hit your point.<eos> What point?<eos> The point where you break.<eos> Where fear becomes master, and you're its slave.<eos> A man who pushes his boundaries ultimately finds them.
You need special tools.<eos> Is this for real?<eos> There are a hundred engineers walking around here.<eos> None of them have the tools? In fairness, not many of them were issued the tools.<eos> What about you? I left them at the office.
Whoever said the customer is always right was, I promise you, a customer.<eos> - It had skinheads in it.<eos> - She was liberating them. Liberating the skinheads.<eos> The ad didn't have anything to do with fucking skinheads.<eos> We used them as fucking extras.
- Yeah.<eos> I hate when you talk to the sleepers.<eos> I find it creepy.<eos> They're just people.<eos> Yeah, you standing over them, staring at them.
You live in McFarland, right?<eos> You ever taken a look out there?<eos> This is one of the poorest towns in America.<eos> These kids are invisible, they are expendable.<eos> They come from the fields, and they go back to the fields unless the prisons get them first.
Your parents didn't tell you?<eos> It was their idea, but I was honored to be a part of it.<eos> You might not believe it, but I studied... at my university... I studied in the Experimental Theater Wing, so...<eos> Um, your parents are two of the most important avant-garde artists of our time.<eos> Of course I helped them.
Think they're really dead?<eos> - Well, I think it's very, very... - No.<eos> No, no, I don't.<eos> - ...possible.<eos> - I think you're helping them.
I was miserable.<eos> I thought this is the end of our life.<eos> - As artists.<eos> - Obviously, as artists, because, and I've heard this over again, children kill art, they just do.<eos> You have them, and the passion you had for creative expression becomes secondary.
I just wanna touch it.<eos> Easy with those light cannons, gentlemen.<eos> We don't have any backups.<eos> These ray guns gonna work, Van Patten?<eos> We had no way to field-test them, sir. But our computer models show a great likelihood of effectiveness.
They will be armed.<eos> They will know the terrain, and you will not.<eos> You must be smarter than them, and faster.<eos> And when the moment comes, you must not hesitate.<eos> I want you to look them in the eyes, Veronica.
What have they built...?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> At least there were independent thinkers.<eos> Otherwise, we'd have buildings and hotels like that everywhere on the coast.<eos> You knew them?
So?<eos> So what?<eos> So, the boars?<eos> 220.<eos> It'll grill them like a barbecue.
Yo, Mike, you knocked him the fuck out.<eos> - Hey, what'd I tell you about talking like that?<eos> - My bust.<eos> - See how I kept my elbows tight?<eos> - I saw them.
- Yeah.<eos> - When I was younger... somebody made me the same proposal.<eos> I made so much money bringing cocaine into the city... I had to rent a storage unit to store all the cash.<eos> The problem was, everybody got hooked on the shit.<eos> I watched my friends rot away in front of me until I couldn't recognize them anymore.
I'm not too big on the books.<eos> You could just pick up one and start.<eos> Yeah, I will, I will.<eos> I want to start with the best book ever.<eos> Since you have read them all, which is the best one?
You find yourself drawn to the crest, staring down the precipice, like hundreds of people before you.<eos> And there's nothing you can do as you KW"? -<eos> Nothing, except think of the impact.<eos> Turn off your flashlights as much as you can.<eos> Light attracts them.
♪ With me<eos> ♪ With me<eos> - How are the breasts?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Sorry, I just haven't seen them in a while.
You're my expert witness.<eos> Even the time you punched out the police officer and then threw up in a bin?<eos> Well... edit the student years.<eos> OK.<eos> Never stop telling them I loved them.
OK, up you go. Up.<eos> Up.<eos> OK.<eos> Take the shoe.<eos> Don't worry about the boots, we'll put them on in the taxi. - Good.
Losh, man, she's fair the expert getting, the daughter.<eos> The kitchen's more her style than the college, eh?<eos> Education... most of it's a coarse thing.<eos> Learning!<eos> Just teaches your children a lot of damned nonsense that puts them above themselves and they'd give you their lip soon as look at you.
Given under my hand etc, etc."<eos> So, think it well over, Miss Guthrie.<eos> Not a word for Will or his two motherless boys?<eos> Oh, for shame, Tam.<eos> How can they be motherless now that I've got them?
You're in fine tune this morning.<eos> Aye, Uncle.<eos> I am that.<eos> How did the horses fare in the storm?<eos> I took them into the barn.
Well, I—<eos> Oloukine gifted me with those earrings, they had a lot of value.<eos> Give her back!<eos> I can't.<eos> I— Lost them gambling.
The only thing that makes sense is a break-in.<eos> You came home, you found everyone dead, you panicked.<eos> You thought someone was trying to frame you.<eos> So you dumped the bodies and you went on the run.<eos> But somebody else killed them.
No, I don't think you're being ridiculous.<eos> Under the circumstances, yeah, you are being a little ridiculous.<eos> Oh, tidings of comfort and joy<eos> We clearly have a major difference of opinion and I can understand why you are wrong.<eos> If you treat them like they're not resilient, they're going to be not resilient.
You have his smile.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> You know, I think that your hands were the first thing I loved about you.<eos> I'm gonna miss them.<eos> I think, at first, I held on so tight to the kids, because of all that we went through and how much I loved them.
He loved his best friend, Patrick.<eos> He loved blowing bubbles and jellyfishing.<eos> He loved making Krabby Patties for the folks of Bikini Bottom just as much as they loved eating them.<eos> Why, you may ask, do they love this greasy little sandwich so much?<eos> Why did they eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, despite their doctor's warnings?
Everyone would be so happy.<eos> All the 3 little piggies had to do was just steal one little crown. That the beautiful wolf had wanted ever since she was a penniless little street cub. Unloved and abandoned.<eos> But that crown would mean she was a princess. And everybody loves the princess.<eos> So, the wolf sent the piggies to get that crown. But the little piggies weren't up to the challenge. They failed their mission.<eos> So the wolf huffed and puffed and she blew them off the face of the earth.
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?<eos> I mean how long have they known about it?<eos> A hundred years, probably.<eos> I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.<eos> And we still don't have them now.
He came along at just the right time for us.<eos> I invite you now Nancy, to declare before God and his church ... your consent to become George's wife.<eos> I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health. I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.<eos> The rings.<eos> Lord, bless these rings, grant that those who wear them may always be faithful to each other.
- Where in London?<eos> - I'll tell you when you land, not before.<eos> I'm not interested in playing games, Brandt.<eos> And I'm not interested in seeing my friends get killed either.<eos> So if I'm going to betray them, we're going do this on my terms and my terms only.
No, no, you wear it.<eos> You wear it because your soul is going to need some religious saving after everything that you...<eos> That you've done!<eos> I needed to buy some time to find the murderers without the cops breathing down my neck.<eos> I've found them, and I intend to kill them right after I leave here.
Then let's show them what we've accomplished.<eos> Send out the twins.<eos> It's too soon.<eos> It's what they signed up for.<eos> My men can hold them.
Diondra Wertzner.<eos> I'm a bad mother.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're superwoman as far as I'm concerned.<eos> You keep the farm going, you raise four kids, get them to school every day and you don't drink a gallon of bourbon to do it.
Goddamn it!<eos> How do you know my wife?<eos> Harge, please.<eos> I work at Frankenberg's, sir, the department store.<eos> I ordered a gift from her desk. I forget my gloves, she returned them, and I thanked her.
And if I'm not mistaken, he wrote his own will before he died.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Leaving everything he owned, or at least what was left of it, to you and your sister, his only living heirs.<eos> It was one of the last things he did before he died, a few days later.<eos> Yes, but won't they argue that Adele did leave them to the gallery?
What was the question again?<eos> What?<eos> Did any of you really do it?<eos> Well, then whose eyes are in that jar?<eos> Well, Babyface found some rocks, and, uh, painted them.
Blast!<eos> They got the horses!<eos> Save your bullets.<eos> They're beyond.<eos> I don't understand how they got them all.
I wasn't able to.<eos> I went with Nadine.<eos> It was run by these two European men.<eos> They were brothers.<eos> Possibly identical twins but one was a foot taller than the other, that might disqualify them.
You look good.<eos> Strong.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Papa wanted you to have his knives.<eos> Would you like me to send them?
Transylvania.<eos> That's cool.<eos> I have a cousin from Pennsylvania. Oh.<eos> These little guys are so sweet.<eos> Dennis would love them.
- Hey, guys.<eos> Yeah, you're gonna dig it here.<eos> Don't even worry.<eos> People are totally cool with our lifestyle choice.<eos> I mean, the kids get picked on a little, but it toughens them up.
Then we're moving.<eos> Please, Mavey.<eos> Don't leave.<eos> Maybe you've let humans into your hotel, Dad.<eos> But I don't think you've let them into your heart.
All I've got is that job.<eos> The bastards are trying to take it away from me.<eos> You want them to like you'?<eos> Like me'?<eos> I want to fuckin' kill them.
And they were accidents.<eos> And that's when I Went to my mum, and that's when I found out the truth.<eos> You know, she...<eos> These men, they answered her ads in the paper.<eos> Then she shagged them, then killed them, and fucking chopped them up, and I'm the spawn of a monster.
And with nothing to hold us in America...<eos> I see.<eos> Your novel.<eos> I read the new chapters.<eos> I'll have them delivered in the morning.
I'm going to get those papers back.<eos> I'm going to finish this.<eos> You burnt them.<eos> Lucille.<eos> You burnt them.
They chased us.<eos> - They were gonna get the both of us.<eos> - Help me!<eos> I did what I had to do.<eos> We need to get the seeds before they find them.
As for the complex emotions and the capacity for empathy, we all saw the distressing images of Ted agonizing over his fallen friend<eos> John Bennet.<eos> In those images, Ted exhibits all of the remaining qualities of personhood.<eos> It's right there for anyone to see.<eos> And I believe that a just court must by definition grant basic human rights to all those who deserve them.
What did you guys do?<eos> What did you guys do?<eos> What is this?<eos> It is an experiment to combine chemicals and... and mushrooms.<eos> When they took them, they... they went crazy.
Come here.<eos> Almost as the nice as 45s... and these very special knives you walked in here with.<eos> You like riddles?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> I hate them actually.
I'll do anything, anything you want.<eos> Oh, I know you will.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They have no interest in me.<eos> I sent them on their way.
- You must.<eos> You invite him to dinner every night.<eos> - Anna.<eos> - That looks great.<eos> - So here's to me. I discover talented writers, develop them for years, and then you steal them away from me.
- Hey, Queenie!<eos> - Ugh! Don't you 'ugh' me.<eos> So who's bringing the pastries for tomorrow?<eos> I am.<eos> Well, yes, though you brought them last time.
It's kind of the truth.<eos> My mom stays home.<eos> My dad's a crook.<eos> I have three older brothers.<eos> They're crooks too. They hate it when I call them that.
Mike, do you really think it was such a good idea?<eos> Sheriff Goodwin was great, honey.<eos> He laid it all out.<eos> I don't even think it's true, and I don't know why you do.<eos> There are signs, and if you don't want to see them, that's fine, but I do.
Look, why don't you let me buy you some dinner?<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm starving.<eos> Come on.<eos> My folks are liberals.<eos> Or maybe I just outwitted them.
But I knew everything would be all right in the end.<eos> Magnificent.<eos> Do you think the codes are really there?<eos> They most certainly are, darling.<eos> And I gave them to the authorities.
You have two enemies.<eos> One saw you for the first time today.<eos> The other... has followed you for years.<eos> Who are they?<eos> I'll kill them no matter what!
Fuck yeah!<eos> Ha ha!<eos> Fuck yeah, Akan's boys are here.<eos> I'm gonna hold them off, yeah?<eos> I'm gonna hold them off, yeah?
I'm sure they got suspicious because they've been seeing you all over the place!<eos> You're gonna get yourself killed.<eos> Nothing kills me.<eos> I'm immune to 1 79 different types of poison.<eos> I know, because I ingested them all at once... when I was deep undercover... in an underground, poison-ingesting crime ring.
Hang tight.<eos> Hello, bound lady.<eos> Not now, Aldo.<eos> I think Mr. Fine has underestimated you.<eos> You found your targets, you tracked them down, you fought very hard.
And so I stayed away as long as I could, because I didn't want to do any more damage.<eos> The only reason I'm here is to ask that you consider helping me, helping your daughter, and then we'll be gone.<eos> The boys are still in the car.<eos> Han.<eos> Am I taking them or not?
But they marched us for four days to the battle at Pea Ridge.<eos> No food.<eos> You get a little bit of water, but there's no food.<eos> And our general, Earl Van Dorn... gives a big, passioned speech about how... how a viper has a split tongue, and we are the split tongue of the snake.<eos> There will be a left flank, there will be a right flank, and then we will surround the blue bellies with our tongue, and we will gut them.
He wants to bag himself a bird, and he does.<eos> It's big, it's beautiful, colors like a rainbow.<eos> That bird goes down over the horizon. Them dogs take off.<eos> Thing is, they don't come back.<eos> So we go charging after 'em, and we find them, and they're tearing that bird to pieces.
Didn't feel right... but it was an order.<eos> He told me to do it, and so I shot them dogs in the head right then and there.<eos> I think about them dogs a lot.<eos> Was it their nature to kill?<eos> I was training them to go against it.
It's not presentable like that. or is it?<eos> Why not?<eos> We're not a museum.<eos> Hey, they know we just moved in.<eos> Tell them we're inviting them over for a picnic with moving boxes romance.
That's what I'd like to know, too.<eos> I went up to our neighbours.<eos> They didn't even open the door.<eos> Maybe they weren't at home. - They were.<eos> I could hear them inside.
In the School?<eos> - You know of the School?<eos> - Oh yes.<eos> I know of many such places, they're all fronts.<eos> They use them to extort and blackmail people.
Admittedly we find them of use.<eos> But we are more occasional custodians, than proprietors.<eos> Custodians?<eos> Yeah!<eos> These places have their uses, so we - use them, just like we used you.
What kind of impact is that having on our soil, with residuals that are left at the microbacterial level?<eos> What kind of impact is that having on the people in our communities?<eos> Where is the cost on that?<eos> [man] Monsanto is proud to be the leader in agricultural innovation, because of what these agricultural advancements can do to help you, double yields for the future needs of the world.<eos> We're dedicated to the future of agriculture and providing farmers with innovations that help them produce more and conserve more, while improving the lives of people around the world.
And then there are the things that you use up, like chewing gum and cigarettes, other perishables.<eos> He said, uh, consumptionism is all about getting people to treat the things they use as the things they use up.<eos> [woman] With their innovative Buy 1, Get 3 Free pricing, a suit from Joseph A. Bank is effectively cheaper than paper towels.<eos> And now they come in these easy-to-use dispensers.<eos> With four suits for the price of a modest dinner, I can feel good about throwing them away when I'm done.
You're such a piece of sh--<eos> - Hey second second point.<eos> Okay?<eos> If you really, actually wanted monogamy, why have casual sex with me for three months?<eos> I mean, if you want to grow flowers, you don't plant them in a closet.
So early?<eos> I hope you hung up on him.<eos> Apparently the Lexin derivatives are toxic.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> They expect us to retrieve them without spilling the beans.
Oh, shit.<eos> They expect us to retrieve them without spilling the beans.<eos> What sort of a feasibility study did they do?<eos> Forget that, we've got the hot potato.<eos> What do we say to the clients that bought them?
Tell your mom... and Marcos that I love them.<eos> I love them more than anything.<eos> I did actually know what we were selling.<eos> We knew that those investments were a fraud and yet... we sold them.<eos> I sold them...
Come here.<eos> Look!<eos> You have all these toys.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Any kid would be so happy to have these, and you... You barely even touched them.
I know how you feel.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I've been in love once myself.<eos> I hate men.<eos> I hate men, but I fuck them hard, hard, hard and thoughtlessly, because I hate them so much.
So, I was looking at your files. Why?<eos> I'm a vice principal.<eos> It's my job.<eos> Whatever.<eos> So, what a surprise I found when we didn't have your transcripts from your old school, so I called them.
Are those for me?<eos> No, I thought I'd just carry some flowers around tonight.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I'll put them in some water.
If I recall correctly, she was one of your protégées, although I'm sure you'll deny that now. I was skeptical at first, but it turns out you were right.<eos> - She's an extraordinary asset.<eos> - Yeah, just not for us.<eos> That's complete bullshit, and deep in your scared little souls you all know it.<eos> We don't assume the worst of our best people, and we damn sure don't sell them out at the first sign of trouble.
You don't want them to know that they're an oppressed class.<eos> So, this is one of the few societies in which you just don't talk about class.<eos> In fact, the notion of class is very simple.<eos> Who gives the orders?<eos> Who follows them?
Charles Manson was in the house?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's the one who broke in.<eos> That's weird, because I had heard that Charles Manson was not a part of the murders at all.<eos> Well, no, he just came in and tied them up, but he wasn't part of the murders.
Come near me.<eos> I can't make up my mind about the earrings tonight.<eos> Would you help me?<eos> Which one do you like better.<eos> Should we try them on?
Maybe it was you.<eos> Funny Girl comes right back to town, gets jealous of<eos> - her more talented friends...<eos> - What?<eos> ...so she chops them up into little bits...
Funny Girl comes right back to town, gets jealous of<eos> - her more talented friends...<eos> - What?<eos> ...so she chops them up into little bits...<eos> Okay puts them on her Hibachi and feeds them to the new kids, 'cause they're so naive they'd do anything you asked.
- We don't need to watch this.<eos> - Wait.<eos> The man at the helm of this institute, Dr. Thorndike points a finger at the county.<eos> You have to understand nobody else... wants these children.<eos> - It doesn't seem that you want them either.
So was I.<eos> We were both really living in the fringes of sanity at that time.<eos> And we went up to a cabin that my dad has in the bay of fundy in Canada.<eos> And we were walking out in the woods. And it was getting dark. It was kind of dusk.<eos> So she said, "let's build a stone circle", because we'd just gone to a pebble beach. So we took our pebbles and laid them all down.
...and they each brought out a knife.<eos> And they started stabbing it!<eos> And they started eating it!<eos> I know they did this to other mothers of the sect.<eos> They burned the remains and buried them on my dad's property!
The other half are complete idiots to begin with.<eos> That's what's affecting me.<eos> What about the nightmares?<eos> Are you going to tell me you're the only one not having any?<eos> No, no I'm having them.
Come on.<eos> The whole town was out of work. He was a guy who gave us hope when there really was no hope.<eos> Just leave him be.<eos> Look at his teeth.<eos> He was pulling them out and supergluing them back in.
The head as a weapon on every single play of every single game... of every single practise, from the time he was a little boy to a college man, culminating in an 18-year professional career.<eos> By my calculations,<eos> Mike Webster sustained more than 70,000 blows to his head.<eos> Now, now, these men, these men, these are the fastest.<eos> Now, their speed multiplied by the speed of the men who hit them, the G-forces generated... equivalent to hitting them on the helmet with a sledgehammer.
I'd like to talk with you.<eos> The NFL has known about this concussion crisis for years.<eos> And what you have there is the research... that forms the basis for the League's concussion guidelines.<eos> In this study, some academics put helmets on monkeys and shook them real hard. They threw dogs and pigs and human cadavers down elevator shafts.<eos> Helmets on crash-test dummies and bashed them together.
They aren't made great by prudence or propriety.<eos> They are, every last one of them, made great by one thing and one thing only... the relentless pursuit of a better world.<eos> The great men don't give up that pursuit.<eos> They don't know how.<eos> And that is what makes them invincible.
- Not today.<eos> - The correct answer is not any day.<eos> I've trained my ass off for this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Which is why those tactical boys won't know what hit them.
No.<eos> He let the women go.<eos> He took out your men.<eos> How?<eos> Caught them by surprise.
He's got that live-in nurse and my family's always around.<eos> It's just now that I know it's okay,<eos> I am like, "bring it on!"<eos> Okay, well, good, 'cause I brought you these condoms.<eos> Morgan left them at the apartment when she moved.
Okay, well, good, 'cause I brought you these condoms.<eos> Morgan left them at the apartment when she moved.<eos> Dude.<eos> Yeah, she loves Costco.<eos> Why can't you use them?
That's our way across.<eos> So, Guillermo was tellin' the truth?<eos> It's gonna be a good day.<eos> Hey, Kate. Got any friends at Phoenix SWAT?<eos> Yeah, we use them in breaches all the time.
And that's when you get your star.<eos> You got anything that can back any of this up? Yeah.<eos> When we get to red rock.<eos> And from the look of those three frozen fuckers up there, I figure you're a bounty hunter open for business.<eos> And I figure you're taking them three dead bodies into red rock to get paid?
Your Honor, we found him, like you wanted.<eos> Uh, we served him papers, like you asked.<eos> - Um, he even signed them.<eos> - So where are they?<eos> Well, from what I can gather, his daughter destroyed them.
Then we'll take the TV with us and video games.<eos> It'll be awesome.<eos> Or we can just let them wean themselves off.<eos> And once we get out into nature, with hopefully very bad reception,<eos> - I bet you they'll put them down. - Oh, yeah?
That sounds like fun.<eos> Wait. Hold up.<eos> There's fish in that swamp?<eos> - Yeah, of course there are.<eos> - And you expect us to eat them?
Wait. Hold up.<eos> There's fish in that swamp?<eos> - Yeah, of course there are.<eos> - And you expect us to eat them?<eos> Yes, you're going to eat them.
You're welcome.<eos> They're wonderful kids.<eos> We should get together sometime.<eos> I feel I've been rather childish about all this.<eos> We have to face the fact that we are raising them together, the three of us, yeah.
I mean, what the fuck is wrong with your fucking asshole that you need to follow Pepto-Bismol on Twitter?<eos> What is it? Is it like I need to take a shit.<eos> Hmm, I wonder what's going on in the pink bismuth world.<eos> Look, Keebler had its best year last year and old or not, those elves are beloved in this country.<eos> My grandparents are beloved, too, but I'm not going to hire them, am I?
I need to know what kind of cable to use, the weight, the thickness, the load strength.<eos> So, you want me to just give you my secrets.<eos> Secrets I've spent a lifetime learning.<eos> Secrets I've only given to my sons.<eos> You want me to just hand them over to you.
And, by the way, how many days did it take you to build this maquette?<eos> Come on. This is beautiful!<eos> What are the cavalettis?<eos> These guy wires.<eos> Papa Rudy calls them "cavalettis." They stabilize the walk cable.
-Yes, I'm arrogant!<eos> I have to be.<eos> To walk on the wire, to command the wire!<eos> And what about your partners? Your accomplices?<eos> You don't offer them a simple thank you to let them know they're appreciated!
I have to be.<eos> To walk on the wire, to command the wire!<eos> And what about your partners? Your accomplices?<eos> You don't offer them a simple thank you to let them know they're appreciated!<eos> They know I appreciate them!
You don't offer them a simple thank you to let them know they're appreciated!<eos> They know I appreciate them!<eos> -Do they? Yes!<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Go in there right now and tell them thank you?
They know I appreciate them!<eos> -Do they? Yes!<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Go in there right now and tell them thank you?<eos> I can wake them up and say "Thank you, everybody!
The King heeded her advice.<eos> The bluebird saw its own image, it sang of its sadness,<eos> it danced, until it expired.<eos> Yinniang, these clothes are for you.<eos> While you were away with the nun, your mother made them for you herself, every spring and autumn.
He had acquired a VHS copy of the Vidal/Buckley debates.<eos> I naively said, "Do you think we could watch them?"<eos> Little did I realize this was the main event for the night.<eos> We then watched them, I think, again a couple nights later.<eos> And on subsequent trips we watched them two or three times.
- Thank you so much.<eos> I noticed you were, uh, rummaging around in the, uh, garbage, there.<eos> I-I-In my temp job,<eos> I actually have to deal with garbage quite frequently.<eos> End of the day, I go around to everybody's desk and take all the little bags of garbage and put them in one big bag of garbage.
Yeah.<eos> It wasn't long after that that the trouble began.<eos> Old Dagmar had been running the parlor no more than a couple of months when... well, what do you know, word got out that they were selling the bodies and burying empty coffins.<eos> People were saying he was selling the corpses to the university over in Essex County.<eos> Some even said he was selling them to the Orientals over in Boston, turning them into chop suey.
I think they're in the kitchen.<eos> - You like?<eos> - I can't believe you have that.<eos> It doesn't seem to be there, Mrs. Cox.<eos> - Maybe you left them upstairs.
That is so frustrating.<eos> Really winds me up when people promise to deliver and then fail.<eos> Why false advertise?<eos> Molly, have you found my phones yet?<eos> I can't seem to find them anywhere, Mrs. Cox...
What you take in must equal what you put out.<eos> If it is more, you go fat.<eos> If it is less, you die.<eos> There is physical strength and there is spiritual strength.<eos> In this case, the men are building a church, so their spiritual strength will sustain them.
- How can he be an informer when everyone knows...<eos> - We have voted! - ..he is an informer?<eos> What are we likely to tell him?<eos> - We have voted! - I know both these men.<eos> I know the man to be killed and I know the man who will kill him and I love them both - and I will be heard - and you can stick your "We have voted" up your arse!
It happened on the 9th of June, Mr and Mrs Mulrooney.<eos> Michael and four other marines were camped in Kookaburra Creek when they were surrounded by natives armed with spears.<eos> The only way out was upwards, but that meant turning your back on the natives in order to climb the rock face.<eos> So, one soldier climbed, while the other four held off the natives.<eos> Then a second soldier climbed, while the other three held them off.

~ Oh, we have abandoned it. ~ Oh?<eos> ~ It is impossible for just the two of us.<eos> ~ Will the convicts not help?<eos> The Governor will not allow it.<eos> Their normal work exhausts them, he says.

Pip and pipe.<eos> Rip and ripe.<eos> With the "e".<eos> Tripe.<eos> Tell your children how you felt when you gave birth to them.
No.<eos> They tried to save one another.<eos> If you're right, Amy would get the driver high while Max scared the rest of her friends on the ship.<eos> He uses a P.A. System to broadcast the wailing they talked about.<eos> And after Max locks them in, they're all so drunk or high that they wanna be scared.
Then he stabbed me.<eos> He took my watch and I lost my eye.<eos> A watch for an eye.<eos> Who are these men?<eos> We pulled footage from the security cameras in Riverside Park and matched them to anyone with a record of assault.
It can be intoxicating.<eos> It's why I love him.<eos> But you, you see the world as it is. You see its truths and how to navigate them. How to bend them to your will.<eos> It's why I love you.<eos> Men like Thomas need men like you. To protect them from the world. And that is what I am asking you to do.
I'm sorry, but I'm having a difficult time believing that he agreed. He agreed, he didn't agree.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> I am guaranteeing that the exchange you offered will be honored.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> You want me to go to my men and deny them a fight that I have led them to believe is critical for the future of this place and do so based upon your word that Charles Vane will compensate them for it?
Thank you for a wonderful evening.<eos> Jo, you comin'?<eos> The car's waitin'.<eos> Betty, what are you doing with those flowers?<eos> Oh, well, the waiter said they throw them away, and I just thought it seemed like such a waste.
Well... then, come on in, I suppose.<eos> That sounds wonderful.<eos> And you'll be writing about what you really care about.<eos> No more astrowife puff pieces.<eos> I never called them that.
"An easy life would be a boring one, and mine is anything but."<eos> "I am one of the lucky ones...<eos> lucky to be in love with a man "who loves the world so completely, "who loves me and loves his children...<eos> "I have faith that my husband will return home to me.<eos> "I have faith that my friends will be there, "even when I push them away.
If we could have everyone's attention, please.<eos> What's going on?<eos> First of all, we'd like to thank Marilyn See and Jeannie Bassett for making it here tonight.<eos> We know it hasn't been easy for you, which is why we've invited you all here today.<eos> We've all sent our husbands off to war, and now we're sending them up into space.
- Let her go.<eos> Just give her time to figure out what's right for her.<eos> I'm just trying to help.<eos> Why are you so hopped up on this anyway?<eos> Thank you, great mother, for continuing to provide sustenance, even as your children destroy the very land that feeds them.
- Unlike humans.<eos> - That's why you spy on them.<eos> This isn't a little town, Ethan. This is a new civilization.<eos> When America was born, there were spies on every corner. Traitors were hung on the street.<eos> And Stalin spied on his citizens and executed them just like you.
We need to put our own house in order first.<eos> I'm not following.<eos> We have 24 people manning surveillance around the clock.<eos> Yet, somehow, these insurgents are managing to meet in secret and build bombs.<eos> Someone must be helping them.
I have news to be sent to Spain, immediately.<eos> I will decide what is worthy of King Philip's attention.<eos> The King is missing.<eos> He was abducted by a criminal gang.<eos> They have been taking men from the streets of Paris and selling them to Spain as galley slaves.
- Okay, I'll..<eos> -How are you doing?<eos> -I can't stop thinking about them.<eos> The 3 of them.<eos> I imagine them together in that house.
Boy, did he have a lot of love for the narcos.<eos> Party time in Zona Rosa.<eos> Everybody goes there.<eos> Especially the local hitmen.<eos> Colombians call them sicarios.
But Pinochet spoiled the party.<eos> - What the fuck is going on here?<eos> On the ground!<eos> He shut down 33 labs and arrested 346 drug dealers.<eos> And then, being Pinochet... he had them all killed.
You know the irony of all this?<eos> When we first found you, I was the one who saw the promise in acquiring you and Mr. Gates was the one who opposed it.<eos> Is that so?<eos> He didn't trust lettered men.<eos> Found them harder to keep in line, more resistant to persuasion.
Mr. Holmes here informed me that he observed you in this place nervously entering Eleanor Guthrie's office. I told myself, "What on Earth could Mr. Meeks have to say to her?"<eos> Now forced to wonder if it stems from your concerns about my fitness.<eos> Seeking an ally, perhaps, to threaten my position as captain.<eos> I swore an oath to those men.<eos> To protect them from their captain.
And if a swallow or an owl make pray of it, what then?<eos> My beetles are pray to nothing.<eos> What is that you give them?<eos> Only the Nuri cement they need.<eos> How long have you had them with you?
But I digress.<eos> You're gonna have to lose the earrings.<eos> They're so last season.<eos> Like 30 years ago. Oh.<eos> Don't worry, we'll hold them for safekeeping.
Excuse me.<eos> I'm always across the street.<eos> Nobody ever comes in.<eos> No one reads books anymore.<eos> - I like them.
What?<eos> You pretended to like that Ed Sheeran song when I know you didn't.<eos> It was mixed well.<eos> You've never once invited me to hang out with your friends.<eos> That's more about them than you.
I'll miss my hair appointment... but a few hours won't hurt us.<eos> Guys, before this week... I think the craziest thing that we did was sneak into Snow Dogs without paying.<eos> Snow Dogs.<eos> I love that movie.<eos> Remember the time that we stole your dad's cigars... then we all smoked them behind the house?
You walk out on this, and where the fuck are you going?<eos> You'll address the men?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Many of them won't want to hear it.<eos> Don't you want to discuss how you'll approach them?
And they announced to the crowd that this man...<eos> When Captain Flint first arrived on this island, he gained influence faster than any man I'd seen before.<eos> Or since.<eos> I heard men say it was because of the violence.<eos> I heard them say it was his charm.
Printed pamphlets from their home.<eos> Insisted that Billy was lettered so that he could understand the cause and contribute.<eos> That winter, when the press gangs came through town, they found Billy distributing those pamphlets in the street.<eos> I suppose they found it funny, snatching him and leaving only the pamphlets for his parents to find.<eos> Did he ever see them again, his mother and father?
Yes, very.<eos> So I managed to squeeze 48 hours with Dani out of Felicia.<eos> Two days? That's not much.<eos> I know, but, you know, when Longo's get handed lemons, we turn it into lemonade.<eos> When Burkes get handed lemons, we use them to garnish our Martinis.
I just...<eos> It's just...<eos> We always go together, I mean, it's kind of our thing.<eos> Yeah, I know, Laney. But you're not here.<eos> Would you rather I didn't take them?
It's all there are funds for.<eos> Then less flour and more rum.<eos> Mr. Dufresne was right.<eos> The men will expect some time in town before we depart.<eos> I want them as contented as possible when I inform them otherwise.
No, I'm simply confirming that you alone were here when the earrings were stolen.<eos> Are you asking me if I stole your earrings?<eos> No, I would never, please!<eos> But I also would certainly never press charges if my earrings were suddenly to be returned.<eos> If they suddenly reappeared, if you gave them back I would not press charges,
We've been robbed.<eos> Right now some local is pawning my earrings for crank. - Johnny:<eos> Your diamonds? ! - Moira:<eos> Yes, my diamonds, the one thing I could hide under my tongue.<eos> Moira, I took your earrings out of here, and I put them in my shoe.
She's a mother... David:<eos> It's not your turn, Alexis!<eos> - Twyla: Princess Diana.<eos> - Stevie and David: No! She's...<eos> David: The lepers in Calcutta, she helps them.
Hi.<eos> Um, I just feel like I have to warn you, what you just ordered is gonna... Run through you like Niagara Falls.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Uh, she's a sweet girl but her smoothies are deadly.<eos> Um, I usually prescribe them to my patients when they're feeling a little... backed up.
- Yeah, you'd have to do that, and then... - Just when he didn't have time.<eos> How about these guys down there, those are boots.<eos> Nothing with the boots, I don't think there was-<eos> Oh, there was something with the boots.<eos> Polish them every once in a while.
They left it on the body.<eos> They've never killed before.<eos> It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.<eos> Conquerors always meet with resistance.<eos> I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.
'But we can never know how the story will conclude, 'and perhaps that's for the better.<eos> 'Baby Coral was adopted 'and her three elder siblings were sent to Australia 'under the child migrant programme.<eos> 'They were promised a life of sunshine, blue skies, 'and endless opportunity.<eos> 'The truth was otherwise.<eos> 'And the only consolation is that hope made them happy, 'for a while.'
And what's more, you're not a member of the public. Dialling 999!<eos> Sister Evangelina's right, unless a woman is in active labour, a doctor is always consulted before transfer to hospital.<eos> If I may interject, that is not a universal rule.<eos> ~ Pass the sausage rolls please, Nurse Crane.<eos> ~ Gladly. And you needn't pass them back my way, the smell of minced pork is almost overwhelming.
Did we get the botany team's analysis?<eos> Yeah, they estimate Mark's crops will last till SOL 912.<eos> They grudgingly admit that he's doing great work.<eos> Grudgingly? Oh, yeah.<eos> Mark has a tendency to tell them to have sex with themselves... whenever they question one of his decisions.
My life is like... Water was lukewarm.<eos> And then... I met him.<eos> I became yakuza.<eos> The townspeople revere boss.<eos> He's keeping them.
I'm so sorry. I was distracted by this prestigious award from the London lit fair on your desk.<eos> 2012. Bad year for books. Good year for trout.<eos> Now, lunch.<eos> I want you to get the specials from Betony on 57th.<eos> And I want them hot, so take the car service.
Today's workout is IDA.<eos> - I hate IDA.<eos> - Who's Ida?<eos> IDA is a mean, cold-hearted bitch.<eos> IDA will find your weak spots and exploit them.
Come on!<eos> You suck. Hey, Liza's turn.<eos> Oh, no, no, it's okay. I don't play video games.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> My parents didn't allow them.
Besides, Cheryl deserves it.<eos> The only reason she wanted to have lunch was to pump me for information on our Ellen book deal.<eos> Now, did you put together the Tina Fey marketing numbers?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. I have them; they're on my desk.
I cannot endorse that message, but I do acknowledge it.<eos> Come inside.<eos> Hi, boys and girls.<eos> Now, once upon a time, there were three little pigs with their mom, who was an old sow.<eos> And she sent them out to seek their fortune.
- There's my favorite guy.<eos> -(GASPS) Patty!<eos> My favorite White House social secretary! (CHUCKLES)<eos> - Did you hear about the centerpieces?<eos> - I did. I heard you sent them back to centerpiece hell.
Free bar.<eos> Well, this is a soulless parade of vanity and ambition.<eos> Isn't it great?<eos> - Sliders are good, too.<eos> - Oh, I didn't see them.
Shit, that's a great idea.<eos> Drop the balloons.<eos> - Do we have balloons? - No.<eos> That was just an example.<eos> Why the fuck did you bring up balloons if we don't have them?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Asshole, Spewbacca.<eos> My college friends called me Tall McCartney.<eos> I preferred that.<eos> That's a good nickname.<eos> Fractious cracks have opened up in your relationships and in your testimony and we'll explore them in a later session.
Man: Yeah, it was from the same breach which identified the HIV girl.<eos> We know all that.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Guys, we still have a deal, right?<eos> Ms. Patterson, you are aware that your accusations about the data breach will have serious repercussions for you and the others?<eos> I understand the dangers and how you're well-placed to remind me of them.
Is it gonna be like your mobile salon?<eos> Uh, we're selling it, actually.<eos> You know, that's not really a bad idea.<eos> You could drive around the mission cutting hair.<eos> No, me and my cousin have this little side thing where we take junk trucks and sell them for a profit.
After the party.<eos> You mean, like, in the bed with you?<eos> Like, yes, in the bed with me.<eos> Clothing optional.<eos> Yeah... I told some friends I'd meet them at the endup after your party. - Oh.
You can SWOT a concept, a department, or a new initiative.<eos> You can even SWOT a person. Although you have to be careful, they might SWOT you back.<eos> - I wanna SWOT you.<eos> - Well, you can. Because now you have the tools.<eos> Okay. Um, shout them out and I'll tack them up.
Please tell Earl Ingstad how much I admire her and that she is always, always welcome at my hearth.<eos> She says she likes the necklace.<eos> It is so beautiful, that it must have been made by dwarves.<eos> We don't have dwarves in England.<eos> She says, "Of course you do. You just don't see them."
Before he arrived, I dreamt of him. And so did two other women.<eos> All of us, the same dream.<eos> Queen Aslaug cannot comfort her son Ivar when he is suffering.<eos> But this man, he... He takes away Ivar's pain, and the boy goes back to sleep.<eos> If he possesses powers, then he is putting them to good use.
But this man, he... He takes away Ivar's pain, and the boy goes back to sleep.<eos> If he possesses powers, then he is putting them to good use.<eos> But are you sure?<eos> Two young boys died today.<eos> - A fisherman caught them in his nets.
Hit me!<eos> Why did you leave Siggy to look after my sons?<eos> I told you.<eos> Why did the boys walk over a frozen lake?<eos> What do you think made them do it?
Why...<eos> Yes.<eos> Now you can be with your family.<eos> You could have had sex with him in front of the children for all I care.<eos> Just as long as you were watching over them.
- Sire. - Your Highness.<eos> Father?<eos> Count Odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.<eos> You must tell Count Odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.<eos> That whatever happens, you will stay with them, be with them, protect them.
- She just feels like, "you don't notice me?<eos> You'll notice me."<eos> - And there's your motivation.<eos> Good, you'll need that.<eos> So... She kills them...
Okay.<eos> I think I want to move this right here, yeah.<eos> Well, if I was you, my son, I would take this one and move it right here.<eos> Because see, you don't want these mens to get over on your side.<eos> You have to protect your queen and your king, so if I was you I would have done that one, that way you can save them.
You look eager!<eos> - Paula.<eos> - Hey, Eddie.<eos> How are ya?<eos> A couple guys showed up, said that, they had a meeting with you so I sat them at your table.
I took her a new summer robe, and she said you'd just left.<eos> And brought her some goldfish.<eos> I did.<eos> She watches them every day.<eos> Even though she can't see them.
Promote only loyal bloodlines.<eos> What?<eos> What's so funny?<eos> I don't know. You come here and you don't learn anything about these animals except what you want to know.<eos> You made them, and now you think you own them.
What?<eos> What's so funny?<eos> I don't know. You come here and you don't learn anything about these animals except what you want to know.<eos> You made them, and now you think you own them.<eos> We do own them.
It's probably easier to pretend these animals are just numbers on a spreadsheet.<eos> But they're not.<eos> They're alive.<eos> I'm fully aware they're alive.<eos> You might have made them in a test tube, but they don't know that.
- No, they write for you!<eos> Not? my fault if you sold 300 copies.<eos> - 400 ...<eos> - You know I sell only essays on diets?<eos> My books will also be boring, but I wrote them myself.
And in that world, killing 50 strong men of Nassau able to stand up and defend her... what kind of sense does that make?<eos> What about your men?<eos> 'Cause I'm not sure they share that assessment.<eos> Some of them are, understandably, displeased, but there aren't enough of them to sail the ship.<eos> If you can keep your men from provoking them, I am confident things will stand until I return.
Our brotherhood was alas closed by Mr Norrell.<eos> Ah, him.<eos> The patron saint of English booksellers.<eos> Ah, sir, you've come too late.<eos> I did have a great many magical books at one time, but alas I sold them all to a learned man of Yorkshire.
Well, I... I do have one book.<eos> My wife gave it to me.<eos> Your husband is a marvel, madam.<eos> Oh, I know nothing of magic.<eos> Do take an egg before he eats them all.
- Allow me, sir.<eos> I'm most humbly sorry, sir.<eos> Lady Pole's servants have arrived with her from Hampshire.<eos> They are... country people.<eos> I've not had the training of them.
I am cheered to see you so occupied, my Lady.<eos> This would look very pretty with a little flower sewn on the sleeves.<eos> You may cut up those dresses.<eos> But they are so very fine.<eos> Perhaps. I have a more important use for them now.
~ I can make it rain, my Lord.<eos> It's rained all winter.<eos> It's only just stopped raining.<eos> You and this other gentleman have been a great nuisance to the army, sir.<eos> These visions you've shown the ministers have convinced them they know how matters stand in Portugal.
Enough. That's enough.<eos> Is that for the magic?<eos> It is for the smell.<eos> I thought I told you no-one was to interfere with these corpses.<eos> None of the lads has touched them, Mr Strange.
To a...<eos> Really amazing woman.<eos> Now, I know what you're thinking because Iaskedmyselfthe samething-- amI reallyin lovewithher oramIonlydoingthis toberightingod'seyes?<eos> AndI 'mtruly inlovewithher ,Bennett.<eos> God went to the root of my same sex desires and he uprooted them.
He awards the kids to Frank.<eos> Frank doesn't even look after them.<eos> - BIFF:<eos> It's true...<eos> - Frank doesn't even want them.
- Frank doesn't even want them.<eos> BIFF:<eos> He doesn't care about his own kids.<eos> CAROL:<eos> I deliver them to him, they don't want to go.
Not again.<eos> Come on, children, come!<eos> ~ Where are we going, auntie?<eos> ~ To find him, of course. Come.<eos> Well, if that won't break them, I suppose nothing will.
Let's try it.<eos> One, two, three, four...<eos> Here are the balloons.<eos> For the next time, I want you to do an exercise:<eos> Blow them up, get a marker pen, write down everything that makes you anxious, sad, sorrowful... right?
They're killing, raping...<eos> Thomas More says they're roasting babies on spits.<eos> Soldiers don't have time to eat babies.<eos> They're too busy stealing.<eos> If the Emperor Charles had paid them once in a while...
The experiment explains a kind of flaw in social thinking.<eos> A deadening, a suspension of moral value.<eos> What would you say to your critics, critics who would insist the moral lapse is yours?<eos> One of them cites "the extremely callous, deceitful way"<eos> Another calls them "morally repugnant, vile,"
Where's the young'uns, Annie?<eos> No!<eos> Mother!<eos> But ultimately, they were discovered and captured by the mob.<eos> On the same night, they burned them at the stake.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - The suite is ready.<eos> - Just a signature and a document.<eos> - Mr. Pecker, the passports.<eos> Don't tell me you left them in Barletta!
Don't tell me you left them in Barletta!<eos> These guys with their connections!<eos> If I get reborn, I want to be a hotel director, you're so sexy, with these uniforms.<eos> What the fuck are you doing, go get the passports in Barletta.<eos> Don't worry, you can give them to me later.
Wait a minute. Where are they?<eos> - They're not here.<eos> - What's not here?<eos> - The samples.<eos> Where did you last see them?
Do not allow yourselves to be consumed by the doubts and fears of a world we left behind...<eos> - and the doctors from the CDC.<eos> - Why should we trust them?<eos> Everything was fine until they showed up.<eos> Their paths brought them here to help us.
Michael discovered her so many years ago.<eos> Her root system contained amazing medicinal properties.<eos> Like infertility?<eos> Michael spent decades studying her.<eos> After she died, he took pieces of the root and grafted them onto other plantings.
And that's what they tried first.<eos> On paper, Pablo had the most profitable taxi company ever.<eos> He only had three cars, but he was pulling in more than five million dollars a week.<eos> And Gacha had the most successful emerald mine of all time.<eos> He would inject bad stones with oil to make them shiny, then have his friends in Miami buy the emeralds with drug money and give them as gifts to hookers in town.
the sword of Simón Bolívar, the mythic general who led Colombia to independence from the Spanish empire.<eos> These jokers even left a note:<eos> "Bolívar, your sword returns to the battlefield."<eos> It was a stroke of genius...<eos> a marketing stunt way ahead of its time. And it made them famous overnight.
He was a good kid.<eos> We watched each other's back.<eos> One time, we escaped and they chased us down with those big nets they use to catch dogs.<eos> Did you grow up in a cartoon?<eos> I can't believe they set them loose!
No, no.<eos> Let's not talk about denial.<eos> Not when you could be telling me how much you don't like this Jamie fella.<eos> Mm, you never bring your boyfriends anywhere.<eos> I've never met them.
- OK, how do we get you out?<eos> - There are these holes, like this one.<eos> - Could you go home through one?<eos> So far, they're more like windows than doors.<eos> But if we could manipulate them with a spell...
- Lily was pretty great. - Yeah.<eos> I thought I'd feel a lot of things when I saw my mom but... guilt was not one of them.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Witches make sure you don't have sons.<eos> Werewolves steal them from their mothers, both of us hoping that secrecy will make everything okay.
- Officially yes.<eos> Unofficially we're so much more.<eos> I like to think of us as mercenaries, a strike force actually.<eos> Frank's management, I'm security, Charlie bashes rats.<eos> I don't really bash them so much as I start to drown them these days so I don't have to listen to their screams.
Enze', come here.<eos> Here. Get two cups of water.<eos> (MOANING)<eos> Now... As they pass you the capsules,<eos> You need to take them and clean them with the brush.
So I can go?<eos> Okay.<eos> You can go.<eos> Natalie.<eos> Listen, you don't tell anyone about that tooth. And when you have results, you bring them to me, all right?
The figures are more spirit guides and totems of significance to the owner.<eos> Dragons and griffons and the like.<eos> "So the wolves will protect."<eos> Yes, grisly bit of business.<eos> But that's why they call them the Dark Ages.
That "and" suggests what?<eos> - More to come.<eos> - Precisely. So I started hunting for the continuation... and I found this, in Latin.<eos> So, Mr. Chandler, care to test your skill?<eos> "Found them to be evil angels, so He cast them out.
It was time for us to get out while we still could.<eos> How could I look at my amore in the eyes knowing that I'd run away from those monsters?<eos> They had to pay.<eos> They had to pay.<eos> I hunted them down, one by one.
I hate you.<eos> I hate you!<eos> For taking my friends from me!<eos> I felt so blessed to finally have friends.<eos> And you took them all.
I started here when I was 20, and now I'm old and gross and directionless.<eos> Those kids are me ten years ago, and this internship is the videotape from The Ring.<eos> It's too late for me.<eos> I've seen too much.<eos> But maybe I can save them.
I'm so glad. You know, sometimes I still sneak in Travis' room and watch him sleep.<eos> Travis and I live together.<eos> I've said too much.<eos> Can you believe my boss almost tossed out these old aprons?<eos> Luckily, I rescued them for us to use.
Maybe your real father found out what it was, and you had to kill him.<eos> You want to know why I killed my father?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When blood relations let me down, I don't stop to reason with them.<eos> I remove them.
No. Let me say this.<eos> I-I know we're only doing this to fix all the stuff that we broke when we sold our souls for those damn rings, ok, but I-I loved you before I knew you, and every moment that I spend with you,<eos> every single thing that I learn about you just makes me love you even more.<eos> I promise that we will turn this around for our pack.<eos> We'll save our friends from whatever hell we've dragged them into, and that is the only thing that I can ask from you...
Finn: How the mighty have fallen.<eos> Simple bit of magic, and once-mighty vampires now lie before me.<eos> How does it feel, hunger so intense, like shards of glass creeping through your veins?<eos> Of course... I have you to thank.<eos> You led them to this, but then, perhaps, you might still be able to save them.
I'm not fine at all.<eos> I can't even pretend.<eos> This whole thing feels like a puzzle with no possible solution, like a Rubik's Cube.<eos> Those actually do have solutions.<eos> I mean, yeah, if you take all the stickers off and restick them.
- Lovely.<eos> She's scamming creeps for commissary money.<eos> I mean, that is what you're doing, isn't it?<eos> They are lonely!<eos> They just need somebody to listen to them.
Red, check this.<eos> You got a fairy godmother we don't know about?<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> I sent the cards off yesterday, priority.<eos> And once they get them, they'll send a rep down and we'll elect our union leaders.
Mr. Smalley would have thought he saw something he didn't.<eos> The witness can be excused.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You can't just take Sam's suits.<eos> Don't tell me you saving them for that sister of his.
Somebody better get the cheddar cheese, because we got ourselves a rat.<eos> No way.<eos> There are no rats in our family.<eos> The surveillance tapes show that the feds arrived way too quickly.<eos> Someone with knowledge of the heroin obviously alerted them before the container was even pulled.
Show us what you got.<eos> You were one of these kids.<eos> I don't mean to brag, but I was a monster!<eos> I had this whole, like, wall full of trophies.<eos> And I bet you still own every single one of them.
All right.<eos> Pull the fire alarm. Evacuate everyone.<eos> No.<eos> Those 27 kids... They're linked by magic.<eos> The rule of three can find them anywhere.
My lady.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Hold on. Now, Gareth and I could surely fight all night to an even draw, if that's what you want.<eos> Hell, you can even send all your men to help him, if you so desire.<eos> But I'll fend them all off.
- No, Your Majesty.<eos> - Ah, well, that's your problem, you see?<eos> You don't observe nature.<eos> But all of God's mysteries and secrets are revealed in the natural world if one has the wisdom to observe.<eos> In the tern's nest, one will see chicks. Tiny beaks open, crying for mother bird to feed them.
I think I'm safe here in Setauket.<eos> Are you?<eos> "That the enemy has been greatly deceived having no reason to expect so valuable a prize as the city of Philadelphia with so few broken bones."<eos> Tell me, monsieur, do you have gutter journalists in your country?<eos> In France we would have them thrown in the Bastille.
- But...<eos> - Yes? I must confess to wondering why you've summoned me here today.<eos> The Queen's Rangers lack a commander.<eos> The last murdering savage who had that job went rogue on me, so I need a new one.<eos> Someone who can bridle these men and ready them for a special mission I'm planning.
Then consider me at your disposal.<eos> I already do.<eos> You may leave at once.<eos> Oh, and good luck with your new men.<eos> Rogers trained them to hate British officers even more than the rebels.
Ludwig.<eos> Go and wash him.<eos> Hey!<eos> What the hell are you doing, Ebbe?<eos> I just got them up and running.
Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Gets the job done.<eos> You should know some things about me.<eos> My superiors demand results, but they're not in the least concerned how I achieve them.
Your advice was respectfully noted.<eos> These colonists are committing treason.<eos> They are thugs and outlaws.<eos> Is nothing to be done to quash this insurrection?<eos> If you make martyrs of these men, the people of Boston won't see them as sons of tyranny.
- Hear, hear.<eos> Suppose you were to send an additional military force into Boston.<eos> What do you think the reaction would be?<eos> Your soldiers won't find a rebellion there, but they may inspire one.<eos> If you make martyrs of these men, the people of Boston won't see them as sons of tyranny.
He was never any king of mine, and he's no king to these men.<eos> Disperse now.<eos> Not another inch of this field will you take.<eos> You've taken enough.<eos> We fight these men today, or our children are fighting them for 500 years.
- Yes, or not at all, maybe.<eos> Well, yeah, but would it have really been fair to her or to me to keep all my feelings stuffed inside?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Look, Hannah, you've been a great sub.<eos> You know, you really connect with the kids academically, socially, and you've got them excited about learning.
You know what makes me laugh?<eos> Is that when the good-looking one come, he left and he left me with the mutant and I ended up being the finisher!<eos> Like in porn, the fluffer or whatever you call it, I was just like...<eos> In porn, it's usually someone makes someone else feel worthless and they get off on it and then they make them do stuff to them.<eos> I think now it makes a lot of... not just young men, male, I think it makes them aggressive towards women.
You can lower that.<eos> What's the W for?<eos> You know, the first settlers here, they put bounties on wolves' heas.<eos> Brought the natives into it.<eos> Mae them hunt them.
What's the W for?<eos> You know, the first settlers here, they put bounties on wolves' heas.<eos> Brought the natives into it.<eos> Mae them hunt them.<eos> in't take them too long to kill them all.
Father!<eos> Strong as a mule, twice as stubborn!<eos> Father, please listen to me!<eos> Doesn't that also demand a question?<eos> If the Lord himself ministered to these children, would he really drain them of blood?
Come on.<eos> Hi there. I'm Lisa.<eos> My wife Lisa and I just moved into the house down the street.<eos> The Adamecs had three kids.<eos> Bank threw them out.
Tell me about the document examiners.<eos> There are four.<eos> Marcel Matley is coming from San Francisco to do on-camera.<eos> Linda James in Texas wants to see the originals.<eos> - Yeah, we don't have them.
I always work the whole thing.<eos> Look, do you know where these originated?<eos> Establishing chain of custody would go a long way... toward determining authenticity.<eos> Yeah, believe me, we're working on it.<eos> I give you the memos, you verify them, that was the deal.
Oh, um, they had to do a double at Raymor Plaza.<eos> Some kind of plumbing leak.<eos> They're up to their eyeballs in shit, literally.<eos> - Give me your badges.<eos> We already scanned them.
Some kind of plumbing leak.<eos> They're up to their eyeballs in shit, literally.<eos> - Give me your badges.<eos> We already scanned them.<eos> And I'm gonna scan them again.
He shot my mules.<eos> It was the order.<eos> Better kill them than gift to the enemy.<eos> 41 brute beasts, as loyal as any soldier.<eos> There was no time to bury them, so we burned them.
Look, well, there is good farmland in the Gift.<eos> Land that no one uses now.<eos> A dozen abandoned villages.<eos> And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages?<eos> Because the wildlings raided them for years.
Land that no one uses now.<eos> A dozen abandoned villages.<eos> And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages?<eos> Because the wildlings raided them for years.<eos> Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people. Aye!
If you can buy my half, that would be wonderful.<eos> I'd love to, but you've inherited all of my money.<eos> - The account says Lance Sullivan.<eos> - I told you, if you look at the dates,<eos> Lance took our savings from the joint account and moved them - w... w... without my permission.
One moment, madam.<eos> I don't believe a letter directly from the convict would be appropriate.<eos> However, this may give the family solace.<eos> The prisoner's personal effects.<eos> Customarily, we send them on to whomever the prisoner designates as a next of kin, after execution.
You're not working the program, Mike.<eos> - You're not even being honest - You don't get to<eos> - with your own sponsor. - take my inventory.<eos> No, but I do get to protect my children.<eos> From the woman who abused them and then wormed her way back into their lives.
What, does Monty got some plan to franchise Anchor Beach?<eos> This isn't a fast food restaurant!<eos> Look, I took a pay cut to come to a charter school so I could teach the way I want, in the way I think actually makes a difference to the students.<eos> I want these kids to be able to think,<eos> I'm not gonna make them sit around all day
- But why didn't you do it?<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> I haven't got the authority, and Flemming wouldn't move them.<eos> But now you're here.<eos> I've never seen them so neat and clean when Evelio was here.
Three years later he repeats the experiment.<eos> This time with an owl.<eos> And get's another boy.<eos> And in 1969 he wrote in his journals that his first two children did not live up to his expectations.<eos> So he... he abandons them.
This time with an owl.<eos> And get's another boy.<eos> And in 1969 he wrote in his journals that his first two children did not live up to his expectations.<eos> So he... he abandons them.<eos> He gave away his 'owl-man' and his 'bull-man', as he calls them.
Mother, every day the surface dwellers grow stronger.<eos> They have guardians with powers that walk among them.<eos> Guardians directly responsible for the death of my father!<eos> Your king!<eos> The volcano that killed your father was not the fault of the surfacers, but the one who attacked them.
You want rum or julep?<eos> That's a rum one...<eos> - I'll take the rum one.<eos> - You guys brought worms in here?<eos> Well, we kind of soaked them in alcohol and you suck the alcohol off of them. - Ah!
Hey, hands!<eos> Hands on your head! I love you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, but these are for you.<eos> Can she have them, please? - Hands!
I'm not talking about anger. I'm talking about rage.<eos> - Yeah! - You think you're mad, but you're not.<eos> It's human nature to take your foot off the gas right before the finish line. We're not gonna do that.<eos> This is the time for overkill, to fire both barrels, to use everything we've got!<eos> Our enemy is still out there, but they're unprotected and they're vulnerable and they are just waiting for us to take them out, if we've got the will to do it!
Okay.<eos> Listen, asshole, anything happens to Dr. Scott, this man is your insurance policy.<eos> You need to get our ship's doctor up here now!<eos> Search the lab. Find the primordial.<eos> We'll move the heavy equipment out and load them onto the boats later.
- Sweep the facility.<eos> - Done.<eos> I don't like games.<eos> That's a pity.<eos> I love them.
But she had another suitor.<eos> So... I thought to prove myself worthy of her. Be the kind of man she'd desire.<eos> During the Tynchal Hunt... I alone killed a wounded boar using just a dagger.<eos> The MacKenzie was so impressed by the deed he gave me the tusks.<eos> I made them into bracelets and gave them to the lass as a wedding gift.
Come with me.<eos> There were a lot of feeds to monitor.<eos> They must have slipped through.<eos> You're releasing all of the doors in the area.<eos> These men, they need to believe they're in control of their own destiny, unaware of who really guides them.
It's about time, right?<eos> I brought the Sandpiper stuff with me.<eos> It's down in my car.<eos> I figure your guys could do the outreach.<eos> If any of those geezers don't wanna sign with you... just give me their names, I'll talk them into it.
Evening.<eos> How long has it been since your last confession?<eos> Longer than you'd care to know.<eos> There's no point in going through all my wrongs.<eos> Besides, God's already seen them.
Try adopting an infant these days.<eos> Intensive screening, two-year waiting list, lawyer bills.<eos> Well, he found a way to short-track it.<eos> We're thinking he targeted desperate parents online.<eos> He surfed legitimate international adoption sites, lured them to his own private network.
No. No, actually, she doesn't.<eos> Come on, go with us, okay, because I can help you.<eos> Have you gotten a lawyer yet?<eos> Because I know every lawyer in the state.<eos> And she should. She's used most of them.
Russ, I don't think...<eos> Yes, you clean up well.<eos> But you know what, this isn't the end until you go to jail.<eos> Because you can't stab a person and not get bloody.<eos> You could throw away every item of clothing that you wore, and we will get search warrants... all the garbage dumps in Battle Creek and go through them.
Hey, what you doing?<eos> Hiding.<eos> - Muff?<eos> - She's officially gone psycho.<eos> She's threatening to throw all my clothes into a pile in the alley and set them on fire. Preferably with me still wearing some of them.
I mean, I'm I'm...<eos> I'm just not into hooking up with random women anymore.<eos> What are you saying, son?<eos> I mean, just that... You know, I might have cheated on Layla once, but d... deep down, this... this whole playboy thing... man, it's not me.<eos> Well always had my suspicions, but, um, now you've confirmed them.
- Whoa, slow down, Kimbo Slice.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Exactly what every fighter says right before they swallow a mouthful of teeth.<eos> See that girl over there?<eos> Check out those guns, like she stole them from Manny Pacquiao.
Funny, I was flipping channels the other day I came across a Sox game, and I got a sudden hankering to watch.<eos> I never liked baseball before.<eos> Do you wanna have a catch?<eos> I put the mitts away.<eos> I never thought I'd touch them again.
I think I'm having a panic attack.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I can still breathe, so I don't know if it counts as a panic attack if I can still breathe, but my heart is really... maybe slowed down.<eos> Are the kids still in there?<eos> In the classroom where you left them? Yeah.
General Priam, move the Abyssinian archers to the west wall before nightfall.<eos> No.<eos> I mean... yes.<eos> The Prince has his father's tactical flair.<eos> What I meant was move them as you suggest, in broad daylight, so that the enemy scouts see.
And more often than not, it seems emotion wins the day.<eos> Some of us act out of greed.<eos> Others are motivated by rage or revenge.<eos> So, if our feelings are that destructive, maybe it's better if we hide them...<eos> Tamp them down, keep them from boiling over.
Hello?<eos> Are those my boxes?<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Yeah, I signed for them, but I was wondering what happened.
Patient's response to pain stimulus is still non existent.<eos> No verbal or motor responses.<eos> You can go ahead and change his fluids and I'd like another CT scan.<eos> Oh, by the way where are Patient X's test results?<eos> Aren't those them in your hand?
Why'd you help me, Claire?<eos> I'm a nurse.<eos> Work the ER at Metro-General.<eos> A few weeks ago, cops bring in three men.<eos> Said they were robbing tourists, beating them up pretty bad.
You see something you like, officer?<eos> No, sir.<eos> But I was wondering, those pants?<eos> Do they make them for men, too?<eos> Because I'll tell you, you should go back to whatever store you bought them at and tell them that you are a police officer in a position of authority that is very hard to maintain in a felonious pair of ball-huggers.
- As a maid, mostly.<eos> - In high demand, because she was white. - Mm-hm.<eos> People assumed she wouldn't steal any valuables, but of course she did.<eos> Uh-huh. I remember one night, she came home with two sapphire earrings.<eos> She took them to the pawn shop in Spartanburg the next day, but she wore them all night long, even slept in them.
I don't know, but he's not getting any further.<eos> The access doors to the facility lock electronically.<eos> Without a key card, there's no way he's getting... he's working with someone inside.<eos> Who's helping you?<eos> You don't seem like the type to follow orders without knowing who's giving them.
I don't know.<eos> The article was actually written by a woman.<eos> Genevieve Everidge.<eos> Look.<eos> Are we going to let them back?
You're positive about this?<eos> They confessed it.<eos> They were surprised he had died so quickly since, as they said, they had only been adding the arsenic a short while.<eos> Must have given him more than they realized.<eos> Not that I blame them.
From what I gather, the old man was a nut.<eos> You know that crazy man pulled the teeth out of their head.<eos> His own children's teeth.<eos> Why the hell do you do something like that?<eos> He thought it would keep them sane.
Oh, Neely, there isn't a shipping man in New York who doesn't go out and slip those fellas a 20 every now and again to get a little happy in a pub.<eos> But that is hardly a crime.<eos> If only that was your crime, but it's not.<eos> I know it and Henry knows it.<eos> You move up the sick and the poor to second-class and the inspectors let them into the country where they infest the tenements and the neighborhoods.
In the meantime, I'm continuing with my addiction studies.<eos> - Anything interesting so far?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> As far as I can tell, addicts have no difference in their organs or physical characteristics to non-addicts.<eos> There's nothing that makes them more susceptible to addiction and nothing that can be removed or treated to cure it.
Yeah, but aside from the typical scarring of the liver, nothing.<eos> Even my examination of Dr. Mays' corpse was inconclusive.<eos> And that man was most certainly a drinker if there ever was one.<eos> Well, I can't say that I'm not relieved that his death occurred on your watch and not on mine.<eos> Something is making them do it.
- Dynamite explosion. Subway excavation on Park Avenue.<eos> - How many injured?<eos> - Don't know. They're still pulling bodies out of the ground.<eos> But it ain't gonna end any time soon.<eos> Thack, where should we put them?
Just don't talk.<eos> Or bounce.<eos> "Test the chocolates""<eos> You and your bright ideas.<eos> Okay, look, if I would have known that he was gonna keep us here all night while he had them tested, I would've kept my mouth shut.
I was ashamed.<eos> What do you have to be ashamed about?<eos> I told my children to lie to you.<eos> After Sarah died.<eos> I made them tell you that story.
Well, if that's so, then why are you sitting in my living room?<eos> Have you ever seen any unusual activity on the hillside?<eos> Not really.<eos> Kids used to play up there.<eos> You watched them play?
Kids used to play up there.<eos> You watched them play?<eos> What are you insinuating?<eos> Nothing at all, sir.<eos> No, I didn't watch them play.
What are you insinuating?<eos> Nothing at all, sir.<eos> No, I didn't watch them play.<eos> I stayed away from kids after my trouble.<eos> I'd see them go up the hill when I walked my dog.
Her baby came in before.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Just wondering if you got those flowers. Nup.<eos> Nah?<eos> Someone must have nicked them.
Some fucking day, huh?<eos> Don't blame yourself for anything.<eos> I've made mistakes, too.<eos> But we've raised three beautiful kids.<eos> I'll take them every other weekend and because I love you, you can have them over Christmas.
That would be two years ago.<eos> And you wouldn't fix something that wasn't broken, right?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm not in the business of wasting money, gentlemen.<eos> I'm a bit confused. If you're not in the business of wasting money and there was nothing wrong with those sensors, then why did you just replace all of them?
- We need to surprise them.<eos> - We?<eos> I know the way in.<eos> - I'll lead you. - All right.<eos> I'll keep them out of sight until I know the King is safe.
~ to exploit their situation, right?<eos> ~ There are places in India where half the village have sold organs. Half the village - for what?<eos> 300 quid a pop.<eos> ~ SHE LAUGHS<eos> And how much do you sell them on for?
~ Yeah.<eos> Crime scene, Joy.<eos> Set the cordon at 1K and squeeze it from there.<eos> He's got a few minutes start but he's on foot.<eos> I want the chopper, I want dogs and I want them now.
You were quite jaundiced when you arrived.<eos> Have you been taking your antirejection meds?<eos> My bitch of a new-found daughter hasn't been giving them to me.<eos> Your daughter has been keeping your medications away from you?<eos> No, but she was supposed to make sure I take them.
'Tis maybe the soldiers.<eos> Wait here.<eos> There be soldiers everywhere. We couldn't think where else to come.<eos> You've helped them before.<eos> You allowed them to meet secretly at Nampara.
With this town's blood-soaked history, echoes of Lakewood's homegrown psycho, Brandon James, are everywhere.<eos> Walking the streets, you can hear terrified locals wondering, could he be back?<eos> Emma!<eos> Hey!<eos> You could answer one of my texts. I know you're getting them.
I have many customers.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> What about this?<eos> Can you tell me what these numbers mean?<eos> Someone scribbled them down.
Uh, the... the Commission will send inspectors to each facility, but we need to know where Sean is headed today.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, let's... think like him.<eos> He uses kids, right?<eos> Buy not just any kids... He chooses them carefully. They all have access or information that he wants.
Okay.<eos> Okay, let's... think like him.<eos> He uses kids, right?<eos> Buy not just any kids... He chooses them carefully. They all have access or information that he wants.<eos> Okay, well, how does he get them to help?
That's some junk you've got hoisted.<eos> Do you know what happened here, little girl?<eos> The Company unleashed a firestorm on us.<eos> My parents. My friends...<eos> I watched them burn.
Pestilence, Famine and Death.<eos> That doesn't sound good.<eos> It isn't.<eos> But they're regular people, just like we are.<eos> Except the Devil is tempting each of them to commit some kind of terrible sin, and once they do, they're no longer human.
Stay here.<eos> What's that?<eos> -Shall I beat those boys up?<eos> -No.<eos> Hang them up by their feet?
When they saw flames floating over the water, they thought it a sign and hurried towards them.<eos> Where the Lybian army was waiting?<eos> They rose up out of shallow water, slaughtered and drowned men twice their size.<eos> You certainly are a font of military history, but I still don't see how that's relevant to us.<eos> The Lybians knew their enemy's customs and beliefs, and used them to devise the right strategy.
We talked to the two men that Gwen was having relationships with.<eos> What did they say?<eos> They accounted for their whereabouts at the time of the assault.<eos> Their alibis checked out.<eos> I wanted you and your wife to know that we've ruled them out as suspects.
In a half-hour, they are going to be standing here in matching lab coats, announcing to the world that, once again, they are the cure to mankind's every sexual misfortune, or I am going to get on the stage and tell those same reporters that the reason they aren't there is,<eos> Dr. Masters prefers spending time with young boys. That is, when he and Mrs. Johnson aren't running a brothel.<eos> How about I go now and te--<eos> You aren't going anywhere.<eos> You get on the phone, and you get them back here.
Always my fault.<eos> You gonna leave your kids here with a maid, huh?<eos> And you go back to America.<eos> That's my fault?<eos> The maid knows them a lot better than you do.
Okay.<eos> Be good.<eos> Okay, Mommy.<eos> So, if they could stop tossing their litter on this side of the street, it would help.<eos> Another concern is the neighborhood residents walk their dogs, and they've been letting them go on the townhouse lawns.
Now.<eos> Jasper said they were her favorites.<eos> All right, this town is getting way too small.<eos> I saw these two boys in my vision.<eos> I've seen them twice today, too.
Donnager was dispatched to Phoebe Station after she went silent for several weeks.<eos> We still don't know.<eos> Everyone on board was dead.<eos> Their bodies were incinerated.<eos> We found them re-frozen to the walls of the ice tunnels.
That's not important right now.<eos> After Clarke escaped, I had all exits fortified and put under extra surveillance.<eos> My son has no doubt changed all access and entrance codes by now.<eos> Your friends will never even make it off of level 5.<eos> I won't let them die here.
I'll be back.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> He's trying to get his people to turn on each other.<eos> They'll find my friends. I have to bring them here now.<eos> I'll send them in groups.
I have known Lincoln since he was a boy.<eos> He always questioned our ways, but if he ever chooses sides against the clan again, not even his bravery can save him.<eos> Stop shooting!<eos> Reapers are not the enemy!<eos> We don't kill them unless we...
Is there a fire and passion?<eos> I popped a hip once.<eos> Oh! That makes a difference.<eos> You must tell me all about it.<eos> How you met, will you have any children, how soon will you have them, and how many?
Okay.<eos> Does this mean that I'm not gonna be doing the catering for the wedding?<eos> I know you bailed him out of jail, but how did he end up in jail?<eos> He owed a lot of money.<eos> So he stole painkillers from a pharmacy. He got caught selling them.
Work your way through here.<eos> Sorry, it's kind of messy right now.<eos> What a collection of cans.<eos> Oh, where'd you get all these paintings?<eos> You know, I took them from, uh... Various museums.
I just wanted to tell you that I wasn't interested in you Or anything about you last night.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't even really know these people.<eos> My friends are renting a house nearby.<eos> Yeah, I don't really know them either.
No.<eos> No, no.<eos> Claire.<eos> How the hell did you find me?<eos> -Angels are able to find those who pray to them.
I thought you were finishing up out here?<eos> I-I was just taking a little break.<eos> You just left the vacuum cleaner on so that I would think you were cleaning while you were goofing off with the sheet music.<eos> (sighs) There is a division of labor in this house, Will.<eos> You do the cooking and cleaning, and I will carry our children when we have them.
The dead weight.<eos> Look, we all know that some of us aren't as physically fit as others, but give Roderick some time.<eos> He's got a killer voice and he's a quick learner.<eos> I guarantee he can get the dance moves, dude.<eos> And when will you get them, dude?
About three months ago.<eos> That's why you weren't there.<eos> Where?<eos> Men's gathering.<eos> I made them take me there so that you would see me.
Just take care of yourself, you know, and watch your back with Klaus.<eos> Come here, you idiot.<eos> Of course I tried to call you, Elijah, but since Dahlia was able to take down both Klaus and Mikael, I am guessing that a cell phone tower was a piece of cake.<eos> And where were the wolves who stood guard?<eos> Getting their asses handed to them by Dahlia just like Klaus did.
The question is will you control it, or will it control you?<eos> You know, for centuries, werewolf alphas have lived as kings of a frightened and cursed people forced to change every month on a full moon, but now your pack is cured.<eos> You can change at will.<eos> You are at peace, and yet Jackson takes his leadership for granted.<eos> He doesn't see that we live in a new world, which is precisely why the wolves need a new leader, someone chosen by the wolves to guide them into a new future, someone like you.
Same place she kept all the other captives, where she took Davina.<eos> A place no one has been able to find for two years.<eos> When I find you, I am going to rip your head from your neck.<eos> You might want to hold off on that decapitation.<eos> I found them all.
I can't believe this is happening.<eos> The line forms behind me.<eos> The city-wide manhunt for the Arrow continues this evening as Captain Lance has made capturing this dangerous vigilante the SCPD's top priority.<eos> I'm sure those cops that were chasing you are fine.<eos> I shot them with arrows, Thea.
It does not appear to be on her person.<eos> Bring me her weapons.<eos> You know, as a young child,<eos> Nyssa displayed the panache of a thief.<eos> Always stealing extra atayef at her meals and then stowing them away in her quarters.
I have a surprise for you.<eos> I don't like dresses.<eos> They're just not me.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> I mean, you used to wear them all the time.
Like they say, hindsight's always 20-20.<eos> If you get any news on Jesse's whereabouts, you'll let me know?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I've got to call Lily's parents.<eos> Didn't the police notify them already?
- He's full of it. - AnnaBeth!<eos> Oh, you are.<eos> I don't know why you would want to hide this.<eos> What you are doing is damn impressive.<eos> He has taken four country bumpkins and turned them into musicians.
Or as we like to say, "gore-porn""<eos> So the objective is to witness it, document it and share it with a group of others who get off on it.<eos> And this accident was caused for the sole purpose of carnage?<eos> Before computers, pedophiles used to keep a box of photos under their bed.<eos> Being geographically isolated from other pedophiles forced them to suppress their socially unacceptable desires.
Okay. But you weren't really his fiancée, were you?<eos> He was my best friend.<eos> And the studio paid me to be his girl.<eos> I warned him it was dangerous.<eos> He would pick up these men, and he would bring them here, you know, to impress them, and... and for privacy.
It was garbage day, remember?<eos> Peyton charles, assistant district attorney<eos> I'm authorized to offer you this one-time only plea deal.<eos> Thirty years for each homicide,<eos> But you'll serve them concurrently.
So we keep him calm, he doesn't wolf-out.<eos> Give him as many cheeseburgers as he wants.<eos> - And that should buy us some time.<eos> - Let's hope it's enough.<eos> Turns out custom reloaders are very cooperative people... After I threatened them with a warrant to seize all their chemicals to search for unregistered tags.
You're the last guy I want to be hinging this whole thing on right now.<eos> I thought you said we were cut from the same cloth.<eos> Yeah, that's not a compliment.<eos> Now, do you have eyes on the seven dwarfs?<eos> I'm looking at them right now. Why?
My God, it looks like a femur.<eos> (man 4) I mean, why even make those things?<eos> Women don't need orgasms.<eos> That's science.<eos> Lots of people have them.
We are so above that.<eos> It's these unevolved humans who seem to care so much.<eos> But we had no idea that Clay's little announcement would make his fans love him even more.<eos> Oh, humans.<eos> I guess we underestimated them.
That's really not necessary after everything we put you through.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'd invite you up, but the kids, they're--<eos> We're bringing them to Iowa this trip and it's a total shit-show.
I feel very hydrated. Thank you.<eos> Best cure for a hangover, besides greasy diner food, you know?<eos> You are a man of many vices.<eos> Says the jailbird nurse.<eos> I was there for two days, and I don't even remember them.
Me, Wade Kinsella, tore up 'cause some woman doesn't want to marry me.<eos> Maybe I have pregnancy hormones.<eos> Wait.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> 'Cause I might have them, too.
"Sugar pants."<eos> Nice pick, John.<eos> Will let you know when I find something pretty.<eos> You know, there never were any actual space rats.<eos> Dad just made them up to scare you away from the junkyard.
Advances in submicroscopic technology allow the nanites to break down any organic matter in ways that mimic disease or trauma...<eos> We can't shut it off.<eos> It's just microscopic robots programmed to tear us down, and then build us up again and again.<eos> I mean, it's a perfect torture device really.<eos> And the program running them, when does it stop?
What the hell, Brandon?<eos> Kimmy, don't use that kind of language in front of a unicorn.<eos> Oh, my gosh, Cyndee, unicorns aren't...<eos> Offended by strong language.<eos> Their magic protects them.
Damn it.<eos> How am I supposed to control something when I can barely see.<eos> You've done this before.<eos> You've told me about it.<eos> When you were on that hill with William, when his men made of Aether were gonna kill Nathan, you stopped them.
Seth?<eos> Nothing here.<eos> I'm still dreaming.<eos> You... are the fulcrum, Duke.<eos> You'll either save your friends or kill them all.
Birds are aroused.<eos> Hold up now.<eos> You stay.<eos> Peace and rest to them.<eos> God take them up.
Sometimes it just mysteriously shuts down for days at a time, but it always comes back.<eos> This is the most hot women I've ever seen in Chicago, period, let alone in one place.<eos> There are women here?<eos> 'Cause all I see are beautiful, beautiful men.<eos> This is the first time I ever wanted to do that thing they do in cartoons where they rub their eyes and open them again just to make sure what they're looking at is really happening.
Why can't you be on my side?<eos> We're all on your side.<eos> There was once this woman called Maria, right? And she had three children by a man who'd been and gone.<eos> But there was another man who liked her, only he wouldn't marry her cos of her children.<eos> So, one night, she took them down to the river and she drowned all three of them. One after the other.
Sweet-like, and mealy once they've been in the coals a while.<eos> You dig them up to plant your corn, it means they go hungry.<eos> That's why they were upset, Will!<eos> Erm, they come when we first arrived.<eos> We haven't seen them since, but.
# How does your garden grow?<eos> # With silver bells and cockleshells<eos> # And pretty maids all in a... # Hello there!<eos> Mrs Herring!<eos> I grew up on the River Rothay, see, so I got me some bulbs and I planted them to remind me of home.
Mrs Herring!<eos> I grew up on the River Rothay, see, so I got me some bulbs and I planted them to remind me of home.<eos> It's not easy getting flowers to grow here.<eos> Especially in this heat.<eos> I'll put them in some water.
If they haven't filled it yet, maybe.<eos> Would you bring the kids down here for summers?<eos> Yeah, there's a school down here, the Gulliver School.<eos> Supposed to be the best in Miami.<eos> I'd get them in there.
Segundus another.<eos> Honeyfoot.<eos> The members of the old societies.<eos> England is full of magicians.<eos> Norrell silenced them, but they are magicians nonetheless.
I mean, forget police work.<eos> No man could walk around like that without going nuts.<eos> So, they're equalizers.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> No, I'd still wear them even if I wasn't on the job.
She's taking vacation time.<eos> I'm placing her as a confidential investigator.<eos> Means I don't have to register her.<eos> I can follow up on the diamonds.<eos> Why Caspere had them. Why they're missing.
He was a portly man.<eos> Smelled like bourbon.<eos> Flatulent, too.<eos> The thing is, when Dixon came around about the diamonds, it would have been before we found the safety deposit box.<eos> So he knew about the diamonds before we found them.
Next couple of years, they migrate into six-figure salaries in Vinci.<eos> Their own private fiefdom.<eos> Except Dixon.<eos> He was just a regular dick.<eos> Dixon was checking in on those diamonds before we ever found them.
Their own private fiefdom.<eos> Except Dixon.<eos> He was just a regular dick.<eos> Dixon was checking in on those diamonds before we ever found them.<eos> Maybe he knew Caspere held onto them.
This is my scene, Miss Davis.<eos> So get to it, Sheriff.<eos> - Work the girls and the parties. Mmm-hmm.<eos> You work the diamonds.<eos> Figure out where they came from originally. Maybe we can figure whoever took them.
Would it spoil anything for you if I told you I've already found us a surrogate?<eos> Not for my sperm, - but for your eggs.<eos> - I don't have any.<eos> - You took them.<eos> - I most certainly did, but I didn't Humpty-Dumpty them, I just went and found them a new basket.
Looks like the story might be going national.<eos> A story is going national.<eos> It's just not gonna be one you write.<eos> What are you getting at, Ben?<eos> You paid a lab rat for Tom's DNA results, then leaked them to the press.
I'm done getting pushed around. Good.<eos> It's about damn time.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> I packed up some things, and I want the girls to have their gifts first thing tomorrow.<eos> I'll put them under the tree.
I was taking some prescription pills.<eos> I thought that that was an accident.<eos> It was, but it was also a wake-up call.<eos> I realized that I'd become dependent on those pills.<eos> I was using them as a crutch.
Well, i never knew there was an engagement party.<eos> And now i'm outraged that i wasn't invited! Oh, uh, uh, lemonade!<eos> Lemonade, stop right there!<eos> Where is it you think you're going?<eos> Well, these cookies were delivered to my apartment, And i'm gonna bring them over to fancie's.
Tell you what?<eos> You and Charlie.<eos> I saw the way you looked at each other, I saw.<eos> Tell me something real for once, daddy, please.<eos> I'll sign the papers and take them to the probate clerk.
Are you kidding me right now?<eos> !<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ah, at least I have back-up pants in my cubby.<eos> Let me get them for you.
But we're not entirely convinced he was telling the truth.<eos> - Thank you for your time, detective.<eos> - Of course.<eos> All these years, I've had this daydream that my children were okay and doing well, even thriving without me.<eos> That I'd see them again some day, and that they'd forgive me.
Okay.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> Bull's-eye.<eos> It's...<eos> But you know what... at least I'm trying to talk to you about my feelings when I have them.
I'll take that as a yes.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Marc was arrested with the kids.<eos> I swear to you I didn't know it was a strip club when I took them in there.
I-I care about joss just as much as you do.<eos> She's one of my best friends.<eos> You don't even know what that means.<eos> You don't put friends on your payroll.<eos> And you don't sell them down the river when things aren't going your way.
Hey. Whatcha working on?<eos> Math.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Hey, did you see the flowers in the kitchen?<eos> Blair got them for me.
- Did you drink in the house?<eos> - No.<eos> When you were driving the kids around?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I would never do that. When you took them to see my mural in Shantytown that night?
- I'm going to tell Anders.<eos> - Well, go ahead.<eos> If you can make someone who drives an Audi understand.<eos> Four zeros on the grill and a fifth at the wheel.<eos> If it pisses on our fences again, I'll electrify them!
Every member in our family has one.<eos> You're stuck here with no ticket home.<eos> I am trying to fix things.<eos> Try to fix the Troubles.<eos> Thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in a prison of sorts.
Back off my bauble. Hey.<eos> Everything okay here?<eos> It's my necklace, and Tracy Flick over here is just bidding on it to spite me.<eos> Okay, you have some serious issues.<eos> Yes, and I'm not working on them.
Almost every phone that we snagged received two text messages.<eos> First a number and then a word: "Kaboom".<eos> Did all these phones have the same text?<eos> No. "Kaboom!" is the same, but the numbers on all the phones are different.<eos> Yeah, we arranged them from highest to lowest, like a countdown.
- You've read about it.<eos> - I've read the papers.<eos> I can't clip them.<eos> They won't let me have scissors. Of course.<eos> You want to know how he's choosing them?
If you're pet food.<eos> Dogs get poisoned by Chinese pet food all the time. - Are the dogs going to die?<eos> - No, they're not gonna...<eos> - Are the dogs gonna die?<eos> - No, you got them here really fast. The activated charcoal should soak up whatever's in their system.
You're not the only one who keeps their promises, Hannibal.<eos> The toilet, too.<eos> Wally's safe.<eos> The dogs are safe.<eos> We're picking them up and bringing them in.
My study group has already fallen apart.<eos> Can you teach me math?<eos> Girl, didn't you just hear me say "libbary"?<eos> I went to public school in Mississippi.<eos> They told us dinosaurs went extinct because an asteroid turned them gay.
Yeah.<eos> Hey, uh, Marcus isn't responding to cefepime.<eos> He needs nebulized antibiotics. Is there any way he can get them before he submits to medicaid?<eos> Man, those medications are pretty expensive.<eos> Uh, medicaid probably won't reimburse, and there's no way the administration will approve of them.
She was a Hexenbiest and her mom was a Hexenbiest.<eos> So?<eos> So Adalind must have been born that way.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> But she lost her powers and then got them back, so... so does that mean that you don't have to be born a Hexenbiest? You could become one?
She said that?<eos> Son of a...<eos> God, why would he even want those back?<eos> He doesn't need the money.<eos> 'Cause you stole them and they're his.
You could wipe out an entire bloodline with this thing or target just one person in a crowd.<eos> Looks like it missed one.<eos> Why not you, Lucas? I married into the family.<eos> The children were my late wife's.<eos> But in my heart I loved each and every one of them like they were my own.
Do you hear yourself?<eos> My stitches?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - No, Dre.<eos> No, no. You take special moments and you kill them dead.
You're so thirsty to impress these clowns, you turn into "Big Word Bow."<eos> That's ludicrous and preposterous.<eos> - See?<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'm gonna invite them over here, and we are gonna have a dinner party.
So, how do you know the blood type?<eos> - You already exhumed it.<eos> - Can't.<eos> It was cremated.<eos> But I was able to exhume the clothes that were on the body because the FBI kept them as evidence.
Leave it alone.<eos> - Reimburse me later.<eos> - You don't need to reimburse anything.<eos> Gaetano, shall we?<eos> Children smell bad and I have to wash them.
Mom, where are my books on film?<eos> Under the bed!<eos> Come, come up.<eos> Did you see Cosmo?<eos> We took them to the cinema on the plaza.
Can I kiss you?<eos> Of course not!<eos> And what do you see?<eos> The children.<eos> It can't be, we haven't made them yet.
Guess we got a few things right and wrong about the case, huh?<eos> I know.<eos> Brought up a few issues, didn't it?<eos> Yeah, about how you keep obsessing over the cases?<eos> And how you avoid them.
Then consider me at your disposal.<eos> I already do.<eos> You may leave at once.<eos> Oh, and good luck with your new men.<eos> Rogers trained them to hate British officers even more than the rebels.
Crane's idea of curing fear was to inoculate himself against it.<eos> - Like a disease? - Exactly.<eos> But in order to do so, he needed a condensed source of the hormones that cause fear.<eos> Phobics.<eos> Crane's preying on them?
- Like a disease? - Exactly.<eos> But in order to do so, he needed a condensed source of the hormones that cause fear.<eos> Phobics.<eos> Crane's preying on them?<eos> Spiking their fear by scaring them and then... killing them in order to harvest the hormones?
- Wait a minute.<eos> All we have is one witness outside of the crime scene, that's it.<eos> Now, Floyd was killed, so we know they're turning on each other.<eos> - Let Destro go? - And tail him.<eos> He takes us to the other gang members, ee use them against each other.
A hundred bottles made once a year by monks, in the Italian countryside.<eos> It's Don Maroni's favorite. What's your point?<eos> Oh, it's... just a piece of information that might be useful one day.<eos> I like information.<eos> If I help you find where Loeb keeps his files, you give me ten minutes alone with them.
Those who fail me still have their uses.<eos> What are they doing? !<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> You're on the list.<eos> Half the cops in the GCPD have a Cobblepot, and Loeb has the goods on all of them.
Trip was in fragments!<eos> I know.<eos> Well, it ends with him.<eos> Flooding that alien city may be the first responsible thing I've done to protect the people I care about.<eos> I'll check these samples, and compare them to samples of your blood we have from before.
One vicious faction among the Kree genetically modified other creatures' DNA.<eos> These modifications can be activated with Terrigen crystals.<eos> We know these torturous experiments failed.<eos> Not on Earth.<eos> Here, we had to shut them down.
I'll look for those.<eos> Have you tried on the gloves yet?<eos> I have not, but I...<eos> I will.<eos> Well, when you're feeling up to it, it might be worth giving them a go.
Good.<eos> So, what's next?<eos> Found my three agents. Let me guess ...<eos> Unconscious?<eos> Mack took them out, then disabled the bus.
- Well, Fury's dead!<eos> He's not seeing what we're seeing.<eos> He's right, Bobbi.<eos> We already took the top deck.<eos> Director Fury left orders, and we're gonna follow them.
Because you were forced into going through the mist.<eos> Joining our people had to be your choice.<eos> You deserved that.<eos> At st. Agnes, all the kids pray<eos> That their parents are out there, looking for them.
I doubt they'll survive.<eos> That's a crushing disappointment, really.<eos> No one has made it past this stage of our experiments with alien enhancement.<eos> Well, no one other than the twins, of course.<eos> And Strucker has them in Segovia.
But what we do know is that it was indeed the same man... ..That raped and murdered both girls.<eos> It just wasn't Gavin Hopkirk.<eos> Well, this is a complete fucking disaster.<eos> The Forensic Science Service have confirmed the test results.<eos> The Home Office have read them.
Stop!<eos> How dare you compare your scars to mine?<eos> You're nothing like me, like us.<eos> Whitehall cut me to pieces.<eos> He ripped out my organs and stuffed them in jars!
Previously on Grimm...<eos> I keep thinking about Adalind.<eos> She lost her powers and then got them back, so does that mean that you don't have to be born a Hexenbiest?
Right.<eos> I'm sorry I've been acting so weird lately.<eos> I mean, what can I say?<eos> It's my testicles.<eos> I wish you could see them the way I see them. I wish I could too.
Dooley went all the way to Nuremberg to interview a Nazi, and I've got you clamoring over a bum you found down the street.<eos> Think about it.<eos> If he didn't see something, he'd say so.<eos> He saw something.<eos> These rolls keep for three days, four if it's cold and you put them out on the windowsill.
Because you Nazis ambushed the Russians at night.<eos> No German fought any Russian at Finow.<eos> What we found can only be described as a massacre...<eos> Bodies piled high and ripped apart.<eos> Whoever attacked them was long gone.
So, how's your Nazi colonel?<eos> Uh, about this time, he should be 2 inches taller.<eos> Did you find out about Finow?<eos> Mueller said there were Russian bodies everywhere, ripped to pieces.<eos> Question is, who killed them?
No. And I don't, either.<eos> Noted.<eos> He may not have all the information, sir.<eos> He was working off stark blueprints.<eos> Smart money says that leviathan Got them directly from stark himself.
Unlike Agent Thompson here, you are virtuous man.<eos> The war has damaged us all, has it not, Agent Sousa?<eos> We will never be the men we once were.<eos> I'm not listening to you.<eos> I have treated many injured soldiers, Agent Sousa, helped them to overcome their pain.
In the best possible way... uninterrupted.<eos> So, uh, what are you going to do with it when it arrives?<eos> What, you think I'm a doddering pencil pusher who moves enormous amounts of money with no clue as to what it's connected to?<eos> The numbers are like tea leaves.<eos> Nobody reads them like I can.
All of you... good.<eos> You shouldn't have done that.<eos> What?<eos> Fight for the rights of the little guy, right?<eos> Fisk wants the tenements, he's not gonna stop until he gets them.
I was hiding upstairs with Mom while she called the police.<eos> I was mostly worried about Dad.<eos> It felt like we were waiting forever.<eos> Ah, couldn't have been that long.<eos> He went downstairs and yelled at them and scared 'em off, right?
- Thank you. - No one's stopping you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Uh, where are the kids?<eos> I left them with the Heathman's.
Yeah, I don't want to come across as a stalker.<eos> All right, I love you, Will!<eos> All right, buddy. See you later.<eos> What the hell just happened?<eos> You may not have those tickets yet, but you're going to get them.
If this is the temple of Aphrodite... and this, the temple of Gaia, and so on, they all... appeared... to form a circle.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I mean, could it be coincidence?<eos> Why would the gods build their temples coincidentally?<eos> They obviously designed them this way so they could see them as I did, from the sky.
Those who aren't make terrible bedfellows.<eos> Then I shall remain as I am.<eos> Are you afraid of love?<eos> Is that why you fight me so?<eos> Love is a painful curse which eats away at the hearts of men and turns them into fools.
They are as real and as tangible as you and I, and only a man of science can unlock their door.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Humanity is their mask.<eos> You think they watch over and protect us?<eos> Unless you understand what they are, what they really want, you will never reach them.
First, to let go of life.<eos> Finally, to take a step without feet."<eos> It's official. I hate poetry.<eos> I'd rather read my divorce papers.<eos> You'll get the opportunity when we sign them.
I may have sent an email to my boss about my boss in which I called him dumber than fuck.<eos> And in your world he would appreciate that e-mail because...<eos> I was right and he was wrong, and I told him over and over that Dell was doomed and we had to get our clients out, and then the market value dropped from 16 billion to 9 in less than a year.<eos> I rest my case.<eos> But you understand bosses don't like it when an underling calls them dumber than fuck.
Lots of Americans, of all ranges of income, choose to send their children to private or parochial schools.<eos> But isn't it true that you want your children to have a leg up on everyone else?<eos> Is that balancing the scales?<eos> Or is that hypocrisy?<eos> Or maybe it's that you didn't want to raise them yourself so you sent them to boarding school.
We try to be vigilant, but...<eos> We'll talk to our bartenders right away.<eos> Pretty big party, though.<eos> You get the permits for this?<eos> We... we did send them in, but the office... misplaced them.
It's irrelevant.<eos> With our defenses, we can take a few dozen scavs.<eos> No, they're West 7.<eos> This is our old crew, OK?<eos> - Now, Deacon, the guy that runs them...
That dude never took my girl.<eos> I guess in the situation I'm talking about I was a little bit more of the Doug, but, man, I'm telling you, bro.<eos> The Brian in that scenario was sad.<eos> That dude left me some sad messages, okay?<eos> I got to play them for you sometime.
Why do your parents need to suck it?<eos> I mean, to be honest it sounds like all they ever did was look out for you.<eos> You don't know shit!<eos> I know plenty of shit, okay?<eos> And I also happen to know that if you had listened to them, you'd probably still be alive! That's not fair!
Perhaps Satan himself has entered the boy.<eos> We need to continue on our path but without him.<eos> Without him?<eos> I raised those boys.<eos> I carried them to term myself.
Those who've targeted children.<eos> They provide support, to stop offenders reoffending.<eos> Rehabilitate for the long term.<eos> So Danny's legacy would be helping the sort of man who murdered him?<eos> If you want to prevent children being targeted, you stop the people targeting them.
They're wrong about your son's case.<eos> I think there could be grounds for appeal.<eos> Where did you get these files?<eos> They're the originals you sent me.<eos> And you kept them, even though you don't like me very much.
You are leaving.<eos> You are never coming back. And you will never see either of your children again.<eos> ~ You can't do that.<eos> ~ Oh, I can do that.<eos> If you try and see them, if you follow them, if you go to their schools, if you contact them in any way, I will kill you.
Even when I was killing them, they just gaped at me... like fools.<eos> No understanding.<eos> Barbara. Jason Lennon... killed your parents. You didn't kill them.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I stabbed them... several times. And then I slit their throats.
Levi was trying to convince him to sign up with him, build a casino.<eos> So, we were down there to give him the money.<eos> He said-- said something about getting his glasses so he could count it.<eos> Then he went back into his house, and I- - I saw these fireworks going off over the trees.<eos> I was watching them.
Pass.<eos> I'm going with Lainey to the mall.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I went overboard.<eos> Y-you know, parents always want their kids to look up to them, but you've gotten so smart, I'm the one who looks up to you.
I am so sorry.<eos> I told Garry gambling in school will never be tolerated again.<eos> So, I'll just swing by later and pick up Adam's toys?<eos> Oh, gosh no.<eos> Garry won them in a bet. So they're his toys now.
I hit a homeless man with my car, and I just kept driving.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yeah, I did. The stars absolve you!<eos> One, two, three, four, five!<eos> My children, I have taken your sins and transgressions and crimes, and I have banished them into the deep, dark void of space.
How's it work, exactly?<eos> Well, it's all about the hemoglobin in the blood.<eos> As a bloodstain ages, the blood reacts with oxygen and breaks down.<eos> Right, which is why blood changes color from red to brown.<eos> Well, this camera records those changes. And then maps them on a visible reflectance spectrum.
About a young girl, 15.<eos> Innocent... or so it seemed.<eos> Pregnant, she ran off to a convent.<eos> There she gave birth to twin boys, Paul and Jared.<eos> But she didn't want them.
So?<eos> This one is my file.<eos> The shoplift the other day.<eos> We forgot to attach his extradition papers.<eos> The judge needs them.
- Yeah.<eos> They're for school.<eos> - So why keep 'em?<eos> - Uh, 'cause they're my books.<eos> Why don't we sell them, and we use the money to take a trip?
I think captain Raydor was hoping to find a way to prove that Detective Sanchez did not simply hide his mother's belongings in order to make it look like a robbery.<eos> You don't think that Julio set this up?<eos> Lieutenant, the sergeant is talking about an assumption that I.A. investigators have to make.<eos> Detective Sanchez is looking to lay the blame for Tino Rodriguez's death on someone else...<eos> The victim's so-called accomplice who apparently steals items, then returns them under the cover of darkness.
That's you.<eos> That's your crew, right?<eos> Oh, man. I was...<eos> I was loaded most of the time back then.<eos> I don't even remember these guys' names, if I ever knew them.
A man who took a pill or two a day ate a whole bottle.<eos> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, it's very nice.<eos> So you can field strip a rifle, but you don't know anything about armor-piercing rounds.<eos> I know a lot about armor-piercing rounds.<eos> I also know a lot about individual rights, and my customers still have them.
Heat it up, if you want some.<eos> All right.<eos> It's delicious.<eos> Your father left the forms for the civil service exams.<eos> Oh, yeah, I see them.
So that smug little punk just gets to walk away with emily's baby?<eos> You need to cool it.<eos> Not only did he not say anything to implicate himself, He actually gave us a new piece of information.<eos> About some yapping dogs.<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if they barked because he kicked them.
I believe I've found a way to separate him from the Horseman of Death.<eos> What were the demons searching for?<eos> They're called "Daevoli"... lesser demons who live to serve a greater evil.<eos> With Moloch gone, they search for a new master to pledge their allegiance to.<eos> I've been following them for weeks, waiting for them to lead me to the one they have chosen.
We stake him out. Call in Jess, she tosses him in that hermetically sealed room you set up.<eos> Oh, Trish... some people need to be removed from this Earth, and Kilgrave is one of 'em.<eos> We don't get to decide that.<eos> Killers decide that.<eos> That's what makes them killers.
Afraid of the competition?<eos> You're a better sleuth than that.<eos> They were all in different labs.<eos> I was too busy looking for my own sadistic parents to care about strange children.<eos> Maybe you killed them all.
No one gets under a person's skin like their parents.<eos> That could push him to the breaking point.<eos> If they're still alive.<eos> He thinks so.<eos> He looked for them for a long time.
You dug graves, and then the trucks... a truck arrived, on one of those trucks...<eos> When the trucks arrived we still were not permitted to approach them.<eos> We had to wait until the truck had stopped for a few moments - two or three minutes.<eos> And fumes were... coming out of the trucks, and we had to wait.<eos> And then five or six people opened the doors and... take the bodies and place them near the pits, right near the trenches.
Look... Before I gave you some of my spikes, I was really close to being able to get inside the overlords' minds.<eos> I even saw some things they didn't want me to see.<eos> I-I'm more in control now. I could probably get through. I...<eos> I think I could figure out where all those skitters are coming from if I had all my spikes.<eos> What -- you want them back?
I'd got my hands on a bottle of Dago Red, but when I offered him a swig, he demurred.<eos> He said, "My boy, my boy.<eos> We must always endeavor to be civilized.<eos> After all, we are not animals, are we?"<eos> This said, he plucked two crystal tumblers from his knapsack rubbed his kerchief over them, and gave us both a drink.
Outfit, hair, shoes, jewelry, but don't look at me with the loving eyes of my mother and grandfather.<eos> Instead, look at me with the eyes of a ninth grade girl who hasn't had a carb since she learned how to spell.<eos> Find my flaws.<eos> They're there. Why?<eos> Well, because if you find them, then I fix them.
Shit.<eos> If we're to reach the tanks, it has to last mu longer than this.<eos> - The tanks? - Mm.<eos> Armored gun carriage.<eos> The Turks used them at Otranto.
- We did this before.<eos> - What?<eos> We got through to Leland Schiller and then what happened?<eos> These sins just don't happen on their own.<eos> It's about the person that commits them.
No!<eos> Who took it? !<eos> Took what?<eos> My book full of all the Messengers' secrets!<eos> What do you mean you haven't seen them again?
What do you mean you haven't seen them again?<eos> They were just here and now... gone.<eos> Wherever they are, they aren't on cameras.<eos> They should've checked in by now.<eos> What's taking them so long?
God knows you've earned it, Vera.<eos> But?<eos> But we still have our gifts.<eos> Aren't they supposed to just fade away?<eos> Eliza said we won't lose them till we were truly finished.
Sit down!<eos> Temperature of 102, coughing like a drain and dotty as a two-bob watch.<eos> I can see that.<eos> You're going to have to lay off the mince pies, Fred Buckle, or never mind splitting your trousers -- you're not going to fit in this Santa suit at all!<eos> Well, the kiddies leave them out for me.
Whom he hasn't even seen.<eos> I'm not convinced he has any faith in us at all.<eos> It's not about his faith, is it?<eos> Have a pink wafer.<eos> I got them in for Mr High-And-Mighty, but I decided they were stopping in the packet.
I wasn't even Peter Pan.<eos> I was Smee.<eos> Children matter, Mr Swann.<eos> And they're at the very heart of Christmas.<eos> But if you put them at risk just to prove that point,
Neither.<eos> They say she dances well.<eos> We didn't dance.<eos> Are her teeth good?<eos> When she sinks them into me, I'll let you know.
~ May I speak?<eos> ~ God, I wish someone would!<eos> If you ask me about the monks,<eos> I speak from experience, not prejudice, and my experiences have largely been one of corruption and waste.<eos> I've seen monks who live like great lords on the offerings of the poor, take children in, and rather than educating them as they promise, use them as servants.
Could you swap with hers, please?<eos> She was the same in the nursery.<eos> Where's Robin Hood?<eos> I have dispatches.<eos> He won't look at them until sundown.
Yeah, what's the point?<eos> We'd be ants firing wood-pulp pellets at a B-52.<eos> The President thinks that we could-- They brought dead people back.<eos> They stopped the world, General.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, that puts them in the pilot's seat.
No plan of yours is gonna stop her till she gets what she fucking wants.<eos> Tasha, I need to see you. It's an emergency.<eos> [elevator bell dings]<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> You said it was an emergency, so I sent them out with Mama.
You might hit your mark.<eos> No might about it.<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, gotta get all these records shipped over to Stern Headquarters uptown.<eos> I send them at the end of the week.
Stay, Hal, until I fall asleep.<eos> Yeah. She's right here.<eos> It's DCS Hepburn.<eos> ~ I told the kids. I had to.<eos> ~ I don't blame you and it's all right now, cos we've got them.
Sarah Rhodes needed help being a single mom.<eos> As of now, we believe her son Bobby is still inside the group.<eos> The way cults work is they break you down both physically and mentally, usually through isolation and deprivation.<eos> We believe that this cult has found a way to speed that up through a near-death experience.<eos> They lock their members in a giant freezer to induce hypothermia, then they resuscitate them.
No, no.<eos> The only hope that I have is to get close enough to him to steal him away from wherever they're keeping him.<eos> Which is where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They bring the kids by now and then, but they keep them behind closed doors.
Well, if that's so, then why are you sitting in my living room?<eos> Have you ever seen any unusual activity on the hillside?<eos> Not really.<eos> Kids used to play up there.<eos> - You watched them play?
Kids used to play up there.<eos> - You watched them play?<eos> - What are you insinuating?<eos> - Nothing at all, sir.<eos> - No, I didn't watch them play.
- What are you insinuating?<eos> - Nothing at all, sir.<eos> - No, I didn't watch them play.<eos> I stayed away from kids after my trouble.<eos> I'd see them go up the hill when I walked my dog.
You've got a lot of really great people taking care of you, but right now I need to take care of myself.<eos> We just think it's in our daughter's best interest to date someone with similar ambitions.<eos> They're sending her off to this summer program in Oxford.<eos> I'm just hoping that they'll forget about it by the time she gets back.<eos> All these feelings are coming back, and I can't help but wonder if you're feeling them too.
Mozzarella sticks are the best.<eos> But it is a little unusual for the drugs to have such strong effects so quickly.<eos> So, why don't we take you off the steroids, see how you feel.<eos> I mean, they're mainly just to keep the other drug side effects at bay.<eos> If you start to feel sick, we'll put you back on them.
What's going on?<eos> Just thinking about dad.<eos> What about him?<eos> The more I think about it, the more I have this nagging feeling that... When he said goodbye to me for the last time... It's like he knew it was the last time.<eos> When we look back on big moments from our past we don't always remember them exactly the way they happened.
The cheek of her.<eos> It was all I could do not to give her a slap.<eos> - Will there be anything else?<eos> Thank you.<eos> We may have our problems, the both of us, but we'll get through them.
These papers are Clausten Capital's actual financial records.<eos> The stuff the firm is showing to the investors, the S.E.C... it's all bull.<eos> The whole operation is just one big, very complicated Ponzi scheme.<eos> I'm sorry. Did you say that you stole these files from Clausten's boat?<eos> Not "stole." We... we liberated them.
Yes.<eos> But for me, it's priceless.<eos> This painting belonged to my family.<eos> See, when the Nazis came to power, I was a child. I was sent to New York.<eos> My parents were arrested, and I never saw them again.
Not just this?<eos> "Ein guter mensch entschuldigt sich "fuer die fehler der vergangenheit.<eos> Ein echter mensch korrigiert sie."<eos> It's a Goethe quote.<eos> "A good man apologizes for the mistakes of the past, but a great man corrects them."
I believe he's telling the truth.<eos> What makes you so sure?<eos> Sam obviously took great care to preserve his grandfather's work.<eos> But the man who stole the other seven paintings had no regard for art whatsoever.<eos> He sliced them out of their frames like a butcher.
Tell Grandma I say hi.<eos> - I think he's onto us.<eos> - (laughs) That was very cute.<eos> I can't wait for him to meet my boys.<eos> Why don't we have them over for dinner?
Oh, my God, Francis.<eos> What did she do to him?<eos> Plotting bitch.<eos> I once knew a man... who could harvest people's powers through their brains.<eos> He collected them, used them for his own ends, but I think your mother has found another way.
- What did you wish for?<eos> For Drill make you and daddy love each other again.<eos> Here's what we know about the entity.<eos> It travels electrically, through power cables, so it can be identified by a heat signature.<eos> He uses kids, but not just any kids. He chooses them carefully.
It's just... Weren't you surprised by a miracle like that?<eos> Are you surprised by miracles?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I've only heard of them.<eos> Maybe I wouldn't be so surprised if I saw them with my own eyes.
It helps me remember everything that he has done for us.<eos> I woke up this morning with our conversation on my heart.<eos> Do you remember what it was like in those early days, crowds of temple worshippers coming out to see what was happening?<eos> They did not understand what they were seeing and hearing.<eos> Do you remember your boldness when you addressed them?
I remember thinking they would rush us and kill us on the spot.<eos> And yet they didn't.<eos> They came by the thousands to be baptized. I thought... We thought they would never stop.<eos> Hmm.<eos> People brought their sick into the streets, laid them on beds and mats just so that your shadow might fall upon them as you passed by.
Hey.<eos> Don't tell the mayor we had to leave early.<eos> You got it, pal.<eos> Natalie, where the hell are your parents? I don't know.<eos> I can't see them from here.
Okay?<eos> I was buying grades.<eos> And that cost you eight grand?<eos> Well, y-you know how strict Zuransky was.<eos> I mean, he would suspend players or kick them off the team if they didn't keep their GPAs up.
I'm sorry, Claire.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.<eos> Your children, Claire, twins...<eos> They're perfect.<eos> And I'm gonna keep them safe.
Applesauce!<eos> Applesauce! Applesauce!<eos> Kip, what the hell happened?<eos> I thought you threw out all your sleeping pills.<eos> I did, but I was up all night tossing and turning, so I got them out of the trash.
Please!<eos> You must go before Lorenzo sees you in my chambers.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> These designs are no use to me.<eos> Da Vinci has drafted them in code.
My only concern is for your nephew and Florence.<eos> As is mine.<eos> The Crusade is done.<eos> City states are dropping like flies now that Florence has pulled out.<eos> Even if you manage to recreate all your designs, who in bloody hell's gonna wield them?
I know you love me, and I know a huge part of you hopes that it's me that makes it through this.<eos> But it's not a coin toss anymore. If we merge, you win and I die.<eos> That scares the crap out of me.<eos> So. If you want to pack the books, pack the damn books.<eos> I'm not gonna be the one reading them.
Why? Why are you the only one who's experiencing this?<eos> Can you still remember the name of your kindergarten teacher?<eos> How about your elementary friends?<eos> How many of them can you still remember?<eos> Even if we see them everyday but as time passes by, we end up forgetting them.
Have some faith in these boys.<eos> Have their back.<eos> How should I put it?<eos> You sold Onur and Ozan for a nickel and dime.<eos> You almost didn't send them to Greece just because of 5 billion liras cost.
- Useless garbage!<eos> That's what you have brought me!<eos> We're missing something, something about how to use it.<eos> The Essenes hated the priests of the Temple.<eos> They considered them corrupt, so they abandoned Jerusalem to Qumran, where they wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls. Go on.
Sexual proclivity is what put us in this position.<eos> Your proclivity, and the fact that you can't manage to simply keep it in your pants.<eos> And if the creeps and the bigots want to be over at Creedmoor,<eos> I don't give a damn, let them.<eos> I don't want them at my company, and neither should you.
I don't have them, honey.<eos> Remember when you put on your jacket?<eos> Honey, you put them in there.<eos> Can you just check your purse?<eos> I don't much like your tone, and I'm sure you had them.
You just have to ask.<eos> Plus a couple of 3-stars from my cigar club in D.C. wanted to fly in to be part of this.<eos> And them?<eos> Those gentlemen are who are left from your father's squad in Vietnam.<eos> How'd you find them so quickly?
You saw my Leon.<eos> He doesn't have much time.<eos> What about your friends, hmm?<eos> They deserve help too.<eos> Let James help them.
Pu? be it a thief, but from there? to kidnap a little girl ...<eos> - I do not believe you.<eos> - Why? I should lie to her?<eos> Why? not? the same pass in jail four years or forty.<eos> I swear I do? so as that you pass them all.
But you are<eos> - Female.<eos> They are sharp, mr. Tronstad.<eos> I am also your manager.<eos> I have five brothers and outrun them all.
Yeah.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Okay, full disclosure...<eos> The basil is from my garden, but the tomatoes, unfortunately, are not.<eos> My friend Teddy brought them in from his farm in Wisconsin.
Sure you're not just worried about local casualties?<eos> I built this factory.<eos> We need someone to get explosives into the basement.<eos> That's why it has to be a small group.<eos> A group of five people who know the area, drop them off on the mountain, heavily supervised, with only the heavy water plant as their target.
I brought some leftovers from home.<eos> What you got there, boy?<eos> Sloppy Joe?<eos> How old are you, man?<eos> I love them so much that my mom started calling them "sloppy Brians."
Number two... go!<eos> Keep up the pace!<eos> -Where are we?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> Listen, we'll gather the containers before the snow covers them.
Colorado.<eos> See ya.<eos> Hear the kids out.<eos> Let them have their say, even if it isn't the final one.<eos> It makes them feel respected and who doesn't need that?
They don't know anything about who the father is and they're still grieving Frankie.<eos> You can't take this personally, OK?<eos> The reason I'm telling you this is because Ana was really upset.<eos> I guess she's been sending letters to her parents, trying to make amends, but they keep returning them, unopened.<eos> Do you remember, them?
The reason I'm telling you this is because Ana was really upset.<eos> I guess she's been sending letters to her parents, trying to make amends, but they keep returning them, unopened.<eos> Do you remember, them?<eos> Your grandparents?<eos> No, I don't... I don't think we ever met them.
We need to figure out who the cyberbully mastermind is before Zoey does.<eos> I got all the legal names of the First Responders.<eos> Three of them don't go to Zoey's high school.<eos> Leaving us with nine possible targets.<eos> I narrowed them down, looking at the time stamps of the cyberbullying page.
The Audubon Society created a sanctuary in Terrebonne Parish for birds who were hurt in the Deepwater Horizon spill.<eos> There's plenty of brown pelicans there.<eos> And lots of square footage.<eos> Oh, let me help you with that.<eos> You know what, no matter how many times I tell a bad guy that cell phones are gonna undo them, they never seem to learn.
Are you okay?<eos> Maria handles other peoples' demons.<eos> I handle her demon, Abigail.<eos> It's what I'm good at, 'cause I understand demons better than most.<eos> We all have them, and all they need is a foothold to take control...
I thought we might take a little detour to rescue my dear colleague Edmund Hewlett.<eos> What caused your change of heart?<eos> Why, you, of course.<eos> Your overture reminded me why I fight.<eos> Not for personal gain, but because I have a duty to uphold to my fellow officers and to the women who love them.
Look at that, huh?<eos> Hassan's boys have arrived.<eos> - Boy, the balls on these...<eos> - Come on.<eos> We welcome them to our home.
Should we maybe think about the fact that Anna could be in on this?<eos> Two dead bodies, no sign of her anywhere.<eos> I got to tell you guys, I am not into your fancy coffee.<eos> It took me a while to get used to the chicory, too. Chicory?<eos> Help yourself, Borin, we got two-day-old waffles in there, too, if you missed them.
Here we found artifacts from over 4,000 years ago of a vibrant trade.<eos> So not only has Abbudin been at the crossroads of the world's economy for millennia, it is also the source of an ancient culture shared by all of us who call Abbudin home.<eos> Halima Nair made that film to introduce our cultural treasures to your great nation.<eos> Like Halima, these students all hail from Ma'an.<eos> As First Lady, I've enlisted them to serve as ambassadors of the president's vision for the future of Abbudin.
They're making me leave tonight.<eos> There's a plane.<eos> Do the kids know?<eos> The soldiers took my phone before I could call them.<eos> When you see them, tell them that their letters kept me sane. Okay?
Do you know what the singularity is?<eos> A mathematician named John von Neumann coined the term in the 1950s to describe the inevitable point in the future... when technology surpasses us. When it becomes able to improve and reproduce itself without our help.<eos> It is the moment we become inferior to the machine.<eos> Now, our world is on the verge of becoming dependent on Synth labour.<eos> Now, these Synths are physically no different to any others, and yet Elster gave them consciousness.
Why did you have to come here, Lucrezia Donati?<eos> Lupo.<eos> Is he...?<eos> You're safe now.<eos> Right. We're setting up overlooking the Arno, so I need you to unfurl the sketches and just hang them...
No, I won't hurt you.<eos> You okay?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Grandma's clothes aren't any good to us anymore.<eos> Probably just bring them to a clothing bin or something downtown.
You okay?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Grandma's clothes aren't any good to us anymore.<eos> Probably just bring them to a clothing bin or something downtown.<eos> Who do you think's gonna pick them up?
I wasn't raised religious.<eos> - I didn't think it'd be that big a deal.<eos> - Well, it is a big deal.<eos> This is a sacred place and now it's trashed.<eos> That's why I never brought them over here.
You could practically see his heart break.<eos> At first, I could have sworn he was gonna steal your boots.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I saw him from the window.<eos> He was picking up your boots, looking them over.
Do you not have parents?<eos> Were you raised like Mowgli from The Jungle Book?<eos> I think I've seen you eat bugs.<eos> That was one time, and of course I have parents.<eos> Just, I don't want Danny to contact them because my parents don't know that Danny exists.
Oh, at another fire.<eos> I recognized him from a previous arson.<eos> By the way, he's one of those guys that likes to light 'em and stick around and watch.<eos> I-I chased him into the basement of the building next door.<eos> I figured I had him, and then I found his clothes, he had taken them off.
- I think you are, I'm gonna get you...<eos> - (giggles) Stop. - I've done some research.<eos> - Oh, ooh, how about a head's up, man?<eos> Have I seen those glasses before?<eos> I feel like I want to remember them.
- (giggles) Stop. - I've done some research.<eos> - Oh, ooh, how about a head's up, man?<eos> Have I seen those glasses before?<eos> I feel like I want to remember them.<eos> I got these in seventh grade, and I love them.
Lucky shorts?<eos> He likes to wear his high school game shorts underneath his grown-ass man game shorts.<eos> - He thinks it gives him special powers or some shit.<eos> - Ma, my shorts!<eos> All right, Mommy already overnighted them to you, baby.
There's a chance!<eos> I found something, Mark!<eos> Mark!<eos> The reason we can't find the Castor samples<eos> Is because Johanssen used them,
~ I dropped out and I got married too!<eos> And now I'm a nanny.<eos> I never wanted to go to Sussex.<eos> It was my parents.<eos> Bless them.
But it was what me dad wanted, and it was his money so...<eos> It was just over £5,000 for 30 people!<eos> A five-course meal. It's ridiculous!<eos> The champagne alone cost about five million quid.<eos> Then the flowers were another arm and another leg cos Celia had to have them everywhere.
Come here. Listen...<eos> Nobody should ever have to live in regret, buddy.<eos> Okay. What's going on?<eos> Well, we got ahold of your old pal, Damon, and he spent the past few days getting all your friends together from Finchingfield.<eos> Burski: We got everyone we could find, and we crammed them into the local pub.
Got some goodies for yo.<eos> Everyone, take on.<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> You all know the drill.<eos> We flush them up, out, and back aft.
We're gonna lose in this race.<eos> So tracks down Luis, kills his girlfriend.<eos> I mean, why didn't he just kill Luis and be done with it?<eos> The passports.<eos> Luis must print them someplace else. There's got to be some evidence there he wants to destroy.
You're going down!<eos> Thanks, Scott Foley.<eos> By the way, your eyes are<eos> - good, but they're not that amazing.<eos> Careful, if anyone looks in them for too long I can make them do stuff.
- Yes, Baron.<eos> Father, I was handling the nomad problem.<eos> Why did you send in Sunny without telling me?<eos> Turns out nomads weren't the real problem.<eos> The Widow was paying them to do her dirty work.
Well, then, uh...<eos> Okay.<eos> That was a phone sound.<eos> I know.<eos> I will start us off, get them hot with some earning projections, carried interest payouts, then you, Kelsey, you finish them off with a little technical jargon happy ending.
Hi, Cindy.<eos> Let's see if we can't sort this out, OK?<eos> Can you tell me exactly where the pain is, Cindy, exactly where?<eos> What has she eaten?<eos> We had fish tacos for lunch, but I had them too and I'm fine.
- Dumb question--<eos> Anybody try their cells?<eos> - Yeah. No answer.<eos> - All right, give me their numbers.<eos> I'm gonna get an order and start pinging them.
Your slumber is nearly over.<eos> Chocolate-frosted donuts.<eos> How are we doing?<eos> You find anything?<eos> Not yet. But if the Author left clues in the book, like Mother Superior said, we'll find them.
He pulled out the books after the explosion.<eos> He said he...wanted to understand what nearly killed him.<eos> Who prompted that conversation?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Did he show you the books and explain them, or did you find them?
He said he...wanted to understand what nearly killed him.<eos> Who prompted that conversation?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Did he show you the books and explain them, or did you find them?<eos> Oh, no, I found them and asked about it.
It's not a prank.<eos> OK. Then John has a new stalker.<eos> Let's go with that for now.<eos> News anchors are the most common of celebrity stalking cases.<eos> They're in everybody's living room, looking through the camera into the eyes of the people watching them.
Do not waste oxygen on riddles.<eos> I did find this under the bed.<eos> Your mother told the news dragon that your sister died with your father, in a ballooning accident, but some doubted elements of her story.<eos> What elements?<eos> She told them the reason bodies were never found because they landed in the mouth of a great white Rhinocodile, which chewed them so hard it caught fire, and then exploded, and the ash was sucked into the nose of a Hipposquito,
- Nobody does. - Mm-mm.<eos> - Fancy meeting you here, Dennah. - Oh!<eos> Say, are those perchance chocolates to bribe Kay, so she'll give you the plus-one?<eos> Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> I borrowed chocolates from Kay, and I'm just returning them.
But you're not a traitor.<eos> You're a voice of freedom, a light in the darkness, like my parents.<eos> Parents?<eos> No one has spoken against the Empire on Lothal since the Bridger transmissions.<eos> I remember them.
Do you have records of who contributed and how much?<eos> Not really. It was kind of a pass-the-hat thing.<eos> But I have copies of all the affidavits that people wrote for you.<eos> That should be close to a complete list of the people who donated.<eos> I have those files. I'll get them.
Hey, Walt, what's this gonna prove?<eos> Don't know yet.<eos> Yeah, I think you do.<eos> If you find the pellets, it just proves what we already know.<eos> If you don't find them, it just means that they're buried by mud or they were carried away by the stream or...
I did a nickel in Rawlins back in the '90s.<eos> Like to buy some oranges?<eos> I also got some buffalo jerky.<eos> Or maybe some dream catchers.<eos> The turistos love them.
What do the kids know?<eos> Nothing. We're keeping the information secret.<eos> I think we should isolate them in separate rooms.<eos> For their safety?<eos> To keep Drill from getting to them before we get to talk to them.
What are you doing in my car?<eos> I didn't have anywhere else to go.<eos> No where else but my car?<eos> Do you know how big the planet is?<eos> My friends, they all think my parents are adorable, and they think that I'm the bad guy for hating them, but I have a right to hate them, cuz I had to be there when they sucked.
All right, look. There's a bird's nest in the router.<eos> Now if you want to fire me, fire me.<eos> Either way, until those birds are gone nobody gets any closer.<eos> Well of course not.<eos> If you move them the mother won't come back.
It should be "forgive ourselves." You forgot his birthday, too, you know. Eh.<eos> Remembering birthdays is more of a mom thing.<eos> Really?<eos> Tell me what isn't a mom thing.<eos> I take care of them when they're sick, I drive them everywhere. I ask the parents with good cameras to take pictures of them at school events.
I think I can change the office.<eos> You know what, go ahead and shoot whatever you want.<eos> I can put defense attorneys in office who are hungry to put criminals away.<eos> I can go after the top crooks because I know who they are.<eos> Because you represented them.
Broham.<eos> -Broham.<eos> Toddler.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I want some deets, and I want them pronto, okay?
I'm so sorry! I...<eos> I can't feel my stem.<eos> Look, it was an accident!<eos> I never meant to...<eos> Just tell my cuttings I love them.
Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I got you.<eos> So, I'm doing this stint at Doctors Without Borders, setting up a small clinic in Kinshasa administering the MMR vaccine to children.<eos> Week three or so, the military decides we're infecting the kids, not inoculating them, shut us down,
Oprah calls that the "aha" moment.<eos> She does.<eos> Anyway, I remember reading a paper by Dr. Gilbert and his team over at Princess Margaret Hospital.<eos> Uh, they were harvesting these pieces of scapula.<eos> And using them to replace the hard palate after tumor removal, but we've never done that here before, and this tumor is big.
As of today, more than 10,000 doses have been manufactured and word has spread up and down the eastern seaboard.<eos> Every day, trucks and boats arrive in Baltimore to pick up new doses and distribute them to the populace.<eos> We are transporting 12 other doctors and scientists to the naval base in Norfolk, Virginia, where we hope to find pilots and planes and determine whether or not there are functioning labs to mass-produce the cure.<eos> I got the hard drives.<eos> Over here. C.O. wants them encrypted ASAP.
Got to give her credit, though, for hedging her bets.<eos> You know she represents the backup quarterback.<eos> Your check, Mr. Donovan.<eos> Children of the wealthy don't always have it as easy as you think.<eos> You making excuses for them?
And I keep thinking that maybe you feel something similar.<eos> And, uh, you're gonna say you don't. I know that, but I can't tell whether it's true or it's because you're keeping some stupid fucking boundary.<eos> - Boundaries aren't stupid.<eos> - Yes, they are.<eos> I hate them.
Well, do you want to go be with him?<eos> We can manage here without you.<eos> No, no, that's very nice of you, but... uh, she doesn't want me there.<eos> Yeah, the early years of a second marriage.<eos> I remember them well.
Goodnight.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> Brigham Young is here to get paid for services you contracted?<eos> Yes.<eos> And if he isn't satisfied, he's going to pull his workers and send them home?
And here it is!<eos> Turrón for everyone!<eos> This is to congratulate you for being such good students.<eos> You're giving the children candy?<eos> Oh! All that sugar is going to make them so agitated and jumpy and...
The Duchess!<eos> What is that?<eos> I call it...<eos> Sack-Puss.<eos> If villains enter the town on this side while I am on the other side, this will scare them away.
Once you've taken away all these traumatic memories, from this life and previous ones, then you are clear.<eos> Someone who had a perfect memory, who was never ill.<eos> Your eyesight would be better.<eos> We tested people before Scientology processing and after Scientology processing, and uniformly found that their IQ had raised.<eos> We are making such individuals, we're making them regularly, and we're making them routinely.
Now.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Been looking for you.<eos> Wanted to talk about them spikes.<eos> Heard you had them removed.
I think you should tell him, whatever you decide to do.<eos> Tell everyone dinner's ready.<eos> If you're all brothers and sisters, and you have the same dad, how come you all look so different?<eos> Our father, the man who made us, didn't think bodies were important.<eos> So he chose them at random.
- Yes, mother.<eos> You must be veil.<eos> Jade told me about your parents.<eos> They were good people.<eos> I'll do everything in my power to find the scum that killed them.
I picked you some flowers.<eos> I remember you like these.<eos> They're lupins.<eos> Hey, we used to run around the hills and pick them?<eos> Well, I... I was just gonna leave them for you.
Bob Paris is building a pool just like he said he would.<eos> You were there.<eos> It looks... looks pretty deep. Where...<eos> Where are the plans?<eos> Um, I don't have them, but I have a call in to Bob.
Now, I don't know what your plan is, but these cops are dangerous.<eos> Better watch your backs.<eos> They're not cops, Dad.<eos> They're criminals.<eos> And I'm gonna take them all down.
I've weakened these fanatics by isolating them, by turning their supporters against them.<eos> By terrorizing the citizens of Jerusalem.<eos> Well, there was a problem nobody seemed able to solve.<eos> Neither have you.<eos> They know you'll persecute them if they listen to the preachers in Jerusalem, so they're leaving the city to hear what they have to say.
And where are they now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> And Brad?<eos> I haven't seen him since last night.<eos> I'm hoping that he might be working them from inside.
- Does it make you feel any better?<eos> Does it make you feel any better figuring out who committed the murder?<eos> It's very satisfying using science to solve a mystery.<eos> I don't think that answers my question.<eos> Some cases are... so awful that I put them away.
He entered a tournament and won.<eos> And he won tournament after tournament.<eos> When was the last time you saw your husband?<eos> The first day of the tournament.<eos> Um, I brought him the divorce papers so he could sign them and embrace his new life.
Anything else interesting?<eos> So far, the conversations are what you'd expect.<eos> "How was your day? I miss you."<eos> This woman is really into kittens.<eos> - He tells her all the time how much he loves them.
Uh, we heard there were problems.<eos> Some hard feelings, maybe.<eos> Nothing that anyone would kill someone over. How do you know?<eos> Do you monitor every text between your employees and clients?<eos> No, but our Cyranos report any problems, and we deal with them. - Cyranos?
- Hey.<eos> Have you seen these two?<eos> - Excuse me. Okay, thanks.<eos> Seen either one of these two gentlemen here?<eos> - No, I haven't seen them.
I love you, too, Ma.<eos> There were five balloons of cocaine in Lianne Sampson's stomach.<eos> - So she was a mule? - Maybe.<eos> No room for "maybe."<eos> I took pictures of the balloons, and I had them blown up.
But Soran would have to navigate the Asteroid belts of Norox without a working Pernovian laser.<eos> [Whispers] Pernovian laser.<eos> - Is that you?<eos> - Uh-huh! I recorded the entire series on tape.<eos> I play them when my eyes are too tired from reading.
- Two minutes out, Major.<eos> - Too long.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> I've heard this speech before from your competitors.<eos> And now Hanka Robotics serves it with milky sake.
Listen, I can't tell you how grateful I am that you're going to all this trouble to help us out once again.<eos> Really, it is no trouble at all.<eos> Great. Well, same procedure as usual.<eos> Uh, the cash will spend the night in here.<eos> In the morning, we'll take it out, divvy it out to the other branches to be paid out to the farmers when they come to cash their checks.
A demonstration is required.<eos> It is difficult to kill that which does not truly live.<eos> My construct is not powered by science.<eos> It's powered by the mind.<eos> Alive because I will it into existence!
I sent it back to you already with my comments.<eos> You sent it back?<eos> I thought we were rolling out with it.<eos> You didn't incorporate any of their notes.<eos> If I sent it back as is, they'd never read anything of yours ever again.
- Quite so.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bad.. bad.. gotta..<eos> You see Evil is the shadow that exists just outside our world continuously searching for a way to come in for a way to become flesh and blood.<eos> Either.. we wait for that day to arrive or we can fight it on our own terms.
Good morning.<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> Hi. Mack, did you catch the game last night?<eos> Since when do i control the remote?<eos> I hear one day you get it back.
- What's done?<eos> - The card.<eos> Go ahead. Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.
Yes.<eos> Long overdue.<eos> We are city folks.<eos> Always wanted to do take a road trip, see the country.<eos> Meet the people in it.
And paths where you can walk and not get lost and...<eos> Trail markers made of crushed Natural Ice cans from frat bros.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is the best campsite around, okay, and nobody even knows about it.
Trail markers made of crushed Natural Ice cans from frat bros.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is the best campsite around, okay, and nobody even knows about it.<eos> How'd you know about it?
No, no, that smelly old box is where my robots used to be, and that scary statue is where I kept my comics.<eos> Well, I had to put one or two things down in the storage room, Dennis.<eos> You wanna move my Habitrail into the storage room?<eos> - Well, Dennis...<eos> - Anyway, I d-don't like this mirror. And I don't want it in this room.
I can't dump him in someone else's lap.<eos> I owe him. No else can pay my debt.<eos> Debt?<eos> What do you owe him?<eos> And Susan is handing me ice cream... and she's dropped a little and is slipping in it.
Here we are, in the dark and creepy Crooked Forest, in search of the mythical unicorn. For some reason.<eos> And here she is, the fearless unicorn hunter, seeking the...<eos> Edith, stop it!<eos> You're gonna scare away the unicorn!<eos> If somehow we actually find a unicorn, I'm gonna film it and get rich.
You're gonna scare away the unicorn!<eos> If somehow we actually find a unicorn, I'm gonna film it and get rich.<eos> Look over there!<eos> This is it!<eos> This is where we're gonna see it!
The car, the kid.<eos> Ancient history.<eos> Why are you still talking about it?<eos> What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?<eos> I can't stand it, never can.
Perfect.<eos> - Crafted, sculpted, with tools...<eos> - Unknown.<eos> Exactly.<eos> That's... that's why I wanted you to actually see it.
Well, then you shouldn't have sent Ty that picture of me.<eos> That's not exactly how it happened.<eos> I mean, he's a liar.<eos> - (HARPER) You punched his tooth out.<eos> - They put it back.
You don't like the way I'm running things?<eos> You know where the door is.<eos> You set this in motion when you put this place on the map.<eos> And I will not cut and run.<eos> I know an enemy when I see it.
Bitch, please!<eos> Slivko, get her out of there!<eos> You know it's the wrong thing to do, son.<eos> (SNIFFLES)<eos> Put it down, sir.
There's more out there.<eos> What do you mean, "more"?<eos> This world never belonged to us.<eos> It belonged to them.<eos> The question is how long before they take it back.
Patience?<eos> The motion sensor has activated.<eos> If any of us move, the grenade - will detonate.<eos> - How powerful?<eos> It'll certainly destroy this flat and kill anyone in it.
Go, go!<eos> Launch initiated.<eos> I'm launching my Forever Puppies, and there's nothing you can do about it!<eos> No!<eos> Baby Corp stole all the love from me... and now I'm going to take it back from them.
Mija. Mija, I don't think you understand this situation.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We are the ones who have Okja. Okay?<eos> We are doing you a favor.<eos> Do you get it now?
Yeah, have a seat.<eos> Now, we can all agree that this sentence,<eos> "this is a wall," is a truth claim.<eos> This wall is real.<eos> I see it, you see it.
I brush a few more.<eos> "Well, it's still a wall."<eos> But...<eos> What if I remove every single atom from this wall except for one?<eos> And you've seen me brush every single atom from this wall except for that one atom, and I point to it and I say,
I told Katie.<eos> I didn't want to.<eos> What can you do with cancer but cut it out?<eos> You have to stop it before it spreads and every cell dies.<eos> This could spread everywhere if we don't cut it out.
What kind of things?<eos> Are we on the right side of this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you know that some gang called the Yang Clan had a deal with Patel before we made that pier acquisition?<eos> Someone was using it. Who cares?
It's a unique force... used to protect K'un-Lun.<eos> It's passed down from generation to generation... and it's given to one student from the monastery to wield.<eos> Why were you chosen to get it?<eos> I wasn't chosen.<eos> I earned it.
She's keeping those people enslaved.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> The beggar.<eos> He said they leave for their evening meal around now, right?<eos> As soon as the building's empty, we'll sneak in and we'll burn it to the ground.
Protectors of K'un-Lun.<eos> It's not what I thought.<eos> It's not what any of us thought.<eos> But you have a duty now.<eos> And we'll face it together.
All right, all right.<eos> So, tell me about Dean's scope.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> I can see it at the base of the wall there.<eos> Why do you keep it?
She'll find her peace.<eos> I pray you find yours as well.<eos> You always liked this spot.<eos> It's a miracle... the fact that this park even exists.<eos> The fact that this city hasn't torn it down to put up high-rises.
- How come he can't be hurt?<eos> - What's the deal with that fist?<eos> - I earned it.<eos> - You what?<eos> He earned it.
Make a bold choice.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Sounds like my phone's blowing up.<eos> Can you hand it to me?
- Thank god you're here.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Honey, it's as bad as what daddy did.<eos> They're hurting the animals.<eos> All right, we got 90 days to get this horse tame enough that someone will buy it.
- One day. All right, well, good luck with that 'cause you got, like, ten minutes of clean water and then every slide's basically a urine delivery system.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We're not gonna get<eos> - drenched in piss.<eos> - No. We're gonna go in there, find our favorite ride, - bomb down it once,
- Everything is "Jerry" out of you mouth.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, uh,<eos> Ch-Charlie, I need a new keg. - This one's tapped, buddy.<eos> - Yeah, give me a second.<eos> Like, if Jerry jumped off a bridge would you jump off it, too? - Which bridge?
I love you so much.<eos> I love you.<eos> Hi! Well done, big brother!<eos> Ring! Show me the ring.<eos> Oh, we're gonna choose it together.
I am.<eos> I'm not the god of war, Diana.<eos> I am the God of truth.<eos> Mankind Stole this world from us.<eos> They ruined it, day by day.
No. If it crashes, it will wipe everyone out for 50 square miles.<eos> We gotta ground it!<eos> Bad news.<eos> It's on a timer.<eos> If we ground it here, it's the same thing.
This is the Dean of Specialized Studies,<eos> Dr. Campbell Grant, also known as Crazy Legs from our days on the lacrosse field.<eos> - Honored to meet you, Dean Grant.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> Cam, I asked Ezekiel here to bring his college essay with him so he could hand it to you personally.
Your hem?<eos> We're late to the potluck as it is, Ramon.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> Something's come up.<eos> Could you wrap this plate in some tin foil and I'll eat it when I come home?
Not yet in Hell?<eos> No, Ponta Delgada and the Azores.<eos> Similar.<eos> You should know the wound in the shoulder is no longer used by us as a signal.<eos> No, we change the codes when we think that perhaps the scum British have overtaken it.
Are you a good actress?<eos> Your father thought so.<eos> And was that before or after he lost his mind?<eos> Well, love is a kind of madness, isn't it, Mr Thoyt?<eos> Or have you never experienced it?
- Do you know what's inside it?<eos> - Aye.<eos> The truth.<eos> If it was up to me, I'd burn it.<eos> Less chance the river might bring it back.
Look...<eos> Go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.<eos> Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account... he will secure it and keep you safe.
- There she is.<eos> Give her to me.<eos> Very well.<eos> Your manager sold me the costume you wore when you played The Little Princess.<eos> You will wear it for me tonight.
It's time the leader of naked forest dancing gets her due.<eos> It's called "Crucible," based on Arthur Miller's play...<eos> So what happened with the dance?<eos> No, we...<eos> I actually never ended up doing it.
So, leave in five?<eos> You promised you'd help us.<eos> We still need to find the rift.<eos> I didn't promise I'd help you commit suicide.<eos> If you can't help, we can find it ourselves.
He could stop them.<eos> The Nazis lost the war.<eos> Why is he still obsessed?<eos> What does he want an army for?<eos> He doesn't want it for them.
You remembered Stiles and then a new rift was created.<eos> If the Sheriff can do it...<eos> Maybe we can.<eos> But that rift closed.<eos> Then we'll open it again.
Even successive strikes.<eos> Mason, are you sure this is gonna work?<eos> Well, whatever's inside this cage is shielded from any outside electrical current.<eos> So the Ghost Rider won't be able to use lightning to escape.<eos> We put a lightning rod on the roof and connected it to that conduit cable. Drawing the Ghost Rider to that spot.
A decision has been made.<eos> You are to be exiled from the Tribal Free Lands, never to return.<eos> I will take you to our border.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then you will step over it.
Lucas, stop!<eos> Stop it, Lucas!<eos> Stop!<eos> We'd have lived a year on what that dagger would have sold for.<eos> Why'd she have it?
We'd have lived a year on what that dagger would have sold for.<eos> Why'd she have it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She never told me anything.<eos> But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.
So...<eos> - I want you to drink her.<eos> - What?<eos> You want power, don't you?<eos> This is how you get it.
What is the crime?<eos> Well, from the way you disappeared, I thought you'd guessed.<eos> The menu, sir.<eos> Foul play.<eos> Isn't that what you call it over here?
Your brother had his corneas burned by radiation.<eos> Was he dying?<eos> So, you put him out of his misery.<eos> But why did you leave the pivot from your elbow behind?<eos> Erm, d-do you have it with you?
I still have to write my dad's name on the board.<eos> Well, you know, i said that, but everybody's board Is gonna be a little bit different.<eos> You have to write down both of your parents' names. I'll get in trouble if i don't.<eos> No, you won't get in trouble.<eos> I want you to put it down.
One of her friends makes mention of it on her Facebook page.<eos> She said, "Is this the shot you're going to use on your secret project?" question mark.<eos> "Is it sexy/slutty enough?" question mark.<eos> I mean, what kind of project is this, Nathan?<eos> Well, if it's a secret project, then that's probably why I don't know about it.
Ah, just there, please.<eos> What do we have here?<eos> I haven't seen chicken like this since before rationing.<eos> Lady Sahib, if the food is incorrect, we are very sorry.<eos> We will take it away.
What do we have here?<eos> I haven't seen chicken like this since before rationing.<eos> Lady Sahib, if the food is incorrect, we are very sorry.<eos> We will take it away.<eos> No, please, leave it.
For security.<eos> There's a Soviet empire.<eos> Stalin needs a warm-water eastern port.<eos> He's had his sights set on Karachi.<eos> He won't get it now.
- Yeah, I'll be okay.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I guess just read a book or something.<eos> So, calculus is the mathematics of change.<eos> It doesn't necessarily predict the future, but it does indicate it.
You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you enjoyed your entire lifetime.<eos> With your natural gifts and our determination we could both be part of something greater.<eos> Something perfect.<eos> The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.<eos> Our order has been developing it for many, many years ... and it wasn't until recently it was perfected ... by my own flesh and blood.
The hammer.<eos> The one I used to kill.<eos> It's dull now, but...<eos> The secret to keeping it clean is use.<eos> Yeah, blood feeds it, gives it shine.
Nina is like "Jeopardy" smart.<eos> They might offer Jordan the role of Ed.<eos> Bang me.<eos> Maybe he won't get it.<eos> We both know if Jordan wants it, he'll get it.
- What?<eos> - What?<eos> What?<eos> - You want some ice cream?<eos> Especially not if you're eating it.
Can't come between two sisters, right?<eos> Then yeah.<eos> I'd love to.<eos> - I guess I'm home then. - (chuckles)<eos> Plus, that apartment is Regina's, and I would feel bad taking it for us when Daphne has to pay for a place off campus.
It's three miles of torture.<eos> What part of that is fun?<eos> Calling it fun is Orwellian.<eos> And why do you care if I miss it?<eos> Who else is gonna call it Orwellian?
Uh-uh. No way.<eos> You've been late to practice twice this week.<eos> Now you miss most of first quarter?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't know I was going to be so late.<eos> Jess, look, you got a problem, come to me, we'll work it out.
You can freeze time when you want for as long as you want, but once you unfreeze everyone else, you're frozen three times as long.<eos> Okay, and you read this in a book?<eos> No, I made it up.<eos> For those real life situations where you wish you had a super power to get you out of?<eos> If you had a super power, what would you want to use it for?
It might.<eos> Yeah, I'll show you.<eos> All right, here's the first one.<eos> Cross it over your hand like that.<eos> Then you take the top loop, bring it down, up, and back through, then...
I'm not a farmer.<eos> I need some help here.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I saw a wild blueberry bush growing outside. If it's young enough,<eos> I'm gonna pull it up and replant it here.
The difference is that we don't have money or nice shit except a stroller.<eos> What other nice shit do we need?<eos> You're being a dick, and you're missing the point.<eos> Why don't you tell me the point?<eos> The point is that that is a $1,000 stroller, and we can't afford it, and so to have it feels fake to me.
You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal "in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."<eos> Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.<eos> Oh, I think you do.<eos> Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum...<eos> Shoney's. - ...or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.
W-where are you?<eos> On my work bench, Morty.<eos> Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?<eos> Flip the pickle over.<eos> What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.
You're gonna kill me.<eos> I have to go to Phoenix tomorrow morning.<eos> I'll be back Thursday night.<eos> But it's the play, and it's opening night.<eos> Well, I'll... I'll see it when I get back.
Nobody's buying any paintings.<eos> I don't mean "nobody," I mean you people.<eos> No family can buy art.<eos> I don't want any part of your pity ponchos or your pity purchases.<eos> If you love a piece, I will give it to you free of charge.
Grudges...<eos> But I don't want that anymore.<eos> So...<eos> I'm giving you the stamp.<eos> Well, you're not giving it to me.
- Officer Myerson.<eos> If you ever need any extra weekend work, you just give us a call.<eos> You got my card?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Hang onto it.
But the reason I wanted you to see this picture was that was the year that changed my life.<eos> When I was nine years old I wrote a paper in school about what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I said I wanted to be a janitor, because my father was a janitor at city hall.<eos> And I worshipped my father.<eos> I got an A+ on that paper.<eos> Brung it home all proud, but when I gave it to my father, he ripped it up right in front of me and said,
You could name a figure.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> I have absolutely no idea where it is.<eos> And even if I found it, I would never sell it to you.
All right, buddy.<eos> All right, let's get going.<eos> Sir, you left your backpack.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'd be out 50 grand if I left it.
I wanna pick up exactly where Anne left off.<eos> And here's your office.<eos> We'll have that swapped out this afternoon.<eos> You have a key to that?<eos> No, but I'll get Office Services to unlock it ASAP.
This is the greatest day of my life.<eos> Now, Keith, this is the golden rope to riches.<eos> Pernell, God has been trying his darndest to show you the path.<eos> But for some reason, you just won't listen.<eos> So we have gathered all of your friends and family, or what's left of them... to show you that, if you choose the wrong path, you will be walking it alone.
Well, I'm sure you do.<eos> Well, then I don't see how I can say no, as much as I would like to.<eos> Thank you very much. That's very gracious of you.<eos> What would you suggest I do with the check?<eos> You can send it to 6325 Quiet Oak Highway, Trumble, Connecticut, 06614.
I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You must be gratified.<eos> And you're disappointed.<eos> Just because I believe in the merits of the deal doesn't mean I'm any less concerned about Iran cheating on it.
Who knew I was coming to New York?<eos> No one.<eos> No one?<eos> Then who was aware of our meeting in the West Bank?<eos> The Israelis suspected it. But only one other person knew for sure.
I'm standing trial... for embezzlement from the company that I formed when I was 24.<eos> My family... no longer speaks to me.<eos> This morning I...<eos> I sat in a park... where I spent the better moments of my life... with my then-small half-Vietnamese son... and I watched a young boy... engineer and then single-handedly build a splendid sand castle.<eos> And then he rose and gleefully stomped it back once more simply into grains of sand.
I thought they had gone, you see?<eos> Gone with everyone else.<eos> I never even considered searching for them.<eos> If I had...<eos> I took the cross from the chapel and brought it out there...
Sorry.<eos> Just walk on down, come back through.<eos> - Enjoy your flight.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hey, give it back! - You can't take it, no.
You... you said that we needed to be in Miracle on the 14th.<eos> We will be.<eos> But there's a man, a very special man, and he's supposed to be here with us, but he's in Melbourne.<eos> And because of this unexpected event, he's stuck in Australia.<eos> God has placed an obstacle in our way, but He wants us to overcome it.
That took a long time, too.<eos> But I found him and I asked him to make another machine because he already knew how.<eos> And he asked me if I had come all that way, why in God's name did I wanna go back?<eos> And I told him it's because I didn't belong there.<eos> So, he built it.
Just someplace else.<eos> Am I supposed to take some kind of comfort in that?<eos> I'm told we have no leads.<eos> We don't know where the hell they are.<eos> All I'm hearing is that my wife is gonna die a terrible death and everyone's gonna see it.
And they are growing more and more skeptical by the day that you have anything in the way of a solution.<eos> My fear is it's worse than that.<eos> My fear is they will learn what your solution actually is.<eos> I know you intend to ransom away that slave woman to Captain Flint and his maroon allies in exchange for the pirates' cache of gems.<eos> As brazenly as you pursued this bargain, did you really believe that no one would find out about it, that I wouldn't find out?
Just for appearance?<eos> And you said no?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I remember when I first met Eleanor, how stunned I was.<eos> A woman who spoke the way she did, who had no fear of the world or the men who reigned over it.
Is that all right?<eos> We found him.<eos> I don't see the chest.<eos> Track marks go back 200 yards.<eos> He dragged it here.
First... he wants a meeting.<eos> - And I want it face...<eos> - He wants it face to face.<eos> Is that it?<eos> - He wants it without...
- And I want it face...<eos> - He wants it face to face.<eos> Is that it?<eos> - He wants it without...<eos> - I want it without old Milt here creeping around in my head.
That's why two billion dollars' worth of these babies are sold every year.<eos> Because they bring reassurance that when the time comes, you can step up.<eos> Some of you take them.<eos> A little blue steel is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> But if I threw this bottle into the audience right now, no one would grab it.
What are you talking about?<eos> My old roommate is planning to stage a hunger strike in front of the B.S.U.<eos> She shouldn't have to endanger her life to get justice.<eos> Well, of course not.<eos> This is the first I've heard of it.
I didn't see it like that, I promise.<eos> Because you were so stressed about the team and going to regionals!<eos> Travis, wait!<eos> You showed your tattoo to Travis?<eos> What did you do, wave it in his face?
- It's all right, Officer.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> May I have your scope?<eos> Scope on your gun.<eos> I promise I'll give it back.
- Guys.<eos> - Well, I'm stumped, Officer.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> If you Agatha Christie yourself to the bottom of this, you come back here and tell me who done it.<eos> Meanwhile, why don't you take that roach and shove it up your ass?
Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm involved in my own.<eos> And I would have mentioned it last night, but, you know, she has so much to lose, and I...<eos> Anyway, her phone is in my fuckin' car, all right?<eos> And if anyone finds it...
Bunch of military intelligence guys and then engineers?<eos> Some kind of coordinated terrorist attack, maybe.<eos> Turn here.<eos> I'm doing you a favor, you know.<eos> I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday.
Sold out?<eos> But there's clearly no one here.<eos> No vacancy.<eos> There aren't any motorcars parked outside.<eos> We got a dress code here, and she's breaking it.
Ah, the food is tremendous.<eos> Let's sit.<eos> - You familiar?<eos> - Word as bond?<eos> Uh, I assume the extra bits enchant the blade to kill me instantly in the event I break it, eh.
Well, I didn't mean right now, but, yes.<eos> Marn, call me back, okay?<eos> I have an actual problem about actual life.<eos> - Rice.<eos> - I know it's so traditional to throw rice, but I just don't think I want them throwing it, because then the pigeons eat it, and I hear they die, I don't want that
In our time, I was a freak.<eos> Today, I'm an amateur.<eos> Stop it, John, this instant.<eos> You know you can walk into a shop here and purchase a rifle or a revolver, and it's perfectly legal?<eos> These people encourage it.
Okay, lie down.<eos> He said you put the stethoscope under the beaker, and it amplifies the sound.<eos> Anything?<eos> Th-This is not the appropriate device. I-I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not processing with my usual...<eos> So you're saying you can't find it?
♪ Out the blue ♪<eos> Bones, you ready?<eos> Ah, come on. It'll be fine, huh?<eos> Come on. Look, they're just shutting this place down for a couple weeks, that's all.<eos> They'll clean it up, they'll get it back up on its feet, and it'll be better than ever.
Yeah. - He made it through the explosion. - Look at that.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's with the broken clock?<eos> That stopped when the bombs went off.<eos> When the lab reopens, I'm going to hang it in my new office, to remind me. Always.
Don't be so hard on yourself, Daisy.<eos> So far, your work here has been perfectly adequate.<eos> Adequate?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I'm capable of A-plus work. You've seen it.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> As an author, I can read my audience, and everything I need to know about my future as a voice actor was evident in Aubrey's demeanor today.<eos> Oh, that kid's got no poker face.<eos> Besides, someone else reminded me that my work has already touched many people, no matter how you read it.
Now I've upset you.<eos> Yes!<eos> Of course I'm upset. You had a significant procedure done without telling me.<eos> Hold on.<eos> A body was found. They're bringing it to the lab.
I think the word that you're looking for is badass, all right?<eos> This is a major sport,<eos> Bones. It's huge, and less face it, it's way more exciting than golf.<eos> I imagine the muscle groups used to swing an ax are the same as those used to swing a golfing stick.<eos> Four years of playing golf and you're still calling it a golfing stick.
Booth! Booth! Booth!<eos> Stop!<eos> No. Successful axmanship requires mathematic calculation.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> First, we find the radius of the log and divide it by 1.25. - Come on.
You don't buy a four-carat diamond for a friend.<eos> Four carats.<eos> That's a very expensive ring.<eos> You know if Helga actually got it?<eos> Well, good luck finding it if she did.
So speaking of secrets, I just met Tim Sullivan. Now, am I imagining things, or is there some kind of history there?<eos> Tell me everything.<eos> That was Clark.<eos> So the fragment found with the victim is... a piece of animal bone.<eos> Apparently she was wearing it.
What are you doing, man? Get your food off my car.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Nice set of tools, too.<eos> There blood on that wrench?<eos> Bro, I don't know who the hell you think you are, but if you don't pick that up, there's gonna be a hell of a lot more blood on this wrench. Put it down.
"A study on the skeletal effects of incredible physical strength."<eos> That's a great idea, Hodgins.<eos> Unfortunately, to write that paper, I would need Hulk's bones.<eos> And since the Hulk doesn't actually exist...<eos> Trust me, your dissertation committee, they're gonna eat it up.
And scared people will do things that you wouldn't believe.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Someone who has been doing this a lot longer than you,<eos> but also someone who recognizes raw talent when he sees it.
You're going to be safe 3,000 miles away.<eos> I'm here to guide you, not push, not prod, guide.<eos> We can't leave.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Someone who recognizes raw talent when he sees it.
And I'm going alone.<eos> I'm surprised you called me.<eos> Well, someone had to call someone.<eos> I need a tissue sample from a body.<eos> I was hoping you would go in there and get it for me.
Mostly.<eos> Mostly?<eos> Maybe you should just go see for yourself.<eos> That's not just a dead body.<eos> You felt it, too, didn't you?
-Yes, Dr. Hale, fix it.<eos> Uh... Well, we'd have to pull the intestine out, I think.<eos> Pull it-- Pull it out of his body?<eos> Yes, to find the cut and repair it.<eos> And then we-- we put it back in and close him up.
It's my turn.<eos> You didn't sleep either?<eos> No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screeching again.<eos> Well, did you hide it?<eos> If Caleb finds it..
What is it?<eos> It's you.<eos> You mean, you guys have been sitting on this...<eos> The game showed up a couple of days after the blind school.<eos> We've been hiding it at Spencer's.
Locker?<eos> Yeah, I thought-I thought that's what you said.<eos> Look, we've tried this a million times. When has it ever worked?<eos> It only has to work once.<eos> Hanna's gonna drop it off, so let's see who shows up to get it.
Ali's baby.<eos> No, no.<eos> No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.
It's eluding me.<eos> There's an even bigger code encrypted into the eyes.<eos> And what's it say?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> But with the amount of processing power I throw at it, we're gonna find out real soon.
- What narrative?<eos> - What narrative?<eos> - Susan... - No, this is the truth.<eos> - Jack didn't wanna have sex.<eos> - Well, he likes it with me just fine.
- What is...?<eos> What's that noise?<eos> You hear that?<eos> It's so weird.<eos> You know you want it.
Those two gallons of water I had you drink, we need you to sweat all of that out, and then we'll replenish your vitamin levels<eos> - to normalize your glucose readings.<eos> - Man, you really know your stuff.<eos> Ah, it's just basic human physiology.<eos> Today's about flushing your system, and tomorrow we build it back up.
There's no nutrients in it.<eos> It's excess calories.<eos> But, when you eat sugar, you don't get inflammation right away.<eos> When you eat sugar, you're not getting plaques forming in your vessels.<eos> When you're eating sugar, your body's gonna store most of it as glycogen or burn it as calories.
Alice reckons they're intimidating her into selling.<eos> We've got a suspected arson at Wyatt Farm over Easter.<eos> "Alice Wyatt accusing sister's boyfriend, Ryan Campbell."<eos> Sounds like we've got the Rangers' boat. A fishing trawler's found it.<eos> - They're bringing it in.
I saw what you're planning.<eos> Your mind must be more diseased than I thought. If you would risk the lives of everybody here, everybody... Just to destroy one man.<eos> The only life that matters now is Henry.<eos> And he will kill every last one of us to protect him.<eos> There's a devil infecting this man's brain, rotting it from the inside.
Yeah. Belonged to Grammie Davenport.<eos> She wrote her name in it.<eos> She was reading that to her schoolkids the year the Titanic went down.<eos> Damn.<eos> And Mom read it to me.
And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.<eos> Well, your garden is part of your backyard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn.<eos> It comes with the house, Mom.<eos> Well, I think you need to mention it by name in case some dirty judge decides to play tricks.
as our sisters secured the seats that gay men once held before our lives were ripped away.<eos> It happened before my package got there, when, um...<eos> A doctor in Texas told him to consider writing a will.<eos> He'd always said that when he started to get sick, he would end things himself.<eos> He didn't want me to see it...
Just whenever you want.<eos> I'm asking you to help call off demonstrations from our side.<eos> We need to show that we're mainstream now.<eos> Have you noticed there's corn syrup in everything?<eos> I avoid it by making my own formula.
- Laurel, we all feel bad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then think about what that means!<eos> And not just for you, but for Wes.<eos> Somebody killed him, burned his body, and misplaced it!
Previously on "How to Get Away with Murder"...<eos> Somebody killed him, burned his body, and misplaced it!
I don't know why you guys don't want to try my "stay positive" New Year's resolution.<eos> I'm telling you, it helps.<eos> Like, I don't see this glass as half empty, I see it as half full.<eos> But it's completely empty.<eos> But I see it as half full.
Well, go ahead. Have a sip.<eos> No, no, don't do that.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Besides, you're underage and you look like you might have the gene.<eos> I can feel it sometimes.
I hate to say it, but this file is full of dead ends.<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> There must be something.<eos> Look, I don't want Paul to have died in vain, but we need to look at this whole thing with new eyes.<eos> Read it for yourself.
Which friend?<eos> He's at Patrick's house.<eos> What happened to your grandmother's ring?<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> I took it off on the way over for safekeeping, 'cause I didn't want it to get stolen, then when I looked for it on the way back it was gone.
I can't do this again.<eos> You find a puppy crying on the road.<eos> - Do you A...<eos> - No!<eos> Stomp on it to shut it up?
Okay?<eos> Grace...<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Grace, what the hell are you doing?<eos> This was Karma's locket. She would have never taken it off.
I-I'm not smart enough.<eos> I'm not. I'm not smart enough.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slugger.<eos> All right, so plan B. If we have the controller, he can't hurt us.<eos> So we steal it from this dandy nutsack, shock him till he drops, and get the hell out of here.
- You don't know that, Clary.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Jace...<eos> Join me... And my son!<eos> Together, we can rid the world of the demons who plague it.
They control their urges.<eos> You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even...<eos> Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?<eos> No matter how good they try to be, Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.<eos> If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
Have you anything to say before we start?<eos> Facilis descensus Averno.<eos> "The descent into Hell is easy."<eos> I'm glad you believe in our sacred Clave motto.<eos> Alec and I use it to remind each other we can't be broken.
Is he okay?<eos> What happened?<eos> Someone has taken my spell book.<eos> You're putting your wards up?<eos> Nobody leaves until I get it back.
Hey... what's going on?<eos> Are you giving away free alcohol?<eos> Turns out some vampires got wind of a singer they're really into.<eos> See?<eos> Your vampire friends know a good thing when they see it.
- He knows, Ray.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, have you figured anything out?<eos> Well, I carbon dated the amulet that Sara - took from Darhk in 1987.<eos> - Before she gave it back to the Legion of Doom, I'm guessing.
Yeah.<eos> No, I'm still here.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not wearing this dress.<eos> But you were wearing it in the first part of the scene.
How are ya?<eos> - I almost died today.<eos> - What?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> A car hit my shopping cart while I was pushing it.
Bosch.<eos> Anita was just bringing me up to speed on the Holland case...<eos> All right, I have to tell you.<eos> After what happened today, I'm concerned. Don't be.<eos> And since you brought it up,
I think he pretty much lost touch with everyone.<eos> Did you see him often?<eos> First of the month.<eos> Pick up his check.<eos> That was the deal. I'd cash it for him, and that was that.
I like our marriage being... recognized by the federal government.<eos> I know we don't need anybody's permission to love one another, but you know what, it feels good to have the same rights as every straight couple.<eos> To be included.<eos> To be protected under the law.<eos> God knows that right might be taken away from us, but, man, as long as we have it, I want it.
- Mm-hmm. - And after one of the more awkward conversations I've ever had in my life...<eos> Jesus is now cleared to resume sexual activity with some limitations.<eos> Hey, well, thanks for the help, Doc.<eos> So... if we pass this along, does that mean we're condoning him having sex?<eos> Well, he's having it anyway.
The thing is he doesn't have a place to live, and if he doesn't take this job up north, he's gonna be living out of his car.<eos> I think he's depressed.<eos> Well, he could have just said that.<eos> He was hoping he could work something out.<eos> Anyway, he has a new number, and he wanted me to give it to you.
Um, black guy or Latino, uh, not very tall. Lots of tattoos.<eos> What do you want us to do?<eos> Should we give the phone to Cynthia?<eos> No no no, listen, I want you to call me on it, so that the number comes up on my phone.<eos> Then I want you to delete the call record and... and put it back, okay?
Military men tend to be creatures of habit.<eos> If Walker's using a burner, odds are it's the same model he used in the states.<eos> And the only one making calls to the Markovians.<eos> Walker's flip phone of choice is an old model.<eos> The only network here that supports it is Detralink DST.
Edlund lost his whole family.<eos> Online, Edlund was a pretty vocal proponent of the SCGR.<eos> Oh.<eos> What's that? It's the Star City gun registry.<eos> The previous city leadership shot it down.
The D.A. came to me, and...<eos> You're referring to Adrian Chase?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He instructed me to revise the report to indicate that the Throwing Star Killer was responsible.<eos> This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.
Ok. All right.<eos> Look.<eos> I appreciate what you're doing, but I'm fine.<eos> Mr. Mayor, all due respect, your head's bleeding, and our concussion protocol's even stricter than the NFL's.<eos> Well, I'm the mayor, so I'm suspending it.
I totally manifested that. What do you got?<eos> When my Sonic cry hit vigilante, it knocked off a small piece of his visor.<eos> Looks like it's lined with some kind of circuitry.<eos> Well, that means, it's manufactured.<eos> Maybe I can link it back to where he bought it from.
- Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> You mean, what do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.
Luckily, I got a chance to see the file they're working on.<eos> Orekhovo-zuyevo.<eos> It is a--a shipyard in Moscow.<eos> Then we go to the shipyard.<eos> We stop Kovar from retrieving it.
But first I have a gift for you.<eos> This tattoo of yours.<eos> To be an American and named a captain in the Bratva, you must have done something extraordinary.<eos> When you look at it, it must--it must remind you of such a victory.<eos> Now, when you look at it, you'll think about our time here together and the secret that you confessed to me.
See you later.<eos> Ah, pain.<eos> It's fascinating, isn't it?<eos> Some men will do anything to avoid it.<eos> Others will embrace it, even revel in it, like you.
How's chasing pigeons gonna help me with my training?<eos> You're not chasing them.<eos> You're tracking them.<eos> This lesson is all about focus. Now, activate your tracking rune.<eos> Now, track this egg back to the bird who laid it.
- about the Queen.<eos> - Well, if you've come to tell me that she made a deal with Valentine, I already know.<eos> Wait!<eos> Izzy has located the rift that the demons are coming from.<eos> Oh, and you want me to seal it.
- I don't know, Tony, you tell me.<eos> I'm... I'm worried about you.<eos> I'm worried you're getting sick again.<eos> I'm not getting sick again, Tony.<eos> Just cos I don't see the world exactly how you see it, how Elise sees it.
- So, that would be, what, 1958,'59?<eos> - Roughly.<eos> - Did Mr Walker give you the teacher's name?<eos> - No.<eos> Or if he did tell me, I don't remember it.
And I knew when I saw her sparkling like an unpolished diamond in this den of iniquity, that I had to free her from the cruel circumstances this heartless town had condemned her to.<eos> You are a good and godly man, Magistrate Hathorne.<eos> I am.<eos> Surely love is where we find it.<eos> And we have indeed found it.
Mary doesn't love you.<eos> Stop tormenting me, Mother!<eos> You and your sister made the same mistake.<eos> Inferior creatures mix their blood to strain out impurities. But Marburg blood is already purer than pure.<eos> Precisely because we never dilute it.
You made a terrible mistake.<eos> I really would have loved you forever.<eos> But you remained loyal to a man utterly unworthy of you.<eos> Did you ever consider what a future with John Alden held?<eos> I see it clearly.
Take it from me, a fool knows a foolish path, and you are set upon one.<eos> Let it go!<eos> And give up my kingdom on Earth?<eos> No.<eos> But I'd share it with you.
I don't know. Tell the bearded ladies I'm a-coming.<eos> And your editor called about the pages to your book. You're six months behind.<eos> You know what being an ex-president is like?<eos> It's like being a man's nipple.<eos> People go right by it to jerk off a dick.
Remember that?<eos> The whole reason that Gilfoyle and I stayed up for 48 fucking straight hours was to decrease server load, not keep it the same.<eos> Technically, the reason why we stayed up for two days was to maximize our ability to get a million users, and I just did that.<eos> Because who doesn't want 10 percent better image quality?<eos> Who doesn't want it?
Technically, the reason why we stayed up for two days was to maximize our ability to get a million users, and I just did that.<eos> Because who doesn't want 10 percent better image quality?<eos> Who doesn't want it?<eos> Everyone.<eos> Everyone doesn't want it!
Mom.<eos> You should really sleep, Sam.<eos> The dead don't.<eos> "Legends of the Long Night."<eos> The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
What's that, dear?<eos> When you're happy.<eos> And when you really have it, you know?<eos> I mean, and you stop to take a picture, And then you're more intent on taking the picture. Than you are knowing that you have it.<eos> Finally, for one moment, you have it.
Kevin, how's it going with your wife?<eos> Any chance I'm gonna see her at a meeting. One of these nights?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She still got me staying in a hotel. After nathan was born.<eos> And today, I found out he had a rash. And she didn't even tell me about it.
Can I be straight with you?<eos> Please.<eos> We wanted the bishop to do this wedding.<eos> He married my sister and her husband, and people still talk about that sermon.<eos> They're still quoting it on Facebook.
You questioned Sheriff Platt about a witness in the Joey Campbell case, and he notified the bosses.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> I was thinking he'd notify the bosses.<eos> I don't have the clout to bring the Joey Campbell case to them myself.<eos> So you got the sheriff to get it on the books.
I think about turning back, then my curiosity gets the better of me.<eos> So I go towards it, only the closer I get, the farther away it goes.<eos> Finally, I turned around and I'd wandered so far into the moors, that I can't find me way back.<eos> Three hours, I wandered in the dark, and not a thing familiar, but then I remembered what me gran told me about the leprechaun.<eos> So, I swallow my hunger and I take my bread, and I put it down on a mossy stone, and I lay down to sleep beside it.
An exaggeration.<eos> People love to invent scandal.<eos> But it was murder that sent you to Arkham, a prison for the criminally insane.<eos> I rescued the city from the madman, Theo Galavan.<eos> Some call it murder. Others a public service.
Yet each one failed.<eos> You must be the first person in history to go on a killing spree in order to find a life coach.<eos> Perhaps you should ditch the riddles.<eos> No.<eos> A good riddle reveals the asker. To solve it is to solve the mystery of the person posing it.
You hungry?<eos> You buying?<eos> Give it a whirl.<eos> That is the logo for my new club.<eos> What are we gonna call it?
Okay.<eos> So you failed. So nobody came to your opening.<eos> Don't end it like this.<eos> Greatness takes time... and you know this.<eos> If a string is in a knot, patience will untie it.
Iris, your mom, she left something behind.<eos> She left a brave, wonderful son and the woman that I love.<eos> All right?<eos> I don't know what the future holds, none of us do.<eos> I know that we will face it together.
Why'd you lure him here?<eos> For you.<eos> Need your help.<eos> Help?<eos> Got a funny way of asking for it.
Oh, um, I forgot.<eos> I have this dinner scheduled with the, uh president of Gold Brothers next week.<eos> Oh, hey, uh, did the three diamond bracelet ever come back from the jewelers?<eos> I should probably wear it to dinner.<eos> Um, yeah, no, I just checked on it the other day 'and he was still resizing it' but that was a few days ago, so I will check again.
Unless you felt sorry for me.<eos> I don't need your pity.<eos> I'm trying to help, Jake. I...<eos> And I don't need you to solve my problems.<eos> And, Paige, if I get this job, I'm taking it.
Jordan, you've lied to me.<eos> - 'Where are you?<eos> ' - Austin.<eos> 'And it's just an interview.'<eos> And, Paige, if I get this job, I'm taking it.
I mean to figure out how to get payback.<eos> And since our only weapon is currently traveling through Paris...<eos> - You mean the tuning fork?<eos> - Actually, it'sitctually called the staff of Arcadius.<eos> Cade's enemies forged it in the fire - that killed him.
Alive.<eos> But we're all out of options.<eos> There has to be a loophole.<eos> This is the loophole.<eos> I hate it, too, Bonnie.
What's it to you?<eos> Well, Matt here has been getting visions because of that journal; and you show up looking for it.<eos> Coincidence?<eos> I think not.<eos> So why don't you tell us the real reason you want it.
I think not.<eos> So why don't you tell us the real reason you want it.<eos> All right.<eos> I got about six hours and change until Cade takes Stefan's life, unless I give him that book.<eos> What's he want with it?
What's he want with it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if it saves my brother's life, I don't care.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You don't give the devil what he wants if you don't know why he wants it.
Winchester.<eos> My name... my name is...<eos> My...<eos> Gideon Loughlin's address was in his accountant's file.<eos> If the book is there, I'll find it.
No.<eos> There's a cure.<eos> There's always a cure, and we will find it. How?<eos> We trap Ramiel.<eos> And we beat his ass until he gives it up.
Everybody in the room was obviously focused on sending you back using Mother's spell.<eos> Everybody except yours truly.<eos> Rowena, now!<eos> I managed to pervert that spell.<eos> So your essence wasn't sent back to the cage, but instead, we found your discarded vessel a few years ago... repaired it, improved it, making it a fitting final home for the real you.
The panel?<eos> Is it dead? - Yeah.<eos> Has been for a long time. - What?<eos> It was a ghost.<eos> The rock salt only slowed it down.
See, I didn't choose this place for its ambiance.<eos> Obviously.<eos> This?<eos> It's a fortress.<eos> No one gets in here without me knowing about it.
Dean... The grace extraction.<eos> The tracking spell was a bust, right?<eos> But... but the extraction ritual worked.<eos> So?<eos> So what if Cass used it on Kelly's kid?
I gotta say, a, hole in reality to a bombed out apocalypse world?<eos> I'm gonna go with 11.<eos> Sounds right.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> The child, he opened this door. He'll close it.
Listen, I was wondering - um, if I popped over, maybe in the next half-hour, would that be alright?<eos> I just need to borrow the old laptop.<eos> What for?<eos> Well, it's got some files on it I need for school.<eos> I'll get it back to you later tonight.
Who are the flowers from, Trish?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They were left on the front doorstep.<eos> There's a card.<eos> - Do you mind if we take it?
- Show me your phone, Mark.<eos> - Why?<eos> Just... do it.<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> You record me, give it to the police as new evidence. What else have you got in your pockets?
- She's booked on a train. She wants to go.<eos> I've asked her not to. I've begged her not to.<eos> She said she'd sleep on it. She's gonna call me at work and let me know.<eos> You know what I'd do?<eos> I'd tear her ticket up, put it in my pocket, go to work, done!
Overcrowded with my people.<eos> I'm trying to change that.<eos> My education initiative is the first step in breaking that cycle.<eos> You cannot dismiss that.<eos> I'm not dismissing it.
Way, way worse.<eos> Whoever "they" are.<eos> Nothing seems to be missing, though.<eos> Looks like you got here just after them.<eos> He was after Jesse's phone and the video on it.
What?<eos> I just wish that she'd just stop trying to make me her do-over with Joey.<eos> Hey, Boogs.<eos> I'm wearing your bracelet.<eos> I never take it off.
- I lost her. - What?<eos> Breeland made a report.<eos> Assaulting an officer, drunk driving.<eos> - Did you? - No, it doesn't matter.<eos> He's gonna send it to the judge and it's over.
Mr. Leonard.<eos> Did you know "Wright" comes from the Old English?<eos> - It means "shaper of wood."<eos> - Huh. And here I was thinking it meant "adulterer."<eos> Well, it intrigues me you never knew the meaning of your last name, considering you picked it.
This is scarlett o'connor peabody, ladies, Reminding you-all to mind your manners. And always speak your mind.<eos> You certainly have a beautiful voice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> At ease, dodo.<eos> Well, job is yours if you want it.
Mr. Dean's brother owns Smokey Joe's out on Highway Nine, Daddy.<eos> Yeah, I never much cared too much for that place.<eos> Is that so?<eos> You know, the folks at The Commercial Appeal might beg to differ.<eos> Paper named it top barbecue six years running.
Yeah, uh, I'm an idiot. I...<eos> I left my wallet on the night stand at the hotel.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Just call someone and have them run it over.
- Can you talk?<eos> I can.<eos> Thanks for getting my phone back to me, though I wish you'd done it in person.<eos> Didn't think that'd be too smart.<eos> Anybody at the station see you with it?
But, actually, it's not my birthday.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> My birthday calendar reminders are flawless. Okay, it was.<eos> It's just not anymore.<eos> I don't feel like having a birthday, so I'm skipping it. Oh.
I needed to check with Dr. Hamza to confirm.<eos> Leo, you have neurocysticercosis.<eos> A parasitic worm has found its way into your brain.<eos> It's relatively safe while it's still alive, but if it dies, it can be quite serious, so we do need to move quickly.<eos> It's likely you had it before you went to Malawi.
You know why they really broke up?<eos> Well, it wasn't his performance in bed.<eos> It was his performance onstage.<eos> God, was Gary a stiff.<eos> Just when Bette realized her marriage was about to close, she took it on the road.
"Joan Crawford's Early, Tawdry Years."<eos> And it's been locked away in my desk drawer since 1946, the last time you went to Louella behind my back.<eos> Oh, I told you then, Hedda, I didn't go to Louella about my divorce from Philip.<eos> No, she came to me.<eos> And you confirmed it.
Seriously?<eos> Let's just call it the fallacy of sunk costs.<eos> So what now?<eos> Now?<eos> Now we, uh, take that PPD, and we shove it right up Chuck's ass.
Because this is a lot to ask.<eos> And if you're not up to it -- just throwing this out there -- maybe you don't need to testify at all.<eos> No, I do.<eos> I'm the only person who can adequately explain the context of that tape.<eos> Otherwise, the defense'll tear it to shreds.
No. That's me on the tape.<eos> But, still, i have some questions.<eos> Like, the recorder, it must've hurt like hell for you to touch that.<eos> There was a degree of discomfort, that's true.<eos> And where did you hide it?
Every one of them came here gladly in support of their lawyer.<eos> Jimmy McGill reached out to people who otherwise may never have seen an attorney in their entire lives.<eos> He took the time to make sure they had wills that accurately reflected their wishes, for a price they could afford, because Jimmy McGill cares about people.<eos> He's devoted the past three years of his life to his brother's welfare.<eos> Waking at 5:00 in the morning to buy Charles' favorite newspaper from the single newsstand in the city that carries it.
Let us do something.<eos> Just point and tell us what to do.<eos> All right, uh... how about you dump one of those packs into the wheelbarrow?<eos> And you... you fill that bucket up to the brim with water.<eos> And then you dump it in, little by little, while he stirs it with a hoe.
And after that, every day after school, I'm checking the till.<eos> You know, something catches my eye, I stick it in the box, put it up there for good luck.<eos> So much for good luck.<eos> It was a cryin' shame they lost this place.<eos> They never shoulda bought it in the first place.
But not now.<eos> Baby Jane was my last chance.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> I read a beautiful script today with a wonderful role for you.<eos> Pauline dropped it off at the house.
I hear a heart attack coming on.<eos> Zack Thomas is intent on recouping his $100,000 from Joe Jarrett.<eos> That is the picture.<eos> Now, if every time we see Zack, he's getting a foot rub, how's the audience gonna understand his ambition?<eos> People know what I want, and they know I don't sweat getting it.
Really?<eos> I want a big signing bonus.<eos> Jack Warner cooked the books on Baby Jane.<eos> I want my payday up front.<eos> Every time I agree to a back end, that's exactly where I end up getting it.
This is the point of divergence. And this ice pick... is an agent of change.<eos> You gonna read her tarot cards next?<eos> Do you have, like, a little crystal ball or something?<eos> Well, it depends on how she answers the question.<eos> Now, if I use it right here, you'll never walk without a cane.
Do you have, like, a little crystal ball or something?<eos> Well, it depends on how she answers the question.<eos> Now, if I use it right here, you'll never walk without a cane.<eos> But I use it here, you won't be able to walk at all.<eos> And if I use it right here...
Well, I should real-- wait.<eos> Come on. Have breakfast with me.<eos> That's-- thank you, but I should go.<eos> But, uh, did Scottie give you my number?<eos> Yes, she gave it to me.
I wish everyone was.<eos> I genuinely regret having to resort to such extreme measures.<eos> You can't take the company back by force.<eos> You need our consent.<eos> And if I don't get it, I'm prepared to walk away... after you hear what Dr. Whitehall has to say.
Okay, I'll bite.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> - You're not gonna kill him.<eos> I already gave the order.<eos> And now you're gonna rescind it.
Whoa.<eos> What is that noise?<eos> It sounds like a saw cutting through bone.<eos> Yep.<eos> You get used to it. I... I don't even hear it anymore!
That maybe that victory, no matter how small, was freedom.<eos> I was soon reminded... and I constantly would be... that there ain't no such thing as triumph under the conditions of slavery.<eos> Just respite.<eos> Black folk, we know pain.<eos> Known it a long time.
That freedom fire, that ain't somethin' that can be stoked in someone else.<eos> And embers ain't enough.<eos> I seen a wildfire once when I was younger.<eos> I stood right at the edge of it with my daddy.<eos> I stared at it for a long time, and still I barely got the words to describe it.
I been thinking a lot on forgiveness lately.<eos> And I figure, saying you forgive somebody is just admitting you ain't got no power against they wrongs.<eos> That you can't do nothing but give in, forget, or maybe even kill yourself.<eos> But I got power now, and I do not forgive.<eos> You knew I wanted it.
This cabin backed up to the river.<eos> Only way in, we can see out them windows.<eos> And there's a little boat tied off just down the way, - we need to run.<eos> - Harriet help me make the plan back.<eos> We follow it, we all gonna make it out of here.
Jason and Cheryl Blossom drove out to Sweetwater River for an early morning boat ride.<eos> Are you scared, Jason?<eos> The next thing we know happened for sure is that Dilton Doiley, who was leading Riverdale's Boy Scout Troop on a bird watching expedition, came upon Cheryl by the river's edge.<eos> Jason...<eos> Riverdale Police dragged Sweetwater River for Jason's body, but never found it.
- This is Jason's number.<eos> - It's yours now.<eos> Usually, sophomores, they only play JV.<eos> This year, we've got an open spot in varsity.<eos> From what you've been showing us, well, I want you to fill it.
- God bless.<eos> - Wearing what?<eos> The ring, Polly.<eos> That ring has been in the Blossom family for generations.<eos> You keep it close to your heart, always.
- What do you mean?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Just that I had a few words with our director/host, and reminded him that he's heard you sing on numerous occasions.<eos> Even though it compromises my artistic integrity.<eos> Cutting to the chase, you have a slot if you want it.
Sometimes we have to do what's necessary - No matter the conequences.<eos> - Don't you dare.<eos> That is what I am doing, Olivia...<eos> My job. I am protecting this office.<eos> No, you're destroying it.
And then you found this.<eos> Your mom's earring?<eos> No, Em.<eos> It's your mom's earring.<eos> Norma kept it.
Have you noticed anything strange about Jules?<eos> Now that you mention it, she does always sneeze in threes.<eos> No.<eos> You know how I've been working on the article about the attacks?<eos> Yeah, you only mention it every 12 seconds.
They... they let him go.<eos> - Yeah. - So your article says...<eos> There's a vigilante on campus.<eos> So dope.<eos> I can't wait for you to read it.
Chin up.<eos> You're in Montgomery, Zelda.<eos> You're at a dance at the country club.<eos> You bought that dress special for that occasion.<eos> And, even if your mama doesn't, you know the boys will love it.
Did I tell you he wears a bonnet?<eos> - I'm gonna go watch TV.<eos> - It's...<eos> See, he's getting to you just like he's getting to me.<eos> It just doesn't fit in this office, and I know how much you love it.
Uh, see?<eos> It's a priceless family heirloom.<eos> He didn't buy you a ring?<eos> Yeah, he did buy it for me; he bought it back from the pawn shop that I sold it to, which is so sweet, 'cause he knew how much it meant to me.<eos> Well, I mean, if it meant that much to you, you probably wouldn't have pawned it.
Jerrod, look at your skin.<eos> You should be furious right now.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Damn, that bread looks warm.<eos> You think they made it in-house?
You should be furious right now.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Damn, that bread looks warm.<eos> You think they made it in-house?<eos> Of course they made it in-house.
Nonsensicality? Pray, what is that?<eos> The prating nonsense of a tavern rat.<eos> Thy hair is wild, but thy wit is tame.<eos> Lame as an old nag, thou rides it for shame!<eos> Thy wit is so stale, worms would not eat it.
No!<eos> That is some hippie dippy bull-crap right there.<eos> - What?<eos> - The paperweight.<eos> My father-in-law gave it to me for Christmas.
I shouldn't have let her eat the whole cake!<eos> Can you hang on just one second?<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> - Ravenous!<eos> What if instead of doing it on the show, we did it on Snapchat?
And then we do the banter and we're out.<eos> - Good rehearsal, everybody.<eos> - Whoa, whoa. Really appreciate you giving this whole banter thing a go.<eos> Well, I'm a team player.<eos> But would you mind rehearsing it just once?
And of course, not only your outfit for coming home, but also baby's travelling outfit.<eos> Do we have any seamstresses or tailors in our ranks today?<eos> I'm a seamstress.<eos> I make all my clothes, and my husband's.<eos> Well, I'm no expert in the world of couture, seeing as I wear my uniform most days, but am I right that the correct outfit is as important as the event one is wearing it to?
Meet your little girl.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I longed for this baby, Patrick.<eos> Longed for it, prayed for it.<eos> And now I'm wondering why my prayers were answered because I don't know what sort of a world we're bringing it into.
This is fascinating.<eos> You know who built this canal?<eos> - No.<eos> - Napoleon.<eos> In 1802... he built it to bring clean water to the city 'cause they had an outbreak of cholera.
Centuries of peace and prosperity with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.<eos> I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.<eos> Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.<eos> Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.<eos> Together, we will save this country from those who would destroy it.
This same mob spat at my sister not long ago.<eos> And if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.<eos> Or yours.<eos> They just like severed heads, really.<eos> Listen, if you have any advice at all, I would love to hear it.
Golden roses, indeed.<eos> Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.<eos> The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.<eos> Well, it is to me, but my fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.<eos> So you just let them take it?
Ah, stranger things have happened.<eos> Like what?<eos> The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.<eos> - The current harvest?<eos> - We have teams of men collecting it from all the farms in the Reach.
That I've come to destroy your cities, burn down your homes, murder you, and orphan your children.<eos> That's Cersei Lannister, not me.<eos> I'm not here to murder, and all I want to destroy is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.<eos> I offer you a choice... bend the knee and join me.<eos> Together, we will leave the world a better place than we found it.
My lady.<eos> Last time I was here, I killed my father with a crossbow.<eos> Last time I was here, you killed my son with wildfire.<eos> There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.<eos> The guards hardly ever patrol it.
- What? Since when does my mom hang out with your stepdad?<eos> Something's amiss.<eos> I hereby call to order this meeting of the shadow wedding planners.<eos> As you all know, it is our sworn duty to secretly control every aspect of this wedding.<eos> Together, we will transform it from a young cool person's thing into a normal traditional wedding, where everything is normal and nice.
My grandpa told me about it when I was a boy.<eos> He was from the old country.<eos> Brought some of those old ideas with him.<eos> Back then they didn't fear the unknown.<eos> They stared into it.
Their patience, their ardent belief in our Lord has not gone unrecognized.<eos> But the question remains...<eos> But the question remains, even with the gift of a second chance...<eos> When the hell did you buy a phone?<eos> Just... just turn it off.
You are definitely taller.<eos> I have a tall girl!<eos> Oh, right there.<eos> The door was unlocked.<eos> Spent an entire weekend installing that double cylinder, but if you don't actually lock it...
You know, our moms talked less and less as the years went on.<eos> But, um, there was one night I'll never forget.<eos> Your mom called my mom the night you were born.<eos> And they talked for a little while, and then, uh, when my mom hung up, she was... she was so happy.<eos> She dug out this, uh... this cupcake. It must have been a week old, and, uh, she... she looked for a candle, she couldn't find one, so she got a match, and she stuck it in.
I spoke with the studio manager.<eos> If you want your internship back, You're gonna have to apologize to ashley.<eos> For what?<eos> Being honest? If you want the job back, that's what you have to do.<eos> You don't want it back, fine.
It's not exactly without gravity.<eos> You're thinking of a device that redistributes weight.<eos> I don't care!<eos> Just get me in one!<eos> I mean, I would appreciate if I could try it out.
No.<eos> It won't bite you.<eos> It already did.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> I say it again.
Yeah, that.<eos> I don't even see what that has to do with anything.<eos> Look, the fact that you can't see what I'm talking about, that's a part of the problem.<eos> Clay, I'm not saying it's not real.<eos> I'm just saying people do it every day.
You all right?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Why would you tell him about our personal business?<eos> He just asked if we were dating, and I said it's complicated.<eos> Gunnar, I've made my peace with the past, but it doesn't mean I want other people knowing about it.
And I have to deal with that every day of my life.<eos> And then sometimes it gets to me, and I overcompensate with my husband. And in my business, and I say things to my daughters that I know deep down are just gonna make 'em want to run away from me. But it's like I can't help it.<eos> 'Cause that horror, it's just right there at the surface.<eos> And I don't want them to feel that.<eos> And I don't want them to think I'm feeling it.
What does that mean, exactly?<eos> Well, for Maddie, I was thinking a midnight release.<eos> No press, no announcements.<eos> No begging some reporter at Slate to give us a mention under the fold.<eos> No, no, no, we release it ourselves, we get all the influencers we know to talk about this amazing song they just heard and in the morning, everyone comes to us, man.
- Yeah, I do. That's why I'm happy to do it, all right?<eos> But we were hoping to have your auction item in by now.<eos> Kristi, I'm sorry.<eos> It just completely slipped my mind.<eos> Because normally we put it in the program and...
No.<eos> Come on. You got to know another way out of this bloc.<eos> We could use a coyote.<eos> You know one?<eos> One. But you're not gonna like it.
Goodbye.<eos> Robert?<eos> Yes?<eos> Why don't you take that Kindle thing with you.<eos> I'm never going to use it.
Vanessa says Jake's been out every night since election night.<eos> If we can figure out where he was going, maybe we can start to try to put the pieces together.<eos> The day Jenny was killed, I picked up the signal of a satellite phone near her cabin.<eos> She's around here somewhere.<eos> She actually bought a satellite phone, and she's using it.
Can we not get dramatic in public, please?<eos> We wouldn't have to get dramatic if you would just listen to me.<eos> Here we go.<eos> From where you'll be standing, there is no place for others, for love.<eos> It's easy to say before you have power, but then you have it.
Why?<eos> Now.<eos> All satellite maps to the island are blurred, but Susan's compound is down here, boathouse,<eos> here, and the village is up here somewhere.<eos> They call it "Revival", but that's all I know.
- That's not a meme.<eos> - It has meme font.<eos> - How is that not a meme?<eos> - It just isn't. Well, then what the hell is a meme?<eos> You... you just know it when you see it!
Act surprised at her show, okay?<eos> Amy! It's risotto time!<eos> Come on.<eos> I need to find a replacement to write under the Belinda Lacroix moniker.<eos> My authors wouldn't go near it.
- Aah!<eos> - Oh, my God, hi.<eos> - What's this?<eos> Nothing. It's my stupid bullet journal.<eos> I don't know. Audrey Gelman was doing it.
Why?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I love my job.<eos> And I could lose it.<eos> You're not gonna lose it.
War tends to put things into perspective.<eos> So, how are you finding your new position?<eos> It's a challenge, but I feel I'm starting to get to grips with it.<eos> Of course, you're totally unsuited to the job.<eos> I don't say it to be cruel.
Room service, sir.<eos> I didn't order anything.<eos> It's from Adil, Mr. Joshi.<eos> He knew you were working and thought some coffee might be of use.<eos> Do you want me to take it back down, Mr. Hamilton?
It's work.<eos> But I thought they'd cleared you of any wrongdoing.<eos> They've allowed me to continue, but they're watching me very closely.<eos> Will you smile, please?<eos> You have a lovely smile and I never see it any more.
No, it's so Delaware.<eos> - And, yeah, of course.<eos> - Denise!<eos> Jane, this piece was your idea.<eos> I didn't even wanna do it.
- Me? Large.<eos> Hey, do you know how they remove a cancerous testicle?<eos> No.<eos> A lot of people think that they just slice one off, right?<eos> What they really do is they make an incision just a little bit further up, and they go in and they grab the testicle, and they pull it out of the scrotum and out through the body.
- I want to make a deal.<eos> No, guys, she... she's not sane.<eos> One small consolation is the bitch is with The Beast right now and I can't really see that going her way.<eos> Word as bond.<eos> I assume the extra bits enchant the blade to kill me instantly in the event I break it.
Purple Orchid, purple dress, purple vibrator.<eos> We're purple people.<eos> Okay, I love your product.<eos> I mean, I love your product.<eos> Yeah, everybody who tries it does.
Even a friendly one, afraid that if we disobey, we will have our air cut off, our water rationed, be spaced, or be herded into chambers to be used like animals.<eos> This is the way it has been until now.<eos> No more.<eos> I have stolen your secret, Fred Johnson.<eos> And I am giving it to the Belt.

When is your second interview?<eos> Mindy? Mindy?<eos> Mindy, are you still there?<eos> I actually haven't checked because I don't even want the job anymore because my life is so perfect.<eos> I hope someone else gets it, actually. #blessed.
Your commitment to diversity is really impressive, which is exactly what we need around here.<eos> Congratulations, you got the job.<eos> How dare you?<eos> Stop trying to give this job to a white man.<eos> Dr. Lee deserves it.
I mean, look at these pictures.<eos> It's like the cast of a Clint Eastwood movie.<eos> Damn, dog, Jody was right.<eos> His picture would look great up there.<eos> Listen, Mike, you were our top choice, but if you don't want the job then we'll give it to Dr. Ledreau.
The verfluchte zwillingsschwester.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I'm with the kids.<eos> No, um...<eos> Eve is gonna do it for me.
Not as long as you help us.<eos> So how long have you had this mirror?<eos> Forever.<eos> It was my mom's.<eos> I remember my dad brought it here to the shop for me to play with when my mom was in the hospital.
No, no, nyah!<eos> Let me handle it.<eos> I just... I don't want to destroy it until we know what happened.<eos> Well, that's fine.<eos> Let's just put it somewhere where nobody can look at it till we know what the hell is going on with it.
"Humano-Reptiliana:<eos> Pathology, Diagnosis, and Treatment."<eos> Aw, yeah, Vle Di Bouyi.<eos> Oh, it smells terrible, and it's really only harmful to Wesen with scales.<eos> Grimms in the South used to use it to lure out Galenchidas from the swampy marshes, and catch them and chop off their heads.
- Hey.<eos> We just got back from the M.E.'s.<eos> We got a dead body full of an enzyme called hyaluronidase.<eos> It's something found in bug saliva.<eos> Hoping you might know of a Wesen that uses it to kill its victims.
This will.<eos> Okay.<eos> The knife has to go through all of our hands together.<eos> Then what?<eos> Then we pull it out, and all of our blood flows together into the bowl.
Or very angry.<eos> Maybe both.<eos> The pain would've been unbearable.<eos> And there's these weird. Post-mortem indentations on her arm.<eos> See these marks running across it?
I don't believe she's overly keen, but Mama said it's a great match, so I expect she'll come around soon enough.<eos> You've been a great friend to me, Drake, so I've brought you a gift.<eos> No, Master Geoffrey, 'tis enough to have had your friendship.<eos> You can open it later if you'd rather.<eos> I'll be offended if you don't take it.
I do not endorse bloodshed and lawlessness.<eos> But liberty, equality, fraternity -- these I can put my name to.<eos> Well, I have no intention of so doing.<eos> No, power must exist -- someone must possess it, and since man is not perfect, sometimes it is misused, but who is more likely to misuse it?<eos> The man who newly finds it in his grasp, like one who has never before tasted liquor?
Is that it, Dean?<eos> When Gavin Jacobs had his throat cut with a box cutter, your laptop was out on his desk.<eos> And whoever grabbed it, they didn't dump it in the bathtub with the other computer stuff.<eos> No, not your laptop.<eos> They walked away with it.
Who wants me, Nance?<eos> Who have you offended?<eos> Whose name is on my warrant?<eos> Look what came to the door, Ma.<eos> I would have sent it away, but it has some rather unusual curves.
Mrs. Wells has me on my back morning, noon, and night and I know I can do better.<eos> Presumably Wells owns the dress you're standing in.<eos> What's your debt to her?<eos> Don't know, maybe five pounds?<eos> As an act of benevolence, I'll settle it.
Yeah, you like that.<eos> She loves scott joplin.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Look, I get you have a job to do.<eos> Just don't do it today, okay?
I got a few things I got to take care of at work.<eos> Oh, come on, Harvey, you're not leaving because of work.<eos> It's time to let things go.<eos> I complained about the heat not working a million times.<eos> Landlord always says he's gonna fix it, and then nothing happens.
There has to be something bigger I can do than holding the door and waving.<eos> There's no way every Walmart greeter is in the Good Place.<eos> Wal... mart?<eos> It's a place regular people go.<eos> - You haven't heard of it.
You can't... this whole story... lots of people have these kinds of clothes. Come on.<eos> You said I had the right to remain silent.<eos> Do I have to even answer any of these questions?<eos> But you do need to give us your phone.<eos> Put it on the table.
You said I had the right to remain silent.<eos> Do I have to even answer any of these questions?<eos> But you do need to give us your phone.<eos> Put it on the table.<eos> Open it up, please, right now.
Get out of here, ya freaks.<eos> You don't know what you're missing out on.<eos> That suit was so formfitting.<eos> Be bloody hard to get out off, I'd imagine, huh?<eos> Unless he never takes it off.
Oh, the woman walking on the overpass.<eos> Apparently she was really lucky not to get hit.<eos> And the baby?<eos> She lost it?<eos> - Did they find it?
You guys!<eos> - You made a lot of friends, huh?<eos> - I heard you guys were dead.<eos> So I threw this massive rager in your honor.<eos> - The fact that you just called it a rager sickens me.
Bring the dogs in here.<eos> They'll kill themselves.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Office space!<eos> When do I want it?
When they ask you to put in the year that you were born,<eos> - all you have to do is...<eos> - Okay.<eos> You talk too much, like woman.<eos> Don't love the stereotype, but I'll take it.
My apartment is too crowded.<eos> With no room for new inventory, these awesome graphs I made will start going in the opposite direction.<eos> For your perusal.<eos> Now, I have a lead on a new office space and enough cash to put down months of rent up front.<eos> The jerk-off landlord won't rent it to me without a cosigner.
I know.<eos> You took a payout and you signed a non-disclosure agreement.<eos> That's got nothing to do with it.<eos> They made us all sign those things.<eos> If any one of us breaks it, it negates them all.
What's with the boxes, Louis?<eos> This is everything the firm has ever done for Couture Apparel.<eos> You're taking us to your annual meeting?<eos> I'm not just taking you.<eos> We're running it together.
And James Palmer's gonna fight each one of them. Which means this thing is gonna drag on forever.<eos> And we're gonna drop the hammer on him as soon as he gets to Harvey's.<eos> Now I don't wanna see you again until I meet you for the first time at that hearing.<eos> Don't you walk away from me.<eos> I hired Harvey to do a job, he farmed it out to you against my will and you're gonna God damn listen to me.
Well, since this is a murder, why don't we ask chief howard?<eos> You are gonna have to think up a new tactic pretty soon, Because any day now, that "let's ask chief howard".<eos> Is just gonna be a thing of the past.<eos> Well, while we are still in the present...<eos> If major crimes insists on special treatment, Of course, you will get it.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.<eos> We need to wrap him up in something that doesn't leak.<eos> We're gonna have to get him to the car in something that doesn't look suspicious.<eos> With a body in it, that trunk is going to be heavy.<eos> Then we won't carry it.
A telephone.<eos> This looks like a 1970s telephone to you?<eos> My God.<eos> I remember when phones were attached to the wall.<eos> They had this little, round dial, you'd put your finger in and turn it.
Earned a Silver Star."<eos> So a local girl makes good, and this is her "welcome home" present.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> So there's our blunt force object.<eos> CSU's running it, seeing if we can get any prints.
He obviously has a lot of pent-up anger.<eos> Look, I gotta tell ya.<eos> You've put me in a very difficult position.<eos> You've lost all credibility as a witness, and not to mention what you just did in there is a crime.<eos> - He deserved it.
You'll be here on my return?<eos> No!<eos> I'm being fitted for a new overcoat.<eos> Paid for by me?<eos> Surely, you wouldn't have me pay for it?
Very well.<eos> But you will continue to report to me.<eos> It was you that delivered the plate of food to Madame de Reynaud?<eos> Yes Sire.<eos> You collected it from the kitchens and you took it directly to her cell?
Pack the wound.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> Bulky, swollen lymph nodes. And a clear primary mass. In the right lower lobe of the lung.<eos> Non-small cell lung cancer?<eos> The biopsy results are pending, But I'm almost certain they'll confirm it.
The nays have it.<eos> We'll look for another recipient.<eos> You remain conflicted about meghan scott despite her breaking the clearly defined rules for being a transplant candidate.<eos> Yes. I...<eos> I remain conflicted. I've worked with a lot of alcoholics, and I know real regret when I see it.
- But leaving the country?<eos> There is no oversight.<eos> The bacteria that caused your abscess likely came from a treatment.<eos> To ditch the wheelchair, it's worth it.<eos> You touched Nick's abdomen, and he felt it.
Mr. president.<eos> We don't know who survived, but I've got our top agents searching for the quinjet.<eos> Agent Burrows has the package, but we don't know if he was onboard.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Let's hope for all our sakes that director mace got it.
I told you not to mess with my mind.<eos> I assure you... your mind is alive and well inside your head.<eos> Untouched.<eos> - This body is mechanical, yes.<eos> You're controlling it remotely.
This is not on you, okay?<eos> We all lost ourselves in there.<eos> And yeah, it might take you a long time to forgive yourself.<eos> But speaking on behalf of the team, you have nothing to apologize for.<eos> If there's a price to pay, we pay it together.
That was amazing.<eos> You are amazing.<eos> Have you looked at the language in this contract?<eos> He's expecting you to be the perfect girlfriend.<eos> You and I have a secret, so unless you want me to tell people about it, we better start talking about a new deal.
No one tells her when to call her boyfriend.<eos> She doesn't have a boyfriend and she probably never will.<eos> Well, you get my point.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> But... we went over the terms of the contract before you signed it.
Is she?<eos> Poor girl.<eos> Don't pity her, it's her own fault.<eos> The serpent feels no inclination to perform for her.<eos> She must not worship it as I do.
I paid your debt this morning.<eos> You'll get yours next time round.<eos> You're lucky to have me.<eos> I like your front, mademoiselle.<eos> Keep that up, culls will love it.
Wings.<eos> You may come forward and form a circle.<eos> You all know the rules for a particicution.<eos> When I blow the whistle, what you do is up to you.<eos> Until I blow it again.
Neil, this looks a hell of a lot like you're asking me to be a party to fraud.<eos> I'm asking you to do your job.<eos> Look out for my interests, and take me at my word.<eos> If I have reason to believe that you're lying to me, which I do...<eos> The only thing you have reason to believe is that I will fire you if you don't do this for me and then find someone who will, so this thing is gonna get done whether you do it or not.
Right, because you killed our neighbor.<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> Are we gonna keep him?<eos> Do I finally get a brother?<eos> We have a plan, but I feel like in your current state you're gonna judge it negatively.
- Mine's broken.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Okay, today has obviously been intense and it's taking a toll on you.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> We have to get the body out of here by morning or the dogs will find it.
Oh, let me get that for you.<eos> Mind if I grab a soda?<eos> Sorry, we don't drink sodas in this family, only milk.<eos> - You're bringing milk to the beach?<eos> - Well, they don't have it there.
So who are you planning on eating, Loki?<eos> 'Cause you are killing people, right?<eos> - It's not all just singin' and dancin'.<eos> - I made a deal with my old gang.<eos> They let me go, and if they need to get rid of a body they leave it in my van in the Magic Mountain parking lot.
- Are you out of your mind?<eos> And I'm not in the venture capital business.<eos> Which means I'd be using my own money on this.<eos> - Money that you'd earn back in spades.<eos> - I hope it turns out that way, but this thing has a lot of risk, and I'd be taking all of it.
I know you know Benjamin and I have been working on a business.<eos> But I'm not sure that you know that we brought on Stu as an investor.<eos> - I didn't, Donna; That's great.<eos> - It is.<eos> But there's a problem, and I need your help with it.
Now, are you on board with this or not?<eos> Okay, Harvey, I'm on board.<eos> There you are.<eos> I need your help.<eos> And you can have it after I've enjoyed my ham sandwich in peace.
- I'm proud of you, Eve.<eos> - Thank you, General, but my conscience is the least of my concerns.<eos> There's a sarcophagus.<eos> It's an Egyptian deity called Apep.<eos> We've been looking everywhere for it. We just can't find it.
- Thank you, General, but my conscience is the least of my concerns.<eos> There's a sarcophagus.<eos> It's an Egyptian deity called Apep.<eos> We've been looking everywhere for it. We just can't find it.<eos> That's because we have it.
There's a sarcophagus.<eos> It's an Egyptian deity called Apep.<eos> We've been looking everywhere for it. We just can't find it.<eos> That's because we have it.<eos> We retrieved it from Egypt.
Thank you so much for traveling all this way, Prince Magnus.<eos> Delighted to do it.<eos> Though the channel into your port is not nearly as safe or calm as...<eos> As Denmark.<eos> Perhaps one day I'll se it with my own eyes.
- We're at the vows.<eos> You take the bouquet.<eos> - What?<eos> Take it, then!<eos> And then when we leave the vestry, you hand it back to me.
They can wait a while longer.<eos> What did you think of the banner?<eos> - I hate it.<eos> - Knew you would.<eos> And the screws didn't know who was doing it, did they?
The bathroom?<eos> Hey, Kyle!<eos> You want to show Detective Geils where the "bathroom" is?<eos> Sir?<eos> I think down here, they call it the "restroom."
I think down here, they call it the "restroom."<eos> Sorry... Restroom.<eos> Of course.<eos> Right this way.<eos> And by the way... we pronounce it "restroom."
Well, that should get my former teammates' attention, and when they travel back in time to save him,<eos> I'll be there waiting for them with open arms. Well, not too open, I hope.<eos> No, have no fear, Mr. Thawne.<eos> I have no lingering attachment.<eos> In that case, kill them all, collect their fragment of the Spear of Destiny, and bring it to me.
He said the Spear could alter reality itself... that it was too powerful for any man or woman to possess, so we broke it into four separate pieces.<eos> Mr. Hunter took one...<eos> And took the rest of you to three different time periods.<eos> When I arrived in Camelot, it was a middling kingdom.<eos> To help me protect my piece of the Spear, I fashioned it into the legendary court of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.
We're telling Kara.<eos> - Would you please calm down? - No.<eos> Dude, I can't...<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> All right. If there's a flaw in your suit that means the suit is faulty. Which means I have to go fix it.
I'm not the story.<eos> Cadmus is.<eos> All right.<eos> I won't reveal it came from you.<eos> You give me a name, I'll verify it myself and bam, we're off to the races.
- What did Mother do now?<eos> Cadmus stole the alien registry.<eos> They're abducting everyone on the list.<eos> My article was meant to warn everyone.<eos> Well, something that important, if Snapper won't let you publish it at CatCo, maybe be a citizen journalist.
So the wedding will legitimize your union in the eyes of the Daxamite people.<eos> We'll have a formal ceremony.<eos> You're insane if you think I'm going through this pageant for you.<eos> Yes, you've made your feelings for me abundantly clear, Lena.<eos> I don't expect you to do it for me.
Breaking in, stealing a deadly virus, and using it to kill aliens in this very bar.<eos> He discovered your cousin keeps a Phantom Zone projector among his Kryptonian artifacts.<eos> A projector?<eos> That sounds kind of low-tech.<eos> They used it to beam the prisoners instantaneously up to Fort Rozz.
Like the nozzles that blow cooling air onto you?<eos> My wife did a redesign of those and patented it and sold it to Boeing and Airbus.<eos> And a Chinese planes company.<eos> You missed a button on your shirt. Oh!<eos> No, I didn't, my, er... my son tore it off this morning.
- Didn't you do a stint at Bray Band?<eos> Yeah. But it's not on my CV, so how...<eos> Susie my assistant used to work there. She recognised your name.<eos> Shady place.<eos> I've never known folk to leave it off their CV.
What did they say?<eos> - I'm just heading into the bank now.<eos> - Oh. OK.<eos> Well, it'll be fine.<eos> Just thank them for the huge mortgage we have and tell them we want to trade it in for a smaller one.
Just getting so old.<eos> Everyone's getting old.<eos> Frankie wipes his own arse now, my eggs are dead...<eos> Oh, honey, he doesn't...<eos> OK, yeah, he wipes it, but he doesn't wipe it clean.
I'm very nervous.<eos> - Is your girlfriend coming?<eos> Usually I take a shower.<eos> But I like the way your sweat smells on me.<eos> I'm gonna drive around with it as long as it lasts.
I don't see that happening anytime soon, what with Charles so "busy."<eos> Admit it, Mother.<eos> France needs new leadership.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Charles fires me as his regent so he can rule the country by himself and he's not even ruling it.
I thought that was for the "Scared Straight!" teens.<eos> No, that's for you.<eos> Which means you will never get off probation.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> I'll go through it twice, and you can count one for Chelsea.
...I love you.<eos> Damn it, Kenny.<eos> What is the point of having voices in your head if you don't listen to them?<eos> Why are you up?<eos> I'm trying to make this table look perfect, but this vase looks stupid wherever I put it.
I've had better days.<eos> Thank you for showing up for me.<eos> Well, I'm not here for you.<eos> I'm here for that thing.<eos> You know, just 'cause they sell it doesn't mean you have to buy it.
Go ask him to wait for me, please.<eos> Governors, we are running out of time.<eos> The fact that you are here at this emergency meeting on such short notice tells the American people that you are as concerned about their safety as I am.<eos> Terror is unacceptable.<eos> I do not accept it.
Aquamarine, let's talk about this.<eos> Yeah, I-I bet you don't really want to hurt us. You... You probably just act mean because deep down you're afraid you're weak.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Let it out. We're all sharing right now.<eos> Topaz, you had one job, and if you're not gonna do it, you're of no use to me!
Beer, then?<eos> You'll hate it here.<eos> I do.<eos> I've been here ten years.<eos> Grimes only came this term, but he hates it already.
The greasy pole?<eos> Throwing things into little hoops?<eos> The hammer?<eos> I'm not entirely sure what that is -- but presumably you just need a hammer.<eos> And then you throw it.
She said something about blue light.<eos> Yeah, that's the Fifolet.<eos> New Orleans legend says that a spirit might present itself in a bright blue ball of light.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> How do we kill it?
Did you see her come in?<eos> I'm gonna say good night to Hope.<eos> Hayley, wait.<eos> Impressive boundary spell.<eos> Unfortunately, it only lasts as long as the witch who cast it.
In fact, you helped me believe in something your uncle once said.<eos> âFamily is power.â<eos> You're a good dad, Klaus. And you deserve the truth.<eos> There is something that you need to know about the ritual.<eos> Vincent didn't want to tell you because he didn't think that you'd go through with it, but I know that you will.
Strong soul rattling around in a dying shell.<eos> But like all the rest of you, she's nothing compared to me.<eos> One last time.<eos> Give me what I seek.<eos> - Why don't you come get it?
Look at that monster.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. You're not thinking... Yeah!<eos> Eating it?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Rub him well with garlic, roast it over heather wood...
So am I.<eos> This isn't a stunt or me trying to get my 15 minutes.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply you were doing this lightly.<eos> This board is the only thing that gets me through the day.<eos> If I give it up, and I allow them to silence me, then...
I got you.<eos> There you go.<eos> I really... I got to make a poult... No.<eos> You...<eos> let me do it.
Is this a fact?<eos> No.<eos> We're traveling back and forth this month competing with several firms for that contract for the following year.<eos> Competing to provide services.<eos> My colleagues don't know we're competing, they believe we secured it.
What?<eos> In the wall?<eos> No, not in the wall.<eos> They're not in the wall, they are the wall... they're all the walls.<eos> These little robots, they didn't build this place, they became it.
I know you!<eos> You're the cheat!<eos> I love your work!<eos> The sound it made...<eos> I couldn't hear you, but that noise... it's like I felt it in my bones, you know?
Good. Therefore, if light is only a wave, then...<eos> Space is not empty?<eos> Exactly.<eos> So just as sound waves travel through air, light waves must travel through some sort of medium in space.<eos> Scientists called it the ether, an invisible but all-encompassing substance pervading the universe.
I need help.<eos> Sandicot's downtown is ripe for redevelopment.<eos> Why would I ever put any of my money in your corner of the state?<eos> I don't expect you to do this deal as a favor to my uncle.<eos> I expect you to do it because of the casino.
I appreciate your retrieving my son from siberia, But I hadn't foreseen you taking that as licence to keep coming.<eos> To me for favours.<eos> It's not like that at all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So the paris receiver picks up the berlin signal. And transmits it to everybody within range.
As if it wasn't struggle enough for her that she was born lame.<eos> This will ruin her.<eos> I will not have our daughter dragged down by these antiquated notions of femininity.<eos> She has not only passed her entrance exam, she scored higher than anyone.<eos> Do you think the world will clear a path for her simply because you will it?
Yeah, girl. How much do you think playwrights make?<eos> So, you're just saying that no matter what I do, there's still no assurance that I'm actually gonna make it even if I win the best award that playwriting has to offer?<eos> Yeah, it's really more about like, what does theater actually mean to you?<eos> - I just love it.<eos> - And you're doing it.
But if waves travel better through denser materials, then why can I put up my hand and block out the brightest of lights?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, scientists think that light travels through its own special, invisible medium.<eos> They call it the ether.
What if, instead of studying gases, we studied a cup of coffee?<eos> You really must sleep, Albert.<eos> Jacobus v'ant Hoff's Nobel paper from 1901:<eos> Particles in a solution behave like a gas.<eos> When sugar dissolves in coffee, water surrounds glucose and tears it from the sugar crystal, correct?
Come see what we've found...<eos> Don't look.<eos> You believed it would be 1,000 times stronger than uranium.<eos> This element is a million times stronger, and it's not even pure.<eos> It's beautiful. What shall we call it, my love?
Oh, hey, um, what's up?<eos> Look, I know this is super short notice, but I'd love to get together today to talk about that logo.<eos> I know it's Saturday, so no worries if you're doing something fun.<eos> Um... uh...<eos> And when Australopithecus wrapped moss around their feet and fastened it with bark, the shoe took its first step.
Can I get you all anything to start?<eos> Well, we're thinking a buttered bread bonanza.<eos> Ooh, what is that?<eos> - Tell her all about it.<eos> - We take some bread, butter it, and keep serving it in baskets - until you tell us to stop.
Me, the floor, my papers, were all falling at the same rate, so I couldn't feel the pressure of the floor on my feet.<eos> But what if the elevator was rising?<eos> I'd be accelerating in the opposite direction. It would produce the opposite effect.<eos> You'd feel the floor.<eos> I'd be glued to it, as I am now.
Mama is here.<eos> Tell-tell me about the fire in Prague.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> What does it matter now?<eos> I've always thought Papa started it.
- Then redirect it.<eos> - Whe...<eos> I...<eos> What do we do? Wh...<eos> Where do we send it?
I'm sorry.<eos> Hamid. Thanks for meeting me.<eos> Have you got your phone?<eos> No, I left it in my car. Good.<eos> I don't want the spooks using it as a microphone.
You see, Charlie Simms called.<eos> He's worried you'll press charges.<eos> But you won't, will you?<eos> Oh, no. No.<eos> Because that would hurt your case more than you're hurting it already.
Let me guess?<eos> More magic?<eos> It's a witch thing.<eos> A mundane object powered up with their magic can keep a spell alive for a long time.<eos> So, we disable it, we disable them?
Yeardley was close to discovering it.<eos> So, I've returned to find it.<eos> Why might two farmers find what an expedition cannot?<eos> When I have the gold in my hand, brother... then I'll be my own master.<eos> We won't find it.
That's my sweet hope.<eos> I have seen her with my own eyes, Governor, out at night, on her own, whispering to the moon.<eos> If there is witchery and we do not suppress it, the King might doubt the governance of this place.<eos> Let me interrogate her.<eos> If there is hellish sorcery, I will uncover it.
No one has seen Darnley since this morning.<eos> What if Lord White has already done him harm?<eos> White never made it into Scotland.<eos> I stopped him at one of the border crossings just before dawn.<eos> Your marriage to Darnley, if you still want it, is safe from Knox.
There will be repercussions.<eos> Be that as it may, Scotland has one true ruler,<eos> Mary, Queen of Scots, daughter of James V, crowned on her sixth day and appointed not by the Pope, but the Almighty Himself.<eos> It is my duty, my God-given birthright and my crown.<eos> And I will defend it from anyone who attempts to take it.
Sparky's not just a dog.<eos> He's the son my father never had.<eos> Seriously.<eos> My dad would come home from work and us kids and my mom would be there and he wouldn't say one word.<eos> He'd pick up that dog and he would hug it and kiss it.
I didn't give you a proper welcome.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Just moved in, so...<eos> Tawny's putting it together as we go.<eos> Hey, in New York, you find a rug mid-town, you drag it all the way down to the Village.
Like, wait.<eos> What, you think you made it?<eos> You think this sorry-ass bar you made or any of this means shit to me?<eos> You don't know sacrifice.<eos> And you know it too well.
Come on.<eos> You know, for a woman who usually sees the big picture, that was extremely shortsighted.<eos> I refuse to put out a mediocre product with my name on it.<eos> I've worked long and hard to make that name mean something.<eos> Oh, come on, no one is disputing that. The problem isn't your message, it's the way you deliver it.
Why would you stop that?<eos> It don't give you the right to run the fucking light.<eos> What do you mean run the light?<eos> You know how many comics I done seen run the light?<eos> - Those motherfuckers earned it.
Is that a fucking friend of yours?<eos> Uh, more like a brother. Yeah?<eos> Really?<eos> Well, you... are fucking fired.<eos> Now, you get your little fucking hebe ass out of here before I fucking toss it out myself!
You ever have the real deal?<eos> The uncut stuff?<eos> Never.<eos> You know, I have a hookup.<eos> All the cool kids are doing it.
You're not listening to me.<eos> This is a Penn-free zone now.<eos> Means you gotta stay 300 feet away from Leanne at all times.<eos> Well, I don't see no motherfucking judge to sign off on that one.<eos> The justice system didn't do its job, so we're doing it.
-Ah!<eos> Angie!<eos> God! Oh, shit. Sorry.<eos> Uh, this is Doctor McCurry.<eos> He's going to cut off your finger and put it on Leanne.
Maybe this is not the time for this, yeah?<eos> It's something I think about.<eos> - Is Poussey in heaven?<eos> - Of course she is, honey.<eos> In my faith, we call it paradise.
I think we gotta be firmer with her.<eos> Yo!<eos> Stop! Yo!<eos> Yo!<eos> You better get your ass down here before the rest of these bitches throw it down for you!
Look, we just broke a million views!<eos> A million people have seen what a pathetic, abusive little man you are.<eos> Your hand could fit twice around that girl's arm. Yet you still needed to break it to hold her back.<eos> You really think anyone's gonna give a shit about that in a day?<eos> Some 12-year-old's gonna add a fart noise to it, share it with his fart-noise-loving buddies, then a new fart noise video's gonna come out, and you will all be forgotten.
- Occupied.<eos> - I need my stomach pumped.<eos> - She's not gonna bail you out.<eos> She took your paperwork.<eos> Ask her if she processed it.
- Police impound.<eos> All right, well, the good news is, we're police.<eos> Why don't you let us help you out.<eos> Can you be more specific, dollface?<eos> We liberate the vehicle, deliver it to you, and his brother's debt is paid.
Brace yourself for disappointment.<eos> I shouldn't have said those things. - I know.<eos> - None of that can be printed.<eos> No, that tape has all of my interviews.<eos> I'm not giving it to you.
Larson, what do you see?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you mean you don't know?<eos> The file's still rendering. The data stream turned out to be more complicated than I thought.<eos> Then send it in.
I improvised.<eos> I lean down.<eos> I'm wearing these socks, right? Black socks with a red stripe.<eos> So I start pulling on these socks.<eos> I get about a foot of the thread, little bit of the red and then I start wrapping it around the hook.
Yeah?<eos> The piece of paper?<eos> The deed to his empire?<eos> It would all come down to that, wouldn't it?<eos> And if he was in possession of that piece of paper... where do you think he'd keep it?
Martin Byrde.<eos> Said his employer wouldn't allow it.<eos> His exact words.<eos> Even after he saw the body?<eos> I watched Sheriff Nix fish it out right in front of him.
This cost me my family, you know that?<eos> This deal was done.<eos> They could have come home.<eos> Now, there's gonna be men coming here, they're gonna be looking for answers I can't give.<eos> They made a deal with us, and they're gonna honor it.
- Ice hockey?<eos> Only one kind of hockey.<eos> What do you watch, basketball?<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> A lot of people watch it. - Mm.
When we lived on Oceanside, we shared a room.<eos> Mom and Dad used to fight so bad.<eos> They'd go from room to room throwing shit at each other.<eos> Remember that pirate ashtray?<eos> When Mom chucked it through the sliding glass door?
Yeah.<eos> The money's in the chase.<eos> I think I'm gonna roll credits over this mayhem.<eos> I think our match was good.<eos> I mean, I'm sure I'll hate it when I see it, but it felt good.
No?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, then, uh, thank you for your concern.<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> Well, just, uh... just please consider it, okay?
Careful, Reyes.<eos> Emorems already got dibs on me.<eos> Small question.<eos> ALIE had a security system to protect this thing, right?<eos> Any idea what she was protecting it from?
But... But really, this book is about...<eos> Pablo, yeah.<eos> A boy and his two dogs. Great.<eos> And the main character had such an interesting and special and specific name.<eos> I'd never heard it before.
No, no, no. You made a guarantee.<eos> A guarantee is a guarantee.<eos> It's a famiy affair now, boy.<eos> I want my diamonds back in 48 hours, or I want their market equivalent, which is 250 grand, or I will cut off your cock.<eos> I'll put it in a pickle jar.
Let me go!<eos> Video clip has a male, 5'10, wearing the monogrammed slippers of the Cavendish Clan at the site of an armored truck heist two days ago.<eos> You're Albert Hill's mate, a wannabe gangster in a little silly bow tie.<eos> I want that gold, boy.<eos> And if you don't bring it to me... I will come for it.
What's your boy done with my diamonds?<eos> My boy wouldn't rip you off, Saul, he knows what's what.<eos> Let's just tell Saul Gold who heisted it.<eos> I want that gold, boy.<eos> And if you don't bring it to me, I will come for it.
So... the truck barrels down the frog 'n toad... Hits the spike strip... Pop pop pop pop pop!<eos> Tires shredded like cheddar stand at ease...<eos> I run up to the driver all cock and bulls when he pulls out a heater.<eos> Sticks dos barrels right in my boat race... But I was too quick for him.<eos> I smack the heater out of his German bands, swing it around at him, and he pony traps in his Alan Wickers.
All you've gotta do is say "please".<eos> Like, you said, pride.<eos> You rob me of mine. I'll have yours instead.<eos> The gold is mine!<eos> And I will not have some slimy little two-Bob shit nick it because nobody ever hugged him!
Now, I said it would kill Fink just like it's killed everybody else.<eos> What more proof do you need?<eos> Yeah, I'm with Mum on this one.<eos> Forget the gold.<eos> Let somebody else feel the weight of it.
Yeah.<eos> What we up against?<eos> How does all this work, then, Norman?<eos> Nothing to it, son.<eos> If that mutt goes anywhere near my bacon sandwich, I'll turn it into mufflers.
_<eos> Now... I've just come for me dad.<eos> Bollocks to the gold. You can keep that.<eos> It's all a bluff.<eos> They want it all.
Shit be your poetry, and shit still your duty.<eos> Sweet Prince, an offering.<eos> A turd by any other name... does not smell sweet.<eos> Beloved Magdalen weeps forever.<eos> Her heroic captain lost to watery depths, her love as brief as lightning which doth cease to be, her grief as deep as the sea which bore it.
Yeah, piss off, ya pestilent prick!<eos> Ye of little faith.<eos> And you say I'm insane.<eos> Well, friend, it seems you have a play to write.<eos> Yes, but I'll need your help, if you'll give it to me.
Oh, shut up!<eos> Odd girl!<eos> Muttering like a loon!<eos> I intend to make the theatre thrive<eos> - until you can take it over and run it.
- Okay.<eos> - Okay, here's what Julia found.<eos> August 20, 1976.<eos> Baby surrendered at hospital.<eos> Uh, a nurse, Michelle Walker transferred it to a state social worker, uh.
No, Chief.<eos> Fire Department gave the church an all clear though.<eos> Sit your ass down.<eos> When I first moved to Rome, I wasn't made to feel particularly welcome.<eos> Had to buy house paint in bulk to cover up the filth that was written on our garage door so Rose wouldn't see it.
Say what you want, but we brought back weapons and a plan.<eos> What do you have to show for yourself?<eos> Ta... fucking... da.<eos> Your royal accoutrement.<eos> This is ceremony, people, and I expect you to slather yourselves in it.
Now, I took a little trip to get supplies.<eos> Oh, goody.<eos> Heroin.<eos> I always suspected this was how I'd go.<eos> Potassium chloride will shut down the heart. Adrenaline will kick-start it.
If you must go upstairs, install an elevator on the exterior of the building.<eos> That's a good solution.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Drinks.<eos> I call it The Panty Dropper.
- Honestly, I'm exhausted.<eos> - I'm getting dizzy.<eos> We should keep going.<eos> No. Look, there's a generator.<eos> Why don't we just connect it to the generator?
There you go.<eos> Call Bell-end.<eos> Now, he picks up the phone, he does all the dialling.<eos> My hands are on the wheel, I'm safe.<eos> He holds it next to my ear so it's hands-free.
Guys?<eos> No, no, we can do this. Okay, you need to find the processor, remove it, and then reverse-wire the flow to the ODBC source admin.<eos> What?<eos> In English, jackass.<eos> And you can't reroute it that way, it'll just loop the signal.
Whatever it costs.<eos> Well, that's generous.<eos> This beacon must be pretty important.<eos> To the Hullen, it's priceless.<eos> So we better move before they find out about it.
She knew what she had to do.<eos> She made her land very small.<eos> Till the whole world...<eos> Could fit in the palm of her hand.<eos> And she swallowed it whole, so that no more harm could come to her people.
This, should make things interesting.<eos> Ah, you brought me a gift.<eos> - Are we dating now?<eos> - Optic implant.<eos> Dial it up... And you can hear your own blood pumping, your eyeballs moving.
Whoo! Seven hours my ass.<eos> Lucy, where is Dutch?<eos> I need you to help me find her, girl.<eos> Processing.<eos> Sending coordinates. Lucy, if you had a body right now, I would kiss it.
Where did you get it?<eos> From tabor's closet. And, before that, the lab of Dr. Alfonso rezov.<eos> He was a friend of a cousin of a client, some sorta scientist, who needed help funding his various tech ventures, so tabor... so he took a bunch of his stuff as collateral.<eos> What do you know about the device?<eos> We took it from his lab while he was out so not much.
He's confused... scared.<eos> Of what?<eos> Death.<eos> I told you when we first met, we have a glitch in our programming.<eos> At least that's how the humans see it.
Join the club.<eos> Why didn't the recall program work until now?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> When I got out, the Drive was just an unfinished prototype prone to instability.<eos> Yeah, we noticed. Our Android's been tinkering with it.
You won't find him here, Ryo.<eos> Only your death.<eos> - You swore an oath. - To the throne.<eos> And the throne will still be here once you're gone.<eos> And who will occupy it?
- Was he scared?<eos> - Yeah, but he discovers a way not to be afraid of the dark.<eos> How?<eos> I could read it to you if you want.<eos> I'm sure the bookstore has it.
Switching to manual.<eos> Murphy!<eos> Thanks.<eos> We have to get to them before they get to Polis with that fuel.<eos> They'll use it to make bombs.
Thanks.<eos> We have to get to them before they get to Polis with that fuel.<eos> They'll use it to make bombs.<eos> They'll kill everyone.<eos> You mean they'll use it to kill Ice Nation.
I will shine such light into the spider's nest that all the world will see him for the deformed pestilence he is.<eos> Hunsdon will no more be able to champion Topcliffe than if he were riddled with plague.<eos> But how will you have it performed?<eos> The censor would never pass a political play.<eos> I will write it.
Be impossible to find.<eos> What was happening on that day?<eos> It was toward the end of World War I.<eos> The Germans had a new artillery weapon called the Paris Gun.<eos> They hid it in the countryside and fired it into the city at random.
We'll put it on the calendar for next Friday.<eos> Thank you, but this needs to be heard tomorrow before there's more blood on the street.<eos> We can have all the parties notified within the hour.<eos> I can't walk across the hall without taking my cell phone.<eos> But you don't use it to light up your neighbor.
I believe that is the thing, the essence of the Uruguayan asado.<eos> For all Uruguayans, the theme of the asado is the same.<eos> From a very young age, let's say from when you're a baby, you're already experiencing asados, because it's a tradition from many years ago, from our ancestors.<eos> We maintain this.<eos> And we still do it almost every day.
You have to drink the Kool-Aid to do this.<eos> There's just no other way around it.<eos> It's a difficult job, it's a harder life.<eos> But it has to be a labor of love.<eos> And if you're not in it for the right reasons, it'll shorten your life span, I think.
I studied, and in my free time, I went to work.<eos> That's how I learned it.<eos> Now I'm 20, almost 21, and I have been working for almost five years.<eos> When the work is finished, and I taste the mezcal, I say the work was done well, the product is good.<eos> And I like when people taste it and say, "this is really good mezcal!
- Yes it is.<eos> Then take off your shirt.<eos> I had a big breakfast.<eos> My advice?<eos> I guess it would be leaving every place you work at a little bit better than when you found it.
Call Foley directly. Get me in a room with him.<eos> Then I'll know if I have an enemy.<eos> Your locker, Mr. Rhoades.<eos> Thank you, Domingo.<eos> Now, some people, when aging a cigar, keep it at 70 percent humidity.
Well, just a tattle tale, really.<eos> And one night, he got the Code Red treatment at boarding school.<eos> Did you lead it?<eos> Just say that I was a part of it.<eos> Never got it out of my mind.
I could've been out every single night.<eos> Models, musicians, your own so-called friends.<eos> I could've done you like that.<eos> Maybe I should have.<eos> I get the same treatment from you now, but at least then, I'd have earned it by getting my fucking rocks off.
Lady Washington.<eos> Clever, isn't it?<eos> That awful winter at Valley Forge, my husband made do with just a spoon.<eos> But with this, he would have had a full set of cutlery.<eos> Why don't you take it?
- Of course, Mrs. Strong. One of the camp women is being drummed out, for refusing to do laundry.<eos> And she's stubborn, but she has a child, and I'm sure I can bring her around.<eos> If you could just ask the general to give her a little more time.<eos> He never wanted the camp followers here to begin with.<eos> We all must do what we can without forgetting that we also have the army and the general who commands it.
White man who wrote your book left it all out, didn't he?<eos> - No.<eos> Doc acknowledged that we were destroying ourselves with violence and pollution.<eos> He didn't, but the...<eos> The Light did, and then The Light gave him the message, and he wrote it down.
You can't bring outside food in here.<eos> It's not food.<eos> It's a severely injured squirrel.<eos> All right, well, sit wherever.<eos> Just don't let it out of the box.
I know what you're thinking.<eos> Yet another superhero battle.<eos> Well, my name's Emily Locke and I grew up in what's known as a fly-over state.<eos> Superheroes never stopped there.<eos> They just flew over it.
Yes! I can hold.<eos> Hey, guys, wait up.<eos> What's that sound?<eos> It's a device I built that warns you when someone you don't like is approaching.<eos> I call it the "Emily Alert."
Can I pick the color?<eos> It's 7:00 a.m. What am I doing here?<eos> Van, this device we've created has just alerted me that Jack-O-Lantern is in the area, giving us enough time to get to safety.<eos> It uses advanced chemoreceptors to pick up on Jack-O-Lantern's unique smell profile.<eos> We call it the "Jack-O-Lert."
With Blaine, it took a couple of days.<eos> Got it.<eos> You know, I had this whole speech planned.<eos> It was funny and heartfelt, profound.<eos> But it feels like a waste if you're just gonna forget it anyway.
They will, lord.<eos> With respect, Lord Uhtred. You have still not explained why you crossed the street into Daneland.<eos> I can never remember your name.<eos> I am Aldhelm, I'm Commander of Lord Aethelred's household guard.<eos> Would you like me to write it down?
- To Larry!<eos> - To me!<eos> Luga, we're toasting my book.<eos> Toast it. Good idea.<eos> No, toasting as in drinking to it and to you and to Corfu.
Struck me those kids would do anything to get out of the house.<eos> - I mean, Mia did come here fairly regular. - Yeah?<eos> Why was that?<eos> Mam and dad collected their rent in cash.<eos> She collected it so it wouldn't go through the books, you know.
That makes you way too easy to buy for.<eos> No, no.<eos> You don't need to get me anything.<eos> - But we want to do something.<eos> - Yeah, it's an important birthday and we want you to remember it.
Except I'm sorry that you never got to write in yours.<eos> This is where it would have gone.<eos> Well, then, it's good that there's still room in there.<eos> I grew up knowing about this book, but when it didn't show up on my special birthday, I wrote down my wish anyway.<eos> Kept it in my jewelry box.
Is it hollow?<eos> Filled with liquid.<eos> Yeah, mercury. Yeah.<eos> Highly prized by ancient peoples.<eos> Chinese emperors drank it.
God, they're doing a raid on our building.<eos> Come on, Professor, let's get out of here.<eos> No,<eos> - the Lumen.<eos> - The book'll be fine; they'll never find it.
I did not call you to get a levelheaded and fair assessment of the situation.<eos> You're right, my bad.<eos> Okay, maybe I can get some intel from Don, but in the meantime, you-you got to kick it up a notch.<eos> It's like with dogs, okay?<eos> You can't just put the food out and expect that they'll find it.
Shut your mouth, peasant!<eos> She is a citizen, bearing witness.<eos> Pay her and give her a carriage home.<eos> Thank you, your Grace.<eos> My nephew is a fool, but not so foolish as to kill a Capulet... on the Montague name, I swear it...
As the world waits for further word on the president's condition, all major indices are continuing to plunge.<eos> The Dow, NASDAQ, and SP are approaching Black Monday-type losses.<eos> The Dow Jones Industrial Average has already plunged a staggering 2,000 points in one day, after the shooting of President Kirkman.<eos> You better not be eating my jello.<eos> It's my jello. I earned it.
Oh, no, no.<eos> I get it.<eos> Believe me, I do.<eos> Running this country is the hardest job there is.<eos> Problem is, with everything that's been flying at you, you're not actually running it.
Now, I know that there are times when our country appears to be divided, but I have seen the one thing that will bind us together forever...<eos> love.<eos> Love of country, love of hope, love of dreams, love of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<eos> I am a husband, I am a father, and I am a son of this nation, and never before have I been more proud, more optimistic.<eos> And I do not need you to tell me that you feel the same way, too, because I can see it in your eyes and hear it in your hearts.
Don't apologize.<eos> You're a welcome sight.<eos> I know it's been a while since we were sent to the Continental side.<eos> And I was just telling her her position's taken.<eos> And now she is getting it back.
Through the "Gazette"? That's you.<eos> - That's correct.<eos> - I asked him.<eos> Sergeant John Champe, 2nd Partisan Corps.<eos> I wasn't told your name and I won't ask it.
My mother.<eos> Well, I'm not sure what you did. Not sure if I want to know either, but well done.<eos> All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places.<eos> Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion.<eos> Well, just because I've been offered Blair's job doesn't mean that I want it.
There isn't a lot of solid ground to build my column.<eos> So you want a guarantee before you make a commitment? No.<eos> I didn't say guarantee.<eos> Well, what's your word then?<eos> The work only works for you if you extend it to the other people in your life.
- Absolutely.<eos> Lucas can hold them right by camera, and you could go to them between takes when we'll be cutting away from you anyway.<eos> Okay, and what's the other option?<eos> We give you this earpiece.<eos> We would just cover it with your hair... And then cheat you away from camera, so they can...
Uh, what's happening?<eos> When I was a little boy in Memphis, there was this record shop, Hoppy's.<eos> I hear they tore it down a couple of years ago.<eos> When I was a kid, that was the place.<eos> They'd let you listen to any record, even if you wasn't gonna buy it.
She worries about you.<eos> Yeah, that she does.<eos> That she does.<eos> You know, I didn't believe her at first when she told me about you having a breakdown.<eos> Is it okay to call it a breakdown?
Why are you making the bed?<eos> I like making the bed.<eos> But it's a hotel.<eos> It's a motel, and this is a bed, and I like making it.<eos> Someone else would make it, is all I'm saying.
See?<eos> Fresh meats that you could actually go and pick out the chicken.<eos> - He would kill the chicken...<eos> - What? ... defeather it, clean it,<eos> - and then wrap it up for you.
And then...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Philly left.<eos> And I decided, you know, what was the point?<eos> You know, when a plate breaks, you don't fix it. You just get another plate.
And are we clear on the scope and nature of this power?<eos> No, but if the readings are right, he may be the most powerful mutant that we have ever encountered.<eos> After what happened in red hook, I'd say that's an understatement.<eos> So he has the power, but he doesn't understand it or know how to control it.<eos> I'd like to dig deeper, see if we can figure out what triggers it.
Um, it was good. You know, I didn't eat anything from sunrise to sunset, so I'd say solid fast.<eos> And it must be very difficult to fast with all those tasty cupcakes at work.<eos> Mm. Did you know Hakeem Olajuwon fasted during the NBA Finals?<eos> Wow. Fun fasting fact, huh, Navid?<eos> Yeah, I've heard it before.
DS Arnott.<eos> Where was your wife on the night of the 17th through to the morning of the 18th of March?<eos> - HE CLEARS THROAT Right.<eos> Presumably you are aware of the law regarding the compellability of a spouse?<eos> Normally the spouse is the one corroborating the alibi, - not undermining it.
- Amen.<eos> We never got married.<eos> She wanted to... especially after you were born.<eos> She took my name.<eos> She wanted you to have it.
What are you doing, Chief?<eos> How many times I gotta tell you to stop calling me that?<eos> Well, Nunez is MIA.<eos> It's just Rita and I running the shop, and she called in sick.<eos> So did Warren and Franks, so, I'd say the job's yours if you want it.
Place brings back memories... when we were all together.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Too long.<eos> I live and work here.<eos> Just as dusty and crowded as I remembered it.
What?<eos> Lem's friends... You trust them?<eos> I don't know them.<eos> I don't know you either.<eos> I know a grift when I see it.
You're the best we've ever seen.<eos> Now, just let that girl go so you can tell your story.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> The takedown, as we call it, is an extremely fluid situation, you need to rely on your instincts, your training, and above all else, the profile.
- I don't want your fucking butler.<eos> I want you to read my script.<eos> The one from this morning?<eos> No. No, another one. I've been trying to get it made for years.<eos> Nobody gets it and no one wants to pay for it.
Cancer.<eos> She tried all the things.<eos> Chemo, radiation, surgery.<eos> You know what they do with a tumor when they cut it out?<eos> They put it in a bag and burn it.
That we're...<eos> That there's no chance of us ever doing something awful again?<eos> That it didn't change us forever?<eos> What happened to us was a miracle, Megan.<eos> We drank in evil... and we spat it back out.
Alright, fine. We'll do Heather's pirate party piece.<eos> - Thursday, third segment.<eos> - But that's the loser segment.<eos> That's when all of our viewers go to the bathroom. - Okay.<eos> We won't do it. - No, no, no!
I got two more days before it's mine.<eos> In East Peck, if no one claims a body part within two weeks, you get to keep it.<eos> But I can't get too excited, because I have been here before.<eos> I, uh, I found a toe once.<eos> I had it for 10 days before someone came to claim it.
1957.<eos> Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...
Sold... to bidder 337.<eos> You gonna buy the whole building?<eos> Don't bother me.<eos> I'm stress-bidding.<eos> Maybe they already got it and splintered back.
Lights would flicker... we'd get that not-so-fresh feeling. - Ooh!<eos> - Ms. Markridge?<eos> I'm sorry, but you've purchased a great deal more than we anticipated.<eos> You've exceeded your credit limit.<eos> Okay, then raise it.
Unstoppable.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> He can choose his own fate.<eos> - He didn't want his future.<eos> He despised it.
Okay?<eos> I own this place now.<eos> Took me forever to find it.<eos> - It's complete shite.<eos> Why do you want it?
If you were caught with it, you'd be thrown in jail for robbery.<eos> I need to collect the money myself.<eos> Well, I'm going with you.<eos> If it's Darnley's money, too, he may try to take it back.<eos> The money will be protected once we get it to the church.
If Darnley is no longer motivated to share your power, he's gonna try and take it.<eos> He's a threat to your throne and to your life, Mary.<eos> You need to get rid of him.<eos> I'm not ready to talk about killing a king... or to have my child without a father.<eos> There has to be another way, and I will find it, as long as I have you by my side.
Or. Don E.<eos> He knew I had the cure.<eos> He was looking to sell it for big money to some high roller at the club.<eos> I was gonna go for ice cream.<eos> The obvious choice, I know. But God, I could taste it already.
- You whiny little...<eos> Whoa, there, big fella.<eos> Assaulting an officer, not your best move.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> I'll bet you know the rest, but I'll run through it anyway.
It works on a monthly subscription.<eos> Anything you do on your phone, all calls, all texts, they get recorded and passed along to the subscriber.<eos> Ken was spying on me?<eos> There is a phone number associated with the credit card used for the Tinker Spy subscription.<eos> My colleague is calling it now.
Shall we begin?<eos> While you wait, have you heard the story of the poor woodcutter and his wife?<eos> I don't believe I have.<eos> One day, a poor woodcutter and his wife found a crane caught in a trap.<eos> Feeling bad for the bird, they freed it.
He died?<eos> He built this place with Cary 30 years ago.<eos> Before the Divisions.<eos> Before anyone knew ‭how fast the world would change.<eos> They built it, ‭and they went looking for people like you to fill it.
Initiating ground launch sequencer now.<eos> Raven.<eos> Becca?<eos> You can tell me that it's none of my business, but why live in a hole in the ground when you have a perfectly good rocket?<eos> Are you tilling the soil or stabbing it?
It should be you or Clarke or...<eos> O., stop.<eos> Neither of us could've done what you did, and it wasn't just winning a fight.<eos> You gave people hope when there was none.<eos> You're... you're Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and giving it back to the human race.
Maybe you should go and see her and show her she's not nearly clever enough to get one over on the great Father Brown.<eos> Have you ever heard the story of the eagle and the daw?<eos> I can't say I have.<eos> A jackdaw sees an eagle swoop down on a spring lamb, carrying it away to eat.<eos> The jackdaw believes himself to be as powerful, so he flies over, lands on the back of another lamb, grips it with his claws and flaps away with all his might.
Who would say that?<eos> - One of the locals described seeing someone.<eos> I thought it might be him.<eos> - It wasn't.<eos> If Eddie went to Peru, I would know about it.
- I don't know.<eos> I had an unburdening session with Richard.<eos> And of course, it was incomplete.<eos> I wanted to tell him everything.<eos> - Well, yes. - That... that impulse is... It's understandable, but to act on it would be catastrophic.
That's great. That's just... what every girl wants to hear as she's being tied to a plank with wire.<eos> Chris lived to help others.<eos> She made lives better all over the world.<eos> She helped build the hospital that she died in.<eos> And it only stood for one month before an unsanctioned American bombing turned it to ash.
Which... which dress?<eos> You know, this one.<eos> I...<eos> You don't know?<eos> Because you've never seen it on me before?
I'm sure there's more to it than that.<eos> Well, it's not right, what Bailey did.<eos> You can't just throw anybody in as Chief of General Surgery.<eos> Keps is good, but Grey put in the time for that job, okay?<eos> She deserves it.
Jackson, stop it!<eos> Just stop it!<eos> You keep saying, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery," but you're not, not in the way you're trying to be.<eos> A title doesn't mean anything.<eos> It's the person who owns it.
I get why he's mad at you.<eos> That was way worse than what I did.<eos> How is that worse?<eos> You gave away his job.<eos> And you put your mouth on the person who took it.
Once we remove that met that's obstructing her bile duct, her liver enzymes will go down, and she's in.<eos> Um, Meredith doesn't feel that surgery is wise.<eos> Meredith is no longer on the case.<eos> And now that I know about this trial, there is even more reason to do the surgery.<eos> And I'd like one of you to do it.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna give it everything that I never got.<eos> I'm gonna get it everything I couldn't give to my boys.<eos> I'll get it everything that you couldn't give to your first child died a-borning.<eos> My baby is not a means for you to right your past wrongs.<eos> This child, it will be good, it will be pure, and I will not be expose it to your darkness - and your anger.
I'm gonna use real jujitsu on you if you don't get that rattler!<eos> I will. Let me explain.<eos> Rattlesnakes don't hunt using vision.<eos> They feel vibrations and sense heat.<eos> So I am putting my cell phone on vibrate, and running multiple apps to heat it up, and putting it in my sock.
Oh! Perfect shot.<eos> Your assistance is greatly appreciated.<eos> Walt, Cabe's got a shot of vitamin rattlesnake.<eos> Where are you with the hydrogen sulfide gas?<eos> Collecting it now.
That'll take time.<eos> We'll have to stabilize the silo or it'll fall in before we're done.<eos> But how?<eos> It's ready to topple right now.<eos> We secure it with cables.
If we don't do something soon, it's the same as letting him fall!<eos> That's it.<eos> We let him fall.<eos> I am so sorry. Some of the acid must've fallen on his head and it's eating his brain.<eos> Those safety nets you have, we tie them together, we stretch them across the sinkhole, we cut the cables, we let the silo drop onto the nets and catch it, and then Joe gets out to safety.
Basically, some people are just better at things than others.<eos> That's what coding makes you realize.<eos> The number seven is the number seven.<eos> If you call it the number eight, you don't actually make it the number eight, you just embarrass yourself.
I'm demanding a full partnership vote on the leadership of this firm.<eos> We're going in another direction. And you're the new direction.<eos> Is that it? Seriously?<eos> Yeah, I'm taking my firm back.<eos> You've driven it to the ground, and in this day and age, we can't afford to let it drift.
You don't look fine.<eos> It's time for you to tag out.<eos> Wake up Snow and get some bloody sleep.<eos> I said I'm fine!<eos> And If I wanted advice, I doubt I'd take it from a pirate.
Oh, what a nightmare.<eos> Larry, no.<eos> If the defense believes that all we have is Detective Hiss' testimony, then he clearly hasn't seen the coroner's report on Margaret Henderson.<eos> No. I haven't seen the coroner's report.<eos> I didn't know there was a coroner's report. I have been asking for it for weeks.
This.<eos> I didn't think this was possible.<eos> It wasn't part of the plan.<eos> So, maybe... maybe we make a new plan.<eos> This time, we make it together.
I think... Yeah.<eos> - I shouldn't do that.<eos> - Too far.<eos> I am so excited to be here.<eos> I haven't been to the beach in years, and I always get burned, but I love it.
- The wolf trial happens...<eos> When there's a full moon...<eos> and the prosecutor turns into a werewolf.<eos> Like, literally, he's just going, "I object..."<eos> The judge throws the gavel at him and he eats it or fetches it.
"now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."<eos> You know what that means?<eos> Pop quiz!<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> If you don't have haters in this job, it means you're not doing it right.
- Definitely. And I'm not one of those Bob snobs, either, that undervalues Robert Herjavec just because he's the son of an immigrant factory worker.<eos> What would Robert do?<eos> He'd probably tell us we need a hook... - something to make our business unique.<eos> - I know.<eos> Maybe our hook should be... ice cream is simple and delicious, and people love it!
I...<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not sorry.<eos> 'Cause I feel like we went through it together.
- You don't know that.<eos> I know that she came and asked for board games, and if that's her major concern, then it's because she isn't worried about food.<eos> If they have more food, they should share it with us.<eos> - I can ask if...<eos> - You think those bitches are just gonna share it with you?
From the fridge to the trash.<eos> I am taking it on the chin today.<eos> There's even an awards ceremony at the Embassy Suites.<eos> The trophy is a crystal palm tree.<eos> We'll attach it to a necklace so you can wear it - when relatives come over. - Mm-hmm.
Oh, man!<eos> And look how your delicate fingers really show it off.<eos> There's no way she says "no" to that ring.<eos> Yes.<eos> She's going to love it.
No!<eos> The older it gets, the more valuable it gets.<eos> Damn straight!<eos> Just give him the ass.<eos> You've been sitting on it for 13 years.
Don't worry. I will make them pay.<eos> How did you find my bag, Carlos?<eos> She told me.<eos> We were talking.<eos> If you wanted it so bad, why did you give it back to me?
But please, I'm asking you, On Monday morning at court, can you just drop the lawsuit?<eos> I'll tell you what I'll drop.<eos> I'm gonna drop you.<eos> Just like you dropped that bullshit accent.<eos> Yeah. I just use it to, um... How you say... make your wife wet.
You-you said that Jennings and his crew stopped this thing. How?<eos> With the city burning, the vault team knew that their only hope of finding the djinn was for one of its own to read the pamphlet and take on its fatal curse.<eos> In the end, the task fell to Samuel Wilson, who took the infection upon himself, allowing the others to follow him to the djinn's nest.<eos> Once there, Mr. Jennings used an ancient Tome of weather magiks to summon a powerful tempest.<eos> He flooded the djinn's lair and struck it down with unholy lightning.
You certain this is the place? Yeah.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> Might be right.<eos> I think I saw this place on a list of Dreyfuss's holdings.<eos> They're gonna turn it into a server farm.
But using the Stone may be the only thing that allows our nation to survive its infancy.<eos> And there the missive ends.<eos> Now, we know Washington eventually followed. Banneker's plan for the Division... And that Dreyfuss has the same information.<eos> Indeed, but with this new thread, that Washington intended to use the Stone before it was divided... if we can find the rest of the correspondence, we may learn to what end.<eos> Okay, we'll find it after we find the last piece.
Go! Go!<eos> Who is shooting those at us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We must be right on top of the Talisman piece.<eos> I'm guessing something doesn't want us to get it.
Well...<eos> Think it's over?<eos> That's the last we'll hear from Dreyfuss?<eos> I'd like to believe it... but evil has a manner of raising its head in a way we least expect.<eos> But if it should... we shall face it together.
But that's not what you believe.<eos> No.<eos> Agent Thomas?<eos> When Molly was younger, she had an imaginary friend... it had green hair and his body was made out of her baby blanket. She used to draw it all the time.<eos> - Anyway, she called it...
So how's a bunch of wrecked cars gonna help us take down this demon?<eos> Okay, it's a little known fact, but cars are filled with trace amounts of gold.<eos> Uh, anti-lock brakes, airbag inflation system chips.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> If gold was laying around in cars, people would steal it.
- Seriously.<eos> You could watch anything.<eos> Even shows about cupcake wars.<eos> But... then along came the Dreyfuss.<eos> Boo! He took the power from the people and he kept it all for himself.
Molly.<eos> You're free. When you grow up, you can choose to fight evil... or not.<eos> And the Witness mantle?<eos> I don't have it anymore.<eos> But you bore it with bravery and aplomb well beyond your years.
One had a gun.<eos> They forced me into the hallway and started yelling, "Where's the money?"<eos> No one even noticed.<eos> What money?<eos> They said they gave Adam half a million dollars and they wanted it back.
Red or white?<eos> Red.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You take it off yourself?
I could hear everything.<eos> God, why are tiny rakes so soothing?<eos> You know, I think I'm finally starting to understand momentum.<eos> Which, apparently, my book does not have.<eos> Nick, everyone loves it.
- Previously on Reign... - You were right.<eos> As long as Mary's alive, there will always be Catholics who want her on your throne.<eos> Unless you share it with someone of their faith.
I've asked Rizzio to keep watch, but everyone at this court is a potential conspirator.<eos> The act of a desperate man.<eos> I have stopped all of Darnley's attempts at gaining the Crown Matrimonial.<eos> Knox and the privy council must have promised him my throne.<eos> Which means they're not above taking it by force.
Last night, in tampa, this semi sort of doodle was discovered on the arm of a cadaver that was being dissected in an anatomy class.<eos> What is it, some kind of tattoo?<eos> No, it's an ink pen drawing.<eos> Yeah, and luckily for law enforcement, the teacher of the anatomy class is also the county coroner, and she recognized the marking.<eos> She'd also seen it on...
Well, I can check ViCAP and neighboring states.<eos> Jeepers.<eos> Another body, and by body I mean torso, was just found 10 blocks from the original one.<eos> Was it found in a dumpster?<eos> Uh, no, pedestrian spotted it in a parking lot.
Weren't you gonna drop your novel off with your mom?<eos> Which, for the record, is exactly what she planned to do.<eos> Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?<eos> I want to give her my... Bracelet. Mom...<eos> - wanted to borrow it.
Who needs a busted love tester when you have visual proof?<eos> I give you exhibit A.<eos> Yes, preach, lawyer.<eos> Feeling better about your test?<eos> I was until you reminded me about it.
People cheat.<eos> Lie. So I have to be vigilant.<eos> Make sure the people I hire are vigilant.<eos> I'd written you off, but you're the only applicant that figured it out.<eos> So the job's yours if you want it.
Oh, stop being brave.<eos> I can't bear brave people.<eos> I'll put the story in the stone.<eos> I'll put your name in the air.<eos> They'll see it for hundreds of years.
The girls should have the bedroom ready by now.<eos> You are clear for approach.<eos> Congratulations on your citizenship.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hong Kong recognizes talent when they see it.
She mentioned it in the therapy tapes.<eos> You're pretty damn sure this Deacon is the Nightingale?<eos> I am.<eos> What are we supposed to be looking for?<eos> I'll tell you when I find it.
Geordie?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - You're needed.<eos> So why is our friend Lawrence so utterly obsessed with sex?<eos> Because he views it as a discovery, as an exploration of ourselves, of our inner darkest desires.
You okay?<eos> Yeah, just tired.<eos> I have a gift for you.<eos> Guy sitting next to me bought it for me.<eos> I made a big deal of telling him I'd give it to my husband.
But everybody is in it together.<eos> You haven't been there in a long time.<eos> That's what your dad says.<eos> You should probably keep this book on your shelf with other books of similar topics.<eos> That way, anyone who's looking won't pay any attention to it.
It could be brutal.<eos> Bring it on.<eos> You serious?<eos> I think it would be a conflict of interest for you to accompany me to the Billy Brennan victory party.<eos> How about we go home, I put on my fancy dress and you take it off.
Fuck you.<eos> If you look at my shit, I'm gonna look at your shit.<eos> All right, whoa, whoa.<eos> I'll go balls deep on your inbox.<eos> If you've taken one fucking selfie, I will find it.
Help!<eos> - Gavin.<eos> - Mmm. I like your hair.<eos> I like your eye.<eos> Yeah, I... I got it from a woman.
Yes, hello, Alex.<eos> You, you didn't deliver on your side of the bargain.<eos> This cannot have been all you got.<eos> Um, I put the name in, and that's all that came up.<eos> Okay, well, did you spell it correctly?
I know I couldn't, not forever.<eos> Maybe it's not forever.<eos> I, um...<eos> I talked to Meghan and Robbie about the case.<eos> We went over it.
So you can take solace in that.<eos> I just realized that I have had this in my car for weeks.<eos> The paraffins alone would have killed you.<eos> I'll get you a different one.<eos> Aldous was so proud when he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it. And Aldous just dumbed it down.
I like it.<eos> Then a golden egg appears between them.<eos> Uh, a what now?<eos> A golden egg.<eos> The woman eats it and a few months later she has a baby.
Mrs. Rodriguez had a sex dream about you.<eos> That's got to be about something else.<eos> What? !<eos> Did you just make that example up or is that real?<eos> Let's just say I made it up... - Ugh.
Oh, no.<eos> Jon changed the code.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What does that mean that Jon changed the code?<eos> Well, we change it sometimes.
That is terrible mothering.<eos> My housekeeper brings my kids to school.<eos> Yeah, but I'm friends with you.<eos> In a town full of gossips, she's the worst.<eos> She texted everyone about my divorce before I even knew about it... and implied that it was my fault.
It worked, and no one got hurt.<eos> Actually, somebody did get hurt.<eos> Chloe Brown Mueller fired her housekeeper for stealing.<eos> - What? - Chloe knew the candlestick was missing and suspected Roberta.<eos> She told her if she returned it, there'd be no consequences.
- Uh, no, actually, we were hoping to come back after.<eos> - Suit yourself.<eos> I require a gift.<eos> - A gift?<eos> Yeah, I mean, name it, and we'll get it for you.
He was a good kid until Damian got a hold of him.<eos> The Antiguan police offered to cut Zion a deal if he implicated Damian, but he obviously refused.<eos> It's kind of hard to rat out your own father figure.<eos> Yeah, being focused to gut someone is pretty traumatic.<eos> It could be that this first kill was so deeply impressed upon him, that's the reason he's resorting to it in his diminished mental state.
I see.<eos> Well, what do you want, Mary?<eos> You've blossomed into a beautiful woman, an example others look to.<eos> It's true.<eos> I know it's hard for you to look at yourself and see the power in you, but I see it, and you're radiant.
They can.<eos> And in return?<eos> A royal child of Whitespire.<eos> The fairies want a baby?<eos> They aren't gonna eat it, are they?
Gonna need some collateral.<eos> Well, okay.<eos> Here are the keys to my house.<eos> You can take in the mail and feed the cat.<eos> What do you want me to feed it to?
Who told you that?<eos> Your little phone?<eos> As a matter of fact, yeah.<eos> It says there's an accident up ahead.<eos> If there was an accident, I'd know about it.
Just to be clear... we stay off of each other's property, no matter what?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Good.<eos> You just got a check from Neumann's Hill yesterday.<eos> I'm gonna use it to start a fire.
Yes, Colt.<eos> That's exactly why.<eos> By the way, I hope we catch 328 fish today.<eos> The exact same number as your career interceptions.<eos> Maybe a fish will swallow your phone and we can catch it.
- He fixed it last time. - No.<eos> Nope.<eos> You know, he is the generator whisperer.<eos> And that ain't exaggerated either.<eos> He literally leans in and pats it, says,
I sent it to go get scrubbed so that we can prove that you were right about Maxine.<eos> You are a liar!<eos> I always knew you wanted my story this story that's gonna save my career.<eos> Anna, I am trying to help you.<eos> The second I get that tape back we can sit down and listen to it together and you will get to write the story that you wanted.
I never said that.<eos> - You said it.<eos> He also told me about your little secret.<eos> What, what secret?<eos> Well, Willy gets the newspaper from the nasty neighbors every morning and gives it to you. - Oh.
That was '87.<eos> The reason we were late was because of that damn Hands Across America that you made me do.<eos> Hands was '86, and you thanked me afterwards because you got to hold hands with someone that was holding hands with Willie Nelson.<eos> What the hell was that whole thing about, anyway?<eos> Hunger? Hand somebody a sandwich in San Francisco and you pass it on down the line till some bum gets ahold of it in Boston?
You'll recall we left Jane working on a novel about her Abuela.<eos> _<eos> Miami One to Read.<eos> Don't get too excited.<eos> Who knows if she'll pick it.
Is it you?<eos> I am Guthred.<eos> I visited the Danes in the guise of a dead horseman, and ensured Guthred's release.<eos> Over the remains of a blessed saint, he was crowned king.<eos> Build an army and I will command it.
So I don't want to host that show.<eos> But... I have an idea.<eos> When I pitched you my travel show, you told me you couldn't do it 'cause I'm too much of a new face.<eos> And I get that.<eos> But... what if we did it together?
The gauntlet.<eos> No.<eos> My team died for that thing.<eos> We might all die because of it.<eos> Doesn't mean I'm gonna hand it to Snyder.
Even 24 hours would give us time to wean The baby down from the morphine And load her system<eos> With a milder opioid, methadone, for a safer withdrawal. Wait, hold on.<eos> The simulator's nowhere even close To being ready.<eos> Okay. What are the problems?<eos> Okay, we can give the baby nutrition Through the umbilical cord, but if we use it To oxygenate the blood, it'll cause blood clots.
It's just gonna be me.<eos> You can call me.<eos> I'll be here.<eos> The love you have for your daughter is stronger than this.<eos> You've proven it already.
How come you're so calm?<eos> You have never been a gopher.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Scarab, stop.<eos> Control that thing, Beetle, or I'll control it for you.
And if you cut it into pieces, each piece can form a new specimen.<eos> It regenerates. In many ways, it's immortal.<eos> Its secret is a gene called FoxO.<eos> It governs the production of stem cells in the organism.<eos> We humans have it as well, but it's less active in us.
Look at this. See how basic this knot is?<eos> I love these thermal goggles.<eos> Amy, listen to me very carefully.<eos> If you and Jake are thinking of trying, you are ovulating like crazy right now.<eos> You take that helmet off before I knock it off.
Well, that gives me an idea.<eos> (CHOPPER GRUNTS) Really?<eos> You can have those?<eos> Chopper, you get its attention.<eos> Lure it to me, and I'll blast it.
Lucy, will you please check my handcuffs and make sure they're tried securely behind my back?<eos> Yup, they're... they're locked.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, as this beautiful lady has just confirmed, my hands are tied securely behind my back.<eos> I will now step into this trunk.<eos> My brother Dash will then lock it shut.
In every town square, in every park and every playground!<eos> You're on fire, you're literally on fire you're so caliente.<eos> That's Spanish for "hot".<eos> The statues are transmitters!<eos> They boost the signal and beam it out all around the world!
Yeah.<eos> We just don't know what happened yet.<eos> I think we have a pretty good idea based on the facts.<eos> If it was you, wouldn't you want the benefit of the doubt?<eos> If I got plastered and I killed a little girl, I wouldn't deserve it.
Okay, and then what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, why'd you leave out the oxy you popped?<eos> I forgot.<eos> They gave it to me a few days ago for a shoulder injury that I got on a call.
Glad to hear it. And that makes sense. You're easy to talk to.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're easy to talk to, too, which is good 'cause, otherwise, you'd go broke.<eos> When a male gentoo penguin chooses a mate, he makes an offering.<eos> He finds a pebble, often taking the time to find the smoothest one, and presents it to the female.
By George, she's got it!<eos> I'm not going to lie to you, this means that your insurance premiums are going to go through the roof.<eos> In fact, everything is going to go through the roof, because I'm going to blow up the lab.<eos> We just need some kind of a trigger, first.<eos> But what are you going to blow it up with?
I haven't slept in days.<eos> How's the song coming?<eos> I finished it.<eos> I think I want you to sing the first verse.<eos> Why don't you or Simone sing it?
I think I brought that to me and Hunter's.<eos> I'm sorry, Cott.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Won't they get all wrinkled in there?<eos> Girl, don't you even worry, boo-boo, there's a steamer upstairs and I'll pack it for you.
It's the old, old story... they never look so good in the morning.<eos> Goodbye to the truth?<eos> I came a long way to read that book!<eos> 2,000 years at the last count.<eos> If you don't want me to read it, you could have stopped me any time you wanted.
Do you understand there isn't a single accurate map of this entire place now?<eos> What the...<eos> Your majesties, welcome to Loria.<eos> You kidnapped our castle?<eos> I'll put it back, as soon as you come around to my offer.
You must really love being married.<eos> No.<eos> Well then, why would you do it five times?<eos> I love wearing the dress.<eos> Plus, when you are in it, something magical happens.
Hurry, because the future Mr. and Mrs. Stein are ten minutes away from the champagne course.<eos> Ah, okay, we're on our way!<eos> - Take off the ring.<eos> - Yeah, I'm trying but someone just force-fed me a seven-course meal and I'm a little bloated.<eos> You'll get it off in the car.
Help me, Yolanda!<eos> Well, if you want Josh to appreciate you, you gotta show him you have other job prospects.<eos> Yes!<eos> Where would I find those?<eos> Just give me your resumé and I'll put it online for you.
It's not going anywhere. Do you understand that Logan is my boss?<eos> What if she comes over and the couch isn't here?<eos> What if anyone else comes over and the couch is here?<eos> Logan picked me out of everyone in the office to give the couch to.<eos> Sending it back would be a slap in her face.
What do we know about him?<eos> No arrests, but he was kicked out of his high school a couple years ago for running a sports gambling operation.<eos> D'Andre could be the middleman.<eos> Do you have an address?<eos> Sending it to your phones now.
Sometimes I think the only thing you two will agree on is that you won't agree on anything.<eos> You make it sound so simple, but it's not.<eos> Congress still has to approve the treaty, and now support is lagging.<eos> No.<eos> They'll approve it if you stand by it.
I quit.<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry, I can't... I can't do this.<eos> Elliot, listen to me.<eos> Do you know why you're good at it?
I don't know exactly.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> It just seems like he needs some cash, and so I'm afraid he's gonna unload that thing somewhere he shouldn't.<eos> - The bracelet?<eos> I mean, do you want me to sell it?
Minister Chen, still holding for you.<eos> Minister Chen, I'm so sorry to keep you holding.<eos> My assistant is out of the office and, well, it's been a day of excitement for all of us.<eos> I'm sure it's not every day you receive a Mongolian horse as an inducement to intervene in the democratic process of a foreign nation.<eos> The, horse was a gift of congratulations from Minister Sendoo, not a bribe, and in any case, I've already declined it.
They probably outnumber us ten to one.<eos> Their soldiers might be fanatics, but they're also untrained amateurs.<eos> We can beat them if we fight them on our terms.<eos> Maybe we use the tracking device that bb removed from the gauntlet?<eos> We toss it into their hideout, wait for the drones to respond, and grab the gauntlet during the chaos.
That's ridiculous.<eos> Wallace asked me why you pushed me to take this case.<eos> I thought he was being paranoid.<eos> Whatever your agenda... it's been satisfied.<eos> CIU took the case, now the media knows about it.
Why would you let him do this?<eos> If you had touched him, you'd have found out.<eos> He saved you from that and perhaps much worse.<eos> The painting is yours.<eos> He had me finish it to save you.
We need this for the pee smell in the house.<eos> - Pee smell.<eos> - It smells like a pee house.<eos> There is no pee smell in my house.<eos> I know you don't smell it, but I can, Mother, and other people can, too.
Okay, according to this ridiculous calendar, I'm spending every waking second with you.<eos> - When do I hang out with Geoff?<eos> - Well, you see that little sliver?<eos> Right there is a little sliver.<eos> Well, maybe you don't see it, but it says "G.S."
Wait, what dance?<eos> Get your head out of the clouds, Dave!<eos> I swear to God.<eos> The Valentine's Day dance.<eos> The Robin Scouts do it as a fundraiser for all the 8th-to 12th-graders in the East Orlando school district.
The shark's oily liver keeps it buoyant and balanced in the water.
You know...<eos> Ah!<eos> Mom, look, the cheap gas station is up ahead.<eos> They give you a free lighter if you pay with cash.<eos> Oh. Honey's horn game almost made me miss it.
Did you have to yell "Not in my house" every time you blocked a shot?<eos> Well, if you keep bringing me weak sauce, I'm gonna keep rejecting it.<eos> What's this noise?<eos> I'm entering a contest.<eos> You create your own comic, and if the publisher likes it, they'll print it, and they'll give it away for free a comic-book stores nationwide.
Well, then, imagine your mother taking time out of her busy day to come down here, looking for help, only to have someone embarrass her in front of you, her son.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Do the right thing, Roger, not for the store, but for mothers everywhere.<eos> They're not perfect... but they're ours.<eos> I'm gonna take the phone back... and use it to call my mother.
Doesn't matter. I got ahead of this.<eos> I told Frankie you and I went outside because there were miscreants in the parking lot. We wanted to see what they were up to.<eos> They ran away, but they'd broken into my car and stole my coat.<eos> That's why I'm not wearing one now.<eos> By the way, I donated it to charity so I wouldn't mess up and wear it to work.
Good.<eos> So, um, just talked to Ron Donahue.<eos> He said, uh, he saw my plumber going into your house?<eos> Oh. Yeah. Remember that pipe busted a month ago?<eos> It was still giving me trouble, but Herb fixed it up great.
- Yep. Please tell me the portrait we had painted of him wasn't...<eos> - Same box.<eos> Oh.<eos> "His favorite book is 'Good Night, Gorilla'.<eos> Every time we read it to him, he kicks his little legs."
- Same box.<eos> Oh.<eos> "His favorite book is 'Good Night, Gorilla'.<eos> Every time we read it to him, he kicks his little legs."<eos> And here's a picture of you reading it to me!
Come on!<eos> We have one more thing for you, as well.<eos> You loved... this Colts towel.<eos> Uh... are you sure about that, Frankie?<eos> I don't remember Blake liking my lucky Colts towel that if I'm not holding it when they play, the Colts don't win.
Yes!<eos> Oh, why wouldn't he call?<eos> The car hasn't moved in days.<eos> He had to have seen the notes by now.<eos> Unless... he's old, and he's on the floor in his apartment because he had a heart attack and nobody knows about it.
Get him on the phone or I am gone!<eos> I don't just call him.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Look, we've got this way of contacting each other in an emergency.<eos> I call it the Bat-Signal, and the only time I've used it since he went underground was to tell him our father died.
What do we know about Darlene Jones?<eos> Well, she's a neonatal nurse in Fredericksburg.<eos> No priors, never been arrested.<eos> Her alibi check out?<eos> Verifying it with the hospital now.
My mom would stop at nothing to be Erica's hero.<eos> Meanwhile, me and Big Tasty started our snow day with an epic cartoon marathon.<eos> Did you two get into my four-quadrant popcorn tin?<eos> Relax.<eos> We were just sniffing it.
Okay, how's about I just sit it out?<eos> - Just please don't send this in.<eos> - And print. Please stop that horrible printing sound.<eos> I wish I could, but I pressed the button, - and it can't be stopped.<eos> - It can if I drown it out.
Edit that out.<eos> To whom shall I send it?<eos> May.<eos> I don't know what you mean by "Barry".<eos> - To whom shall I send it?
This is the sort of countryside where people can do nice things, like go for a walk or a picnic.<eos> This, however, is the sort of countryside that will be my home for the day... mud.<eos> Yes, I love mud.<eos> When I say I love mud, I mean I hate mud.<eos> But the people with me here today really do love it.
- Yes.<eos> Yeah, yeah. - I have to get out and attach the winch to a tree?<eos> Yes, you'll get out, and you'll get your strap with you.<eos> The strap goes round the tree to protect the tree.<eos> Then you bring your wincher up to the tree, or whatever obstacle we attach it to, and I'll operate the buttons.
So sex and drugs. That's it?<eos> Do you have any idea how powerful you are?<eos> You know what that power is?<eos> It's the one thing you have that every man wants.<eos> You just have to let them think they have the power, but they never do, never, unless you give it to them.
Might this equipment be of interest... to anyone outside the hospital?<eos> - Not that I know of.<eos> - So you think it's an inside job?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Someone may have borrowed it and forgotten to register it.
At least that's when I woke up to the facts.<eos> People don't realise how little it takes.<eos> Many do.<eos> Everyone's read your article.<eos> 731 people have read it.
- No, no, no. I will not do that.<eos> I do not know - If I want to give you the money back.<eos> - I do not want the money, but my picture.<eos> Then give the assignment to another.<eos> - I will never paint it again!
- The king spoke through him.<eos> - Like a ventriloquist.<eos> - I want my picture!<eos> - Then ask another.<eos> - I will never paint it again.
Do you have any idea what your life would've been like if I took a murder rap when you were 5 years old?<eos> Yeah, well, you know what?<eos> Foster care would've been better than this shit.<eos> You think so?<eos> I'll tell you about it sometime.
It'll kill those, take out the other cells.<eos> Yeah, Shoghi's aren't easy to get.<eos> Nah, I got a guy. My buddy Nick can hook us up.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll make the plan more solid when I pitch it to Baz and Pope.
Why can we neglect the seasonal Yarkovsky Effect in calculating the probability of impact?<eos> Ah, because the heliocentric radius is large compared to the geocentric radius, so, as we get closer to the planet...<eos> It has less influence, so what was a close encounter at the same position is now a direct hit.<eos> Precisely.<eos> So how do we stop it?
High salt content, low bacteria...<eos> Yeah, so two weeks to turn El Jefe into king tut puts time of death within the first 48 hours of his trip.<eos> Mitchie... We talking about murder here?<eos> Give me the room.<eos> Yeah, it works way better when Rosie does it, right?
This is great.<eos> Hey, you deserve to be in a Captain's chair.<eos> Being a captain is more than a job.<eos> It's who you are.<eos> And when you get that job, I'm making you take it.
Can I just talk you through this outfit?<eos> Those bangles, my dead grandmother's vintage.<eos> And this special number was the bikini I wore on our honeymoon.<eos> Start with the basics... do you have a name?<eos> Do you know it?
Where, like, I'm holding on to you like we're on a magic carpet ride.<eos> I mean we could, but my dick can't...<eos> What, it can't stretch back, or round, or... ? - No.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Why don't we do it like this?
[Pidge] The shield can't handle this much power!<eos> We might not be strong enough to beat this thing!<eos> -[Ulaz] Hang on!<eos> -Ulaz?<eos> I'm going to take it down from the inside!
Maybe the reason that I was so upset is... there's a little part of me that's afraid she was right.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> I grew up bouncing from one foster home to another. I thought anyone who didn't smack me around was mother of the year.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The only thing I know for sure is that if you had a baby, you would love it like crazy.
Valerie's adored by the residents.<eos> Me, not so much.<eos> Does she have an office or a desk or something we can look at?<eos> A locker.<eos> I'll open it for you.
Barely, sir.<eos> We're living out of boxes.<eos> It'll settle down.<eos> Change is always hard, and if we want progress...<eos> You might call it progress, I call it wasting police time.
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Gently.<eos> That is DI Bacchus.<eos> DS Coles.<eos> What were the men doing when they found the body?<eos> We used to dump our waste down there, but a German company wants to buy us and they're very hot on health and safety, so we're cleaning it up.
A few months before Alistair died there was an accident -- a fire at the plant.<eos> Guess who did the internal review?<eos> Tommy Norton.<eos> First thing he did as General Manager.<eos> Alistair signed it off.
The young man you hit?<eos> He was just a kid.<eos> I'm screaming for him to get out of the way, but he doesn't even see me coming.<eos> I close my eyes, but I hear him hit the car.<eos> That sound, ohh... I'll hear it for the rest of my life.
I don't want to be a woman.<eos> Sometimes, I think wearing their clothes lets me inhabit them more completely.<eos> But the truth is I don't know where the desire comes from.<eos> It just is.<eos> And though I have to hide it from narrow minds, I won't deny myself the feeling it brings.
Because that is not seed dust, that's seed fungus!<eos> Claviceps purpurea, commonly known as ergot.<eos> Now, when the humidity increased in the vault, ergot spores were formed.<eos> The vent turning on spread the fungus.<eos> Who breathed it in?
I don't know.<eos> I definitely look at... sex differently now, I don't know.<eos> Kids in high school were so infatuated with sex all the time, and I just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just look at it completely different now.
- Well, does that...<eos> Enough!<eos> We're all friends here, and Van is tearing us apart.<eos> And I'm putting an end to it.<eos> ♪ You put the pig in the pit ♪ ♪ And then you eat it ♪ ♪ It's just indigenous ♪
Yes, but it was all happening so fast. I...<eos> I just reacted. Right.<eos> You reacted to what you saw:<eos> a man attacking your mother.<eos> As for the rifle, you have no idea if your mother saw it.
Parabiosis?<eos> Are you joking?<eos> He's bleeding kids too?<eos> No, it's just plasma.<eos> Mud, parabiosis means he is processing young blood and transfusing it.
Ever heard of the ikea effect?<eos> I imagine I'm going to.<eos> It's a cognitive bias. Where consumers place a higher value. On a thing they have put work into.<eos> Like building furniture;<eos> It makes them like it more. Than if they bought it assembled.
No, I mean on Usher.<eos> The body is remarkably well-preserved, except for the extremities, which frostbite took care of.<eos> But dental is intact.<eos> Our counterparts in Antarctica are cooperating fully, and the body will be in our possession within the next 12 hours.<eos> I'll have it in transit after customs.
Wonderful.<eos> Although I'm not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.<eos> Well, when you get the machine, you can find out.<eos> Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.<eos> Oh, you don't need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize.
We have a problem.<eos> Yeah, we have a problem.<eos> We raised quitters.<eos> No, look, you can totally see my wine rack.<eos> Well, why didn't you put it on at home so you could tell if your clothes would cover it?
You can't. This is my Abuela's special fever cure.<eos> Please hand me the dried scorpion.<eos> You're gonna eat this?<eos> No, don't be stupid.<eos> I am gonna wrap it in a rag and I am gonna let it soak into my head.
Oh! Hey, well, thank you, Manny, for letting me tighten that last wheel screw.<eos> Maybe next week you could teach me how to street punch?<eos> Yeah. Sure!<eos> Wow.<eos> Cam found it upstairs for me.
Naomi... if we don't get a handle on this... you may not make it.<eos> We don't know, but it may not be long.<eos> Naomi, no.<eos> Naomi, you're not going anywhere.<eos> Yeah, well, if I only have a little time left, I'm not spending it in here.
They'll take it out and monitor it to make sure no more appear.<eos> Now, I know this sounds scary, Naomi, but you're gonna be just fine.<eos> Well, you saved my life again.<eos> Did you use that humidifier the night before your paralysis?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, up until all of this happened, I used it every night.
So, like I was saying, the fiberglass installation around the transducer was all over the access tunnel, so whoever went in there would have fiberglass in their nasal passages.<eos> I tested Wu. His nose was clean.<eos> So he's innocent.<eos> So who... Who killed Bobby Huff?<eos> Take your eminent domain and shove it up your ass!
Hey, we got into this to make some money, provide for our families.<eos> I'm not about to go to prison for it. Are you?<eos> Put a bullet in him, toss him over.<eos> The downwellings out here will take his body right to the ocean floor.<eos> Nobody will ever see it again.
The homeschooling, the answering questions for him, the nudging him away from football to art school.<eos> Think they're in love?<eos> I think they think they are.<eos> I'm telling you, Chunk, we're gonna win this case.<eos> And we're gonna win it the right way.
He's hot for teacher.<eos> Have Cable track down his last few days.<eos> No way he's as virtuous as he came across.<eos> He drew a breathtaking sketch of the Brooklyn Bridge.<eos> And, somehow, he knew to draw it from exactly my favorite spot.
I'll give it.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, A: You assaulted Beck on our balcony appearance and B: you've pretty much been an arsehole all day.<eos> Robert is giving it.
But I can tell you where he keeps it.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> You have no right to come into my...<eos> No knock, search warrant.<eos> I have no idea what you're looking for, but I guarantee you're not gonna find it.
So she was threatening to call the cops on him.<eos> And she took me back home and smashed my computer with a hammer, smashed my cell phone with a hammer and said, "If you ever try to do that again, I'm going to smash your fingers with a hammer."<eos> It was a rough year.<eos> I call that "the bad times."<eos> She had taken this dog leash and clipped it to a pair of handcuffs, and clipped the handcuffs to the bed and kept... it was like that for about two weeks.
- Let me guess, - you drive a Prius.<eos> - I ride a bicycle.<eos> Everyone should.<eos> We only have one planet.<eos> And the city's Department of Transportation is destroying it?
-[wind whistling] -[Dionne Warwick] Saving lives... Did I say something wrong?<eos> Was it the-- the dead wife part?<eos> No, it's just, how do you compete with a memory?<eos> Memories are always better than it really was.<eos> Like, when you're a baby, you love breast milk, and then you have it as an adult, and you're like, "What's the big deal?"
The spun polyethylene and positive air pressure would mimic her bubble.<eos> That'll protect her, but she's gonna need a better breathing apparatus.<eos> A full-size oxygen tank will not fit under a Hazmat suit. Paige?<eos> Grab an extra comm and then tell Ada's father to sterilize it so that she can communicate with us when she's in the Hazmat suit.<eos> I'm gonna take the filter from this regulator, put it in this smaller tank's mask, cover the side vent holes with sterile medical tape, and, voila...
Toby, she's ready. Get it in gear.<eos> Uno momento.<eos> Can I talk to Ada for a moment? - Yeah.<eos> - Ada?<eos> Um, I've been brain-storming preliminary code and I believe that I can create an algorithm to compress worldwide genetic data in such a manner that even if there is only one bone marrow match out there for you, I will find it.
Gunshot wound.<eos> Mid-clavicular line, left fifth intercostal space.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Means if we don't get him to a hospital, he's dead.<eos> I'll take him on the helicopter, send it back for you ASAP.
What are you thinking?<eos> A wasp bomb.<eos> Sorry I asked.<eos> The tree moss is damp enough to create plenty of smoke.<eos> Smoke makes wasps docile, so, then we cut down the nest, carry it to the loggers' camp.
On our way!<eos> I probably have a concussion.<eos> Stop being a baby.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I'm gonna take that clicker and shove it up your...
Now, in exchange, I want you and yours to leave my daughter alone.<eos> Forever.<eos> Or?<eos> No need for "or."<eos> You know a good deal when you hear it, and I'm only offering once.
I don't even know him.<eos> I think you do.<eos> Calvin... I think you're the one that pulls the strings in here.<eos> You decide when to help, and you decide when to look away, and you have a lot of friends, and they're afraid of you, so they play your little game.<eos> Like you said, they don't fight it.
Not all of the women were missing 3 liters.<eos> Some were only one.<eos> The healthier the victim, the more blood they were missing.<eos> It's like he's conducting experiments.<eos> Maybe he's got some kind of disorder and thinks using the healthiest blood will cure it.
Now give me your wallet. No way, I don't trust you.<eos> Very nice.<eos> You're learning. Good.<eos> Do need the wallet, though, 'cause it's part of the thing, so give it to me.<eos> I'll give it back to you in a minute, you're gonna get it back.
Where is she?<eos> What are you doing with my daughter's phone?<eos> ! I don't know.<eos> I just found it, all right?<eos> Pack of girls comes in here like Coyote Ugly, and one of 'em drops it.
If you do this for me, you'll be a hero... just like King Arthur when he pulled the sword from the stone.<eos> Oh... yeah!<eos> Whew! Oh, God, this is embarrassing.<eos> I'm so sorry. It's been, like, 500 years.<eos> Aw, this is your big moment and I'm ruining it.
Never going to happen, mate.<eos> Hashtag -- just saying.<eos> I'm not blind, brother.<eos> This is what they do.<eos> They wait until you're into them, then they tear out your heart and peel it like a big old Babybel...
Darling, don't you see?<eos> Your magic is useful because it's unstable.<eos> You're so desperate for love, so desperate to prove yourself. Your heart is in disarray.<eos> Well, don't look so surprised.<eos> Anyone can see it.
Brother, you don't owe me. You don't owe me a thing.<eos> Look, my last gang team, we were tight for five years.<eos> And I thought that that's... that's where I belonged.<eos> And I lost that.<eos> I know how this feels. So as far as your desk is concerned, I was just holding it down for you.
- Withrow outbid you.<eos> - Seven times.<eos> At a certain point I just wanted to see how high he'd go.<eos> And he won.<eos> But the next day, he sent me the flight log with a very nice handwritten note saying he didn't want it after all.
It's common to confuse homonyms when you use a dictation app.<eos> Son and sun, by and bye, except and accept.<eos> Skip to the good part... the part where I'm right.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, the way the app works is you dictate your e-mail content, that gets sent to a server farm, which translates it into text and sends it back.
Okay, fine.<eos> Two weeks ago, we picked up chatter suggesting Flaco Ruiz could possibly.<eos> I.D. a major player in the Flores cartel's money laundering operation. Who?<eos> Just know he was important enough for us to fast-track the meeting.<eos> And who else knew about it?
Let's just say it activates and deactivates almost anything I want.<eos> Not everything, but... you know, depending on what I program it to.<eos> This is gonna make us rich, Ma.<eos> A few more refinements, I'll be selling the patent to The Pentagon.<eos> They'll be fighting wars with it, you know, they'll be able to diffuse or... or detonate bombs from miles away.
Karen!<eos> Hey, um...<eos> I decided I do what to keep my senior project.<eos> Oh, honey, I'm sorry.<eos> We took it to the dumpster already.
You think it's okay that the student group who invited Shiloh McCullen is paying to give her that platform?<eos> She doesn't come here for free, you know.<eos> - Progressive speakers are paid, too.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> He doesn't get it.
Yeah.<eos> Dr. Ken's gonna bring all them patients in there.<eos> We gonna make everything look legit.<eos> Too legit to quit, baby.<eos> We're gonna have you run it, hmm?
Need a minute?<eos> You want some water?<eos> I missed you, too, Felix.<eos> You're also missing a lot of shots.<eos> I guess you only knew your way around a court when you used it to hook up.
Maybe three seconds.<eos> So in a crowded room, after you'd been drinking and popping pills with music pumping and lights pulsating, you were really able to see and identify a ring on the finger of a stranger?<eos> I saw it.<eos> And his face.<eos> I'll never forget it.
I don't want to say.<eos> Is it really that high?<eos> I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.<eos> You don't how much your rent is?<eos> My father pays for it!
Until the most recent victim, his targets have been those who excelled at university.<eos> If the killer was an academic failure, this could be his way of lashing out.<eos> Aspects of his ritual support this theory.<eos> And all the victims were positioned to face geodetic, or true north.<eos> It's a geographic term, but we think the unsub is using it more in a philosophical sense.
I want her in the Sit Room.<eos> Is it about the smuggling ring?<eos> CIA found another cargo flight carrying contraband.<eos> That's a good thing, isn't it?<eos> Not if they force it down.
Oh, God.<eos> Leon.<eos> Uh, hi.<eos> It's, uh, quite a tale.<eos> Uh, you see, your cabinet was, uh, faulty, and I was fixing it with a drill, and it was very loud, so when they came, I, uh...
And we're not leaving until we get it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's your truth.<eos> You are in way, way over your heads, okay?<eos> If I screw up this job that I'm doing right now, if you screw it up for me, then he is going to kill me.
Maybe three seconds.<eos> So in a crowded room, after you'd been drinking and popping pills with music pumping and lights pulsating, you were really able to see and identify a ring on the finger of a stranger?<eos> I saw it.<eos> And his face.<eos> I'll never forget it.
I been working with Bobby.<eos> He hired me to shoot the West Side a couple months ago.<eos> So a little bit of money and that righteousness just goes right out the window?<eos> No, I came around to his way of thinking.<eos> Your neighborhood's going up in flames, the least you can do is make the rest of the world look it in the eye, and, yeah, the money wasn't bad.
If I can't invade Ferrara, I'm certainly going to invade her.<eos> I should have known better than to try to bribe her.<eos> Valentina's loyalties will always be with the Doge.<eos> Her power is dependant on him.<eos> Well, if that's true, I wouldn't call it power.
Maybe she's the one.<eos> Let's do it in the garage.<eos> It's kind of cold, but we can do sweaters on, pants off.<eos> Look, he left his phone.<eos> I'm just gonna nudge it with my knee into this empty pizza box...
And Trevor probably doubled his fee.<eos> It's also a good way to make sure the Nelsons didn't back out of the deal.<eos> All right, let's pick him up and bring him in.<eos> Okay, I just found his address.<eos> Sending it to you now.
Endowed by their creator with certain "inalnable..."<eos> unanaba...<eos> Inalienable rights.<eos> She did it right on the way over.<eos> Maybe you don't hear that noise, but I hear it.
Well, you don't represent the people any more than I do.<eos> We're in the minority everywhere but in here.<eos> Maybe you disagree, but I think we can get more done working together.<eos> And what would we be working together for?<eos> You and your mother look at this country the way politicians have looked at it for 250 years, as if there's this ideal America out there and it's just out of reach.
You get a Hazmat team down here right now.<eos> I think he's been dosed with something toxic.<eos> What?<eos> Is it radiation?<eos> Walker: "The past is never where you think you left it."
In 1918, he survived an assassination attempt.<eos> When he found out that the bullets used to shoot him were dipped in poison, he became obsessed.<eos> He started a secret lab called the "special room."<eos> its sole purpose was to weaponize poisonous substances to assassinate people anonymously, and that lab still exists to this day.<eos> Putin uses it.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Don't stress.<eos> Next week, we'll sit down, I'll tell you what I observed, it'll all be good.<eos> Maybe I'll just e-mail him.<eos> That way, if he's looking for more context, he'll already have it in his inbox.
Oh, I forgot all about Scott's burn book.<eos> And I think Petra did, too.<eos> How did you get that?<eos> Hi there.<eos> Why did you have it?
Given the way I feel, I can't properly represent Rogelio.<eos> - But...<eos> - What now?<eos> Ask for a continuance.<eos> The judge is gonna grant it because your lawyer is resigning.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Tons. Because with writing comes exposure, and with exposure comes vulnerability.<eos> And there are all these stages of exposing yourself.<eos> First with writing the book.<eos> Then marketing it.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Kathy used to wear a crucifix?<eos> She did, her mum gave it to her.<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> Did you find it in her things?
What about the crane that built this thing?<eos> They take hours to set up.<eos> What about a jumper's pad?<eos> Well, not from this height.<eos> Besides, what would we even build it out of?
We're not gonna throw it. We're gonna float it.<eos> Now, get the tarp from the truck bed and I will find a heat source that will seal the seam.<eos> This lighter should provide enough heat.<eos> Mind cluing me in here, Sly?<eos> We're building a balloon. We're gonna fill it with methane.
She's gone.<eos> She's gone for the day, or she's still gone gone?<eos> She's gone gone.<eos> But the important thing is, is Patel's out, and you're in.<eos> The Alderman seat's yours if you want it.
So you two can't...<eos> But back to the case.<eos> So, uh, Doc Hollywood put botox in Broden's coconut water?<eos> I mean, it would explain Broden asphyxiating.<eos> Doc Hollywood slips botox into the coconut water, Broden drinks it, asphyxiates, dies, then the ex shoots him.
That's not unusual. The people that I deal with, they change up their info all the time.<eos> He said he wanted my help selling a book that used to belong to a pirate.<eos> So you put it on the market for him. No.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> He didn't actually want me to auction it. He wanted me to offer it directly to a guy named Farhan Al-Asmari.
They'll put it up soon.<eos> They're just trying to build suspense.<eos> Hey, I brought you a present.<eos> The person who made it loves her little boy very much, and she put that love into every stitch.<eos> So when you wear it, maybe you'll feel the love, too.
- Come here.<eos> Sweetheart, love ya.<eos> I came to tell you I'm sorry about your teacher.<eos> Someone can be a good person and a bad person all at the same time.<eos> They have to know that everybody in the world is waiting, so why don't they just put it up already?
We got to get the time, parking, address.<eos> - Print it all out, okay?<eos> - You got it.<eos> And, um, play Jesse's new single.<eos> Loud enough so we can hear it down here.
Very popular in the '60s, when every agent was a licensed operator, fluent in Morse code.<eos> The good old days.<eos> Oh, don't underestimate the power of short wave radio, Mr. Callen.<eos> Hetty, those frequencies are public.<eos> You put a message out there, anyone can hear it.
Well, the phone's itself is entirely devoid of incriminating evidence.<eos> Doesn't sound like good news.<eos> Doesn't sound like news at all.<eos> Well, we're getting there.<eos> He probably only uses it for specific reasons, like contacting members of the Xionshou Song network.
Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, Michelle's body was recovered by LAPD.<eos> Uh, they found it in a van left where the tour bus was hijacked.<eos> They're personally escorting it to the morgue now.
That's great, good for you.<eos> Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she's gonna be fine.<eos> Ah, of course she is.<eos> And that day care is great. It is.<eos> I went to check it out, and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows.
! There's a lady in accounting who seems like she's doing the best she can.<eos> A booster is a portable car seat for young kids.<eos> Slash part of a spaceship.<eos> Agree to disagree.<eos> You put it in your backseat.
Oh, God.<eos> I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it!<eos> - Damn it!<eos> Take your name back.<eos> I don't want it.
It could not be shown as propaganda.<eos> It was just too brutal.<eos> There was just too much carnage.<eos> [narrator] Capra was in Washington, anxiously awaiting delivery of the footage.<eos> His team packaged it into a newsreel that was distributed to theaters around the country.
When her father was killed,<eos> Cortés, the conquistador, took her in as his own and gave her a land, a new religion, a new name.<eos> Who exactly do you think you're talking to?<eos> Do you think you are the only killer in this place?<eos> If you say my daughter's name again, I will carve it into your skull.
Help!<eos> Help!<eos> I still think<eos> I should do the whole thing in Dutch.<eos> Well, the Koningsdag address is customarily given in English, but, then again, we've never done it online before.
I have not eaten anything in two weeks.<eos> Neither one of us ate your pot roast, Dougie, just like neither one of us ate your shark jerky.<eos> That sounds like the kind of brave a man gets when he has a stomach full of red meat.<eos> I'm gonna turn around, I'm gonna count to ten.<eos> I want whoever ate that pot roast to put it back, no questions asked.
That's why I'm telling you this.<eos> I don't know, but I know what I saw!<eos> Lindsey Vaughn?<eos> From that case in Chula Vista 10 years ago?<eos> You remember it.
I will always love you.<eos> Mother."<eos> Gideon...<eos> I know it's not easy to talk about Belle.<eos> But this book... meant the world to her, and she really wanted you to have it.
- You did it.<eos> - Kinda.<eos> That won't hold very long.<eos> It's okay. The Black Fairy's got his heart.<eos> Gold's gonna get it. Everything's gonna be fine.
Gold's gonna get it. Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I appreciate your optimism, kid, but we got to go.<eos> You think his heart's down here?<eos> I know my mother.<eos> This is where she'd hide it.
I needed the creature's body.<eos> Living, dead, I don't give a shit.<eos> Because until we collect every last supernatural entity that you let in the Triangle, I am stuck in this "living anus" of a town.<eos> Willa's the Earp who let the riffraff in.<eos> I was the one who bitchslapped the tentacle, slid back across the line, and sliced it like deli meat.
I want to take another look around.<eos> If the concrete struck the car as it passed under the bridge, would've continued on a ways before it hit the curb and started rolling.<eos> Think a piece might have fallen and hit the windshield?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or somebody threw it.
I want what you think they'd gain from Brookwell...<eos> Whatever it takes to put more faces on our board.<eos> I need actionable intel from whoever is running evidence recovery.<eos> What do you mean they're not on site yet?<eos> Homeland Security doesn't report it as a threat.
I know. I was just... I was trying to be less impetuous.<eos> Well, I'm a good soldier.<eos> I follow my orders.<eos> You needed time.<eos> I'm giving it to you.
Need to know what.<eos> Loretta.<eos> Well, judging from the massive head trauma and the hemorrhaging from the ears, nose and mouth there's no doubt Campbell died from the impact of the fall.<eos> He complained of head pain just before he jumped.<eos> Any indication of what caused it?
Wait.<eos> Where did she get some goo?<eos> Come.<eos> OK, so I found this compound that shocks the nervous system, right?<eos> It makes the demon think it's in a dying body, and then it abandons it.
- What?<eos> They are looking for something.<eos> Yeah, a seal.<eos> Old news.<eos> What happens when they break it?
- No, no, no.<eos> A crib is what you want, and a crib is what you're gonna get.<eos> God, I wonder if I'm sober enough to sell my blood.<eos> Aw, what the hell.<eos> Whoever gets it is gonna have a great time.
Needed the magnet.<eos> And I need electrical current.<eos> Oh, I got it.<eos> Okay, I'm putting the magnet under the piston.<eos> And once Toby hits it with electricity, it creates Lorentz force, increasing the piston's velocity so much that...
As soon as we get this giant space Rock off our scanners, we can pinpoint Captain Marvel's ID and get her and your crewmates back.<eos> On it.<eos> Looks like the asteroid's destabilizing.<eos> I can't risk shrinking it.<eos> Then we don't touch it until you and Tony run a thorough analysis.
You cannot defeat us.<eos> For we are of one mind!<eos> You share a brain?<eos> Hmm, makes sense.<eos> Which one's using it right now?
Stent deployed.<eos> All right, let's have one last look.<eos> You can press the pedal.<eos> Dr. Bardovi?<eos> I don't know what's wrong with the floor pedal. I'm stepping on it.
Right, well, either it caromed to your midsection, or it hitched a ride up through your venous system.<eos> Good.<eos> Grab a DPL.<eos> A Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage.<eos> We're gonna insert a needle in your abdomen, fill it with fluid, then drain it to see if there's any internal bleeding.
I can't...<eos> Look, we're getting nowhere with Eli, so tell me you found something on the missing kids or their foster mom.<eos> I wish I could, but it's like they just vanished into thin air.<eos> The music teacher... any idea why Eli was trying to find him?<eos> He's been vacationing in Rio, had no idea Eli was camping out at his place, and the men who took Amber's body from the morgue got it by using fraudulent transfer papers.
Those are terrible odds.<eos> Relax, Gamora.<eos> Now, if I know Yondu...<eos> And I do know Yondu, he probably stashed the sarcophagus in one of these old hideouts until he can negotiate the best deal.<eos> All we gotta do is search each one until we find it.
Wait, wait.<eos> Clay, use the stick.<eos> Stick?<eos> It's a sharing stick.<eos> You can only speak if you're holding it.
Yes, he's gonna get the rat!<eos> Go in the back. Go in the back.<eos> I don't see no rat here.<eos> Calm down, Dean!<eos> We're getting it.
So glad you've joined us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm gonna need your cell phone.<eos> My phone, why?<eos> You'll get it back at the end of the session.
Mommy. What do you want her for?<eos> She's not that great.<eos> Hey, there you are. Will you tell your daughter you're not that great?<eos> Are you wearing my perfume?<eos> It was next to my cologne, and I accidentally grabbed it and spilled some on myself.
Well, I did once, but then I became known as "the girl who flirted with a dad,"<eos> and that kind of killed my career and a marriage.<eos> And that's why everyone was very confused at your mommy and daddy's wedding.<eos> I-I don't get it.<eos> She giggled at this thing for like ten minutes and suddenly she hates it.
If you could, I wouldn't clock so many hours on the toilet.<eos> Wow, these cocoons are even more boring than the movie of the same name.<eos> Boring?<eos> Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar is digesting itself.<eos> If you were to cut it open, caterpillar guts would ooze out.
He's gone.<eos> This is Agent Elizabeth Keen with the FBI.<eos> I need a medical team. Priority three.<eos> There were three men.<eos> I didn't see a body at first. Just a rug or a rolled-up tarp. But when they put it in the back of the Van it sort of...
We confiscated his lab.<eos> So, he stole yours.<eos> But your memory, the night of the fire.<eos> He stole it from me 25 years ago.<eos> That's why we needed you to get it back.
I never should've left.<eos> I should've fought with him!<eos> No. You were right to follow his instructions.<eos> Because you did, the book is safe.<eos> We need to take it to your mother now.
Well, I'm afraid it is.<eos> Your story book.<eos> Or what's left of it.<eos> No way.<eos> My mom would never burn it.
Henry!<eos> Let's go. Go!<eos> - You did it.<eos> - Kinda. That won't hold very long.<eos> It's okay. The black fairy's got his heart. Gold's gonna get it.
Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I appreciate your optimism, kid, but we got to go.<eos> You think his heart's down here?<eos> I know my mother.<eos> This is where she'd hide it.
- Is everything okay? - No.<eos> The satellite's initiated its preliminary firing sequence.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I'll never hack it in time.
What happened?<eos> She didn't put the money in the bag fast enough, she reached for the alarm?<eos> I never ripped no banks.<eos> I'd never catch a federal charge and go away until I'm gray.<eos> You know, what I'm disappointed about is you and your boy snatch half a mil tax-free, and you drop it on tail?
The lead detective told us that Pettigrew was the person of interest in a kidnapping and murder of a tender age victim that was sexually assaulted.<eos> They brought Pettigrew in, but could never arrest him.<eos> They didn't have enough physical evidence.<eos> You're thinking this guy is a pedophile?<eos> Detective in Detroit thought he was good for it.
No, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Listen, I need to talk to you about next semester.<eos> Corporate said your phone interview went great.<eos> The job is yours if you want it.
And Leah would survive leukemia.<eos> I offered the surgery. She declined it.<eos> Wait!<eos> You said doing the surgery on bypass came with some risks.<eos> What about doing it off bypass?
But mine aren't.<eos> You're stealing the code.<eos> Every day Harris is issued a new authorization code, allowing him to approve the transfer of nuclear material.<eos> Now, I can get into the WIPP facility, but I can't get the uranium without that code and it expires at midnight.<eos> And he keeps it in his briefcase secured with a biometric lock.
"over two light-years from home,<eos> "trapped alone on the shadow side of a planet that as yet had no name"<eos> You read my book.<eos> ShadowSide.<eos> And now you're quoting from it.
In the coming months, we...<eos> The intellectuals, academics, scientists and our writer... have been tasked by Darius Tanz to select 160 people...<eos> to colonize Mars.<eos> Counterintelligence successfully traced the source of the hack.<eos> They call it a mimic signal.

Did you ever imagine we'd be working together someday back when you thought I was a bad guy?<eos> Who says you're a good guy?<eos> First, what I don't understand is, why hide the trigger in an app?<eos> Security?<eos> If somebody accessed your phone, they wouldn't discover it.
- Tina is a boy's name?<eos> - Yeah, short for Christina.<eos> - Mm. - You're right, it's pretty gross.<eos> You don't bake bread.<eos> Let me take it off your hands.
You really think they're gonna enjoy your brown rectangle of dirt with one little house?<eos> - Excuse me, this is an accurate facsimile of a mid-sized switching yard.<eos> And it isn't a "little house."<eos> It's a work shed where the yardmen get their OSHA-mandated eight hours of rest between shifts.<eos> So, yeah, I think the kids are gonna love it.
We spent years crafting that break room into something special, something comfortable.<eos> - A place with so many stains that the new ones just blended in.<eos> - Where the couch cushions were so worn down, they comforted all butts, large or small, flat or juicy.<eos> - Juicy?<eos> - Gross. - We built a masterpiece, and you amateurs flushed it down the toilet. Skir-plash.
- Sorry, guys, we're stuck with the nice, clean expensive sofa.<eos> But I guess we'll just have to make do.<eos> - Oh, we'll make do.<eos> - We'll make do all over it.<eos> - Well, I just mean we'll fix it.
Well, off to death.<eos> - This place is awesome.<eos> I've always wanted to work in a covert facility.<eos> We're in a black site, Rosa.<eos> I bet they have some awesome name for it.
I didn't think so.<eos> The mortgage is paid off.<eos> You can give the place to whoever you want. I don't care.<eos> Actually, I do care.<eos> Don't give it to Hitchcock.
All men are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights!<eos> That is where America is!<eos> Love it or leave it!<eos> You better love it or you better leave it.<eos> You take this stick and you hit it, and candy flies out of it.
All right, ladies, I'm going to put this as gently as I can, but it appears that someone's rectum fell out on the stairs.<eos> Now, whose is it?<eos> Be honest.<eos> All right, that's fine.<eos> But let's just agree on a rule that if your rectum falls out on the stairs, it's on you to pick it up.
And two... If you've got something you need to tell Paige, you need to man up and tell her yourself!<eos> Happy, where are we on a solution?<eos> I think we've got something.<eos> The chief's firehouse covers the airport, which means it carries a tank of high-expansion concentrate for jet-fuel fires.<eos> We're going to remove the nozzle from the hose. Cabe slides it in through the cracks in the rocks. You need to tie a knot at the bottom of the hose and put it underneath the rocks that are pinning you down.
What the...?<eos> You can't see the bride!<eos> My dress is in San Jose.<eos> I picked out something beautiful.<eos> Can't afford it. You'll wear it once, then return it.
On the radio, a weather front, out in the Pacific...<eos> Oh, you think?<eos> We already know.<eos> It's disrupted the fire.<eos> We don't think the boat will be able to see it when it passes by in a few minutes.
What's up?<eos> Hi, Chloe.<eos> Did you get any of my calls?<eos> Doesn't matter. The Sudanese have confirmation of Mitchell's poor health.<eos> They're leaking it to the press.
- An F-35 should have the transmitter in range in just a minute, sir.<eos> That's cutting it a little close. We have Minister Bellucci.<eos> Mr. President, our jets are almost in position to shoot down the drone.<eos> Minister Bellucci, it's Elizabeth McCord here.<eos> We have reason to believe that there could be a biological weapon on the drone; if you hit it over a populated area, you run the risk of causing a pandemic.
Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> What do I owe you?<eos> Oh, I don't know, how about a million dollars?<eos> - Okay, just don't cash it till Friday. - Ah.
Chop-chop. Geez, I mean, what kind of family would we be if we didn't support Mom's dreams?<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> - Yeah, we really...<eos> - I can't wait.<eos> - You know what, of course we'll read it.
Bear claw, good choice, Rebecca.<eos> That's right, I learned your name.<eos> I learned everybody's names.<eos> Emily... I've been thinking.<eos> Even though you lost the match and the office is mine to do with whatever I want, I'm going to give it to you anyway.
FBI director James Comey announced the bureau is renewing its investigation into her personal e-mail server.<eos> Crooked Hillary Clinton.<eos> It's not clear if the tightening in the polls stems from FBI director James Comey's widely condemned disclosure.<eos> Donald Trump has taken this country to the brink.<eos> And tomorrow, voters are likely to take it back.
All right. Stay low and get to it.<eos> When you hear my signal, throw the switch.<eos> What's the signal?<eos> Haven't figured that out yet.<eos> You'll know it when you hear it.
Talk to someone anonymously. Just talk to someone because the minute you start talking, it gets easier.<eos> And just know that there's life beyond what you're feeling at the moment.<eos> I promise it will get better.<eos> There is an entire future of incredible things waiting for you.<eos> And if you go, you don't get to-- You don't get to see it.
Which means, even inside the walls there's a future.<eos> This is the worst...<eos> Why did the Coordinate have to fall into the hands of the worst person imaginable?<eos> We've gotta get it back...<eos> I can say... without a doubt the one person in the world I wouldn't want to have it Eren... is you!
Maybe I can give them some of the gummy worms from my secret hiding spot to make them feel better.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Whoa, look at this.<eos> We'll just have the landlord fix it.
- ♪ Long G. ♪<eos> I'm here to give Mr. Gunderson his shot.<eos> Boy, the "putting him in a coma" idea was just dinner table chatter. I did not sign off.<eos> You tapped your nose.<eos> I was scratching it.
And can't talk about it to anyone now.<eos> They never know.<eos> "Do you know anything about the dog?" "Uh, she's afraid of pennies. [audience laughing] So, we think maybe somebody's been throwing handfuls of pennies at her face.<eos> But, otherwise, no."<eos> So, you take this random dog and just put it in your house with your family, and watch their personality unfold. [audience laughing] This dog is insane.
What does she just, like, get-- You're right there.<eos> Was there, like, a sign that says, "One dip per goddess"?<eos> You ever color an Easter egg?<eos> It's not that complicated.<eos> You dip it, and then you hold it differently and dip it again.
[women] Whoo!<eos> [laughs] It was a very different country when it was made from whenever you're watching.<eos> But anyway... [audience laughing] We had a whole other thing going on.<eos> This building's not here anymore. [audience laughing] But...<eos> You're watching it on a dusty thing, and it's all rubble.
Well, Fessler's got a nicer arse.<eos> Probationary period's over, here's your performance review.<eos> Check it over.<eos> Happy, sign it.<eos> - The job's your permanently... if you want it.
If you do get too successful, it's sort of, there's something that's...<eos> You feel ugly.<eos> Being a salesman and going out and talking about the movie and selling the film, that was the part of the business that I think he was least comfortable with...<eos> Really, really had a hard time with.<eos> He wanted fame... And then when he got it, he didn't want it.
At first, I was a little taken aback, 'cause I have to say that or he'll watch it anyway.<eos> It doesn't look like he's self-aware.<eos> It just got better.<eos> Take after take, he tried to hit a target.<eos> There is a target he tried to hit, and when he hits it, it's beautiful.
[chuckling] Strip him.<eos> Really wish we hadn't have done that.<eos> I can never unsee him naked.<eos> I mean, the size of that thing.<eos> Hollow that big bastard out, you could use it for an umbrella stand.
Whaaat?<eos> Throw a chunk of potato or some pepper in there, cap it.<eos> The steam pressure shoves it in the hole and seals it up.<eos> Same with an egg.<eos> Ya crack it in, it cooks on the way to the hole. Bull...
- I'm, heading out tonight, I, um...<eos> - Where you going?<eos> Oh, just a club.<eos> Which club?<eos> Oh, dunno, I didn't choose it.
You would have wrecked it anyway.<eos> You with me or what?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To a club in Dallas.<eos> The club's for you guys. The girl who's running it, though... I've been trying to hit that for months.
No.<eos> No way.<eos> We have run the numbers, okay?<eos> I mean, the secret of who really wrote the book is good for business, absolutely.<eos> But someone solving it would be just as good.
You're dead now, bitch.<eos> Looks like somebody fucked you up, esa.<eos> She's with us.<eos> Drop the shiv. Leave.<eos> Before I put it in your eye!
- Yeah.<eos> - That'd give it a diameter of, what, - 40 inches, right?<eos> - Give or take.<eos> Why?<eos> Let's say your snake does exist, but nobody can find it because nobody can see it.
They crush them to death first, and then slowly eat them.<eos> Other animals swallow their prey whole.<eos> Monkfish, certain frogs.<eos> Maybe this snake is just borrowing one of their tricks.<eos> Yeah, but if it can do all that, how are we gonna find it?
W-Wait, you two know each other?<eos> Well, Donald was the public face of the manhunt for Raymond when he was on the run with Elizabeth Keen.<eos> Everyone in my world knows Donald Ressler.<eos> We're here to make a deal with you.<eos> If there's a deal to make, I'll make it with Agent Ressler.
You won't be using that arm again.<eos> But it's your left arm. I know you're right-handed.<eos> I know that because we've worked together for 11 years.<eos> I know your wife has diabetes, that your daughter's favorite animal is a hippo.<eos> I know you love Chinese food, that you eat it every Wednesday when you shack up with your girlfriend in her apartment above WuFat Noodle House.
Roy told my colleagues yesterday that he'd been following the husband of one of your clients.<eos> We'd like that man's name. Why?<eos> You think he had something to do with this?<eos> It's a possibility we're exploring.<eos> Given the work you do here and the kind of clients you do it for, that man may have been hiding millions from his wife.
Not to mention, Clay Nelson isn't the only sports star to hit my desk recently.<eos> Nobody cares about Tyler Perati, mate.<eos> It's demigod Clay Nelson the public are crying for.<eos> I've had the Sports Minister and the Premier on the phone this morning.<eos> Mate, when the brief is ready, if we think it's strong, then we'll present it.
One year, when Janet was, eight or nine, she lost a tooth.<eos> She told us she didn't believe in the Tooth Fairy at all.<eos> And I said, "Of course there's a Tooth Fairy."<eos> And she said, well, if I was right, then the Tooth Fairy would know where the tooth was, no matter where she hid it.<eos> So, that night, she took it out of the glass of water by her bed, and I had to wait till she was fast asleep and crawl around her room in the dark, trying to find it.
I kept it for ages somewhere.<eos> Yeah, it was in a cufflinks case.<eos> - You found it?<eos> I looked for months.<eos> I had to search everywhere, but I knew you would have kept it.
No. I dare to try to make mine. And my family's safer.<eos> I saw the Widows destroy the second seal.<eos> It requires a devilry I'm not certain even you can muster.<eos> Well, you've seen me before coffee, right?<eos> And if you break it, and if Clootie rises, how do you propose to kill the mighty demon Wyatt himself could not put in the grave
- Come on!<eos> What are you so afraid of?<eos> Damn it, woman, I just told you to shoot me.<eos> Doc, listen to me!<eos> If I don't break the seal, the Widows will find it and they will kill you anyway.
- Amado will keep them under control.<eos> - I know them, Güero.<eos> They won't sit and relax.<eos> One with sugar.<eos> I don't want to drink it.
Oh, is he in the Peace Corps, too? Yeah!<eos> So, why don't you set next Saturday aside...<eos> Okay, wait. Courthouse?<eos> She needs a wedding.<eos> Why don't we do it at my BB?
Nah, sorry. I don't have time to play nice anymore.<eos> Here's our card.<eos> Let us know if you... see him.<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know for sure yet, but I feel it in my gut.
So, Mercedes attacked Nicole.<eos> Why? Widow Mercedes thought that Nicole had the third seal.<eos> Not possible.<eos> It's safe and sound, and it's the only thing keeping Clootie from resurrecting.<eos> The Widows won't find it.
I mean, it's enough back into place for me.<eos> There's no complaining from this guy.<eos> Kind of like a cork being put back in a bottle.<eos> Almost too small.<eos> Well, it's not malignant, but I'm still glad they took it out.
I need Mike to drop that case.<eos> You telling me to go back on my word because your client's bullying you?<eos> It's one pro Bono.<eos> He can drop it.<eos> If I give you an assignment, you do it.
I know that you didn't feel valued at Pearson Specter, and I wanted to apologize for my part in that.<eos> I also just--I wanted you to know that it was never my intention to get you fired.<eos> I hope you're not here to offer me my job back.<eos> - And what if I said I was?<eos> - I'd say I wouldn't take it.
I certainly have not.<eos> Doctor, you might wanna, you know...<eos> elaborate. Oh.<eos> No, my iron carving wood.<eos> I-I-I left it right here.
But we still don't know who was involved.<eos> I mean, the president, anyone.<eos> Anyone could be culpable or innocent.<eos> I can't believe Harris would be complicit in something this evil.<eos> If NASA launches the gravity tractor, then the Russians will blow it out of the sky. Thinking we're trying to weaponize another asteroid.

I was very nearly the official voice of CBS.<eos> Yes he was... I'm sorry, I did not mean to interrupt you, but you did such a beautiful audition for CBS.<eos> Would you do for them tonight your CBS audition?<eos> I don't know if the audience wants to hear it.<eos> I was gonna do it regardless, you know.
Which brings us to tonight.<eos> You see, over the years, I've written several plays for Gil and I to perform...<eos> - George, you remember the first?<eos> - The first play we ever did?<eos> - Yes. - Yes. I'll never forget it.
Do you have any memorabilia from films, things you've taken that are special to you? - Yes.<eos> - Would you name them now?<eos> I have my Three Amigos outfit.<eos> - Do you ever put it on?<eos> - Do I ever put it on?
You go to 44th and 8th to that hand-job parlor?<eos> What's it called again, Shake Shack?<eos> [music stops] Oh, yeah, come in our Wacky Shack and we'll shake you off, and there's a line of goddamn families going out of there?<eos> While you're waiting, here's a vibrating butt plug to stick up your tush.<eos> So I take this nasty thing and shove it in my prostate, while I give myself a shake off.
Donna, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About the fact that I'm pissed off.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment and she handed it off.
Actually, I do mind.<eos> Excuse me, Stephanie, I'm speaking to you.<eos> It doesn't matter what year you are.<eos> I'm head of the associates.<eos> If I give you an assignment, you do it.
Start!<eos> I am Groot.<eos> You're right, bud.<eos> Next time we don't ask.<eos> Just grab the helmet and stick it in the sack.
No one is taking sides.<eos> We are merely trying to protect the child.<eos> I wore that helmet once, and its power nearly destroyed me.<eos> You have to give it up.<eos> No way! Don't worry, Sam. The helmet was fixed since then, and no one's gonna take it away from you.
Maintain formation.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> He's going supernova!<eos> - That flash...<eos> - I've seen it before.
- Katie, does this...<eos> - No.<eos> Any new thoughts on what the fall color will be?<eos> I'm still trying to crack it.<eos> It's like I can see it in the corner of my mind's eye, and then I turn and look, and it's gone.
Uh, can anyone say, "Lame"?<eos> Put that thing down.<eos> Hey, babe, did you remember to bring the box fan?<eos> - Those cabins get really hot.<eos> - Uh, no, I thought you were bringing it.
Darmani Rock.<eos> I regret walking out of the ring like that, but... I fuckin' wanted the Golden Boy award.<eos> God, I never fuckin' get it.<eos> I've fought... I've won fuckin' 12 national championships for this goddamn country, and not once have they given me fighter of the tournament.<eos> Statistically, I'm supposed to get it one out of every ten times. I fuckin' won it 12.
My memory isn't the problem.<eos> That drive requires a unique crystal lining to operate it.<eos> We extracted that crystal from a meteorite that Darius owns.<eos> And it's the only one of its kind on Earth.<eos> The most important oneofakind device in human history, and no one at Tanz Industries even thought to properly vet the man building it?
Okay.<eos> I need you to start on those RSVPs.<eos> Oh, and my green juice.<eos> I need my juice.<eos> I'll get right on it.
Well, believe me, no one is more surprised about where it ended up than I am.<eos> I know.<eos> You have this idea of the kind of writer you should be, but... don't let that keep you from the kind of writer you could be.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We're uploading it right now.
- I say, was it something I said?<eos> - I don't...<eos> Jeez, how long was I out?<eos> Ooh! That nap was incredible.<eos> I really went for it.
Ice King:<eos> Oh, yeah. I like this room, too.<eos> It's where I do all my deep thinking.<eos> Man, I still can't believe it...<eos> The Fionna in my bathroom, touching my toothbrush, throwing it into my little trash can.
Is there a paperless post?<eos> Yes, I will add you to the paperless post.<eos> Add me because I have a funny comment I want to put on it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Okay, I'm Binging it right now.
Right?<eos> Me too, I mean, he was wearing a leather jacket.<eos> I won't even splurge on a leather jacket.<eos> Well, maybe we shouldn't be spending so much money on chicken.<eos> Maybe we should be stealing it so we can afford a sweet leather "J".
Evening.<eos> Good evening.<eos> As promised, here is the manuscript.<eos> Right on schedule.<eos> I will read it over carefully.
Though the winning work, Drifting Emotions , has the word "emotions" in the title, there is no single emotional expression in it.<eos> The bland daily life of a woman working at a cafe.<eos> The rambling conversations between her and her bedridden mother.<eos> Even on the final page of the novel, we never learn the names of the characters.<eos> However... what has stayed with each and every one of us that read it is an undeniable emotion.
I heard more than 400 thousand copies have been sold.<eos> Really?<eos> Amazing!<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> Lots of people are reading it.
No...<eos> Xeron, attacking the Sphinx will only endanger my friends.<eos> We must attempt to solve the riddle.<eos> All that matters is retrieving the beacon.<eos> And I will use it to summon the Warlock and destroy him.
A riddle to ponder, perhaps.<eos> Okay, how's about we save the hugs for when we get outta here?<eos> Great.<eos> The entrance is still gone.<eos> The Sphinx called it a test.
I'm sure it's a who's who...<eos> Of penises, obviously.<eos> Uh, yeah, I think I'll take the platter.<eos> Does that serve 15, because I'm throwing a goddess... sorry... party this weekend, it's surprisingly hard to say.<eos> Yeah, no, of course, yeah, I will pick it up Saturday.
I don't want you to do it, I want to get it.<eos> - No.<eos> - All right.<eos> This guy.<eos> It looks to me like she's gonna get it.
Wong.<eos> Breaking the laws of nature.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, don't stop now.<eos> When the sanctum's restored, they'll attack it again.
It's smoking already.<eos> Embers.<eos> Spark of life.<eos> Now, you throw this into your tinder stack.<eos> And you pick it up.
- You know what?<eos> That book was our baby. And you abandoned that baby before it even learned to fly!<eos> Okay, well, books can't fly. And neither can babies, so...<eos> You don't know. I'll tell you what.<eos> If I had a human baby that could fly, I wouldn't be telling the press about it.
That's Ed's son. Ed Junior.<eos> Okay. That's obviously who I meant. That's...<eos> Hi, Junior. If I may, when is the last time the paranormal entity was actually seen?<eos> And if you were to rank it, let's say between probably a T1 and T5...<eos> Garret here saw it on Tuesday, and I believe it made him soil himself.
Checking the settings. We look good.<eos> What is that?<eos> Looks like one of those things that makes cotton candy.<eos> It's a PKE meter.<eos> There's a ghost anywhere around here, this baby's gonna find it.
- I will preach.<eos> You know what we're gonna do, ladies?<eos> We're gonna catch a ghost, we're gonna bring...<eos> God.<eos> We're gonna catch a ghost, bring it back to the lab...
You know that we only comprehend about 4% of the universe. 4%!<eos> - Across the board! It's four!<eos> - Abby, Abby...<eos> We all believe in the scientific method. I've dedicated my life to it.<eos> And we have actually done it.
- Okay.<eos> Nice!<eos> Yeah, my mistake. It was a medium poof.<eos> This puppy I like to call a Ghost Chipper.<eos> Hollow-laser technology, sucks in the ghost and neutralizes it.
- Yeah, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Put it back on.<eos> - Could you please put down your knife?<eos> Put it back on.
You have a purpose.<eos> You're always happy.<eos> How's your book coming along?<eos> I've never written about me before.<eos> I think it's some of the best work I've ever done, and I don't even know why I'm doing it.
I left a big ass demo charge down there in that subway.<eos> There's a flooded tunnel, leads right underneath that building.<eos> SEALs, they can recover the charge, swim in underneath that thing's feet.<eos> We get in its face and distract the hell out of that son of a bitch so the swimmers can blow the bomb.<eos> That's how we take it out.
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's a reason I'm in this cab today.<eos> Yeah, sir, you called for it, remember?<eos> No, my slender brown friend.<eos> Love is a beautiful thing.<eos> When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream.
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer... and there were all these new experimental drugs from Germany.<eos> Vanessa's already working on Plan A, B, all the way through Z.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm memorizing the details of her face.<eos> Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
You know, first few months, they only see black and white.<eos> This will help stimulate spatial awareness.<eos> Or early onset motion sickness.<eos> I got him one of these. A bouncy chair.<eos> Not quite sure where we're going to put it.
All right.<eos> You're talking to a published author.<eos> Online, Mom.<eos> I sent you the website.<eos> Yes, they know about it.
You work for him.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I work for Minister Belloch.<eos> I want the route Roldan is taking from Laos.<eos> I'll give you 100 million pesetas to get it for me.
Look.<eos> More scrap Anderson.<eos> Oh, fits perfect.<eos> We'll own all the coal soon.<eos> They're going to nationalise it.
Okay?<eos> You want to beat Durán, you're going to have to humiliate him.<eos> You're going to have to shame him, right there, in front of everyone.<eos> It's not going to work.<eos> Sorry. Sorry, you have to defend the title. Or what they'll do is they'll just take it away.
"Special project"?<eos> Sammy.<eos> I'm not... I'm afraid that project is going to die in RD.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I gave it to you. I teed it up perfectly. Are you kidding me?
The Indianapolis is a heavy cruiser designed to take out enemy ships and aircraft, but our guns are useless against submarines.<eos> That's why normally, we are sent out with an escort of destroyers in front of us that act as blockers.<eos> Their job is to detect and destroy enemy subs with depth charges before they can get to us.<eos> Many of the crew are mere boys with no idea of the danger we face out here at sea.<eos> If we are fired upon by an enemy sub and if miraculously we spot it early enough, we have at maximum four minutes before the torpedo arrives.
Stick your hand out.<eos> It's Theodore, you dummy.<eos> You little turd!<eos> We found your book on a dead guy, man.<eos> I gave it to a sailor for comfort.
Thank you, darling!<eos> We are living the dream, darling. We are, darling.<eos> Here I am, Edina Monsoon, on my way to... my book launch. Yeah.<eos> Oh, darling, I lost my pelvic floor on takeoff.<eos> Don't worry. We'll pick it up on the way back.
What kind of question's that?<eos> Of course it's dangerous!<eos> You want safe job, work in IKEA!<eos> Don't question me!<eos> If you don't want it, I don't care.
On the record.<eos> You know what I think.<eos> What, you think I'm ruining my own project?<eos> I'm sorry, our project.<eos> I think you know you're ruining it, but it's easier for you to blame me.
You got it?<eos> Hey, you're not gonna hurt me. All right.<eos> Like that, but stronger.<eos> Good.<eos> Now at the end, you'll grab my wrist and pull it toward you.
How long is a little while?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Not too long.<eos> I'm not gonna have your address.<eos> I want you to give it to Dion.
Who?<eos> LUCAS: Oh, there you are!<eos> I've been looking all over for you.<eos> LUCAS:<eos> My book, I was looking all over for it.
No, you're coming with me.<eos> Yeah, whatever you need to tell yourself, that's fine.<eos> From what I can see, your wee band won't do too well without me.<eos> No...<eos> Whatever power this mirror contains, I'll not let Freya wield it.
Yeah, whatever you need to tell yourself, that's fine.<eos> From what I can see, your wee band won't do too well without me.<eos> No...<eos> Whatever power this mirror contains, I'll not let Freya wield it.<eos> We'll find it, and we'll bring it to the Sanctuary.
I had my daughter, mom.<eos> She's just starting to look like something that might turn into a person.<eos> I was so scared.<eos> But now looking back on all the lives and stories of others, I know it will be alright.<eos> Some people can't see the love they have until they see it through someone else's eyes.
Lust, perfectly natural.<eos> I can see that my words are not lost on you, Marisol.<eos> It is refreshing.<eos> So few these days possess any openness of mind.<eos> But if I may, Marisol, this veil that you wear offers only false comfort. Remove it.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Let me just give you a little bit of advice, okay?<eos> - What?<eos> - Go with that mall rap again.<eos> I don't know if you remember it.
We're having more fun in the studio.<eos> It's getting more experimental.<eos> The songs were gettin' better, more interesting.<eos> # And I'm still... # There weren't, like, big plans. You know, sometimes it just unfolded.<eos> John was not mechanically minded, and he took a tape on, and the tape had run off to the other reel, and he put it on like it was the start, but it was the end of the song and that's when the guitar came.
I done died and went to Heaven.<eos> But he got your name, though.<eos> One morning, Saint Peter was looking at his book, and he was marking it up for the Judgement, and he let me see your name.<eos> He got it in there under "M."<eos> He got Rose's name. I ain't seen it like I seen yours, but I know it's in there.
Eleven o'clock, thank you very much.<eos> Okay, now we control her dating app.<eos> He bought it.<eos> When you enter, you will trigger his alarm.<eos> I can silence it, but it will send him a signal.
Oh, my God.<eos> You look gorgeous.<eos> I'm wearing a bra, a new bra.<eos> It's not new.<eos> It's old. I just haven't worn it in a while.
It just feels weird, you know?<eos> Listen to me...<eos> Your dad believed in you.<eos> That's why he gave you that note.<eos> He knew that you'd take the money and use it...
Like, I use this word, "assuage"...<eos> All the time.<eos> Can you assuage me the ketchup?<eos> Can I assuage you a few questions?<eos> - Is that the meaning of it?
And then he was seen acting in an agitated and very suspicious manner mere feet from St. Francis convent.<eos> But mostly, ladies and gentlemen,<eos> you take it from the boy's words. You take it from his own words.<eos> He's already confessed to the crime. To his arresting officers.<eos> He admitted it to fellow prisoners.
This is exactly what I need.<eos> (HUMMING)<eos> But, sir, that entire region is heavily patrolled by the Galactic Rangers!<eos> We will have this planet!<eos> And we will take it by going on the offensive.
Man, we're just worried about you, all right?<eos> I mean, school hasn't even started yet, and, guys, correct me if I'm wrong, but you are the official frontrunner for the Freshman Numb-Nut of the Year award, right, guys?<eos> - The what award?<eos> - It's the annual award.<eos> We give it out to the most clueless freshman.
It'd be nice if we could find it. You haven't come across it by any chance, have you?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Harrison believed it would be worth more than just money.<eos> Harrison believed it would open portals to other dimensions.<eos> And if that's the case and we find it,
The Egyptian Princess?<eos> I read some of Harrison's journal and I caught on to some of the storyline, but the jargon was pretty much over my head.<eos> Well, to answer your question, yes, I do have a theory.<eos> I think the locket, or the "locket of light"<eos> as some would like to call it, sent the spirit to a purgatory-like place, for all eternity.
Whatever happened to that jaguar...<eos> The traffic cams would have caught it!<eos> Bingo!<eos> Pretty sneaky, slick!<eos> However, if you didn't have access to the system before... I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now.
- So, everything's okay?<eos> - Oh, yeah, no.<eos> I just had to disconnect the engine before I came into the lobby.<eos> - Why?<eos> - To make sure no one wires it.
But to tell you the truth, I have no idea how this is done in the KSA.<eos> I mean Mr. Alan Clay meeting Dr. Zahra Hakem outside of the hospital.<eos> "And I hope it doesn't appear too inappropriate to ask you for advice."<eos> "I'll pick you up on Wednesday at noon."<eos> I'll write your initials on a card "and put it on the windshield."
Well, it's nice to meet you.<eos> We've come to get a book that your husband's been kind enough to look after for me.<eos> Oh, yeah, the book.<eos> Well, it's somewhere inside the house.<eos> As soon as I have a chance, I'll find it, and I'll put it in the mail.
All right.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Was there ever a time when you thought that cheating was wrong?<eos> Of course.<eos> I still do. Then how do you justify it?
Today's the 22nd.<eos> Today.<eos> Birthday.<eos> Sometimes I feel the danger as if it were so physical.<eos> I actually feel it.
- Yeah.<eos> You put it on, you lick it off.<eos> You feel much better.<eos> It's nature's ointment.<eos> I put it everywhere.
It's just drainage. It goes to the city cistern.<eos> We are looking for a large underground space perhaps with columns, artificially lit from within.<eos> That's it. The ancient cistern.<eos> Sixth century.<eos> Well, some call it "The Sunken Palace."
Fine.<eos> Then scream at the top of your lungs and invent and lead!<eos> If you love humanity, if you love this planet, you'd do anything to save it.<eos> The greatest sins in human history have been committed in the name of love.<eos> No one will look on this act and call it love.
It was posted in class, and I emailed you a copy, and slid one into your locker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just haven't checked it yet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I get it.
Don't swallow the key.<eos> Please don't. Please.<eos> Please stop.<eos> So now you control your fate.<eos> Tell me the story, so I won't send the elevator down, because, if I send it down to the basement, there's no way for it to be down there and you to still be here.
Cowan, I know I'm new here, but as far as I can tell, people who don't even know you, think you're an asshole.<eos> - And you?<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> You don't know me, but my first year in the Academy, you gave a talk.<eos> The "long game" you called it.
This makes no sense.<eos> Okay, sorry.<eos> At least, and I know this isn't much consolation, but apparently we're now surrounded by Chinese food. - Right?<eos> - Guys...<eos> I think where we are right now, they don't refer to it as "Chinese food." It's just called "food."
- The stick can unencode anything.<eos> It can open up a back door into any computer on the planet.<eos> - Including his.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right, we not only make him think that we have it, but that we're going to use it to expose and destroy him.
I tried to hang on to it for 30 years.<eos> It just had a funny way of slipping out of my hands.<eos> The thing has a life of its own.<eos> It doesn't wanna stay in a box.<eos> It's got a way of influencing the world around it.
Thing just scatters itself all around town.<eos> I remember investigating that crash.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Anyhow, middle of the bayou ain't a bad place to hide the thing.<eos> So I stuck around town for a while, just in case someone stumbled upon it.
- I can't kill my little girl.<eos> - That ain't your little girl down there.<eos> I don't understand!<eos> Wouldn't it just be the same problems but inside of me now?<eos> What we're gonna do is make poison, you drink it. You go down there, do the deed wait to die, you will be with your girl.
- Oh, shall I put it on your room?<eos> - Rooms.<eos> We're not... Separate rooms.<eos> - So you want separate bills?<eos> - No, no, no. Put it on my room, 106.
Second, I am not the police, So you can be frank with me.<eos> You did this?<eos> I wrote the software.<eos> Not bad for a young man.<eos> Where did you get it?
And the plan would not work without you.<eos> Good.<eos> Then, after they tell me, why do I need you?<eos> Because we know how to do this job.<eos> I would have people to do it for me, Probably even better.
People of Bana, my friends and I cross the universe only to find you..<eos> this was no accident.<eos> It was fate that brought us here to this place.<eos> You are the citizen of a Bana that once was, a Bana that will be again.<eos> Zhong laid waste to our planet, but together we're taking it back!
Okay.<eos> Your bastard science works to sever the bridge in between the body and mind.<eos> That way they can do terrible things to us without anyone ever knowing.<eos> This world is full of wisdom.<eos> Nobody ever questions it.
Someone had a rough day.<eos> What happens if there's still people living here? I mean..<eos> What is this place now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No matter what, I'm finding that laptop and I'm gonna fuckin' smash it.
We want the truth!<eos> Justice for all!<eos> You do have a plan, right?<eos> I didn't hear anything about a prisoner transfer.<eos> Well, you're hearing it from me.
Come on, Dinosaurs!<eos> Use the Jurassic super strength!<eos> Watch out , kids!<eos> The weasel has landed.<eos> I will push it in Go to Betshez and Ellie.
God, I got to work on that acronym.<eos> An extremely costly method, of hijacking the hippocampus to clear... traumatic memories.<eos> It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport, or the things I did to avoid processing my grief.<eos> Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment.<eos> No one in the right mind would ever funded it.
- No.<eos> I owe you again.<eos> I'm keeping a list.<eos> You know, he kind of try to kill me.<eos> Sorry, I'll put it on the list.
Stay down.<eos> Final warning.<eos> I can do this all day.<eos> That shield does not belong to you.<eos> You don't deserve it!
You're out of your mind. No way.<eos> That's out of the question.<eos> Mr. Snyder is not a registered Olympic trainer.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, I hope you know all the words to the German national anthem, because you'll be hearing it every time one of those Nazis win a medal I would've won.
Okay then.<eos> Let me give you my card.<eos> - And if you change your mind.<eos> - You don't need to waste your cards.<eos> Please keep it.
In the beginning... there was only ocean... until the mother island emerged.<eos> Te Fiti.<eos> Her heart held the greatest power ever known. It could create life itself.<eos> And Te Fiti shared it with the world.
Te Fiti.<eos> Her heart held the greatest power ever known. It could create life itself.<eos> And Te Fiti shared it with the world.<eos> But in time... some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.<eos> They believed if they could possess it... the great power of creation would be theirs.
I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.<eos> You are not my hero.<eos> And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!<eos> I'm here 'cause you stole the heart of Te Fiti!<eos> And you will board my boat... and sail across the sea and put it back!
What are you doing?<eos> Escaping!<eos> The heart!<eos> Forget it!<eos> You'll never get it back!
Hey, we just have to pretend that we have no idea that something went wrong.<eos> Ben and Ashleigh, they will vouch for us because they don't want this to go any further either.<eos> Who would hire a company like this?<eos> You would!<eos> Okay, listen. My uncle, he has this plot of undeveloped land in the desert just outside of San Bernardino, we're gonna take the body there, we're gonna dump it, and then we're gonna come back here and pretend like nothing happened, okay?
No?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Did you lose a cat?<eos> Hello?<eos> I've got a little ginger cat down here, if anyone's looking for it.
- Wing Commander.<eos> - Frank.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> We haven't been introduced.<eos> Okay, Frank, whatever the job is, I don't want it.
Hello, trouble.<eos> Don't you sneak up on me like that.<eos> The past can define our future.<eos> But I won't let it.
I only want to know where it is, who bought it...<eos> Who do you think I am, Interpol?<eos> Go on, get out of here.<eos> We're not serving hippies today. Do you remember me?<eos> I was in the tree, I climbed up while you were uprooting it.
- It's a star.<eos> - What's the date?<eos> The website is up to date, must still be there.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> They're using it as the company logo!
When we accepted Mr. Gorbicht's donation, our intentions were well meant, but a mistake.<eos> Many young members of our community are aware of the sacredness of nature, and the environment, so after much prayer, we have made a decision.<eos> We would like this sacred tree to bring peace and harmony to your family, especially to the elderly gentleman who has cared for it his entire life.<eos> Clearly, it should be returned to the spot where it was planted and grew."<eos> They're giving it back!
Okay, you gotta get your shit in order.<eos> Just listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> The entire case rests on this.<eos> We have a case here, and we're gonna win it.
Now, you did, every time.<eos> Feel like I'm a little bit in over my head to be honest.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Hey, let me tell you the worst vice is advice.<eos> I just been giving it to you.
I've put out a warning and we've got uniform on the beach.<eos> The bags are still coming in, but not so many.<eos> And I spoke to the coastguard.<eos> Given yesterday's wind, their guess is that the rucksack went in somewhere due south of St Ninian's.<eos> Or it could have been dumped where we found it.
Who's that?<eos> The man that fixed the World Cup.<eos> The trophy that went missing last year?<eos> All that in the paper about a dog finding it?<eos> It was Harry got it back.
- What the hell are you doing? - God!<eos> God, Jesus!<eos> Dad...<eos> Your mother puts orange juice in that thing.<eos> I'm gonna wash it.
It is a frigid, dreary outpost full of pathetic, peace-loving cowards.<eos> You speak of it as if you have actually been there.<eos> Where do you think I was when Viktor wasted years with Selene?<eos> Prepare yourself.<eos> The journey's long, and I need you to take it alone.
Are you ready?<eos> All right.<eos> It's heavy.<eos> Open your hands out like this.<eos> Like this, so you can catch it.
"Mama's got cancer" or, "My fucking foot is falling off."<eos> "I'm trying to get my life back together."<eos> You know, "I got a little lost there in my teens, and now I'm really working on myself, man," and,<eos> "Oh, you know, my dad, he died in Iraq."<eos> Any sad spiel, and they'll just say it over and over and over again until it's meaningless.
Okay, do your thing.<eos> Do your thing.<eos> Do your thing.<eos> Do your thing.<eos> I got you a present, and now I'm gonna throw it in the garbage.
- Yeah, go for it, Lewis.<eos> Ya know, here's a question:<eos> Somebody builds a safe in the back of a grocery store, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - And we found it.
- I'm in position.<eos> - Good.<eos> Hey, where did you put your wire, anyway?<eos> That's not important.<eos> Let's just say we should probably throw it out when we're done.
Are you still waiting on someone? Or can I take this plate away?<eos> - Yeah, you can take it away.<eos> - No no no, you can leave it.<eos> No, take it.<eos> I'd like to keep it.
He was a legend.<eos> To Thad!<eos> To Thad!<eos> Then why can't I taste any?<eos> You telling me there's lime in this, I can't taste a goddamn ounce of it!
What kind of trap?<eos> You said your father made a trap.<eos> The reactor.<eos> He's placed a weakness there.<eos> He's been hiding it for years.
- Good night.<eos> At one minute before 1:00 this morning, the switchboard at the U.S. Capitol received a phone call.<eos> A man's voice said a bomb would go off in the building in half an hour.<eos> At 1:30 in the morning, it did, in a small, unmarked restroom on the ground floor of the Senate side, next to a barbershop and near several small offices, including one committee hearing room.<eos> For a report on the first serious damage to the nation's foremost structure since the British burned it in 1814, here is congressional correspondent Lawrence Lawson.
-Let me think about it.<eos> In any case, I'd have to run it past Fort Meade.<eos> -Ôcourse.<eos> -Did you have a name?<eos> Yeah, if it's not taken, I'd call it Heartbeat.
Everybody.<eos> And if they say they don't, they're lying.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> But everybody thinks it ought to be given out, free of charge like Mardi Gras beads.<eos> Especially to them because, of course, they're gonna do good with it.
- What's the announcement?<eos> - Hell if I know!<eos> Anything to turn off those goddamn cameras in Atlantic City.<eos> I began to scream... and one white man hit me in my head and told me to hush.<eos> My dress had worked up high, so I pulled it down.
Like that...<eos> Like the Grim Reaper.<eos> I figure I'm gonna die up in these mountains anyway so...<eos> I don't know... just a nickname.<eos> I didn't beg it.
Check it.<eos> Suck my motherfucking balls.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> How am I supposed to work with this inferior goddamn equipment?<eos> Is that what the ladies are calling it now?
- It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!<eos> - No, it can't.<eos> 'It's called Pepper's Ghost.<eos> 'A simple reflection in glass of a living, breathing person.<eos> 'Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.'
Mr. Umberto, it's James Harvey, Millennium Realty.<eos> Yes, I wanted to cal! And let you know that in the next few months about a dozen houses in your neighborhood are gonna be foreclosed.<eos> And once the bank forecloses those houses, the overall property value for the block goes down.<eos> Pretty soon what you had, what you have now, isn't worth much.<eos> Split it between these.
How do you know Barbara?<eos> - We used to dance together in San Francisco.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> Well, I hope you like the apartment.<eos> It's a bit garish but Barbara wanted it that way.
- He's a detective and he's everything a woman could ever want.<eos> He's strong and handsome, smart and kind.<eos> I just know that he's the one.<eos> He even gave me this ring.<eos> I call it my magic ring.
- All right.<eos> Take care, love.<eos> - Hi Elaine, it's me.<eos> Yeah, you left your ring here.<eos> You're probably driving but I'll drop it by on my way home.
- Yeah.<eos> Dr. Stockman.<eos> We just got confirmation, sir.<eos> The "package" is shipping later tonight.<eos> Well, make sure they're tracking it every step of the way.
You guys secure the portal device.<eos> I'll deal with those two.<eos> "Secure the portal device"?<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> It means kick the butt of anyone that's guarding it, wait for Donnie's go signal, and shut it down.
I'll deal with those two.<eos> "Secure the portal device"?<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> It means kick the butt of anyone that's guarding it, wait for Donnie's go signal, and shut it down.<eos> Yeah, but we don't know how many people are guarding it!
And child.<eos> We start over.<eos> I have been offered a post at Harvard.<eos> I was going to turn it down.<eos> Now I have a mind to take it.
Like he's here.<eos> I'm here, I'm right here, and I'm not going away.<eos> You're a hard one to get rid of, that's for sure.<eos> I'm stubborn, just like my husband.<eos> Now... let's talk about the future, and how we're going to change it.
I had to fight for my life.<eos> Mr. Cuatro was 78 years old and on an oxygen tank.<eos> Did you bring the knife with you?<eos> No.<eos> Got it from his kitchen.
You had the presence of mind to run from a crime scene, to remove evidence implicating you in the crime, to operate a motor vehicle without crashing into anything, but you didn't have the presence of mind<eos> The prophet Muhammad has this to say about that.<eos> "Hurry with all the strength of your legs to the one who needs help."<eos> Is that what you did for Andrea?<eos> Here's the deal, Mr. Khan, and you know it.
The Reverend mentioned an incident involving my mother and my father, and the way he phrased it made me feel like it was something big, maybe something terrible.<eos> Definitely something he didn't want to spell out on paper. It scared me for some reason.<eos> I put the letter back in the box, locked it, and never looked at it again.<eos> My father kept a journal.<eos> He wrote in it every night after supper.
I didn't have any other choice!<eos> I didn't know this would happen.<eos> All you care about is a fucking experiment.<eos> You took the serum too!<eos> Why did you take it?
Give me a sec.<eos> Where's Joe's belongings?<eos> All right, all right, that's good, hold.<eos> Like that?<eos> Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line. If you get a strike, it's going to slice it right open.
George says the piston's going to go right through the block any minute now.<eos> Unfortunately, that's a problem.<eos> We can't afford to keep the boat if we can't run it, and we can't run it if it's got a broken motor.<eos> Let's take out a loan.<eos> And pay it back with what?
Just routine.<eos> And your outfit?<eos> Am I supposed to get it?<eos> We were joking around with the kids at school.<eos> I'll wash it off.
- Finally?<eos> - Finally.<eos> Have spoken?<eos> Do not respond to calls or messages.<eos> You will have broken the phone or lost it.
Shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> East Side is much busier than the Upper West Side, at least for now.<eos> - Can I get some coffee? - No.<eos> Fine. I'll get it by school.
But he's got giant's blood.<eos> And you've got training.<eos> Sounds like a fair match to me.<eos> Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.<eos> And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.
That's Erin.<eos> They're growing impatient.<eos> What time does he get to work?<eos> Ahhh, 7:00.<eos> Tell them we're doing it in the most cost-effective way.
Ugh, no.<eos> I made a gay slur, then he threw it back in my face by acting like the kind of fruit that grows on trees.<eos> Everybody thinks so fast.<eos> Stan Smith, remove yourself from the tree immediately.<eos> Not until you promise you won't cut it down.
And no one would enjoy seeing you triumph here more than I, obviously.<eos> But this place is just...<eos> it's so big, you know.<eos> It's nearly a thousand, three thousand people.<eos> Well, Lily Pons's voice filled it.
The guy with the feet. That's me.<eos> Yeah. I'll hold.<eos> - It's still here. - It's still there?<eos> - You want him?<eos> - No, I don't want it.
When I was a child, my nurse would never let me eat every morsel put before me.<eos> Something must always remain, for Mr Manners.<eos> I know now that Mr Manners is a myth, and it is madness to appease him with delights of any kind.<eos> And now we take our right arm and raise it upright.<eos> Moving it backwards, we perform a circle, repeating the move four times.
No, I wondered if you'd show me how to use it -- there's a long playing record I'd like to hear.<eos> Oh, how thoroughly romantic.<eos> It's simply to put me in the Latin mind-set -- for the Spanish.<eos> Of course.<eos> Then I'll do better than show it to you, I'll play it for you.
Then you'll take a hot bath to help you relax -- the heat intensifies the effects of the castor oil...<eos> He's not on his own, is he?<eos> Dr Turner's with him.<eos> Johnny is waiting for this baby.<eos> And I promise you, he will see it.
Picture's my souvenir.<eos> 27 years I've done at Hayward's so far.<eos> My husband did 30.<eos> He got his long-service watch before he died.<eos> Ian wears it now.
If I get a degree, I can be a teacher.<eos> Or write for the papers.<eos> I could work for the BBC, making programmes about poetry.<eos> I could put better food on the table than you've ever seen in your life.<eos> I could be proud of how I put it there.
I mean to say, he tried, but you can't run a shop on good intentions, can you?<eos> Don't he know this shop's the only thing you've got?<eos> It's not all I have, Mrs Cadman.<eos> But it is mine.<eos> And I would like you to leave it.
And then I met Denis.<eos> My miracle.<eos> My kind, wonderful miracle.<eos> He brought frankincense to the church.<eos> They call it perfume of the sanctuary.
Yes.<eos> Can I just take one last one?<eos> I'm all done with the iron if you want it.<eos> It's this hat that's giving me the run-around.<eos> Not had it out of its box since I buried Mother.
Mercenaries all know the jambo, Amahl.<eos> These guys are all right.<eos> Base, we're looking at a lot of Russian SA-7s.<eos> Tell him to maintain eyes on the truck as long as he can.<eos> We're gonna find his stash and we're gonna level it with a Hellfire.
And with that hate,<eos> I wept.<eos> I wept more than I ever have before or since.<eos> The world was never the same again.<eos> You destroyed it.
When you played him... who would win?<eos> Me.<eos> Just 'cause the brother's dead don't mean I gotta start changing the facts.<eos> So what will happen to this place?<eos> Ah, the bank will swoop in and take it eventually.
That's what I'm telling you.<eos> And as a proud NYPD detective... see, my partner and I, well... we're accountable for each other.<eos> We need to know each other's whereabouts, 24/7.<eos> And thanks to my partner's GPS on her phone, I got Mr. Cage's home address.<eos> And I will give it to you... if you're a good boy.
It's a long story.<eos> I'll make time.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - What?<eos> Worried I'm gonna spill it?
I should be out there doing my job.<eos> Your job is out there waiting for you, Detective.<eos> The question is, how badly do you want it?
You're the Frank Bonneville?<eos> - Apparently.<eos> - I listen to you every day.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I wouldn't miss it.
- New York Post.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> I gotta go be in makeup from morning to evening. I hate it.<eos> - Oh.<eos> You're doing it for Ian, so... - Yeah.
What is it? - Welcome aboard.<eos> I'm so glad you're joining us.<eos> Hop in, I'll explain.<eos> - Tommy, this is Richard, my lead scientist.<eos> - The machine will amplify your power and run it through the conduits, allowing you to send anyone who's wearing one of these to the future in an instant.
You're welcome.<eos> Hi.<eos> Here. Come on.<eos> She's withdrawn from the case.<eos> She's assigned it to me and doesn't want anybody from the firm spending time on it, so I'm looking outside it for some help.
You want it?<eos> No.<eos> You've got her cat?<eos> You want it?<eos> I don't want it.
I killed a slave catcher.<eos> You take care of your mom and Nana, you hear?<eos> You a child of god.<eos> You got purpose. It's in you.<eos> The lord put it there, and there ain't nothing nobody can do to take it away.
Kyle didn't like them, so he took them down.<eos> He didn't like them?<eos> I mean, who doesn't like custom built-in wood shelves?<eos> Jesus. I mean...<eos> Half of us build the world, the other half destroy it.
Fergus, fill me in.<eos> Forensics are on their way to the piggery to check on the blood.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Who owns it?<eos> Well, it's the old Sullivan place, but the Graysons, they bought it a few years back.
I've never been to his house.<eos> Did you paint that? Yeah.<eos> It's not very good, I know. But I'm... I'm just starting.<eos> A kangaroo with a light switch for a head.<eos> What do you call it... a kanger-switch?
Ohh!<eos> Things got a little heated back there, huh?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> You got to tell me what's going on with you and this case.<eos> You know we never solve it till you do.
Thanks for letting my cousin hang out. I never know what to do when he visits.<eos> Hey, Paul?<eos> Can you go grab a froyo?<eos> 'Cause we gotta work now.<eos> That thing's old and expensive. He's just knocking it around.
- You want final judgment upon me, you will have to hand it down yourself, as I most certainly intend to do.<eos> - I ain't yourjudge.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> You are the only one who knows me, same as I know you!<eos> Do you think the world stops when you leave it behind?
You take the canister out of the box,<eos> keeping the fuse up and the blasting cap out of the nitroglycerin.<eos> Then you're gonna slide it down into the hole.<eos> And then, you lower the blasting cap into the nitroglycerin.<eos> And then, gently, bend it over the side of the rock. And then fill it with wet sand.
Otis was selling non-sanctioned products in his store?<eos> Well, the discrepancy could be an aberration in the manufacturing process.<eos> I'll know for sure once I test the T.H.C. levels in these samples.<eos> When you say "test," uh, exactly how do you do that?<eos> Well, we do burn it in a controlled environment with proper ventilation.
The bolt has rusted.<eos> - It takes force to put it in place...<eos> - How do you know it was my wife?<eos> It's not you or me.<eos> I know Mr. fakur closes it properly.
So, put the video on for me please.<eos> - You said you would.<eos> - Let's go outside and let the man work.<eos> How many times have I told you not to say we have a vcr, in front of a stranger?<eos> Do you want the authorities to find out and take it away?
I mean we weren't going gang-busters. There just weren't enough people in Arcadia.<eos> Meanwhile, one town over is San Bernardino and we want to relocate, but we got no money for a new stand.<eos> And that's when my brother here comes up with one of his brilliant ideas.<eos> He says, why don't we move the stand we've got.<eos> Put it on a truck.
I then showed Detectives Lange and Vannatter what I had observed and, in discussing the situation, we became concerned that it was possible Mr. Simpson himself might also be in danger.<eos> Injured, or worse.<eos> Well, that makes total sense.<eos> What did you do in response to this reasonable concern?<eos> I went over the wall and around to the gate and manually opened it.
Detective, could you tell us what you see here?<eos> These are photographs of the area I was inspecting behind Mr. Kaelin's residence.<eos> And in them is what I then identified as a possible glove.<eos> What did you do then?<eos> I approached it and I looked at it.
And in them is what I then identified as a possible glove.<eos> What did you do then?<eos> I approached it and I looked at it.<eos> Did you touch it?<eos> I didn't touch it.
I was raped in Italy by a waiter.<eos> And I buried it.<eos> Didn't forget it.<eos> Just... sort of stuffed it.<eos> When I had my first rape case, what happened to me, of course, came flying out from whatever rock I had jammed it under and...
That's from Churchill himself.<eos> Whoever is up at the house, he gave the wrong fucking name.<eos> And you do this to me on my fucking wedding day.<eos> The money is in the car, Mr Shelby.<eos> Fetch it out and count it.
If you think I am pushing you, it's because I am trying to prepare you for what is to come.<eos> You must fortify yourself against the Dagda Mor.<eos> You're pushing to see if I snap.<eos> It's not fun... having your mind read, is it?<eos> Your power may be growing, but be careful how you use it. And with whom.
Use it!<eos> You can't do this.<eos> We have to go back together.<eos> No, you have to go back.<eos> Don't you get it?
I told you we'd make it.<eos> _<eos> All right, where's the seed?<eos> I tried to tell you earlier...<eos> Oh, please don't say you dropped it.
Sure. Blue works, too.<eos> Yeah, I mean, either/or...<eos> Orange or blue, whatever one you're standing on, it's gonna look good.<eos> I was thinking about that, um... you know the blue rug.<eos> Maybe we don't get it, like, for my place, but...
Go like that, stay with it !<eos> Last thrilling lap with De Martino in second place with Minotti's Lambo right on her tail.<eos> Right behind the Ferrari MP1, which has passed the Antonelli Porsche.<eos> Go in neat, go up the kerb.<eos> They've raised it, dickhead !
Come, Kubo.<eos> Come to your aunties.<eos> No reason to be afraid, Kubo.<eos> We just need your other eye.<eos> Your grandfather admires it so.
Kubo, we both want the exact same thing.<eos> You want to take my other eye.<eos> That's what you want!<eos> Well, yes.<eos> But do you know why I want it?
It's so raw and aggressive.<eos> We're trying to build the space for them and...<eos> (voice breaks) out where I live now.<eos> Well, I can get a brush and sign it.<eos> I mean, that way they'll buy it.
You ain't alone, son.<eos> You got lots of people here who care about you.<eos> It don't matter what the Massa call you.<eos> You keep your true name inside.<eos> I'm gonna keep it there, too.
And what did I say?<eos> Reason one.<eos> I love you.<eos> Reason two.<eos> Do you remember it?
So was the commander.<eos> What clarke did at mount weather weakened her.<eos> The ice nation is emboldened.<eos> Their queen wants Clarke's power.<eos> If her people believe she has it, she'll break the coalition and start a war.
I just want to say that you look beautiful.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> You do. You look so beautiful.<eos> My makeup is insane.<eos> It's not insane, okay? If we just take it down a little... around the face...
Slow down, girl, you're gonna ruin our reputation as a greasy spoon.<eos> You gonna charge them for that?<eos> Free refills, right?<eos> I want to get half your tip.<eos> And I want a pony for Christmas, but I ain't gonna get it.
Explanation for what?<eos> The Little Venice restaurant in Forge Street was burnt down.<eos> No, no, couldn't have been us.<eos> We was at a wedding.<eos> You burnt it down to stop my son being at that same wedding.
It's not formal.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It's made in Paris.<eos> It was stolen in Birmingham.<eos> My mother stole it from a house she was cleaning, 1901...
Madness.<eos> Killing.<eos> I am the first one... .. who understands you.<eos> I found her perfume.<eos> Put it on.
Now he's suing me.<eos> What I want is for you to use your badge and your gun to intimidate him into dropping the case.<eos> Wow. That is so very illegal. He's not doing that.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You have 48 hours to do so, or I'm gonna take your sperm, and I'm gonna dump it into the East River.
Everybody knows you break in when the owner's there.<eos> That way you have guaranteed access to the safe, and you can kick his teeth in to send a message.<eos> - Okay, why don't you just...<eos> - Oh, sure, you could slit his throat, but then what are you going to do with all the blood?<eos> - Uh, we'd leave it in his body, where blood lives, because we're cops.
♪ - Give it a whirl, girl.<eos> - Guys, he's rhyming. He's telling Gina to sing.<eos> Captain Hold is on a vacation high!<eos> He will say yes to anything right now.<eos> - I would like a police horse, and I'd like Terry to be riding it almost constantly.
"What's in the box?" Brad Pitt, "Se7en."<eos> But seriously, what's in the box?<eos> - The worst thing in the world.<eos> [kitten mews] Shut up, stupid.<eos> - Okay, so who sent you a kitten and why do you hate it?
You don't see me bringing up how you burned your junk off.<eos> - That didn't happen.<eos> There was just some light blistering.<eos> The point is, the only thing those bullies have over you is that you never solved that case.<eos> So why don't we solve it together?
Give me the phone.<eos> Give him more cord.<eos> Hand me the phone!<eos> You're gonna break it.<eos> You're holding it. I got it.
Last time she saw you, She started bringing over trays of that shit.<eos> "you give this to richie.<eos> His folks both in the ground now. Somebody got to take care of him." well, she's fucking right.<eos> How come you didn't bring the motherfucking chicken?<eos> I ate it.
Oh, my God, I felt so terrible about that.<eos> That was so disgusting.<eos> Good news is, you're the guy getting a colonoscopy, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Well, if that hot dog has given you cancer, they gonna catch it right away.
What's he done now?<eos> He and Anatole Kuragin and that dreadful Dolokhov, they found a bear somewhere...<eos> - A bear?<eos> - Pierre!<eos> ...and put it in a carriage and went to... To the actress's, you know. And the bear got out and when the police came, oh!
I hate that you're about to see me like this, but I don't have the strength to fight you anymore, Ray.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Is this what you wanted?<eos> I didn't get the job.<eos> They gave it to somebody else.
Roman!<eos> Here!<eos> Tell me another joke.<eos> I don't have another fucking joke.<eos> The joke is if you don't get your ass out of there, I'm gonna come down and kick it.
I hope you didn't overspend.<eos> Stop.<eos> - Come on.<eos> No.<eos> I still can't believe you got it, dad!
Okay.<eos> - Yeah. She's very thinning-of-the-herd type person.<eos> Dude, dude, no, no. Do not eat cookies. Don't eat any sugar.<eos> Sugar makes you crash.<eos> You'll look tired and they'll take it as a sign of weakness.
- Running, you ass!<eos> Look, he can't just murder people with a gun, okay?<eos> That's fucking boring.<eos> What if the murderer strangles someone?<eos> Because strangling is scary 'cause it's really personal, 'cause you have to, like, look 'em in the eye when you do it.
Three flights up.<eos> Lift's broken but it keeps you fit.<eos> _<eos> Yeah, chicken sounds great, love.<eos> A couple of days out of date is fine, as long as you cook it well.
So... why don't you sit down?<eos> We have a lot to talk about.<eos> I'm not going to mince words.<eos> There's a void here today.<eos> We all feel it.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> No.<eos> I'm here to deliver the package.<eos> Do I give it to you?
- Anatole has left Moscow.<eos> - Well, it makes no difference.<eos> When you see Countess Rostova, tell her that she was and is completely free and I wish her no ill.<eos> Is that all?<eos> Look here, I'm sure it was a moment of madness and she regrets it bitterly.
You should.<eos> Wow, you're a real F. Lee Bailey.<eos> I know my rights.<eos> I didn't have to steal that footage.<eos> That guy Orton... he didn't even have it no more.
Because being brave, it's really, really hard.<eos> You know what makes me brave, Mason?<eos> My badge.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> Now I'm gonna give it to you, and it's gonna make you brave.
I followed a lead.<eos> We think we've got the person who hired Ezekiel. Great.<eos> You plan on telling me who that is?<eos> Sandra Russo, you're under arrest for the murder of Shane Barton.<eos> I'm telling you, there's no way she did it. Sandra is a lot of things.
- Gotta take it.<eos> I'm taking it.<eos> Daddy, do you want bacon in your waffle?<eos> - Bacon in my waffle? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I've been crumbling bacon and putting it in the batter.
He's an asshole.<eos> His opinions are pretty stupid too.<eos> I mean, I for one would love to read your book. Uh, no, you don't.<eos> It sucks.<eos> Come on, you let Hayden read it and give edits, you won't let me?
Any idea what she was doing out there?<eos> None that fit her character.<eos> This was found near her body.<eos> It's loaded with a suite of proprietary data, including some of the hosts' core code.<eos> It only works from higher altitudes, so if Theresa was using it, it's possible she was trying to transmit and fell.
Mechanical failure.<eos> But the conspiracists are already at work.<eos> Hacking's been mentioned.<eos> Our greatest act.<eos> And we do not claim it. The plane was a job.
Poison, really.<eos> It will rid you of the child, but it can also kill you.<eos> But what other choice do I have?<eos> Do you want the baby?<eos> Of course I want it.
I'll tell you, though.<eos> Great work, bud.<eos> You killed it, really.<eos> Ah, thanks, Charlie.<eos> When you got a good plan, you stick to it.
The night you left, at the cave, you said Jack's been arrested.<eos> What the fuck's going on?<eos> Spanish intelligence.<eos> They learned of the cache.<eos> They demanded the governor recover it and return it.
I've known him since we were children...<eos> Suffered illness and loss by his side.<eos> Watched him give his loyalty, his sacrifice and his love to my mother, to me.<eos> So you can just imagine what that was like, asking him to accept what was done to him at the hands of men who look so very much like those he watched murder his parents when he was a boy.<eos> You can imagine how tempted I was to take that knife and put it in his hand and let him use it to his liking.
Along with my good name.<eos> Along with her lost love.<eos> Along with your late quartermaster's life.<eos> All the awful sacrifices made to assemble that box are now part of its contents, and those things... are sacred things that I trust in no man's hands.<eos> The next time that chest is opened will be after Anne and I walk away with it, And once the smoke is cleared... and all is done.
Wozniak wants this handled quietly.<eos> Kovach is a white dude. 5'11", dark hair.<eos> Son's name is Brian.<eos> - Whoa, he drive a truck? - How'd you know?<eos> He just slammed Brian into it.
I am the queen of every hive.<eos> I am the fire on every hill.<eos> I am the shield over every head.<eos> I am the spear of battle.<eos> Who but I am both the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
Dude, I'm sorry, what the fuck is a moyel, and why are they sucking baby dick?<eos> A moyel is the Jewish dude who performs the circumcisions.<eos> You know, like a... a bris.<eos> So they don't do it in the hospital, so these rabbis can do whatever they want.<eos> So they take the detached baby foreskin, and they roll it around in their mouths with wine.
Progress?<eos> The pamphlets have been impounded, sir.<eos> Only one batch made it past the checkpoint.<eos> I fear it's on its way down to the plains.<eos> We'll be ready for it in Delhi.
Neil.<eos> What?<eos> Tom's not getting on this plane.<eos> Do you want to explain that?<eos> They said a plane was on its way, but they didn't say they were sending it... - for him. - (Neil):
Sister.<eos> And here's our bride.<eos> Welcome home, Father.<eos> The dress isn't finished.<eos> I didn't mean for you to see it like this.
And I'm telling you, those tracks were not more than a couple days old.<eos> - Yeah, and what's your point?<eos> - There's gotta be a vehicle somewhere.<eos> - Talk about some crazy idea.<eos> You know, and even if there is some escape vehicle out there, how are we gonna find it?
Listen to me, Mr. Pine.<eos> Your nephew is my friend.<eos> Now, I don't like dick any more than you do, but he does, but that's his business.<eos> He don't need you riding him on it.<eos> So you do that in front of me again, I'm gonna take that cane, shove it up your ass, and break it clean off.
- People have been unattracted to you for thousands of years.<eos> - Thousands?<eos> - Since the dawn of mankind.<eos> In ancient Greece, not-Joshero love was considered quite normal.<eos> Plato called it the cornerstone of a modern democracy.
Yeah, well, now he needs your help.<eos> The 12 Monkeys... they put something in him, something that helps them find him.<eos> A tracker device.<eos> Sounds like them.<eos> We need you to cut it out.
Harry Selfridge.<eos> - Don't you know who I am?<eos> - The Whiteley brothers.<eos> Father had a store, just like you.<eos> Now that he's gone, you're running it into the ground.
You're gonna need these.<eos> Try to hang onto them this time.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm looking for the panorama.<eos> I just don't see it.
Publicly disappointed. Privately pissed.<eos> - Will they retaliate?<eos> - If they win.<eos> And if O'Shea wins?<eos> He'll either bury the Grand Jury report, or use it to bury me.
And lucky they're not slowly dissolving in a 50-gallon drum!<eos> She trusted me!<eos> Veronica trusted me to protect the disk, and I failed her!<eos> Okay, well, maybe.<eos> But we're gonna get it back, right, with a plan?
He's on the board, Archer.<eos> One word from him, and A.J. is in.<eos> Yeah, but-- Yeah, but shut up!<eos> This is your daughter's future, you dickhead!<eos> So you are gonna take his case, and you are gonna solve it, and A.J. is going to school here and then grow up to be a titan of industry or an astronaut or some other shit!
You didn't follow me into the crapper to gloat about freedom, Jane.<eos> Talk to me about the Nutella Tax.<eos> Uh, we're really calling it the "Nutella Tax"?<eos> Palm oil is a key ingredient in Nutella.<eos> If the Federal Government taxes it at 300%, it'll cost more for us to gorge ourselves on it.
Oh, that is just a regular bird raised in Amish country, by the way.<eos> Ah.<eos> It tastes better because it can't use Google, huh?<eos> Look, there's over five million of us. And we're armed.<eos> We've beaten this kind of bill before, we'll beat it again.
What ex-husband?<eos> I didn't know you had an ex-husband.<eos> Since when?<eos> A couple of years in graduate school.<eos> It's weird, I've been thinking about him a lot lately, and then recently he sent me this book that he's written and it's violent and it's sad, and he entitled it Nocturnal Animals and he dedicated it to me.
You'll travel to Valencia in 1099 and make contact with him.<eos> In that time he'll be about 50 years old.<eos> Ah, also... you'll also obtain a sample to analyze his DNA.<eos> Something wrong, Alonso?<eos> I am going to meet our most important soldier and I have to yank out his tooth, because he's not going to let us just take it out nicely.
I always used to say that love is a social construct that doesn't really exist.<eos> I didn't believe you then and I don't believe you now.<eos> Okay, so what is it?<eos> Christ, don't ask me.<eos> Seriously, how would you define it?
My husband abandoned me.<eos> But despite such mean thing, you are still in love with him.<eos> Do you think I shouldn't?<eos> Do you want my advice about love?<eos> I don't know any man who knows it better than you.
- I have too much work.<eos> - Have Angustias do it.<eos> - Angustias is playing nurse.<eos> - You want a report?<eos> I'll give you one right now and you can write it down.
She just left to take a break.<eos> When she realised that the worst had passed, I managed to convince her, if not... she would still be here, on the front line.<eos> Easy.<eos> The trick is to scare the octopus.<eos> You dip it into boiling water three times.
Did it not seem strange to you that the studnts laughed when the teacher started class by saying: "As we were saying yesterday"?<eos> That was Unamuno's first class after his exile.<eos> Miguel de Unamuno, one of the most important Spanish authors.<eos> Primo de Rivera exiled him for six years after he criticised his government and the king.<eos> If he was a bad patriot, he deserved it.
I've told you that it's a private matter.<eos> But if you must know...<eos> With your permission.<eos> I've come to give this cameo to a native woman here.<eos> The other day a soldier died, Rafael Ríos, and on his deathbed... I promised him I would do it.
You see?<eos> It's fucking dead.<eos> - Fucking God damn it.<eos> - You see? You see?<eos> 'Cause you shook it all the way here like an idiot.
The wealthy brother convinced the Paraguayan woman to marry him and they moved in together.<eos> The other brother was immersed in an unbearable pain.<eos> So one night, unexpectedly, he went to the happy couple's house claiming that he wanted to settle their differences.<eos> They went for a walk in the property and they started to talk, but out of the blue, the one with the beard took a piece of iron that was lying around and delivered him... a terrible, quick blow on the head. His brother just dropped dead.<eos> After that, he carried his body and burnt it in one of the ovens in the foundry.
I'll give you the address.<eos> I live on Castelli...<eos> Castelli 111.<eos> Here. It's next to the police station. There's a vacant lot on the other side.<eos> This piece of paper is for you. Keep it.
Deputy Chief Irving.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Uh, [clears throat] a DUI checkpoint, sir.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Who authorized it?
Play.<eos> You motherfuckers, I'm gonna kill you both.<eos> The tracking App.<eos> The pin will tell us where her phone's at.<eos> They would have turned it off after she called.
- Mexican.<eos> Poquito Mas. Best Mexican take out in L.A.<eos> And I got you a new phone.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Why don't you go set it up. Your mom and I'll put food on the table.
Monica, Monica, Monica.<eos> Oh, you'd be so much more handsome without these warts and goiters.<eos> You should really have them removed.<eos> And let's talk about how sad it is that you're here pursuing business that you're never gonna get.<eos> Ah, well, you know, we just wanted to see the place before you raped and pillaged it. Ta-da.
What brand are you talking about?<eos> Mae was able to lift a partial image from Jeff's body.<eos> My analyst at home is trying to identify it.<eos> Hey. I've got it.<eos> I'm sending it to you now.
I'm not leaving you.<eos> I said go.<eos> Please, just go.<eos> If you care about anyone, M--<eos> There is a price, Morgan, and you're gonna pay it.
Oh, hell, I could survive that.<eos> What?<eos> George Burness made the jump.<eos> And he was drunk as a skunk.<eos> He did it on a $10 bet.
Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights, the rest of us are having a funeral for Will!<eos> I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day!<eos> All right, show's over.<eos> What?<eos> We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right?
It's not that they don't want to vote for you, they just don't feel they can with all the heat they're getting on this thing.<eos> So we need to delay the Senate vote and hold a hearing.<eos> Air all this out.<eos> Get these votes back.<eos> The only way the Senate will approve a delay is if you ask for it yourself.
She crazy for it. Plus, it's rare.<eos> I heard they only made like 50 copies.<eos> That Jamaican's spot on Charlotte Street got rare stuff. Boom!<eos> Get that shit.<eos> - Get in the club. - Yeah. Get the DJ to play it.
What do you think?<eos> Not often I get asked over. Thought I'd come early.<eos> What is that godawful smell?<eos> Lunch!<eos> They call it "Running Mutton".
You were supposed to show me how to do what you do.<eos> Do not underestimate the crayon.<eos> I promised you the secret, not the answer, Grasshopper.<eos> To earn the answer, you must solve the mystery as one.<eos> And when you unlock the gate, we will walk through it together as one.
"I hand you the magic, Grasshopper."<eos> "Do not underestimate the crayon."<eos> Look at Dizzee.<eos> "You must solve the mystery as one."<eos> What the fuck are you looking at it like that, bro?
- Shao didn't know, right?<eos> Close that shit.<eos> That body turns up anywhere but on the inside of that trunk...<eos> Cadillac gonna make sure we all gonna be the next ones stuffed in there.<eos> The cops find it? Gonna lock us up regardless whether we did shit or not.
♪ You're headed for the danger zone ♪<eos> What'd I do?<eos> Singing, right?<eos> I know.<eos> All right, I won't do it no more.
No, no, no, tío.<eos> I want this. I wanna sign with Mr. Asheton.<eos> Regina, Yolanda and I wanna be at Marrakesh, same as Misty.<eos> I trust you to protect me and Jackie to guide me.<eos> I'll let you write the contract and I'll sign it, but we wanna be at Marrakesh.
I wanna fucking kill myself.<eos> Turn the music up. Come on!<eos> - Frances.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I'd offer you some wine, but I think Diane's already sucked most of it up.
He is the only thing that has kept me sane this last year.<eos> And I love him.<eos> - I think.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You love his dick and all the pretty dark hair that surrounds it.
Yes. - And... it... is so good.<eos> - And?<eos> - Uh, great. When can I read it?<eos> - Uh, well, um,<eos> Kelsey's just going over it with a fine-toothed comb.
You don't have to be shy.<eos> Seriously, I-I'd really like to get to know you.<eos> Really?<eos> Here's something that I learned from our relationship.<eos> When you feel a knot... you take a deep breath and you stare at it and face it without fear or judgment.
You've never seen a greyhound, have you, Bill?<eos> Seen a few showdowns in my day.<eos> A greyhound is a racing dog.<eos> Spends its life running in circles, chasing a bit of felt made up like a rabbit.<eos> One day, we took it to the park.
He ran.<eos> Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog... running.<eos> Until, at last, he finally caught it.<eos> And to the horror of everyone, he killed that little cat.<eos> Tore it to pieces.
You probably think you're on this trip because you're some kind of contender, some... some threat to me.<eos> I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone.<eos> My sister probably picked you for the same reason.<eos> I earned my place.<eos> Nobody handed it to me.
He's a senior advocate.<eos> He's been asked to defend you.<eos> I've been asked to, but I don't particularly want to.<eos> Then why don't you go home?<eos> Because your case is so bad, no one else will take it.
I thought we could play catch with Jock.<eos> Did you bring him?<eos> Where is he, boy?<eos> I'm an evil genius hiding a relay.<eos> Where the fuck do I hide it?
It's the human beings who confuse me.<eos> This building isn't in any survey of the park.<eos> That's because we use hosts to do most of the surveys.<eos> They're programmed to ignore this place.<eos> They literally couldn't see it if they were staring right at it.
Let's take a look at that contract.<eos> Okay.<eos> I would red-line it, but...<eos> I'm not allowed to have a pencil.<eos> This makes less sense the more I look at it.
Well, sometimes, I think it's better to celebrate these things on your own.<eos> That's all.<eos> Understood.<eos> Well, go on, skedaddle.<eos> Otherwise you'll miss it.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> You see, I was just stuck indoors all the time and he was out there, up on his fine horse, in a world full of temptation.<eos> Some nights he'd come home and he'd give me a little present, you see.<eos> That's what he actually called it.
Not that boy's fault your dumb ass splitting eights on a 10.<eos> Gimme your fuckin' lighter.<eos> I already gave you my lighter, Credence.<eos> You know, that blue one that I...<eos> You'd have gave it to me, I wouldn't be fuckin' askin' for it!
We need some food!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> Here...<eos> How are you paying?<eos> Charge it to the fire brigade.
Right, right.<eos> Junkyard dog...<eos> Oh, someone who's gonna be ferocious in court.<eos> Oh, well, I'm afraid I don't appear in court.<eos> I prepare the case, I don't present it.
You can't betray that now.<eos> Not if this marriage is truly the partnership you have promised me.<eos> These are turbulent times, Eliza.<eos> We need to be open to change. I am not open to it!<eos> I repudiate it!
Ezra?<eos> You okay?<eos> Were you working on the last chapter?<eos> It's finished.<eos> Do you want me to read it?
They beat him almost to death.<eos> After three days he had still not woken up.<eos> Even Mrs Oskarson was becoming worried.<eos> It didn't help that I got my eternity note.<eos> I had been waiting for it for four years but it was not as I had expected.
I'm special.<eos> You know, Gitty.. ...some people think they are hot shit on a silver platter when really, they're just cold turd on a paper plate.<eos> What does that even mean, Mom?<eos> It means special people don't have to tell you they're special.<eos> Mum.. ...if someone asks you to keep a secret.. ...should you keep it?
- Yes.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It used to be a restaurant.<eos> But the new owner lives abroad, so it's almost always empty.<eos> So, in the end, no one uses it.
Tough toughy job.<eos> An octopus arrived today.<eos> Some strange octopus.<eos> An octopus?<eos> It's poisonous and lethal so don't touch it.
there can be only one.<eos> I don't blame you, Ken.<eos> I'd do the same thing.<eos> But I'm up 32% this year, which, from what I know of your run-and-hide approach, is 30 points better than what you are at vista verde.<eos> Well, you can call it what you want, but I call it "careful."
No, you won't.<eos> You need this $9 million.<eos> Because none of you... not one... Has done a single day of work from the moment your miserable prick of a grandfather fell facedown in the sand in Palm Beach. And after reviewing your holdings, your business interests, your debts,<eos> I know that this check is the only thing standing between your family and bankruptcy.<eos> So pick it up, put it in your pocket, and walk out of here.
My dad said that?<eos> Is she gonna be okay?<eos> Yeah, she's doing better.<eos> They say she should be able to leave tomorrow.<eos> I've been carrying this ring ever since you took it off.
The cluster's burning up.<eos> We're gonna lose her.<eos> - Stand back.<eos> - Liquid nitrogen?<eos> Phone companies use it to cool phone lines throughout the city.
The Ministers and the ambassador will meet in a different room.<eos> I'll go through the local agreement. When it's signed, the others will join us.<eos> We go through the other agreements.<eos> This is just a final review.<eos> When we're in agreement, we go outside and sign it in front of the press in the atrium.
For boys.<eos> We don't need international cooperation.<eos> Sharif says that oil and gas belongs to the landowner.<eos> Everyone has to do their part in order to obtain peace.<eos> If everyone can accept the oil agreement Norway offers, the Zamani family will also support it.
I'm Mayor Eric Garcetti, and I approve of this show.<eos> Killed it.<eos> [man] The famous DJ partnered with LA Mayor Eric Garcetti as a way to celebrate the city.<eos> A free concert with a civic-minded twist.<eos> They are calling it LAoki.
We have just the thing for you.<eos> So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.
That's it.<eos> I'm on my lunch break, pal.<eos> Your son Lee is not half bad.<eos> His footwork's sloppy, but he's good with a stick.<eos> I know talent when I see it.
Easy now.<eos> Trust me.<eos> These are the M80 firecrackers that ShotSeeker picked up a half an hour ago.<eos> See how precise?<eos> ShotSeeker picked up the sound, located it correctly, and identified it as firecrackers.
It's pressurized gas escaping as the bullet exits the barrel.<eos> It's also called a muzzle blast.<eos> From a Ruger 22.<eos> How can you tell that?<eos> I can hear it.
The miniature machine clone is on this laptop.<eos> You know, for a man with such serious concerns about the proliferation of artificial super intelligence, you sure do love to build new ones.<eos> I can connect this Machine laptop to the Samaritan laptop via this central computer, which will function as a forum for their virtual engagement.<eos> Or a Roman Colosseum for an unlimited series of virtual battles.<eos> If Samaritan has a fatal flaw, we'll know it soon enough.
Grab some guns, Sameen.<eos> You'll feel better once we shoot some people.<eos> There'd be a better way to fight this war if we hadn't closed the system.<eos> If I believed that, I wouldn't have done it.<eos> What if I said I hard-coded a little something extra into the system before you closed it for good?
This has been sitting back there for.. that was 10 years now, wow.<eos> Everybody thinks it's a bottle of fancy bourbon or something like that, but..<eos> Nope, nope.<eos> This is actually the most illegal thing in this bar.<eos> You know, our pal, Garth. And another buddy of mine gave it to me for my birthday while back now.
A red dragon.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me... Tell me about that.<eos> The red... red dragon.<eos> I watched it while the man lied on top of me.
Look at you, a young woman now.<eos> It's a mistake, Khatun.<eos> If you stay, there is no more suffering.<eos> All the pain of life, gone.<eos> Soon, you won't remember any of it.
Now you know sacrifice.<eos> Now you are ready for what comes with this gift.<eos> Swallow it.<eos> It's the seed of light.<eos> If you grow it, all you need to know will be inside you.
I hope you know I've always thought of you, well, all of you as collaborators, but... you, most of all, I like to think of as a partner.<eos> Don't.<eos> And I know we're both worried about the same thing.<eos> Will we ever find the fifth movement?<eos> One of us will get it.
Completion and death.<eos> - Can you tell me anything else about the game?<eos> - Mm, very little I'm afraid.<eos> Only a scant number have played it but, uh, every few years or so, it always ends up back here.<eos> - Uh, why do they return it?
Shoshanna, hello.<eos> Um, what... what are you... are you here for work?<eos> It's all right.<eos> You don't have to be kind to me.<eos> I know I took a spiked dildo and I frickin' rammed it right into your heart hole.
And much worse than we remembered it?<eos> Precisely.<eos> But there were other changes as well, at least from my perspective.<eos> Spearhead, for example.<eos> In my reality, we invaded, confiscated their core, and used it to continue our mission.
They gave her a flashy new name, put her in the pictures.<eos> She became Anvil Studios' top earner by '38.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> Is that in the file?<eos> I will read it directly.
People have a psychological need to find the super-villain, but in my experience, reality is a lot more complicated.<eos> So who is Geronimo?<eos> That's a very good question.<eos> You've never brought me behind the curtain before-- why now?<eos> Well, you were forced to take this job, but there are legitimate reasons for you to be doing it.
What I'm speaking about is this man.<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm not in the habit of climbing into bed with snakes.<eos> I couldn't care less who you're climbing into bed with.<eos> Let's say this works.<eos> We fix this device and then Vernon stops Whitney Frost with it.
I'm really sorry, I tried my best and I.. and I...<eos> You didn't sell the membership.<eos> I did not sell the membership.<eos> And now you're expecting to be fired?<eos> Would it be easier if you just, like, wrote "you're fired" on a piece of paper, and left it on my desk?
She hooked me up with this gig and I just stay out of her way.<eos> That's good.<eos> It's a smart move.<eos> - What's wrong with your phone, man?<eos> - What? You've been checking it all day, man.
You know, if you wanna see a free movie, all you have to do is call the theater and tell them that the projector was all fucked up.<eos> I don't know about that, ma'am.<eos> I'm just trying to find out what you thought of the taste.<eos> Maybe what your children would think of the taste.<eos> If they were gonna improve the flavor, what aspect of it would they improve?
He's waiting.<eos> You'll address him as sir, and his wife as madame.<eos> The Treaty of Versailles forbids any other form of address.<eos> His left arm is slightly deformed.<eos> You will not refer to it or look at it.
But I told the Austrians,<eos> "You got what you wanted.<eos> Stop in Belgrade!"<eos> I wrote a telegram to Vienna, "Stop in Belgrade!"<eos> They never sent it.
This girl has been caught in flagrante in this officer's bedroom.<eos> And Frau Linnenkamp swears it is not the first time.<eos> Your Highness, I am entirely to blame.<eos> That this should come to light on the very day that Herr Himmler is to visit!<eos> God forbid that he should hear of it!
He's just asleep.<eos> - You've got somewhere to go?<eos> - An address.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> I betrayed my country, but I won't abandon it.
Don't you "good luck" me.<eos> That is, like, the meanest thing that you could ever say to anybody.<eos> And by the way, you're wrong about this place.<eos> The fish is exactly suited to the price.<eos> Well, and thank God you can afford it with your food stamps.
We can't give this to them.<eos> They'll be sitting ducks.<eos> We can't put this intel into the hands of a terrorist.<eos> We can, but only if we can track them down before they actually use it.<eos> We could plant a worm into an attachment so that, when the recipient opens it, the worm pings their location.
And now I've lost my husband, and you've started a new war, so go pray that the tribes will fight by your side.<eos> She is a foolish girl.<eos> Right now we have to attend to the tribes.<eos> Call them to council.<eos> Tell them you hold the throne just as you always have, until you pass it to your eldest son... Jonathan.
The baroness was infertile.<eos> Not experiments.<eos> A cure.<eos> She was pregnant the night of the wedding.<eos> Before they burned her... the villagers cut out the fetus... and threw it in the aquifer.
This is where you began.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> You know... you look just like she did on her wedding night.<eos> The night they took her from me.<eos> The villagers cut out the fetus and threw it in the aquifer.
A tracking beacon from the Ark...<eos> Farm Station. - That's the beacon.<eos> - This belongs to us.<eos> The Ice Nation queen wants Clarke's power.<eos> If her people know she has it, she'll break the coalition and start a war.
Resist, and you will be met by force.<eos> Fight, and you will be greeted by death.<eos> Today is a new beginning.<eos> Mark it down.<eos> Remember it just like the Grounders will remember it.
Sorry we had to do this the hard way.<eos> We all have pain.<eos> Some of it is physical from injuries or age.<eos> Some is mental... you know,living with the loss of our loved ones.<eos> If you think about it, whether we fight that pain or succumb to it, the result is the same.
All right?<eos> All right.<eos> I can't believe I haven't even seen you since...<eos> You put me in an institution?<eos> Maddie, you know I hate it as much as you do.
Welcome back to Heart Work, we have Mindy on the line.<eos> Mindy, what's happening?<eos> Hi, Dr. Greg.<eos> Long time, first time. I'm a 48-year-old, never-married woman.<eos> I am a huge fan. Like, if you had a book, I would sleep with it under my pillow.
- So, a twist, a turn.<eos> - Every three pages.<eos> - Yeah, something big. - Uh-huh, uh-huh.<eos> Um, I don't want this to seem like I'm just shitting on your script.<eos> Oh, my God, I just appreciate you reading it.
I can't read the language.<eos> It's okay. I'll help you remember.<eos> Splendid.<eos> Now, as for the dagger...<eos> - You need someone to steal it. - Okay, fine.
- A poem.<eos> "And though my soul departs the Earth, "I count my days till my rebirth.<eos> "I will wait across eternity for my love to come back to me""<eos> The knife.<eos> You gave it to me, and the inscription, it was a poem... a love poem which promises...
Technically, she'd have to give up the baby to a third party.<eos> - Joe Silverman.<eos> - Joe Silverman.<eos> He's the foster father, for a few days.<eos> She hands the kid to Joe, he hands it back.
Red Guard are only authorised to attack if the Musketeers' rescue fails.<eos> It will fail.<eos> I'll see to that.<eos> There'll be a signal.<eos> Don't attack until you hear it.
All right, here you go.<eos> I'm gonna...<eos> - I'll put it right there.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I think if you elevate it above your heart, that's what's supposed to be good for it.
You know, there's a book that could help you with that.<eos> Sarno?<eos> It didn't.<eos> You have to actually read it for it to help.<eos> I'm not supposed to just shove it up my ass?
We just brought in more medicine.<eos> Gregory wants the best deal possible.<eos> Yeah, well, we want things, too.<eos> We need food.<eos> We came all this way, we're gonna get it.
I gotta confess. I-I'm working on my boasts and rails with a pro. Mm.<eos> 300 an hour.<eos> But hey, at least I don't suck anymore.<eos> You want his number?<eos> You just gave it to me.
- Oh, hello!<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Funny to see you here.<eos> I left you a message.<eos> Did you get it?
I let my anger get the better of me. But the Germans, I can't stand their arrogance.<eos> Their arrogance?<eos> You insulted me. You insulted my friend.<eos> I'm sick of your drunken behavior.<eos> I can't take it anymore.
You were just nastier.<eos> So Anne Marie texts Nicole, "Running late, be with you soon."<eos> Only the poor love makes a mistake.<eos> Instead of texting the secret phone they've been using behind your back... she texts her usual phone.<eos> And you pick it up, cos you're at home.
About once every seven sleeps.<eos> And was it warm, the food?<eos> That's what made it good.<eos> Three miles from the road and eight from the edge of the woods, but the food was warm?<eos> Maybe he hiked it in in some kind of insulated bag.
Did you even look at the talking points? You know what?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I did not.<eos> This endorsement is the race.<eos> Your father saw it today... the place where Adam was kept.
For sure.<eos> I was beginning to think you were a no-show.<eos> I'm beginning to wish I no-showed.<eos> I don't see the appeal.<eos> See it now?
Why are you really here?<eos> Uh, Joey's here to, um...<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> It's not something I talk about, but like you, I rely on my faith.<eos> And somehow, I never made the connection till you said it, but... maybe these powers, these... gifts that you have, that Daisy has, maybe they're not random.
- Hello.<eos> - Do you have an account here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - May I have the account number?<eos> - I don't know it by heart.
What are you doing in there?<eos> It's my dad's store.<eos> He said I could invite some friends.<eos> If you're cold... there's plenty to drink.<eos> - Good wine, if you feel like it.
- Truth time.<eos> - Action!<eos> In 1983, Special Agent Bruce P. Mindhorn was captured during a secret operation on the Siberian border.<eos> Communist doctors performed experimental cybernetic surgery upon him.<eos> They removed his eye and replaced it with a super-advanced optical lie detector which meant he could literally see the truth.
Okay, sounds like a plan, partner.<eos> I'm gonna head off.<eos> - I'll give you a signal when I need you.<eos> - What's the signal? - Uh...<eos> You'll know when you hear it.
If she can access A.L.I.E. 2...<eos> She can tell us how to stop A.L.I.E. 1.<eos> Bekka Pramheda gets her second shot at atonement.<eos> Get back to the mind pathway.<eos> If A.L.I.E. uses it to upload our minds to the City of Light, then there's a chance my mom's still alive.
"I Am Jenna Hamilton?"<eos> "What I've Learned?"<eos> "A Millennial's Guide To Love And... "<eos> Hey, Jenna, weird question, but, did you write a super-detailed post about our relationship on Idea Bin?<eos> I thought you didn't read it.
No, I don't. But I do check my phone. It started blowing up with new Twitter followers and texts about the post.<eos> Nice headline, by the way.<eos> It's horrible, I know, but they changed it on me last-minute without telling me.<eos> It's totally not what I wrote.<eos> I think you'd actually really like the article if you just read it.
My son...<eos> Look into my eyes.<eos> Did they look at you when you killed them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Come near me in life, old man, and I will take your hair and wear it on my belt.
Is it Jewish?<eos> It's... it's Ukrainian, ma'am.<eos> It's all... this is all very sad.<eos> It is, but thank you for your time.<eos> We do appreciate it. Thank you.
Kenny?<eos> Right. Well, thanks, Mrs. Haleford.<eos> - We will need that address.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jamie's mobile - someone's just turned it back on.
Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> My parents believed I had succeeded on my own, but the truth was, I couldn't have done it without Matty.<eos> Why did that feel like such a shameful secret?<eos> I suddenly realized the shameful secret wasn't that I needed Matty's help. It was that I wanted it.
I can't think of anybody who wanted him dead.<eos> OK, thanks.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Tommy's mobile was a pay-as-you-go number.<eos> Hadn't used it in a while.
I sold the van to Tommy a couple of months ago.<eos> He said he needed wheels.<eos> Now, that's a lie. Tommy was skint.<eos> It's not even worth the money for scrap.<eos> I think Tommy was driving it for you.
- Is that a sandstorm?<eos> I know what you're thinking, but we haven't had a sharknado in five years.<eos> - That's what worries me.<eos> - We're right by three Astro-X pods.<eos> They'll take it down if it grows into something bigger.
A day?<eos> If they've traveled north.<eos> Compass.<eos> This path cuts east.<eos> We'll follow it while the raptor covers all other terrains.
Yes.<eos> All right, where am I headed?<eos> You're exiting the tracheal artery.<eos> You should see the first fragment.<eos> No sign of it.
All right, where am I headed?<eos> You're exiting the tracheal artery.<eos> You should see the first fragment.<eos> No sign of it.<eos> Did I miss it?
Let's try this again.<eos> Back for more. Where's Savage's fortune?<eos> Now, I'm particularly interested in this thing called the "vessel".<eos> The vessel is my master's most treasured possession.<eos> Excellent, and where can we find it?
What does "fold in the cheese" mean?<eos> - You fold it in.<eos> - I understand that, but how?<eos> How do you fold it?<eos> Do you fold it in half, like a piece of paper, and drop it in the pot, or, what do you do?
They're Japanese graphic novels.<eos> It's called Manga.<eos> Oh, well, that sounds like a... Lucrative career choice.<eos> So anyway Bob, I've decided to take this space for my office, so.<eos> Ooh, now this is a bit awkward, because you gave me the distinct impression that you didn't want it.
I mean, I like it 'cause Jared Leto gave it to you, and he was my first kiss, but I don't know if I like, like it, like it.<eos> Um, that's not really an answer.<eos> I feel really bad, I feel like there's something burning in my throat.<eos> Oh my God, well, you could've answered the question by now.<eos> So I guess I'm wearing it.
Right out front!<eos> Bob, you know, this bagel shop idea was just an idea.<eos> You know, it's not even an idea, it's just an illustration of a theoretical idea.<eos> Well, that may be, but do you know how much a bagel oven costs?<eos> And Ivan here, he's willing to do it for free.
Well, it was very tasty, and naturally I'll reimburse you for it.<eos> Alright, well, give me seven bucks, we'll call it even.<eos> - Seven dollars? - It's raw milk we're talking here, it's all natural, unpasteurized, straight from the cow's breast, to your mouth.<eos> You paid seven dollars a bottle for this? !<eos> - Where do you get it?
- Yeah.<eos> - Do you want more coffee?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> Okay, so we've run out of sugar.<eos> Um, do you want it still because I don't really.
This girl, she has got balls."<eos> I do have balls.<eos> Only when you're on the other side of a computer screen, you've got balls.<eos> This bikini does not scream "balls."<eos> All right. You want me to put it on? - Yes!
This is your idea of a love interest?<eos> Yeah, okay, first of all, Gary, all right, he didn't call her a bitch.<eos> He said, "Bitch, please,"<eos> which is a term of endearment.<eos> I mean, I say it to Rachel all the time.
I guess we'll never find out, will we?<eos> - I like Darius... - Mm-hmm. And I intend to win.<eos> And if that doesn't make you happy, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.<eos> Yael, hey. So, there's a flag on the play.<eos> The costume assistant was steaming your blue dress, and she burned a hole in it.
Okay well, think about how much fun that will be for parties, David.<eos> Um, and what about parking?<eos> Okay, you don't... you don't even have a car!<eos> Oh my god, if you want the place so badly, David,<eos> - why don't you just say it? ! - Who says I want it?
Um, and what about parking?<eos> Okay, you don't... you don't even have a car!<eos> Oh my god, if you want the place so badly, David,<eos> - why don't you just say it? ! - Who says I want it?<eos> So you don't want it?
Of course not.<eos> - Never.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, this priceless artifact is yours.<eos> If you want it, just give me the damn crystal.
Don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.<eos> I'm not the sentimental type.<eos> No, but your partner, the physicist with the big brown eyes, is.<eos> Turn the core back online.<eos> You will turn it back on, or I will put a bullet in your friend's head.
- Show them who you are.<eos> - This is who I am.<eos> - No! It never has been.<eos> We hold the line.<eos> If you cross it now, then there's no way back.
I suspect if we were to put her in a line-up, Dr. Lorenz colleagues would soon pick out Lady Georgina as that young woman.<eos> Your sister discovered that not only was the animal that attacked her alive, but that Dr. Lorenz was using it as part of his research.<eos> I think she planned to use the tiger to exact her revenge, only Goggins got careless and the animal escaped.<eos> It looks as if it was your sister who stole the tigress musk and dosed Dr. Lorenz's handkerchief with it, in the hope that it would bring the animal to him.<eos> But Ingrid Hjort borrowed it. Unfortunately, she fell foul of someone who brought her out of Wytham.
- I need to see the old man.<eos> Mr. Drake has guests, as you know.<eos> He must hear this, however.<eos> Frank, save the shoe leather. I'm sure it must be near run through, and new boots are costly.<eos> Were it not for the fact I think you'd enjoy it too much, I'd take this piece of machinery and I'd shove it up your...
I might believe you!<eos> I dream often these days of my home, of all I might have been, had I not been forced to leave there, not had the need to learn this tongue of yours.<eos> Your instinct as regards the tidal patterns, your workings were sound.<eos> Such strong forces colliding, they will create a vortex.<eos> But the breakwater, this, erm, pier, they have built houses. The vortex, gives it shape, drives it into the land.
Legs!<eos> Listen carefully now.<eos> Be careful with him!<eos> When you reach the river, head west for two miles to a rickety bridge that looks like a crooked smile.<eos> Listen, when you cross it, go to the top of the hill, look for a house got a lantern in the window.
They're willing to buy it back at a premium.<eos> Premium?<eos> Don't let 'em fool you, August.<eos> Mercury's used to mine for gold.<eos> Probably get a whole hell of a lot more, you sell it to the highest bidder.
I hold, along with some colleagues, the patent for the original prototype, which we designed more than ten years ago now.<eos> So, this technology is now found on volcanoes around the world, and it's revolutionized the monitoring of gas emissions from volcanoes.<eos> It's my baby.<eos> I'm really glad to see it.<eos> I haven't seen it for two years, and here it is, still working.
They are bringing the prisoners back.<eos> It's too soon!<eos> If we don't get out now, we'll be trapped in here.<eos> You failed me.<eos> I gave Governor Feron the message just as you told me, I swear it.
Or we will carve out your eye, and when I find Eduardo I will show him your eyes as a reminder of the way you died.<eos> Where is Eduardo?<eos> Just tell him.<eos> Tell him!<eos> My son will drain the fluid from your eye and then carve it out if you do not tell me right now where your brother is.
For now.<eos> That thing is still out there.<eos> Yes, but we isolated a weakness. We can go on the offensive.<eos> Okay, if hallowed ground hurts the thing...<eos> Then we take what we can from this place and we weaponize it.
The cave in Iraq... you took more than just gold.<eos> Oh, even back then I was always looking for something extra-special to sell.<eos> I managed to sneak away from my unit and what do I find?<eos> I had no idea the power I held in the palm of my hand.<eos> And then I felt it, immediately.
Yes, but --<eos> The doctor will meet you once I've seen the surgery is complete and your cybernetic eye is in place.<eos> Surgery.<eos> You want us to remove...<eos> And replace it with --
- From a booth.<eos> We'll meet in four hours in the bar in front of the junk yard.<eos> What is this'?<eos> The boy's wallet.<eos> I took it before putting him in the trunk.
- You know what that is, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I was 9 and I had no fucking idea, so I asked my grandma and she said:<eos> "It's a super long worm that lives in your stomach and scoffs all you eat, and you can't gain weight".<eos> I asked her how to get rid of it and she said when you take a shit.
- You're not a thing either.<eos> - Are you expecting any call?<eos> Because you've been looking at your phone all night.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't know, I haven't noticed. I look at it to check the time.
The ones that I could open.<eos> I've tried everything else.<eos> Not everything.<eos> You're still here.<eos> Yeah, it seems like you got some kind of a plan. So why don't you tell us about it?
Well, I have my sources searching for Marcel.<eos> They won't be long.<eos> Still, I can't imagine that this turn of events will improve your odds.<eos> The game's not over.<eos> When the Strix find Marcel, they'll take back the charter and hand-deliver it to me.
These are my mom's medical records.<eos> How do they have these?<eos> You and I need to talk about Ezra Fitz.<eos> Does he know what you're doing?<eos> You wrote this, big parts of it.
The mystery is how am I going to walk in it.<eos> I may need to borrow Emily's legs.<eos> Well, I'll hem it.<eos> You're gonna rock this dress, I promise.<eos> Please try it on. Oh, wait.
Did you tell Yvonne to leave her phone at lunch?<eos> Yes.<eos> To prove to her that she shouldn't trust me.<eos> That's what I told her.<eos> Yeah, but then you never told her that I took it.
You wanted to believe that the army had straightened me out.<eos> Look. I'm your brother, but I'm not built like you.<eos> I didn't take to the military like you did.<eos> You saw the world as something to be fixed.<eos> I only saw it as broken, so I made sure I had enough to survive in it.
It's the wound from Ra's.<eos> If the life she owes doesn't come from taking others, it will come from the life of the host.<eos> Thea, please don't go.<eos> There's only one way to prevent that.<eos> My father once told me of an elixir known as the Lotus, and I will freely give it to you on one condition.
Andy told me that Genesis was coming.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Phil Collins said they'd never tour again.<eos> The old testament, the book of "Genesis."<eos> God wanted to give the world a do-over, so he destroyed it.
I don't think so.<eos> Phil Collins said they'd never tour again.<eos> The old testament, the book of "Genesis."<eos> God wanted to give the world a do-over, so he destroyed it.<eos> He destroyed it with a flood.
My ear plugs did not do a thing.<eos> The Sonic device is what shouldn't have done a damn thing.<eos> You said Cisco keyed it specifically to Laurel?<eos> It should have only worked with Laurel.<eos> The crazy part is that this girl is using it at much higher decibels than Laurel ever did.
Darhk ripped it out.<eos> Darhk would control the world's nuclear stockpile.<eos> Andy told me that Genesis was coming.<eos> God wanted to give the world a do-over, so he destroyed it.<eos> He destroyed it with a flood.
I think that's pretty close.<eos> All right, Stewie, now remember what we practiced last night.<eos> And here's a trick to keep that confidence up.<eos> You go in that room and imagine everyone in it wants you sexually.<eos> I'm doing it right now, and I feel powerful.
Oh, my God.<eos> Peter, did you get my text?<eos> No, hold on.<eos> No, I don't know what he's doing here.<eos> Okay, Stewie, when Barbara hands you that orange juice, you're gonna drink it and smile.
I better go; my helicopter's here.<eos> Fa-doo, fa-doo, fa-doo, fa-doo, fa-doo.<eos> Are you still-- by the way, you have no idea what a helicopter sounds like-- are you still keeping up this charade?<eos> Yeah, but it's perfect.<eos> Shelby's already off work, so I'll just grab the ring and we can bring it back before they close.
Oh, just some rich idiot I saw bragging about his vacation on Instagram.<eos> He posted a picture of his feet in sand.<eos> You're a guy, don't do that.<eos> What a dick.<eos> Hey, I'll swallow his dental floss. You pull it out of me and put it back on the roll.
Here, Chris.<eos> Your first cell phone!<eos> Yay! Something my dad held in the bathroom!<eos> You know, Chris, you could probably salvage that phone.<eos> If you put it in a bag of uncooked rice, it'll dry out.
Cole, it's over.<eos> Your country thanks you for your service, Shirley.<eos> So what's Jones' plan for getting us back without a tether?<eos> I have to place a classified ad in the paper, give her an exact time, specific location.<eos> She then reads it in 2044.
I listen to Beyoncé.<eos> So... bow down bitches!<eos> We were going to give you my brother's number.<eos> He is a surgeon.<eos> And I now glad to take it.
They won't be easy to kill.<eos> These Reapers are even deadlier, which will make your task more difficult.<eos> My task?<eos> For this experiment to work, we need blood from a living Kree.<eos> And I want you to get it.
No.<eos> Do you feel guilty about it?<eos> Not really.<eos> I don't see the world like you do, Christian.<eos> How do you see it?
And to stay in the fold.<eos> Venya, you know the parable about the servant who hid his talent in the earth.<eos> And you know how it ends.<eos> You too have a talent.<eos> And God doesn't want you to hide it.
They were going to her grave.<eos> That's what he said.<eos> Where?<eos> Here?<eos> 'Aggie wants us to spend it with her.
But there is a strength in forgiveness.<eos> There is a potency.<eos> Not only for those who have done us wrong, but also for ourselves.<eos> In forgiveness... there is love.<eos> Come on girls, you're missing it!
They really had nothing that could compete with the corvette.<eos> Gm had something like 60% market share.<eos> And over the course of a year there had literally been almost a 15-point swing where they stole 15% of market share from Ford.<eos> Henry Ford flipped out and he says, hell with you guys.<eos> If you're cheating and you're not going to hold up the ban, I'm announcing right now, publicly were not going to do it and we're going racing.
They had come in. Taken over.<eos> Shelby didn't fire really me, but it was obvious they didn't need me around there anymore.<eos> Enzo Ferrari did not tolerate mistakes.<eos> Especially when it came to engineering.<eos> And if engineers did make a mistake, he made sure they knew about it.
As a driver, of course, you always go for the power.<eos> The 289 at the very beginning obviously left a lot to be desired.<eos> There just was not the power that the driver is looking for.<eos> Ultimately, of course, they came out with the mark ii.<eos> They said, right, we got to get the job done, so if we can't do it by cunning and daring, we'll do it by brute just force with this bloody great engine. We'll blow them away.
Ferrari, having lost at le mans, got a little bit of its own back by going to Daytona.<eos> Early in the career, they had not been as durable as the opposition this is the first time that Ford had been slower than the opposition.<eos> So at that point it became clear to the hierarchy that something needed to be done.<eos> But it wasn't clear how to make the mark ii decidedly faster in a short period of time.<eos> Phil Remington returned to dearborn with two of his chief fabricators and they took the first j-car chassis, they took it into the wind tunnel and they started literally cutting away at the bodywork to try to improve the aerodynamics of the car.
\.Y'\'" r he sprays the crowd with champagne.<eos> Nobody had ever done that.<eos> Like a fire hose, I could get every single one of them.<eos> I didn't realize what it would evolve into.<eos> Now, in every race, particularly in Europe, people win... They pop the champagne and spray it.
Why shouldn't he be part of the 22? Because he was one of us!<eos> Lundberg?<eos> We know that Carnot was here 10 years ago and he met with Burlin and Forsberg.<eos> like the bear ring.<eos> They use it when they kill a bear.
In one month it'll be gone.<eos> Could you repeat?<eos> I didn't get it. -<eos> - Of course.<eos> It'll be gone in a month, because you gonna take it away from the mine.
- Well, actually, I could use about seven, but one will do.<eos> I need you to put these in bay eight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Are we giving her the runaround, or is she giving it to us?
I only wanted to bring you a bit of joy.<eos> In the dark depths, she was a ray of hope.<eos> Do you know why I stand guard, why I remain hidden in this place, while the others live in the light?<eos> Once, and only once, did all the gods work as one.<eos> We took all the evil in this world, and we hid it away in this box, Pandora.
Got to find a way to shield it or...<eos> Jen!<eos> Let her go!<eos> No longer will I tolerate anyone's meddling!<eos> My power is my own, and no one will take it from me ever again.
It almost impresses me. The insatiable mortal desire to fight what you cannot possibly conquer.<eos> I don't know what I hate about you most: the way you talk, or the way you treat women.<eos> Let me help you choose.<eos> I know well the value mortals place on love.<eos> Let me take yours... and turn it into pain.
All right?<eos> Nobody made you drop out.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> All right? I got you this job, man. Now you don't want it?
Salt.<eos> We put it out.<eos> It keeps 'em placid.<eos> Trolls are mountainborn.<eos> If they can't get salt from the rock, they'll get it from red blood.
Uh, Carlos doesn't wear underwear.<eos> -Sol, you've got to look at Carlos.<eos> -Nah, I'm good.<eos> -You boys like bingo?<eos> -He loves it.
Neither will I.<eos> You want to know why you haven't caught this guy yet?<eos> Because you're too good... too decent.<eos> You of all people should know how indecent I can be.<eos> You give everyone the benefit of the doubt whether they deserve it or not, and Mr. X doesn't deserve it.
It's too far away for me to read her lips, but if you look at her body language, it's like she's saying, "Are you lost?<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> Should we call them?"<eos> Joey hands her his phone.<eos> The man walks away with it, presumably destroys it, then hides it.
Where's my bracelet?<eos> Why do I have a feeling this is not a social call?<eos> I need that bracelet back.<eos> See, you're fine stealing from other people, but when it happens to you, you don't like it.<eos> I was forced to steal it to pay off my debt, and if I don't hand it over,
Look where that got me.<eos> That was the old me.<eos> This is the new me.<eos> And the new me is gonna get shot in the head if you don't give me the bracelet back.<eos> If I give it back, I'm an accessory to a crime.
That was the old me.<eos> This is the new me.<eos> And the new me is gonna get shot in the head if you don't give me the bracelet back.<eos> If I give it back, I'm an accessory to a crime.<eos> If you keep it, you'll be found guilty of the crime.
This is the new me.<eos> And the new me is gonna get shot in the head if you don't give me the bracelet back.<eos> If I give it back, I'm an accessory to a crime.<eos> If you keep it, you'll be found guilty of the crime.<eos> And let me tell you something... my Benefactor isn't the only one looking for it.
That is good. You want to try Felicity's omelet?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I've had it.<eos> So, what is this bracelet, Rhys?<eos> Why is every crook in town after it?
He'll try and divide and conquer.<eos> He always does.<eos> So we can't let him or anything else come between us.<eos> I promise.<eos> We don't know much about the bracelet... only that every crime syndicate in town seems to be after it.
He always does.<eos> So we can't let him or anything else come between us.<eos> I promise.<eos> We don't know much about the bracelet... only that every crime syndicate in town seems to be after it.<eos> But you think Christopher has it.
We're talking more now than we did when you were Christopher Hall.<eos> Where are you now?<eos> On my way to the Larágan Consulate to return the bracelet.<eos> Alice, don't do that.<eos> Agent Dao is looking for it, too.
Can I have it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mickey Shive was waiting for me.<eos> What do you think they're gonna do with it?<eos> Sell it, of course.
Margot.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Yes, we had a deal to steal the bracelet from the Larágan Consulate in exchange for our missed payment, but now...<eos> We had a deal for the bracelet.<eos> If you want us to steal it again, then you will forgive our debt in full.
We can't let them press the fence.<eos> We go out once a week and clear out the bodies.<eos> You okay?<eos> He had a pickax.<eos> He was swinging it like...
- Yes, that's right.<eos> And I'd like to say that we don't ask for money.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - And there's nothing illegal here.<eos> I have a gift, and I want to put it to use to serve the needy.
How did you know I lost it?<eos> From time to time I'd call the orphanage where you were growing up.<eos> And they told me that you always kept a piece of the pipe with you, but that you were missing the other piece.<eos> How did you find that piece?<eos> I had already lost it after you left me at the orphanage.
Should have gone with the turkey pot pie.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> Never seen anyone look so pissed off at a turkey pot pie.<eos> Just... reminds me of someone I know.<eos> You mind if I eat it?
- Lele leaves his face down.<eos> - What ? - You leave it face down.<eos> Think I haven't noticed ?<eos> It's not intentional.<eos> I pull out my phone and place it down.
- What do you mean, 50 euros?<eos> - Dad, what are you saying?<eos> - Shut up and let Dad handle it.<eos> - And this tiramisu?<eos> Aunt Aurora made it. It's delicious.
The day shall come.<eos> The day shall come.<eos> Bram and Gracie?<eos> I'm back, and I got apple juice.<eos> Almost didn't get it.
Baby drinks for free.<eos> Looks like we got a good news/bad news situation on our hands.<eos> Marcel, I simply don't have time for this.<eos> I got a bead on the bullet.<eos> Whoever found it is offering it up to the highest bidder.
Kol's linked to that candle, so whatever our two lovebirds say, our witches will be able to hear it.<eos> I don't think that a few more minutes of privacy is too much to ask.<eos> I don't give a damn about young love.<eos> They have a task.<eos> They had better finish it.
- No, that's the wrong answer!<eos> - No, no, no,<eos> I know this is a war but I've lost a lot of friends, too.<eos> Today... I need your help.<eos> Then you shall have it.
- All righty. Thank you, ma'am.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Just got a call from Raleigh County, West Virginia.<eos> State claimed the body.<eos> So, uh, we called the E.M.S. They're gonna transport it up to Charleston, uh, right now.
Huh? Now listen, I am launching this product next weekend, and you let Parker walk out of here potentially jeopardizing a billion-dollar deal.<eos> I want you to look into the face of a man who outsmarted you... So you understand how stupid you really are.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want you two idiots to go out there, find the bigger idiot, bring this product back to me, or don't bother coming back.<eos> So we're, like, fired if we don't find it?
Well, I remember the sex was amazing.<eos> And it got way more amazing for a minute.<eos> W-what?<eos> I thought you took it off.<eos> Why would I take it off?
♪ in Jesus' name, we tamed the savages ♪<eos> Listen to me, man, the product, it's irrelevant to the story. Okay?<eos> That's why I need it back.<eos> Your boss made it seem pretty important.<eos> I mean, you said he really wanted it back.
Look, if I was a girl...<eos> Peop... people lose their minds when something happens to a girl.<eos> They have rights groups supporting them. They have lesbians out hating men, but... a guy?<eos> You really believe people don't care when a male is violated?<eos> I put a mattress on my back and carry it around, you think they're gonna put me on TV?
We've all got our things, don't we?<eos> The demon demands payment.<eos> We must each relinquish a beloved memory of the one we love the most.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Keep this with you and think of me when you wear it.
And he can speak to you through that necklace?<eos> - Here, in the Institute?<eos> - It's like when I saw Dot.<eos> It's a Portal shard.<eos> That's why your mother made sure you had it.
I'm listening.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> It's in the loft where you found me.<eos> There's a loose floorboard in the bedroom.<eos> My mom didn't know I knew, but she hid it there.
DEAR LUCAS, BE AT MY HOME TODAY AT 8:00 PM.<eos> FATHER JOSÉ<eos> Look what I booked for us.<eos> You always had good wine.<eos> - I open it and you serve.
I love you."<eos> We go to the same church, so I thought it was... -it was sister talk.<eos> -Like sisters in Christ.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And she wrote me another note and passed it.
Ben joined Compaq at a time when we were just forming, and I think he's played a key role in helping guide us along the way.<eos> We have a lot of mutual respect, and we bring different things to the party.<eos> You have to give Ben credit for two things.<eos> One, he saw that the vision was a real vision.<eos> He got it right away because they did finance the plan, and then at each stage thereafter he encouraged and supported.
You hear me?<eos> - I just wanna help, Sergeant. - No, you can't help.<eos> You're the problem!<eos> 'Cause of you, the uniform means dick.<eos> Cops are no longer preventing crime, we're just chasing it.
She asked me to read the following statement.<eos> "It was a difficult decision for me not to return..."<eos> But I know my husband. If he were conscious... "...he'd tell me to press on..."<eos> ...that the best way to be at his side is to serve my country.<eos> "And I can serve it better in Germany than in a waiting room.
Like, safe?<eos> - Yes, is that weird?<eos> - Huh. - I get it.<eos> I wish you could see this place.<eos> I can, if you describe it to me.
You said we're going to war.<eos> We are.<eos> And there'll be a time and place for you to turn yourself loose.<eos> But right now, the last thing you want is for everybody here to be... scared shitless of you.<eos> Tame that fire... or they'll tame it for you.
Hold on. No.<eos> No! Get off me!<eos> - It wasn't my idea!<eos> - You don't have to do that! Please!<eos> He'll turn it off!
I meant it, Ray.<eos> I love you.<eos> I guess you found the ring.<eos> The ring?<eos> Kind of a strange way to get engaged, but... I'll take it.
A patient named Richard Kester.<eos> His wife convinced him to try Dr. Shaw's therapy.<eos> Hmm, let me guess... didn't end well? She had an affair.<eos> They got divorced. And then Richard sent Dr. Shaw a death threat.<eos> It's been more than a year, but that kind of anger can bubble up when you least expect it.
Oh, yes, I know exactly how you feel.<eos> Decker.<eos> We called around, found the girl that gave Rose her subdermals.<eos> Said she, uh, came in a couple weeks ago with a guy.<eos> Weird guy, apparently, with a weird name, too, but she can't remember it.
Yeah, it's cool.<eos> So, are you gonna take the job?<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> You think it'd be fun to work together?<eos> I think you should take it if you want it. For sure.
Yeah, she's doomed.<eos> Oh, my God, thank you!<eos> Ms. Grant, they were out of lattes, so here's a coffee.<eos> Mmm.<eos> And here you are, delivering it to me like a normal, boring person.
Mine ain't good.<eos> You're out already?<eos> Hanging on to it.<eos> I thought the whole point was to not pay rent.<eos> Use it for storage, that sort of thing.
And we still have no idea who this person is?<eos> Unfortunately, no, which is another of our better questions.<eos> But hearing Emile and Tamika maybe both spoke to the same person right before they died got us a warrant.<eos> We're set up on the mystery phone, but it's turned off, battery out.<eos> Well, maybe the owner will turn it back on.
Unfortunately, no, which is another of our better questions.<eos> But hearing Emile and Tamika maybe both spoke to the same person right before they died got us a warrant.<eos> We're set up on the mystery phone, but it's turned off, battery out.<eos> Well, maybe the owner will turn it back on.<eos> And leave it on for at least an hour so it pops back up online?
Quickly, people. We gotta find it.<eos> I think it might be in the parking lot.<eos> But there's already people here.<eos> Do you want... want me to hold them back?<eos> No, person with the phone might realize what we were up to - and turn it off.
Thank you, Miriam, for the translation. She always sounds believable no matter what she says.<eos> If your client could tell us where Gary is, it would help us take her version of events more seriously.<eos> Gary has one of those disposable cellphones.<eos> Does that help?<eos> If you know the phone number and if Gary is still using it.
Too many of the right questions.<eos> Which makes the other search I turned up especially odd.<eos> The Uzi's serial number was run 11 years ago.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> We only now just found it.
True form?<eos> It needs a total of four living souls to consume and then it'll walk the earth.<eos> Four souls, one for each corner of hell where it's trapped.<eos> After that, it's unchained from its suffering and it's free to walk the earth.<eos> Well, how do we beat it?
Hester?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Why are you tracking this synthetic?<eos> It's, uh, experiencing a very unusual systems fault.<eos> It could make it dangerous. We're going to fix it.
You know, they have a different study every five minutes.<eos> I mean, at first they say that<eos> "Oh, red wine is the fountain of youth."<eos> And the next it's, "oh, it's liquid death."<eos> Come on, Stefanie, look, when you have cancer, you just cut it out.
You want Sally Benton's endorsement?<eos> We just have to show her who has the real ideas, so...<eos> We challenge Lexi to a debate.<eos> And then it just disappeared?<eos> Yeah, I guess whoever put the comment up must have taken it down.
And I'm your wife.<eos> It's his bachelor party.<eos> And this is my life.<eos> Do you care about our marriage at all? I do.<eos> I count on it to be a place of support from which I...
That's the jet he flew us down to Kevin Copeland's place.<eos> - That's the one.<eos> - That's a hell of a jet.<eos> - Uh-huh. - That's all I'm saying.<eos> And if you want it today, all you have to do is take over the payments.
Well, now it's significant.<eos> I thought it was a clean-up but I didn't realize it was a cover-up.<eos> If Dan White is an operative, that means that he had to have been vetted by ASIO.<eos> Which means, there's a file.<eos> And even if I got it, you couldn't publish it.
Master Chief's been gone for over two hours.<eos> You tend to pass out afterwards.<eos> How long was the needle in your arm, Captain?<eos> Half-hour, give or take.<eos> It's like they're taking our blood and feeding it to half their crew.
The organ broker who sold Will's kidney.<eos> Good. We need to hit the ground running.<eos> Tommy's life depends on it.<eos> "Let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers, but to be fearless in facing them.<eos> Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain, but for the heart to conquer it."
We will find them tonight.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Didn't Minow lead you to the cargo?<eos> He did better than that.<eos> He led us right to the facility where they were keeping it.
Here.<eos> I will get them back for what they did to us.<eos> This book, it is bait!<eos> You want the Master?<eos> He will come for whoever possesses it.
You can name her.<eos> Anything you like.<eos> She's here to serve you.<eos> Give her an order,<eos> - and she will carry it out.
Here are the reports.<eos> Eight the hard way.<eos> My lucky number.<eos> I got a good feeling about this batch.<eos> I'll believe it if you will.
It's not gonna be admissible, though. I-I drew a little bit outside of the lines to--<eos> It's not gonna be admissible, then it doesn't count.<eos> I know, yeah, just listen, okay?<eos> I can link her to the Lobos murder plot.<eos> I fuckin' knew it all along, and no one fuckin' believed me, and that's fine, but if--
Yes.<eos> Though my hair was much shorter.<eos> What is the name of your kingdom?<eos> China.<eos> And who rules it?
Why did you look at me that way?<eos> In that fashion?<eos> Why should you pity me?<eos> I think you carry a terrible burden.<eos> And you carry it alone.
Bring it to us.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Get the warrant?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are you gonna let me see it?
So, start your timeline at zero.<eos> What's your first event?<eos> I'm gonna start with the suicide at SSU.<eos> It happened a month before the first killing. I'm not ready to call that a coincidence.<eos> All right. We'll call it event one.
Have you ever had feelings of wanting to harm yourself?<eos> Others, sure.<eos> But myself?<eos> I just need to get a message to somebody.<eos> Maybe you could just let me borrow it for a second?
I know where he'd take her.<eos> What do you mean, you know where he'd take her?<eos> Connor owns 200 acres of land north of the city.<eos> - That's where the lab is.<eos> - How do we find it?
She's lied to us this whole time.<eos> But, Duval, Gracie's your kid.<eos> - It's your call.<eos> You know this place well enough to draw us a map?<eos> Yes. I know it very well.
Okay.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> - Stop!<eos> - It's... My medication is in there.<eos> If I don't take it, I would be in no shape to answer Connor's questions.
It's about time.<eos> It's throbbing like crazy.<eos> All right. Well, sit down, and we'll get started.<eos> I thought you liked pain.<eos> Only when I ask for it.
Jacob and his mother... they're heading right towards a wall of Germans.<eos> Do you have to socialize with your husband's coworkers often?<eos> It's not my favourite part of the job.<eos> That book you're reading?<eos> There's not one of them that would look at it.
I cannot lose my job.<eos> Is he still angry?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Ken, what's his state of mind?<eos> He buried it down, pretended it wasn't happening.
I worked on a team that worked for a team that worked on the Hubble telescope.<eos> He's being modest.<eos> -He has a letter from the president.<eos> -No way.<eos> Once I was held back from riding an elevator because the first lady was riding in it.
Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm just looking for a device.<eos> It belonged to the Connavers?<eos> They use it to get into Arkyn. - Why do you want it?
So, is this good-bye then?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I heard you talking.<eos> I know you have a warrant for the shield.<eos> You know I'd give it to you, but...
Maybe an animal.<eos> It is a dog.<eos> A dog?<eos> Now, Elena...<eos> I want you to take this dog... and take it out of the room.
No, no, Piggy's tail is front-page news!<eos> Oh, wait... let's see.<eos> I don't see what the big deal is.<eos> I was born with a tail.<eos> The doctors removed it, but I keep it close so when I'm reincarnated, I'll be whole.
I'm okay.<eos> We can't stay here.<eos> If Vorza got away, he'll be back with an army.<eos> All right.<eos> We need to move the body before somebody discovers it.
I smell a promotion.<eos> And unlike Angela, you've done it without sucking anyone's dick.<eos> She didn't suck Mike's dick to get on the task force.<eos> DOJ drafted a deal.<eos> If Ruiz takes it, finally have a witness to testify against Lobos.
-Grace, just let me--<eos> -No.<eos> -Grace!<eos> -Sir, you need to pay your bill.<eos> I haven't brought it yet, but I was going to.
You know how everyone has that one teacher that really believed in them, changed their lives?<eos> Mr. Eastman. A.P. Calculus.<eos> My father was that to so many people.<eos> He was so proud of that watch.<eos> He wore it everywhere.
So basically you stole it.<eos> Look. I've obviously wandered into something here.<eos> You're telling me this phone is linked to a murder.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> I picked up a phone, turned it on to see who it belonged to. I was about to return it and next thing I know, you lot are arriving outside the bleeding restaurant.
So I figured with my scientific background, I could increase my powers, and... I did.<eos> So you've taken Velocity-6 before?<eos> Yes.<eos> But there were some unforeseen side effects.<eos> This is why you didn't want Barry to take it or even know about it.
That right there... it's best damn blacksmith in the whole damn Union.<eos> That's who he is.<eos> Let me tell you now, that boy... he got rare, mystical skills, passed down by Mandinka craftsmen.<eos> That's on the Kamby Bolongo in Africa.<eos> One time, I saw him patch a cannon by sitting on the muzzle and hammering it as it fired!
Good schools.<eos> Are you familiar with a gang called "Los Guapos"?<eos> It's their turf, but, uh, we have an understanding.<eos> So I assume that would extend to my baby as well.<eos> Okay, so if a baby does poo-poo, would you, like, wipe it front to back or back to front?
I just want to hold her one more time...<eos> Wow, you could be in a lifetime movie. Thanks.<eos> We gonna do this the easy way.<eos> You want the couch?<eos> Whoever sits on it the longest gets it.
I love you. (chuckles)<eos> But you are getting me a real ring.<eos> You're gonna have a diamond the size of a raisin.<eos> We can go tomorrow.<eos> We'll pick it out together. (laughs)
Ah, father and son.<eos> Dani, would you look at this heart-warming tableau.<eos> My heart's plenty warm. Leave me out of this.<eos> You know, maybe you two should talk.<eos> You have this precious time, and you spend it all in front of the old boob tube.
I need my samovar for the party.<eos> You mean my samovar?<eos> I'm the one that spotted it at the Rose Bowl in 1999.<eos> -You snooze, you lose.<eos> -Well, I got it back.
But she's never going to stop until she gets that painting.<eos> She's sent me six text messages since we hung up<eos> -and they all say "Kenny Loggins."<eos> -Here's what you do.<eos> You go to the garage, you dig it out, you say you got it back from him, and he sends his best.
Yes, you do, Troy.<eos> Was it because seclusion was the only place they couldn't get to you... the only place that you felt safe?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And why do you have that tattoo?<eos> They said that, uh... if I don't, if I don't let them give it to me... then they're just gonna keep beating me every day.
It's the girl from the food drop.<eos> She didn't have any I.D.<eos> She told the officer her name was Sara.<eos> Hey, I'll store the teddy bear with the other belongings.<eos> Maybe someone will recognize it when this is all over.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I'm telling you, it's real.<eos> The Confederates used it during Sherman's siege.
Trey?<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> He's fixing Cinco.<eos> Dr. Cannerts, what are you doing?<eos> I'm drawing the antiserum from Thomas's blood, mixing it with interferon, and introducing it into Cinco's bloodstream in real time.
This could lead to a cure.<eos> The hope may lie in one of us.<eos> Which means it lies in all of us.<eos> I, for one, am glad the president apologized. Hold up.<eos> Just because they didn't do this attack doesn't mean they're never going to attempt one like it in the future.
Why then?<eos> Because that's where Kendra is.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> She sent us a message through time.<eos> Go ahead, say it.
I'm just saying, she is very in tune with her family and surroundings.<eos> So am I.<eos> Did we get a dog?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> I don't want it in the kitchen, I don't want it on the couch.
All we have is now, and this is what we have to do now.<eos> Let's stop their supplies, stop our parents leaving.<eos> We can worry about 'then what' tomorrow.<eos> Best way this works is if we blow up the bridge before the truck gets there so the parentals can run free.<eos> We blow it too soon, they never leave the showground.
What are you looking for?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> - We gave you work.<eos> We thought you needed help.<eos> You found it in the caves, didn't you?
Oh, I'm not gonna let just anyone look after Vivian.<eos> She's too important to me.<eos> And so are you.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Just when I think I don't have room for any more food, I find it.
- So this is about my book?<eos> This is about you...<eos> living in a morally questionable universe that isn't appropriate to raise a child in.<eos> But yes... I found your book exploitive and disturbing. Faith and I both did.<eos> What's gonna happen when Vivian grows up and reads it?
This is amazing!<eos> Which means that values are something we've invented, and having them should be a choice rather than something that's forced on us.<eos> And you got all this from a book on architecture?<eos> "The Fountainhead" is about so much more than architecture. Wow.<eos> I'll have to read it sometime.
And I...<eos> I saw a window...<eos> No, there's... There's no window, Scott. - I promise.<eos> - There is a window.<eos> And I'll stay here, and I'll... I'll wait for you to see it, too. Because I know somewhere deep down in there... there's a part of you that knows this is right.
You haven't even seen my biggest surprise.<eos> You made the bed?<eos> - But how?<eos> - I Googled it.<eos> And if it gets messed up, I'll make it again.
That, man.<eos> That cost three bucks, Chip.<eos> Is that the watermelon that was in your fridge?<eos> - Yeah, and it's gone!<eos> - Yeah... because you ate it.
I thought we were here to talk about surviving on the inside.<eos> OK. If I ever go down,<eos> - what tips would you give me?<eos> - Well, it's all about power.<eos> Whose got it and who wants it.
- Well, it's all about power.<eos> Whose got it and who wants it.<eos> If you got it, what do you do to keep it?<eos> What parts of yourself will you shut down to stay on top?<eos> And if you want it, what are you gonna do to get it?
- Hardly surprising.<eos> - They're beetles made of dung.<eos> - They're not made of it.<eos> They live on it.<eos> They cut it, then they roll it and they bury it.
- That's your big plan, is it?<eos> Well, Sven is Greek Orthodox ... though he likes the confession part, he says, and the hats.<eos> So it's all planned.<eos> - Look if this wedding does go ahead, I ...<eos> - Darling, this wedding is going ahead, and I would really like it if you could arrange it for me, please.
Don't get paranoid.<eos> We are working on a brand new image...<eos> Tell them to fuck off... subtly, as you usually do.<eos> Oh, and delete the message.<eos> In case the Eloísa folk see it.
- Where you going?<eos> - I'll be back.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Now, I did work hard to make sure that we have a fitting memorial - to these fine men. - Excuse me.<eos> They deserve it.
Sorry to trouble you so late.<eos> I got it, Rosie.<eos> Got what?<eos> Apparently, we got a situation.<eos> Well, then I guess you better deal with it, but don't leave these children standing out in the cold.
- No.<eos> Because I told him I'd cut his dick off, and he knew that, and I meant it.<eos> She did tell me she'd cut off my dick and I did know it, but I wasn't particularly concerned on account of the fact that I don't use it for much except pissing.<eos> In fact, I'd love to see it go because all I do is look at it every day and it reminds me of better times.<eos> Now when I brought up your dick, it wasn't my intention for you to just run with it as a topic of conversation.
I mean, they just keep saying the same thing over and over.<eos> According to police, Siletti was driving with an expired license and refused...<eos> Really, I don't know what you're expecting to see.<eos> The Ramirez family has asked the Attorney General's office for assurances that Mr. Siletti's high profile earns him no preferential treatment, and today, the lead prosecutor on the case responded.<eos> We'll investigate this case thoroughly and prosecute it vigorously, as we do with all cases.
Um, sorry, I can't do dinner.<eos> Why not?<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> Got it.<eos> Coach put me on a diet 'cause I ate so much of your food. 'Cause I love it so much.
- You are anxious.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> I'm not anxious.<eos> This work I am set to, my research in Whitechapel,<eos> - you do not wish me to undertake it.
You mean to make me generous?<eos> You think me some feeble-headed girl - with her brains in her tits.<eos> - No, sir. No, indeed.<eos> I will give the job, the man who offers me the best price.<eos> For three, four... we'll do it for half your fee.
- We're done here.<eos> - Hey, Wayne.<eos> You know, the people that you work for, they gotta be mighty pissed that your drugs are out on the street right now.<eos> And Eric O'Bannon going and running his mouth to the feds, that's not gonna make them any happier.<eos> I mean, fuck, they're giving you an awful lot of rope, aren't they? And eventually they're gonna hang you with it.
You've been taking advantage of me.<eos> I do all the work, you two make all the money.<eos> Well, sure, yeah, we can work something out.<eos> I'll be back at midnight to collect the rest.<eos> If I don't get it, they'll be pulling your bodies out of the lake.
- Want to touch it?<eos> - The flower?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Yeah, my cousin won't appreciate it, but I don't care.
I had to take care of this thing.<eos> It's always a thing.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> I really wanted to give you this cake.<eos> No, you wanted the credit, and you lived off of it before you did it, and then, you didn't fucking do it, but you still bagged the credit.
- Cathy.<eos> Do we have a problem?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I'll coordinate with Doug.<eos> After a dog's bitten you, you either put it to sleep, or you put a muzzle on it.
If they did, they wouldn't have released two hostages.<eos> They're actually looking for an excuse to back out.<eos> If the media plays that video, I look like a traitor.<eos> We tell them it's a precondition.<eos> If they share it, the deal is off.
"Interim Deputy Director."<eos> Suits you.<eos> Yeah, well, I thought a, uh, a new role might suit you, too.<eos> Head of this JTTF branch... Hannah's job.<eos> Yours now if you want it, though I'm assuming you don't since I heard you put in for a transfer back to L.A.
Still got to check, handsome.<eos> You got banged up pretty good.<eos> May have internal bleeding.<eos> And what about his bite?<eos> Keep it clean.
Let's hope they can keep their clothes on.<eos> She only got the job because it's Mr Grove's daughter.<eos> Well, she's down in the stock room now.<eos> There's girls that would kill for that job.<eos> It should go to someone who deserves it.
Why does everything have to be this complicated?<eos> Why can't we just find what we need to find so Cat and Vincent can have a damn life? !<eos> Hey, hey... come on.<eos> I'll get you some ice.<eos> Only if you put it in a drink.
So it's his only way into the city.<eos> Although how Braxton plans on blowing it up, I have no idea, 'cause it'll have been cleared by tomorrow.<eos> Still, it does everything Braxton wants it to do:<eos> it covers up the prince's murder in what looks like a terrorist attack.<eos> Yeah, which Vincent gets blamed for, unless we can somehow stop it.
-What?<eos> We'll book Eddie Redmayne as the fetus.<eos> Are you hearing yourselves?<eos> We're not going to fake an abortion on live TV.<eos> Obviously, we'll pre-tape it.
Yes, thank you.<eos> Welcome. Please come in. Hello.<eos> Thank you, Abby.<eos> Do you still need the binder?<eos> I can't locate it.
I'm Michael.<eos> I don't know. I've just always wanted to see it.<eos> Yeah, you know, I think I saw a TV special on that.<eos> I watch a ton of stuff on NatGeo, which, after a while, gotta say kind of all blends together into one big shark, temple, monkey, alien show.<eos> Well, if you do go, you will remember it.
Oh, look, wrapping's coming off.<eos> Yeah, well, don't mess with it. You're gonna make it worse.<eos> Just peel it back a little bit, we could take a look what's inside.<eos> What, are you crazy?<eos> I'm not... I'm not gonna open it.
You listen to me, you ancient fuck!<eos> Nobody is paying attention to you.<eos> You're out.<eos> They all come with the same size in a cup.<eos> You drink it and you are ready to go.
Because that won't get you the answers you're looking for.<eos> And because I don't think you want to be dealing with another murder charge, either.<eos> The buyer will be contacting you.<eos> He'll let you know what the next test is.<eos> And if I don't do it?
Ouch. That's not what I meant.<eos> Just charm Braxton.<eos> Keep his attention away from his computer.<eos> No, I know.<eos> And then you'll take the doohickey and insert it into the computer, and it'll take it from the airlock to the cloud or something.
How do they get into... a pickle like this?<eos> Do you really want to know?<eos> Now you'll think I'm senile.<eos> They promise them a better life, and a job.<eos> Then, when they get here, they take their passport and their papers, siphon off their wages... ..tell them they're sending it all home to their families, along with any letters they write - which, of course, they aren't -
About divorce proceedings.<eos> Hey...<eos> They think they've found another one.<eos> It's been on t'news. National news on t'telly.<eos> Have they announced it officially?
- No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you won't look after it.<eos> No, I would.<eos> I'll walk it and feed it and everything.
Hey.<eos> Welcome back, bro.<eos> Time for job two.<eos> 7-7s moved in on your territory while you were gone.<eos> You're taking it back tonight.
Turns out we didn't need the DNA.<eos> The suspect alibied out.<eos> She was already at Kings Theater at the time of death.<eos> We did get the address of Peter's old apartment in the village...<eos> Apparently, he was using it as a love shack.
While Henry's on one of those rides he wants to do 17 times in a row.<eos> Okay?<eos> Don used to drink soju, it's a Korean liquor.<eos> They're making fun of Don because he drink wine - with Korean food.<eos> - Oh. My brother drinks it with everything- scrambled eggs.
Is this a group home?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Well, the property across the lane, the one that burned down?<eos> Where they found the body?<eos> Yeah, there's a shed over there and it looks like some kids have been using it as, like, a clubhouse of some sort.
- Fox Ryder.<eos> It's my new name.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> - Um..<eos> I can't really use the name Brent right now because, uh.. ...because cobra trademarked it behind my back.
We celebrate all the time but we pull out the really good stuff for you.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Alright.<eos> - So, Sean, I've been writing a script.<eos> I can't wait for you to read it.
I'm not willing to give up yet.<eos> Catherine. The text-<eos> - JT can trace it.<eos> And Garrus talked about Braxton's foreign client.<eos> We comb Graydal's records, maybe we get a name, take it to DHS and try and make a deal.
No, absolutely not.<eos> You cannot track Jace through your parabatai bond.<eos> It will weaken both of you.<eos> Or break the bond.<eos> Jace already weakened it.
You know when would be a good time for me, Clary?<eos> Never.<eos> Never call me again.<eos> - What the hell is that thing? - Let's go.<eos> Did you kill it?
Simon, wait!<eos> What's going on?<eos> We need your help.<eos> The Book of the White.<eos> It contains the spell that can wake my mom, but she hid it so Valentine can never find it.
Of course.<eos> And what is it you require?<eos> A clean slate.<eos> She wants a Writ of Turning-Me-Into-A-Vampire.<eos> And we need you to draft it. Hmm.
And yet true love cannot die.<eos> But people can.<eos> People are more than just toys for your amusement.<eos> Hundreds of years old and still so naive.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with love if you found it.
It looks bigger than it did in the brochure.<eos> Well, better that than the other way round.<eos> Do you remember that awful hotel we stayed in in Greece?<eos> It wasn't so bad, I rather liked it, though as I recall the local tipple was fairly wretched.<eos> Do you remember it, Cathy?
They get mean and take everything away, I know.<eos> Essentially, yeah.<eos> They have their reasons.<eos> But that's what happened to the manuscript.<eos> For some reason, I didn't deserve it.
Dad, I need to talk to Mom, like, now. It's important.<eos> Well, after a frolic, she'll usually head for the tepidarium.<eos> Can you please just call it the bath?<eos> Nonsense.<eos> This is my domus. I shall call it what I please.
Jesus.<eos> You're doing time magic to change what you did.<eos> Yeah, but only a fluke natural-born time witch could do something like that.<eos> Now, I have done all the research there is, and one day, I realized I was looking at it wrong.<eos> We don't have the energy, but it's not that we need to generate it, because somebody already has it.
- Well, I'm gonna need it.<eos> - Why?<eos> We're asking all key witnesses to hand over the clothes they were wearing the night your sister-in-law was murdered.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I guess it's a good thing I'm not wearing it now.
- Just tell me what happened.<eos> Right to it?<eos> Just like Dad.<eos> You know, y-you two are a lot alike.<eos> You set a goal, you achieve it.
I know about the $12 million line of credit at Tricoast.<eos> ...We... We bank with first premium.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> The bank statement is locked in my desk drawer.<eos> Nobody will find it.
Oh, God, I hope not.<eos> Oh, that dog is a hero.<eos> If I had to hear "Over the Rainbo"" one more time...<eos> That is so weird. I thought you guys were all into his ukulele.<eos> You seemed to really love it up in Big Bear.
And the blow itself?<eos> Not one that I would associate with a powerful man.<eos> There was force, yes, but it is glancing, almost fearful.<eos> A fraction of an inch and Marley could still be alive.<eos> I would call it an unlucky blow.
No!<eos> Really?<eos> This is my favourite piece in the shop.<eos> When I'm grown up, I shall own a comb just like this one.<eos> I shall wear it to grand balls and men shall queue up to dance with me.
Let's ensure that the evening is a success! - Mmm...<eos> - The wine, Bumble.<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> Yes. (CLEARING THROAT)<eos> FRANCES: If he manages to find any money, I daresay he'll take it straight to the card table.
He offered you up without a second's hesitation.<eos> Can you not see?<eos> If you do not speak up now, you will hang!<eos> I hope you're not trying to sneak a peek at the dress?<eos> It's not bad luck if you accidently see it, is it?
Who would be sorry before?<eos> And you've done plenty to be sorry about.<eos> Do you want this milk?<eos> Because if you speak to me like that,<eos> I shan't fetch it for you and you'll be thirsty.
I wonder what it is, a little boy or a little girl?<eos> I don't mind, a daughter or a son, as long as it's healthy, but I wonder what it is.<eos> - It's unwanted.<eos> I want it.<eos> James wants it.
Not on my watch. [scoffs]<eos> Look, if things get rough, you'll be there with him.<eos> You are gonna be there, right?<eos> No, I won't.<eos> I'm gonna be at Pearl's wedding Saturday night, and I'm gonna make sure I'm nowhere near the bouquet when she throws it.
We're busy.<eos> How else are we supposed to meet people?<eos> Eyes front, mate.<eos> They got cameras in here.<eos> I'll tell you everything. If we get a name, you'll have it right away.
we got him.<eos> I have been chasing Mr. Pralines and Cream for years. You caught him in a day.<eos> What's your story?<eos> Fresh eyes.<eos> No, I know talent when I see it, and you're the real thing.
And this story, Brian, your story?<eos> The memory implants and the innocent man on death row?<eos> That's better than what I had.<eos> And it happens to be true.<eos> And we can sell it, Brian.
Senator Morra and I would like to offer you a job.<eos> - A job? - Mm.<eos> A quite lucrative one at that, working on the senator's private security team.<eos> I'm gonna write a number on a piece of paper.<eos> When you see it, I'm sure you'll be convinced about how serious we are to have you on our team.
Draw your own conclusions.<eos> But thanks, in part, to my job at Datavision, I knew how to work even the toughest customers.<eos> Have you ever considered the reason you're seeing a decline in sales could be because of your name?<eos> I mean, I get why you chose it.<eos> It's powerful, and I love it.
- Exactly.<eos> And once they've inflated the bubble, the legion shorts those stocks.... and then they pop the bubble, making a massive...<eos> And, most importantly, instant... fortune.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So they make everyone think the treaty's gonna happen... and then they kill it?
Innocent blood.<eos> Innocent.<eos> Execute. "I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes."<eos> Wrathful rebukes. Wrathful rebukes.<eos> As Christians, it is our duty, our burden, to take action against sin, wherever we may find it.
Like, I don't want to be... greedy about it, 'cause I know I've already put on the most perfect dress once today, and I should wait...<eos> - You thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> - I really want to put it on again.<eos> - You should put it on again.<eos> - I know! Okay, I'm going to go try it on.
What the hell happened to my castle?<eos> ! Yeah, we, uh... We sort of tore it down to make homes and shops for everybody.<eos> Oh, well, that would explain the familiarity.<eos> You knocked it down? !<eos> I demand you rebuild it immediately, or I will have every one of you drawn and quartered and...
Look, all the horrible hiking, backbreaking biking and soul-crushing swimming is paying off, because the other night, Jeremy... That's his Christian name... and I were walking past a jewelry store and he asked me what kind of ring I like.<eos> Oh! Three carats, cushion cut, Yetwo simple baguettes.<eos> A boy can dream, can't he?<eos> - Pearl.<eos> - Yes. Now, you know, I fully support your mission to find love, but I'm gonna need you to find it before the 8:00 a.m. staff meeting.
Not at all.<eos> If you tell social services about me, we're talking about adoption.<eos> - You're alright. Take a seat.<eos> - I know what they do.<eos> What they do is they give your baby, they steal it from you and they give it to some fucking child-hungry middle-class couple and then I won't get to see the baby again.
He's right, Nick.<eos> Can't do this alone.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, what if Black Claw knows about the keys and knew they were in the trunk?<eos> Black Claw doesn't know we have the trunk, and the guys they sent to find it are dead.
Give her the damn pen and paper.<eos> Who do you want me to give this to?<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I'll hold on to it.<eos> Give it back to you when this is all over, okay?
Pretty cold, Mr. Ford.<eos> Funny thing is, abandoning the dog is what got you caught.<eos> I got a call from a vet in Hodgeville.<eos> Someone brought him in to check his ID. He had a microchip under his ear.<eos> When you scan it, our info comes up.
Not one of them has succeeded, not a single one.<eos> They all lost and burned and ran.<eos> That's who I am.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a burger. I always bring a snack. But I don't want it now, he's put me off my dinner.
This is mine.<eos> Gonzalez.<eos> Nicotero State Hospital?<eos> That place has been shut down for a while.<eos> Which is probably why she's using it.
What?<eos> Bongs full of holy water?<eos> No. No, nothing that tired.<eos> The ancient Ritual de los Bacabs.<eos> And if we do it right, we might just cast away the soul of Amaru and save Katey-Kakes.
Lured her into a trap and killed her.<eos> Which is why she pulled a Corleone, had all the Lords whacked as soon as she got her.<eos> All right. That's not all, man.<eos> They feasted on her flesh, but they saved her blood because it was so powerful.<eos> Gave it to Lord Oculto for safekeeping.
- What does she want?<eos> - What?<eos> No. Fuck that.<eos> How do we get her back?<eos> How do we get it out of her?
Or help us do it.<eos> Because if the Russians get him before we do, we don't have any cards to play.<eos> And they are out for blood.<eos> President Bozek didn't order the hit.<eos> And he certainly doesn't condone it.
He can help us.<eos> We save him. He can save us.<eos> Mom, we already covered this trail.<eos> It was cold.<eos> Then we cover it again, and we keep going until we find a trail that's hot.
- Rules him out as a suspect.<eos> - In other words, you were wrong.<eos> Mrs Batch is still a suspect.<eos> If we establish where the cyanide came from, maybe we can tie it to her.<eos> Some pharmacies stock it.
- Criminal harassment. Stalking.<eos> Peter develops unhealthy obsessions alarmingly quickly, and there's a new woman from his neighborhood, a blonde.<eos> He follows her and fantasizes about her.<eos> - Do we have a name?<eos> - I'm not even sure he knows it.
No, but, he'll be watching, he'll be right there.<eos> Yeah, but, so we can get him.<eos> And then it's over.<eos> What do we have to do?<eos> Send the bastard a message and hope he gets it.
All right, but if we lez out, nobody catch feelings.<eos> Eh, I'm just talking about a little chick-ity chat.<eos> You know, friends sharing with friends in a completely safe environment.<eos> Well, I've been having this recurring dream...<eos> Yeah, well, you'll have it again.
Hi, this is Amy Dubanowski from Store 1217.<eos> We have an employee here who's about to have a baby, and I was wondering if maybe we could get her some paid maternity leave.<eos> I'm sorry, we don't offer paid maternity leave.<eos> Don't just give up.<eos> Well, some of us were wondering if you could change that policy, because we really want it.
We must send a warning.<eos> To cover our backs.<eos> Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.<eos> Address it to the PM.<eos> He'll never read it, of course.
To cover our backs.<eos> Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.<eos> Address it to the PM.<eos> He'll never read it, of course.<eos> But the important thing is we sent it.
After the incident a cross-party delegation was sent to Donora on an urgent fact-finding mission.<eos> They recommended that clean air zones be set up all round London, as a precautionary measure.<eos> - I never saw the report.<eos> - With good reason.<eos> Our Prime Minister threw it away, claiming it wasn't a priority.
Sophie wasn't overwhelmed, she just wasn't a go-getter.<eos> I'll find other people to help out.<eos> Don't worry, things always work out for me.<eos> Well, new business thrives or dies on reputation.<eos> If you don't deliver an important order to a very vocal town mayor, I think Martha will make sure everyone hears about it.
[Once you've seen inside the machine...] [they don't let you leave.]<eos> I propose that the universe is both infinite and finite infinite energy in a finite system.<eos> This is due to sphincters.<eos> Everything is controlled by sphincters black holes to butt holes.<eos> Now the universe is shaped like an apple and through its core runs a secret passageway, completely through it.
One more night and that's it.<eos> This is a good deed and it won't go unnoticed.<eos> I plan to repay you in full.<eos> Black hole to butthole.<eos> Now, the universe is shaped like an apple and through its core runs a secret passageway, completely through it.
How does this fuck up your life?<eos> You know, you're gonna be over there, I'm over here, what do... what if I... what if I need something?<eos> Like what?<eos> Like... like the remote.<eos> I can't even find it now.
Now, where is it?<eos> It must have been mislabeled.<eos> Well, where is it?<eos> Where the fuck is my dick?<eos> Okay, you know what, Dice, if we can't find it, I'm sure Cynthia will do another molding. - Come on.
Not this stupid thing I got to carry around.<eos> You got Dice.<eos> Hey, it's the director of the "Welcome to Vegas" commercial.<eos> - Yeah, don't you got a name? - Yeah, I have a name.<eos> But you don't know it, so this is faster.
Where are you getting your intel?<eos> - A confidential source.<eos> - I see. So the DEA's supposed to hand over all our surveillance, but you get to play it close to the vest?<eos> Look, we could be allies or enemies.<eos> We're asking for help, not demanding it.
And it never occurred to you that criminals might use it?<eos> Or this country's enemies?<eos> Yeah, it occurred to me.<eos> That's why i modified the code To include a phone-home component.<eos> Whenever the program gets used, It makes contact with my server So i can track who's downloaded it.
Spent 20 years meticulously restoring and expanding the old B.R.T. pneumatic tube system.<eos> So it's true. It really exists.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Fully functional and wonderfully reliable.<eos> Hugo runs it as a private service to specialized clientele.
It wasn't fair, after all you've done for me.<eos> I've done nothing for you, Lizzy.<eos> I'm scared for my little girl.<eos> Push the meds.<eos> It's the children whom the world almost breaks who grow up to save it.
Look around here.<eos> You call this living?<eos> After I lost my daughter... I crawled... crawled into the wilderness like a mortally wounded animal to get as far away from the pack as I could, to... to run out the clock.<eos> Run out the clock and die.<eos> If you came for a survival manual, you won't find it here.
How bad did it go?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about, um...<eos> There was this... kid, back home, after the war, when everything was still torn up.<eos> He and his friends used to come after me when I used to go across town to get milk.<eos> You know, they'd take it from me and beat the crap out of me.
Are you crazy?<eos> You could've gotten yourself killed.<eos> What were you gonna do, powder me to death?<eos> You should be so lucky.<eos> This brush cost $150, which would've been a waste if I had to stab you with it.
We can go anywhere.<eos> Tom, there's some money.<eos> - If we go...<eos> - Verloc's money?<eos> He kept it hidden away, you see.
But I found something else.<eos> She gave the office a burner e-mail address.<eos> That was the only way they were supposed to contact her.<eos> Possibly to keep the pregnancy secret from her husband. Send it to me.<eos> I'll give it to CCS so they can open the account.
Um, anyway, my love, you remember that, um, homeless guy I was telling you about who sucks on cotton balls? We all call him Hobo Marshmallows... I'm not stupid, you know.<eos> I've known for weeks.<eos> You're not pulling any wool over these eyes.<eos> I have no fucking idea what you're talking about.<eos> I'm talking about you pulling your dick out of your pants and sticking it in my sister!
It's about winning, about providing society with superior things, and about proving that you have taste, and good values and you work hard.<eos> And what a wonderful relief, every so often, to know who the enemy is.<eos> Because in the garden, the enemy is everything.<eos> The aphids, the weather, time.<eos> And so you pour yourself into it, care so much, and see up close so much birth, and growth, and beauty, and danger, and triumph.
I can't, either.<eos> I think I just came out to you.<eos> Doesn't count ‭if you can smell it a mile away.<eos> Oh, it's good 'cause you can't taste the alcohol.<eos> Ah, you'll taste it on the way back up.
Jon, I know why you did it.<eos> Your note, "My father was wrong about me." - "I had no choice."<eos> - I didn't mean killing my dad. No.<eos> You meant the lab.<eos> You blew it up to stop Brenda so she wouldn't release Exhale.
Now you're not.<eos> So, what? You're not into me anymore?<eos> I want to be.<eos> But then I think of this stupid tattoo, and, like, it's gonna be here forever.<eos> And what happens in a year, or five years, when I hate it and want to get rid of it, but it's seared into my skin, and the ink won't come out?
A few days ago, ZOMO got an anonymous message.<eos> Threatening to expose his identity if he didn't meet him in Carroll Park at 4:00 a.m.<eos> - How did they figure out who he was? - I don't know.<eos> But he said when he got there, this guy just handed him a sketch.<eos> And said he wanted him to paint it for a show. - The burning rose.
I did everything you asked.<eos> Your boss requisitioned the footage.<eos> I had no idea she...<eos> How'd you even know that?<eos> Destroy the file before she sees it.
If he spots you and hits that kill switch, they are literal toast.<eos> Now, this is a two-person job, the brains and the muscle.<eos> Weller, you're the muscle. So, can you...<eos> Okay, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...<eos> Okay, now, the muscle carefully lifts the painting off its hook and moves it forward about an inch. Now, this will allow the brains to sever the tension wires from its back... thus freeing it from the explosive shotgun charge.
- Yeah. - She used it to steal a witness immunity agreement from the files.<eos> And we're sure that it has something to do with her parents.<eos> Our friend Spy-ris here overheard her talking on the phone with her mom.<eos> Yeah, but an old witness immunity agreement's useless.<eos> Unless she's using it to set them up, get them here before calling the feds on them.
And two... your presence in my chambers is highly unethical.<eos> I could hold you in contempt of court for this.<eos> Well, I would like to... See you try.<eos> Reggie, come in here, please.<eos> Mr. Castle, I'm aware of your friendship with the mayor, so even though you don't deserve it, I'm gonna let you go.
Roger Masters the host?<eos> - Why would she want his empty glass?<eos> - She wouldn't say.<eos> And that really got me fired up because if I got caught stealing, even something as trivial as a champagne glass, I would've lost my job.<eos> But you stole it for her anyway, didn't you?
I can't be the only one getting rid of stuff today.<eos> Wait a minute. What is chickie doing in there?<eos> But every year when the kids were little he was the star of easter!<eos> I mean, besides Jesus.<eos> When you squeeze it, it says,
- I know perfectly well it's been covered.<eos> And you think we missed something?<eos> You could go through this sand with a fine-mesh sieve and not turn up anything new.<eos> Well, I lost a cufflink out there in '07.<eos> If one of your chaps turns it up, do let me know. Mm-hm.
Fakes.<eos> Just for show.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry, I never caught your name.<eos> My boss never uses it.
Look, you can see the bot.<eos> It's right there.<eos> I'll biopsy the tumour, run a cell assay.<eos> - 'K.<eos> - Then we'll open it up.
Well, it's not a tracking device.<eos> At least not primarily.<eos> It's way too over-built for that.<eos> And it must produce some anesthetic, like a leech when it latches on.<eos> That's why she doesn't feel it.
- How?<eos> - Actually, the women kind of invited me.<eos> We've got some advice for you.<eos> Yeah, yeah, don't be a moron.<eos> If you know the advice, why aren't you following it?
Bareback.<eos> Got it.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> Sign it. We'll drop it in the mail on the way to Carmadelle's.
Man, I'm cool.<eos> Are you cool, though, Dwight?<eos> I mean, I just said that it was happy hour at the Pussy Bar and Dwight eats for free, and you're telling me no?<eos> Is that cool? I haven't finished the job.<eos> I-I haven't earned it yet.
I'm just happy.<eos> [Laughs] Hey, how's To-Go going?<eos> Is it taking off?<eos> Oh! What happened to your cast?<eos> I let the boys cut it off. [Chuckles]
I feel bad we never went back out there for dinner.<eos> Oh, they're fine.<eos> We heard them leave.<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah.<eos> I also heard the sound of tinfoil, so I think Jessica wrapped up our country ham and took it with her. [Chuckles]
You said I have to be five pots tall.<eos> You are now, son.<eos> I'm so excited for you.<eos> You're giving me your apron?<eos> Yes, to hand-wash for me, and then you'll give it back to me.
Hi.<eos> Hello!<eos> It's us.<eos> That's right.<eos> Not only are we reporting on the chili, but we're also judging it.
Instead, she found a weak link:<eos> a low-level marshal fell victim to a classic spearfishing campaign.<eos> Leaked the flight number and the U.S. marshal transporting the witness.<eos> What about the witness's name?<eos> I don't see it anywhere here.
So... you're worried about what?<eos> That people aren't gonna think that you became top cop by immaculate conception?<eos> It's not about me. Really?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's about this office, not the man in it.
Previously on "Awkward"...<eos> - My piece is on the front page.<eos> - Babe, that's amazing.<eos> But what if Matty sees it?
What?<eos> Why?<eos> Matty's pissed.<eos> Wow, so this is about Matty.<eos> Matty is selfish if he wants you to take it down.
You said you work on percentages, right?<eos> That's what you said?<eos> For your loyalty, I'm willing to give you a piece of... whatever I bring.<eos> And let me make one thing clear.<eos> Even the smallest percentage number, the one that's running through your head right now, the one you're hoping I will agree to, even if you cut that number in half, and then cut it in half once more,
I have an idea.<eos> Oh, the shed.<eos> This is a great idea.<eos> Nobody ever comes out here.<eos> We'll turn it into our own little love shack.
Hey, I ain't leaving.<eos> Please.<eos> I ain't going nowhere.<eos> There's gotta be a way to fix this thing, right? There's gotta be.<eos> We just don't know what it is yet, so I'm gonna keep you safe until we can figure it out.
Ok, so do we have a deal?<eos> Not if we can't get out of here.<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> Axel changes the code all the time.<eos> Keeps it in a notebook nobody knows about.
Most of us.<eos> We need to know there's a plan.<eos> Right now.<eos> Well, I got a truck parked downstairs, John.<eos> I just need to wait for the valet to bring it around.
We have everything we need here.<eos> You guys know the odds outside, and Denver's hundreds of miles away.<eos> You're seriously gonna stay here?<eos> Yeah, damn right.<eos> There's no way anybody would find this place unless they knew about it.
To change the world.<eos> But in your case, this is truth.<eos> You are.<eos> You will.<eos> But you will not save it.
Just like you wanted us to.<eos> That was the goal.<eos> But why are you so late, if you just had hamburger sandwiches?<eos> Well, we were walking through Chinatown and we found this place where you can play tic-tac-toe against a real live chicken.<eos> They call it...
You always see the beauty and potential in everything.<eos> Just close your eyes.<eos> Just see the potential.<eos> Okay.<eos> [Siren wailing] Oh... No. I still can't see it.
What about your knife?<eos> Guess I lost it in the raid.<eos> Well, that's a shame.<eos> Well, I'll have some of my guys double back.<eos> Maybe we'll find it.
You can keep that one. Can I get all the other files back, please?<eos> Are we all here?<eos> All right.<eos> We believe that Aleksandre and Ruth Iosava are running an underground route from Germany into Syria for young girls to marry ISIL fighters.<eos> He's funding it through his refugee foundation, and she's recruiting the girls.
Next thing you know, he's getting invited to the warden's parties, hunting trips, and on the parole board.<eos> So when Hamm decides he doesn't want anything more to do with him, that's when Carroll shows him the pictures of the parties.<eos> He's been blackmailing him ever since.<eos> Deed records for the land.<eos> It's not too far from Quitman and Ray bought it the same year that you guys were there.
This voyage was never about the grain in the hold, was it?<eos> You're going after that cursed sapphire...<eos> "The Eye of the Storm"!<eos> So you've heard of it.<eos> Well, every sailor's heard of it.
Ah! Stop it!<eos> What is your genius plan for getting the book back?<eos> Throw one of our epic parties tonight.<eos> And the kids who stole your car will show up.<eos> We might not be able to find the book, but we can go after the ones who are searching for it.
What the hell?<eos> Okay, so... the seawater is what's cooling the engines.<eos> No water, the engines overheat.<eos> I'm guessing something's blocking the water intake.<eos> Pull whatever's blocking it and let's get the hell out of here.
- Thanks.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I want my backpack.<eos> - Well, what did you do with it?<eos> - I don't know, but I need it.
I can't condone what Cindy did, but, uh...<eos> But she saved your son's life.<eos> Because of her, I get a second chance with Owen.<eos> I was outside the station and I, uh,<eos> I see a guy hanging around the building, like he was casing it, you know?
But you don't survive a bite.<eos> Oh, you don't believe I was bitten?<eos> I don't believe in miracles.<eos> - Miracle is your word.<eos> - What would you call it?
Not until I know where that book is.<eos> Now spill.<eos> Unlock me first.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> He always keeps it with him, so the book is here now.
- Where are you going?<eos> - Away.<eos> - [sighs] - Hey, listen, man.<eos> I don't wanna get in the middle of this, it's none of my business, but I just have to say I love that sweater.<eos> - Can you give it to me?
- Was he dead when you found him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, man, he was.<eos> I'm sorry, Travis.<eos> His neck was sort of jacked, you know? Like he broke it going through the glass.
-[ringtone playing] -Todd, it's ringing.<eos> This is it.<eos> Oh, no, my phone!<eos> Oh, no, I kicked it, right through that doorway into the hallway!<eos> Now, other people are kicking it and it's sliding across the floor!
Well, it sounds mighty Christian of you, Gilfoyle.<eos> There's no reason for hate speech, Richard.<eos> I can see by the sour, pinched expressions on all your faces that Richard has filled you in regarding the unfortunate circumstances that have forced me to relinquish my stake in your fair company.<eos> Erlich, uh, you should know that I have written a press release. - Oh?<eos> - I'm not going to release it yet, but if I hear wind of these rumors spreading out of control, I'm going to send it to every tech publication and blog on the face of the earth.
The reason I'm calling has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with the fact that I own half of your blog and everything to do with the fact that I was just named Chief Evangelism Officer of Pied Piper.<eos> Feel free to abbreviate that, whatever acronym is most economical. And I have a story.<eos> Well, if it's anything like this last one, I am all for it.<eos> I am getting so many paid views on your tell-all.<eos> Everyone in the Valley is reading it.
The website is a massive database that cross-references everything ever said on the Internet.<eos> It relies on people typing in a name and address of someone else to add to that database.<eos> If we can all agree to resist the urge to look up other people's Internet histories, Maggie, okay?<eos> As long as we all respect each other's privacy, darling, then our town won't suffer the same fate as Fort Collins.<eos> And what are the police gonna do to make sure people don't use it?
None of that matters, Rita. You know that.<eos> [sighs]<eos> So a late disclosure, so no rape kit.<eos> No, but the maid saw Abby's dress was stained.<eos> Showed it to Laura, her mom.
Well, we'll need to take a statement from the three of you.<eos> Also we'll need access to Abby's friends and social media.<eos> We understand that there was a dress.<eos> There is.<eos> Okay, we'll send it to the lab.
What about Bernard?<eos> Bernard, yes.<eos> But who am I?<eos> That is a very complex question, for which I can only offer a simple answer.<eos> You are the perfect instrument, the ideal partner, the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it.
Takagi killed Maru.<eos> Joseph Takagi, you're under arrest for the murder and immaculate plating of Kobayashi Maru.<eos> Appetizers on the house?<eos> You were the one serving whale the whole time.<eos> And when Maru found out about it, he was furious, wasn't he?
- Heart attack.<eos> - Heart attack?<eos> He looks 26, and he's in the best shape of his life.<eos> He has an incredible body.<eos> The odds of an adult male under 30 suffering a heart attack is about 1 in every 780,000, unless there's something already in the system to cause it.
- Tomato. - Ugh. You're that guy?<eos> Ted, it's fine. Hand me the drone controls.<eos> As we speak, I'm piloting a drone to our fruit-distribution warehouse in New Hampshire.<eos> Is there anything about the nature of the hack that would point to who might have done it?<eos> Now, I've selected your tomato from a huge pile of tomatoes, and I'm piloting it back to this room.
That should be the location of the server.<eos> We've been hacked.<eos> My mom had blowy hair.<eos> We don't know much, Mr. Mayor.<eos> The hacker is threatening to release the names of every user on the site unless we shut it down permanently.
Where's my scalpel?<eos> Where's Dr. Stein?<eos> My God.<eos> Angie, you're gonna be okay, you hear me?<eos> I'm gonna find your kidney, and I'm gonna put it back inside you, and everything's gonna be okay because I love you.
No, no. We still have to investigate it, no matter how personally despicable we find them.<eos> So, let me guess... We go through the motions of capturing the killer, and once we have him, we let him off on a technicality?<eos> "Even though you know your partner's changing, she might not know she's changing."<eos> Get down to the graphic designer's loft, figure out who killed him.<eos> Also, find out what the parking's like down there and what they're gonna list it for.
That'll be all, Stan.<eos> Let's just say she did do it.<eos> It was a graphic designer. Victimless crime.<eos> She didn't do it.<eos> Do you think if Tribeca has a rifle, she's gonna hit someone in the head with it and then throw it in the Dumpster right next to the building?
The publisher says it will take at least six weeks to get it into bookstores...<eos> Who says we need bookstores?<eos> Several pages of the former First Lady's upcoming memoir appear today on the D.C. Dish's website.<eos> Both the publisher and Senator Grant herself denied being the source of the leak.<eos> The book, however, is being described by those who have read it as explosive, revealing, and deeply personal.
He'll shoot.<eos> Says what, your spidey sense?<eos> SWAT has sharpshooters in place.<eos> They're gonna shoot that incompetent whack job you recruited.<eos> They're gonna take our hero moment away from our hero and give it to some jackass sharpshooter.
A coiled wire spring covered by a snake-patterned vinyl sheath?<eos> Lisa, our weekend in Capital City will make us friends again.<eos> I don't see your saxophone.<eos> That must be a relief to you.<eos> Honey, I want you to bring it.
Happy, what are the approximate dimensions of the aerostat?<eos> Uh, length 100, diameter 20.<eos> I still don't understand how this works.<eos> Okay, the aerostat's 200 yards away.<eos> We put the Sun Gun panels in it, send it off, and Rahal is now decades behind schedule if he wants to make new ones.
We put the Sun Gun panels in it, send it off, and Rahal is now decades behind schedule if he wants to make new ones.<eos> Remember, he didn't build these, he found them.<eos> The Sun Gun could land anywhere.<eos> Which is why I am running the numbers to predict the exact time and location so the aerostat crashes in the Mediterranean.<eos> Where the Navy SEALs will pick it up in a watertight bag.
This is gonna be the best prom-posal ever.<eos> Lacey and Sebastian are for sure gonna say yes.<eos> Because of a fish balloon?<eos> No, because of a self-mobilizing fish drone.<eos> It's gonna hover over Sebastian and Lacey, then I'm gonna pop it and it's gonna rain down Swedish fish, you know, 'cause Sebastian is Swedish.
All right? I'm gonna come get you.<eos> Don't -<eos> - Don't leave and -- and text me the address.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll send it to you now.
Sweet.<eos> Hey, where is Jesus?<eos> Is he sick today or something?<eos> So, for the Student Council's Community Outreach Project this year, here's what I was thinking.<eos> I thought if we take this space in City Heights and turn it into a park or a community garden,
Go and make mom unground me.<eos> Oh, I can't do that. You broke the rules.<eos> Because of you!<eos> And you have my respect.<eos> I don't want it!
And now I'm all by myself.<eos> And you can't abandon a baby...<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> It goes without saying, right?<eos> You think I'm going to abandon it?
Could you wire some money?<eos> [Are you kidding or what? ]<eos> [I'm waiting on your script!<eos> OK.<eos> We'll talk when you get it.
Put them in the right order.<eos> Write something wrong, you should shred the paper.<eos> -Have cell phone ?<eos> -Now.<eos> Take it to work.
Move, move, move.<eos> - That's everyone.<eos> - Except for Angie.<eos> A set of keys.<eos> She still had it.
I used to make deliveries to her family along the canals.<eos> Once a week, same time.<eos> She would come to the balcony...<eos> smile down at me.<eos> She'd lower her basket, and I'd fill it.
Once a week, same time.<eos> She would come to the balcony...<eos> smile down at me.<eos> She'd lower her basket, and I'd fill it.<eos> She'd pull it up.
It'd be a hell of a partnership.<eos> My grandfather, Jonas Quincannon.<eos> One time, the Gormann Brothers had a pork concern out at Las Cruces.<eos> Hoping to move in on his territory, they were pressuring wholesalers, something like that.<eos> Uh, anyway, Jonas found out about it.
I am the Alpha and the omega.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I am the bright morning star.<eos> I just saw you picking your nose.<eos> No, my son, i was scratching it.
That's where my retirement fund is.<eos> If this hacker isn't stopped soon, we're looking at a worldwide economic collapse.<eos> Relevant people!<eos> In my office.<eos> National City's entire mainframe has been breached by a cyber-terrorist attack and nobody knows why they're doing it, or who, or when they will strike again.
That and the Pope's support are all I have left to fend off Elizabeth and to fight the rebels who are trying to snatch my crown!<eos> The rebels that I am fighting have not only stolen my crown, they're starting to pick off my children.<eos> Charles has been seduced by Narcisse and Claude has been married off.<eos> Is it not possible that Narcisse is just trying to do his job?<eos> Do you honestly think that, having held power, that Narcisse and his friends will surrender it willingly when my son comes of age?
So Curtis Miller's in the wind, and we still don't know who this third Pretorius agent is.<eos> - His children are in imminent danger.<eos> - Monty, you've held off notifying Armand Smit and his wife about Brandon's rescue, right? - As you requested.<eos> - So now we have no choice.<eos> The only way to get the name of that third Pretorius agent is for Monty to get it from Smit himself.
What's that?<eos> The contract.<eos> For what? The mask.<eos> I have to sign a contract for a mask?<eos> And you have to sign it in blood.
You might extend the same apology to my husband the next time you see him.<eos> -Oh, is he struggling?<eos> Well, it'd be odd if he weren't.<eos> Anyway, if I am to succeed, then he and I are going to need all the help we can get.<eos> Well, I'm sure you're surrounded by good people offering it.
Talk.<eos> Jaha's backpack.<eos> What about it?<eos> All right, it runs the A.I.<eos> And if we destroy it, I'm pretty sure we can destroy her.
Honey?<eos> No.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> I-I can, uh -- I can keep it if you want.<eos> I-I can't return it anyway.
Look, I've seen my share of this kind of thing.<eos> You're referring to your experience with soldiers wounded in war?<eos> Look, the emotional recovery can be as tough as the physical one, but there's nothing more important than hope.<eos> A city worker found a body off the expressway.<eos> They're bringing it to the lab now.
All right. Come on, Marvin.<eos> Come on, Marvin. Can't we stop here for a second?<eos> Pumpkin<eos> My little pumpkin,<eos> I like to think about other girls sometimes, but the truth is if you ever left me, I'd tear my heart out and never put it back.
Maybe that includes saving Hannah.<eos> We need to ride the day out here, see if the machine brings us back.<eos> We tried it your way.<eos> What do you think Jennifer really meant?<eos> She said... time knows Jones invented time travel, and it needs her to do it.
Against what?<eos> The future.<eos> This project is massive.<eos> It is.<eos> That's why we're calling it "Titan."
The report mentions a place called Titan and a man called The Witness.<eos> - This is it.<eos> - We go back to 1961, we find Kirschner before the Mossad does, we find Titan, we find The Witness, we cut the head off of the snake.<eos> That's not gonna stop the storms out there.<eos> We save the world by killing the one who destroys it.
Same old.<eos> Hand me that suture, please.<eos> He's, uh, never come by here to see me.<eos> Well, lucky you.<eos> All right, I want you to hold this in while I tie it.
- What, you see Bruno?<eos> - No, I see bars on my phone.<eos> We have to stay right here. It's almost time for my FaceTime.<eos> Give me that stupid thing.<eos> I'll put it down my pants.
Okay.<eos> Surveillance footage successfully looped and holding steady.<eos> There she is.<eos> Happy, according to the schematics, the access panel is off the third level.<eos> Okay. Opening it up.
Um, found unconscious, intermittent blindness.<eos> Facial droop.<eos> That's... it's a classic sign of a stroke, right?<eos> Yeah, it could be a stroke.<eos> If it's a clot, the TPA will bust it right up.
Well, maybe I didn't make myself clear.<eos> This place is a shitbox.<eos> How dare you?<eos> This is a special building.<eos> I mean, several famous African American authors rented space here back in the day when nobody else would rent it to 'em.
I don't know what that means, honey.<eos> Uh, let me see if I can find Nutter butter, get a pic with him, too, for next year's Christmas card.<eos> Ma, we're not taking a picture with the cat.<eos> We gotta get going.<eos> But thank you again for the sweater. I love it.
Hard to talk about.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Phil.<eos> Why can't we remember this last piece?<eos> We just had it this morning.
"Peinture."<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sam's little accent is amazing, isn't it?<eos> I wish he could hold onto it, but he'll probably lose it once we get him into school.
♪ ♪<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> When we were boys, we had to learn that sacred chant by heart and understand its meaning.<eos> By the end of this weekend,<eos> I expect all you boys to know it, too.
I told you. We're taking you to the hospital.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're not the patient.<eos> The bullet's lodged at the base of the neck.<eos> We need you to get it out.
Is Christy stable enough for the transplant?<eos> - You mean right now?<eos> - Right now.<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> Then do it.
Systolic less than 70 with a bleed that is subdiaphragmatic.<eos> All the indications are there for REBOA.<eos> I've never done this procedure before.<eos> - None of us have. - It's dangerous.<eos> We float the balloon up the aorta, inflating it above the level of the bleed.
Oh, my god. You look terrible.<eos> Sir Galavant, it's me, the Chef.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Why have you got Isabella's amulet?<eos> She never takes it off.
This is not an information warfare. You should talk face-to-face.<eos> You're not the one to talk.<eos> It's always a hand-to-hand combat for me.<eos> What is this for?<eos> Who are you going to throw it at?
Oh, how could we, when she made us this fresh hand-churned ice cream?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, you know what we should do?<eos> We should send her a picture of us eating it.
You saw your stepfather instead.<eos> May I assume your visit had something to do with his book?<eos> You know about the book?<eos> An hour ago, I signed for a box which contained nearly 200 copies... but I've been aware of it for months.<eos> An associate brought it to my attention.
It'll probably go away.<eos> Although, clearly, your ex husband is not about to.<eos> I tried to tell you that.<eos> Listen, if this case survives tomorrow, and it shouldn't, but if it does, my marching orders are not gonna be to merely argue the case.<eos> They are going to be to destroy the man bringing it.
Yes, please.<eos> Hey, will you promise me something?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - No more secrets.<eos> Okay? You have a problem, you come to me and we figure it out together.
They probably sent it out as a sky wave.<eos> It works like a HAM radio signal.<eos> She's right.<eos> Anyone with rabbit ears could be picking up the signal.<eos> So we'll put out a statement before the other stations start rebroadcasting it.
Why don't we do this right here, Whiskers?<eos> Snap you like a string bean!<eos> Enough, enough!<eos> God.<eos> You guys don't stop it, I will lock that baby up, and none of you will ever see it.
Why are you being like this?<eos> You're about to be a grandma.<eos> Isn't it something even you can enjoy?<eos> For how long?<eos> Once you get the baby in that house, I'll never get to see it again.
I-I put it on Samuel and apparently he never sits down.<eos> The son of a bitch logged seven miles.<eos> That is not a believable number for you, my friend.<eos> Don't you think I know that?<eos> No, that's why I got to roll back the mileage before Molly sees it.
I'm sorry, Craig, I didn't even ask.<eos> What, uh... what is it that you do?<eos> - I'm a musician.<eos> - Ah. Right now, I'm in a jazz quintet, The Quintangibles.<eos> I made up the name, but I hate it.
Tres Pasitos.<eos> - Three Little Steps.<eos> - It's a Mexican rodent killer.<eos> 'Cause a mouse can only take three steps before it drops dead.<eos> You can't get it in the States anymore.
I think it would mean a lot to Jesus, just like it meant a lot for me to get to know Ana, to have that chance, at least.<eos> But he can't as long as Gabe is on that registry, because, legally, Gabe can't even be around minors.<eos> Or live within 500 feet of a school.<eos> And you know how hard it is to get a job when you're on that list?<eos> He doesn't deserve it, Mama.
Well, this is what I think of your petition.<eos> No one's saying suicide is sexy.<eos> Teen suicide is a real problem, Brandon.<eos> A big one!<eos> God, and you're glamorizing it by staging your play!
The publisher sent the PDF.<eos> "The little fool had no idea I put hemlock in her salad.<eos> "There she sat, her molars mashing the leaves into the shape of her destiny."<eos> "The shape of her destiny"?<eos> She wants me to send it to my editor, but I can't do that to Lerna.
Your nurse Todd confirmed you had a window box planter.<eos> The week before Grace's death, you ordered him to take it down, trash it.<eos> He didn't.<eos> He gave it to another one of his patients.<eos> Now we have it.
Hey, Liv.<eos> What's up?<eos> Clive didn't tell you?<eos> About my lottery ticket?<eos> First I've heard of it.
It's just I care about Gareth, and I promised I wouldn't use it.<eos> And he seemed super upset about the vacation.<eos> Maybe I'll... I'll go down and help him fight.<eos> Look. May I be blunt?<eos> You want power. I offer it.
Got it.<eos> Great story.<eos> No.<eos> That's not how he got his name.<eos> He got it from the way he took the corner.
Start at the beginning.<eos> I work at a pet groomer's.<eos> This dog was there a couple weeks ago. But the guy who brought him in came to get him before I was done.<eos> He was all sweaty, freaking out.<eos> He said he stole the dog from a cop who abused it, and the cop was coming back to get him. - What cop?
All right.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm weird, too.<eos> Did you know cicadas spend 17 years underground, and then emerge and immediately shed their shell?<eos> They spend all that time building it, and then just leave it behind.
Or maybe you threw<eos> Overson's laptop into the marina.<eos> And maybe the coast guard fished it out a couple hours ago.<eos> And maybe Overson waterproofed his hard drive.<eos> Because he did use it in a boat after all.
The victims all died because Leo didn't dispatch the paramedics in time.<eos> So he orchestrated their deaths.<eos> Just spoke to the NYPD.<eos> They issued a BOLO for Leo. And I sent them the antidote.<eos> They'll push it to all cell phones in the area using AMBER Alerts.
What if Aguirre is telling the truth?<eos> Well... what if he wasn't?<eos> Even still, it doesn't sit right with me.<eos> What do you know about how your father bought the inn?<eos> Well, he was getting out of the Navy, and he found a piece of property that he liked, so he bought it.
I'll try but you won't believe me.<eos> There can be no good without evil.<eos> But evil must first be confronted before it can be driven out.<eos> What I do is take the evil from those who come seeking salvation.<eos> Where do you take it?
Always knew you had one.<eos> Dear God!<eos> He's stolen the Queen's jewel.<eos> I doubt she'll care.<eos> What on earth would she wear it with?
Oh, you got a little bit weird, you face went all "Judge Judy".<eos> - Did it?<eos> - Yeah, a little bit.<eos> No, well... sex has never really been my...<eos> Well, maybe you've been doin' it with the wrong people.
I'll send you to the hospital for a mammogram.<eos> Has anybody told you what really happened in the fire?<eos> I couldn't save Warner, but I did save your son.<eos> Sex has never really been my...<eos> Well, maybe you've been doin' it with the wrong people.
Are you on with him?<eos> Jackson?<eos> There's definitely something there.<eos> It's... it...<eos> When my daughter died... he did something for me... he... He did me a favour and I'll never forget it.
- Come in!<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hi, Liz.<eos> Sonia told me they found Helen's body.<eos> It should have been the breakthrough we needed. But according to Forensics, there's no corroborating evidence linking it back to Sonia.
Son lost his mother.<eos> I am an officer, He turned into a killer.<eos> And you, Beklemishev not realized I'm human. You make me spinning like a spring.<eos> Remember, live, until he returns your honor.<eos> - And how would you return it?
Let's talk wine charms.<eos> Wait. Can we just go back to the calendar?<eos> Because if I was gonna do that...<eos> We're not married to it.<eos> You don't like it, forget about it, because you're gonna love this.
Yes, ah... one of your detectives called about a list of all the people who had access to our house.<eos> This is everyone I could think of.<eos> This is very helpful.<eos> There was also a water delivery guy we had up until about six months ago or so.<eos> I couldn't get the number, but I'll find it.
So we'll have to make sure that the gun is properly calibrated.<eos> We'll need a drone to shoot down as a test.<eos> Oh, no, Birdroni?<eos> Yeah, better dust off your toy, buddy.<eos> 'Cause we're gonna blast it out of the sky.
I mean, think about it.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> Miss Clemens... You may not agree with this project.<eos> In fact, I don't agree with it.<eos> I don't actually understand it.
You're right.<eos> I don't know how this works.<eos> I don't even know what any of this is.<eos> A sconce?<eos> Look, if this is the type of help that you're here to give me, I don't want it.
Your being confirmed is very important to me.<eos> Isn't that reason enough to do it?<eos> I love going to church as a family, but I also have a questioning mind, and it's hard for me to believe in things I don't see.<eos> That's why I love my job.<eos> I know what I'm doing, I know why I'm doing it, and I know who I'm working for.
It's fun.<eos> Not really.<eos> Drawing is something you do in kindergarten to get out of your system.<eos> You need to stop.<eos> - Lots of people do it for a living though. - Not really.
You wrote a comic book.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> It's a big success.<eos> People all over the world are reading it.
If I'd known, I would have visited it more often.<eos> Seconds?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> You were really hungry.<eos> I haven't tasted it in a long time.
You can use it in your next novel.<eos> Write it down, or you'll forget it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Where's the notepad?<eos> I remember it.
She could just eat him up.<eos> And I call her "Meemaw,"<eos> because, well, just, well, look at her.<eos> It's interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don't.<eos> Oh, well, you know, now-now that I'm hearing it, it does sound familiar. How could it?
- That's so crazy!<eos> It's so crazy. I've never met anybody else who likes beer.<eos> Don't tell me you also like food. I'm obsessed with it.<eos> [Laughs]<eos> Literally eat it three times a day... could not survive without it.
Me too.<eos> Uh, Gevork, what are you doing?<eos> I said, "take Cahuenga!"<eos> You still haven't answered the question...<eos> "even if you could build that wall, who's gonna pay for it?"
So, Henry comes over, and I'm like, "who wants ice cream?"<eos> And, you know, Dave was in, but poor Henry had just come from a creamery tour.<eos> And, of course, Molly couldn't leave him here alone.<eos> So I rang up Mrs. pancake to watch him while we were gone.<eos> Then Molly and I got ice cream, ate it, and here we are. The end.
What if you were followed?<eos> Trust me, stay cool.<eos> If you don't, you and Ghost gonna need his and her jumpsuits.<eos> How you shoot so good with that glove on?<eos> Why you have it on, anyway?
synced and corrected by peritta Previously on You, Me, Her...<eos> How often are you having sex?<eos> If I stuck my tongue in Emma's mouth, she's probably just crack up laughing.<eos> You do it with someone you don't know.
Something's happening.<eos> What's she saying?<eos> She's dying.<eos> I don't know what else to do.<eos> The baby needs physical contact, but Finnerman won't allow it.
Whatever you say, sir.<eos> Flynn, would you like to lead grace?<eos> It's been a while.<eos> Just keep it honest, you'll do fine.<eos> Dear Father, thank you for this food and the hands that prepared it.
I didn't move you.<eos> Wh-- are you saying someone else did?<eos> After you turned in last night, Marcus informed me that the missing rug had been found.<eos> The one from the video?<eos> The police traced it from the gang's Dumpster to a landfill.
- Amelia, please, come with me.<eos> - No!<eos> I don't wish to change!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> I must wear it until my heart has healed itself.
- No!<eos> I don't wish to change!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> I must wear it until my heart has healed itself.<eos> Until then, I will wear it to remind me of my foolishness.
Based on everything I was learning,<eos> Ramos was someone to be admired.<eos> There was more to this than just a wrongful death.<eos> I-I had a hunch, sir.<eos> I knew it from day one and I should have followed my instincts.
Please!<eos> Milly, this is a really bad idea.<eos> How can you prove that this woman even existed?<eos> Grandpa must've hidden her body somewhere.<eos> The police will find it.
Please stay away.<eos> Please stay back.<eos> I just want to offer my prayers for the deceased.<eos> The branch was blocking the road at head height.<eos> He hit it at speed.
What did you bring him?<eos> Clothes, books. His watch.<eos> Can I see?<eos> Where did you find his watch?<eos> Mother had it in her bedroom.
This can't happen. Not now you know the truth.<eos> Mother, I don't care.<eos> Why did you take his pocket watch?<eos> It was a present for Alexander's 18th birthday.<eos> He cherished it, he always carried it on him.
- And we all have jungle fever.<eos> [Chelsea] Mone, where are the glasses?<eos> Over here? Oh, got it.<eos> [Simone] Well, Mom and Dad's marriage is worth talking about.<eos> I would just describe it as a wonderful random intersection.
Drop it, Wallace!<eos> I didn't hurt him!<eos> I've known him for 20 years. He wouldn't do it.<eos> Then why is he swinging a poker at my officers?<eos> Please, Mr Wallace. Put it down.
10 days.<eos> This is a difficult question.<eos> It's hard to know.<eos> You have to let pain be your guide.<eos> If you can handle it, go.
Well, Amy, Julio, and I can do a Lexis-Nexis search on Calderon's clients and see if there's an overlap<eos> - with our case. - ‭Good.<eos> We may have movement with one of our 10 Little Nazis.<eos> Chief Howard, what's the occasion? Oh.<eos> The, uh, L.A. Housing Authority and Martin Borja are announcing their development plans at noon, and Borja's put aside a little park between the shopping center and the apartment complex he's creating where the Zyklon buildings were, and he's naming it after Chief Taylor.
Talk about the weather.<eos> Does your giant mole hurt before it rains?<eos> Well, there's something you don't see every day. Oh!<eos> I'm rubbing a pomegranate on my mole.<eos> You're feeding it now?
It doesn't exist, never has.<eos> It's here.<eos> It's here and I know it.<eos> I feel it in my gut, just like I felt it when I knew that you murdered your wife.<eos> And I'm gonna find that money, and when I find it,
How ya goin'?<eos> Engine trouble?<eos> Um, seemingly, we have a fuel blockage.<eos> I got it sorted.<eos> I'm gonna take it back to my place, fix it, yeah?
I don't know how good it is, but I, uh, I could use a professional opinion.<eos> - Mine?<eos> - Well, yeah.<eos> You're like a star editor at a great imprint.<eos> You know a good book when you see it. Oh, and... and a bad one, of course.
Cool.<eos> It's, um, like "Bonfire of the Vanities" meets "The Walking Dead."<eos> Are there zombies? Yes.<eos> And they occupy Wall Street.<eos> I shouldn't say anything else, but Scott Rudin loves it, and Paramount's already talking a three-picture deal.
Do you want to see my drawer?<eos> - Yes. - No, it's okay.<eos> I trust you.<eos> You know, I'm a little old for "the talk."<eos> We had it in seventh grade.
Millenial finally has momentum, and I'm not going to waste it.<eos> All right, it's not about the partying, it's about visibility, and Millennial needs to be visible.<eos> Like Colin?<eos> That book is going to be huge.<eos> And I hate that we don't have it.
- You'll see, they've just come online.<eos> - [Chelsea] They're all on.<eos> Everything's online.<eos> [Chelsea] It looks like I'm flatlining.<eos> The electrical hum from the brain is actually really small because it has to travel through the scalp... - Yeah. - ...through a layer of hair and then that's where we're measuring it.
Tell me about it.<eos> Everybody bugs her all the time, how do you think I feel?<eos> She looks like she just climaxed.<eos> What do you think about sex?<eos> I don't think about sex unless a human asks about it.
Like, "At one red light, I got ten things done. That's amazing."<eos> But then I think, because we're all able to do so much, all the time now, because of our phones, we're expected to do that much.<eos> - Right. - Meaning, as technology increases, this new level of productivity is expected and you must meet it.<eos> My phone is always off. It's always off.<eos> Like, unless I'm waiting for somebody to call me, I turn it on, but I miss calls all the time, because I just...

Was that a bad thing, or is that a good thing?<eos> Sometimes I think the bad things are portrayed more than the good things.<eos> What were some of the good things you feel like - aren't portrayed?<eos> - People were taken care of.<eos> Would you take a tractor that you just bought brand new and tear it up, misuse it?

Yeah, you see that tiny piece of metal in there?<eos> Let me just see if I can extract it.<eos> Looks like a microchip.<eos> Yeah, many of the new credit cards have them embedded now.<eos> I can just scan it.
Daddy's home!<eos> Look, daddy, I made you a friendship bracelet.<eos> It means we're B.F.F.s -- best friends forever.<eos> But you can't ever take it off, or else I'll know.<eos> 'Kay, promise you'll never take it off?
Dean, wait.<eos> Tim, what do you want?<eos> I just want to learn.<eos> Don't overthink it.<eos> The shows a hit, people love it, critics love it.
Though technically english, The language has evolved to include A certain unique vocabulary and grammatical structure.<eos> I can translate.<eos> You threatened to kill eddie.<eos> Oh, he says that he only sent eddie the text message Because he was furious.<eos> He drives a gypsy cab, And eddie asked to borrow it two nights ago.
I never should've been sleeping in my squad car.<eos> That's another way to look at it.<eos> When I first came out of the academy, they paired me with this old timer, Perzecki.<eos> Kept a pillow in his car.<eos> Put it under his arm when he drove and under his head when he took a nap.
If I'm saying words, don't do it.<eos> And, Molly, before we go in there, there's something I want you to have, and I don't want an argument.<eos> I told you I didn't want to do this when... Oh, ooh!<eos> Grandma's ring!<eos> You two always had a special bond, Ah... and I know she'd want you to have it.
I told you I didn't want to do this when... Oh, ooh!<eos> Grandma's ring!<eos> You two always had a special bond, Ah... and I know she'd want you to have it.<eos> Oh, I don't know what to say.<eos> Just say you'll keep it.
Like the weather.<eos> I've changed.<eos> Between my practice and Nick, I'm already short on time.<eos> I told them I'm not interested, but they're not giving up.<eos> They know a good thing when they see it.
It was the only way I'd say yes.<eos> I get to keep my practice here, and spend time with Nick.<eos> I've... grown pretty fond of my life here, in Middleton.<eos> And I have to say, diagnosing your guest probably did something to... push the board to give me the job...<eos> - the way I wanted it. - You are going to help a lot of people.
Do not imagine that our great republic is a democracy.<eos> The Signoria is run on loyalties and patronage.<eos> Those can be bought. Our coffers are filling again.<eos> Albizzi calls our money "dirty gold".<eos> Anyone foolish enough to take it could be next in the dock.
Albizzi is marrying off his son to Isabella Contarini in secret.<eos> Contessina has done well to get us this information.<eos> The Contarini's bank with us in Mantua.<eos> They've grown wealthy on the profits from their leather business.<eos> That wealth will soon be Albizzi's and he will spend it on more mercenaries.
Commander.<eos> Morning. Sergeant Voight around?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll buzz you in.<eos> You lose this fight to a fireman... I don't care if you are doing it for charity... You find your own way home.
I'd like to make the right decision.<eos> I remember when I thought, uh, getting a sample of meningococcus was a big deal.<eos> Nobody needs this.<eos> The Americans have it.<eos> Or they're just testing it to make antidotes in case we use it like they say at my lab.
Murray, there's something wrong with the wheels on this vacuum cleaner.<eos> Can you come down and take a look at it?<eos> I just bought you a new used one nine years ago!<eos> I'm telling you, it's sticking.<eos> See, if you just move it back and forth, you know?
I'm doing this for Amy.<eos> - Doing what for me?<eos> - Yeah, Karma, what's going on?<eos> Amy, please...<eos> I don't know what you're up to, but I'm on a date with Felix, and I don't want anyone ruining it.
Daddy had a deal with the mill.<eos> Yeah, but he wasn't able to grind last year, so they dropped his contract.<eos> You're just now telling me this?<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I'm sure they'll renew it.
Wait, wait.<eos> I'm the child?<eos> I really wanted to be the warrior.<eos> You're kinda acting like a child.<eos> Your bo-rifle, as the ancients used it.
When I was looking for Deiser out there, the creatures wouldn't come anywhere close.<eos> They don't like the markers.<eos> And the base is surrounded by them!<eos> If we can get it, we can use it to hold them off while we clear the ship.<eos> Only problem is, how do we get to it?
- They gave me an assault alarm.<eos> - Good to have when you're shot at.<eos> They offered me a bulletproof vest too.<eos> As if I don't sweat enough already.<eos> - Why didn't you put it on?
Nothing.<eos> This isn't your problem.<eos> I don't want you to get dragged into this,<eos> - and I'm ruining your birthday.<eos> Hey, you're not ruining it.
Excuse me?<eos> (SCOFFS) When Melissa finds out...<eos> Get her.<eos> Tell her whatever you want, but right now get out of my fucking cubicle.<eos> Fine, we'll take it off, but we're talking about the bailout and Plouffe's suicide.
I know that you like her.<eos> It seems to me that you're letting your feelings get in the way of our project.<eos> There, Sweetie.<eos> Here's your passport.<eos> Can you put it in your pocket?
- Go a little faster, boys.<eos> - Damn, is that heavy.<eos> Simon, if you're going to play here, then you have to work for it.<eos> Mom gets the food delivered.<eos> She orders it on the internet.
All right, all right, break it down for me.<eos> Well, to really get it, I got to take you back to 1924.<eos> Husband-and-wife team, the Bedfords, opened up a freak show/ dwarf sanctuary on this land you're about to be at.<eos> Dwarf sanctuary?<eos> Yeah, they called it the Bedford Lilliputian... a whole miniature city scaled down for dwarf and midget inhabitants.
Nevertheless, that don't change what's been done to you.<eos> The person who did this will get proportionate retribution.<eos> On that tip, I still need you to fix this thing for me.<eos> Our site's been down way too long.<eos> Good news is, once you bring it back up, you will get your money, and, in time, God willing, your health.
Treasures in Art.<eos> Did you figure it out? - Yeah.<eos> - Think so.<eos> Python must have noticed this book in your office.<eos> He's using it to play mind games.
I mean, what if I do this and I can't sleep at night?<eos> Abby...<eos> You're a good person.<eos> You're just standing too close to the Oval.<eos> You can feel the power, and you want it.
If I die while he's balling himself limp, I will haunt the shit out of his ass.<eos> You're fucking kidding me.<eos> That's why they call it The Castle That Isn't, 'cause it's invisible.<eos> The truth is, the castle was constructed to be invisible primarily for budgetary reasons.<eos> The royals had spent their entire seasonal allowance and then realized they still had a castle to build, so they figured builder's grade material is just fine if you can't see it.
No, no!<eos> Kady...<eos> Julia, run, run.<eos> Kady, that was my hermit who healed your heart.<eos> And now, I'm going to taste it.
I wasn't.<eos> You can leave.<eos> You don't have to be here. It's fine.<eos> You know...<eos> You can't make me feel guilty for doing my job even when I'm barely fucking doing it.
What?<eos> Do you want to be buried or cremated?<eos> No, brother.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> But if I do, I want you to stuff my body and put it in the corner of the gym.
And there's a baby in there.<eos> Don't flatter yourself, Bunch.<eos> You're not gonna hit it.<eos> I know that.<eos> If you don't want to do it that much, why don't you get her something?
Get over here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's the safety.<eos> You see the white dot, it's on.<eos> You pull it down, it's off.
Bags of money, the days away, the drinking. It was all just Hollywood.<eos> Cover ups.<eos> Everything he did, he did for you.<eos> It goes like this. "I carry your heart with me.<eos> I carry it in my heart.
I-I don't understand what the problem is.<eos> You can't say it, can you?<eos> I can say it!<eos> I can s--<eos> Look, people say it all the time.
And then we're going to wait till she calls crying.<eos> - Hey it's for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Yeah, it's a flattop and the girl I'm dating loves it
Hey, you really shouldn't be smoking in here.<eos> That is so bad for Mom.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> She gave you her bracelet?<eos> Yeah, I remembered it from when I was a kid.
She was trying to extort me.<eos> Wow, can you walk me through that back flip?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The program works.<eos> In order to prove it, we had to get kids to go through it.
Those two words are her explicit wishes to live on through the most generous gift anyone can give.<eos> So today we're gonna honor Joy Tanner's wishes.<eos> There's a patient in Lancaster dying of congestive heart failure.<eos> His heart's also on the wrong side of his chest.<eos> He needs a miracle, and she has it.
- _<eos> - You can't just say you had a dream, I need details.<eos> I don't remember anything specific.<eos> Yeah, I call bull.<eos> Enough! I have to draw the line somewhere, and telling my mom the ins and outs of my sex fantasy is definitely crossing it.
Plus, obviously, you have something in your hand.<eos> We found the ring.<eos> Oh, well. I was saving it for a special occasion.<eos> It's the closest thing I have to a family heirloom.<eos> I want you to have it,
Yes.<eos> But the first thing you have to understand is that autism isn't a single condition and it's not a disease.<eos> It's a set of behaviours that cause difficulty in social communication.<eos> OK, well, here you are, saying that autism's hard to pin down so how can you even say that it's autism for sure?<eos> I'm afraid it isn't going to go away if we call it something different.
Just because you're as big as two people doesn't make you a couple.<eos> Fine.<eos> You want it?<eos> Come and get it.<eos> Fine, we'll split it.
Man, I can't get enough of those little guys.<eos> _ Uh, have you read this?<eos> That is one of my favorite books.<eos> Me too.<eos> Read it every year.
No, but the people that want Kirkin... they can help me.<eos> If you give them Kirkin, what do they promise in return?<eos> Proof that Arkady is alive.<eos> I was told he has a message for me.<eos> I would receive it if I kidnapped Kirkin and put him in that shipping container bound for St. Petersburg.
I don't know if I can.<eos> You got to come help me, Clark.<eos> I can't leave now.<eos> They're just about to start the hayride.<eos> Or as everyone here calls it, the "haaay-ride."
I had the perfect night planned -- alone, pay-per-view boxing -- The pride of Ireland versus a Cuban sensation.<eos> In the ring and in my bloodstream.<eos> Then Gloria and Mitchell got involved.<eos> Jay, Cam is gonna watch the fight, too.<eos> Why don't you two watch it together?
W-What are you doing?<eos> I'm lawyering up.<eos> Uh... uh, yeah.<eos> There's a lot of ambiguous language in this contract.<eos> I wouldn't sign it.
It's a bank statement showing a balance of nearly $50,000.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what?<eos> Detective, your brother opened this account in your mother's name after he became a fugitive.<eos> We've been monitoring it ever since.
- Nicole also said she smelled sour fruit.<eos> As in fermented fruit. - Liquor.<eos> - Ethyl isn't in liquor.<eos> Back in my day it was.<eos> Bootleggers used it
And then he...<eos> LOU! Goddammit!<eos> Do me a goddamn favour.<eos> All of you!<eos> Refrain from mentioning that name, because the next piece of excrement who utters it will get the Levi treatment.
I've been auditioning.<eos> I've got an agent.<eos> I've sent out tapes.<eos> But how can you give up our dream of you being a golfer?<eos> I'm not giving it up.
Do you have a comments card I can fill out?<eos> Look, you have to evacuate Old Town.<eos> There's no telling who or how many people he plans to kill.<eos> And what if he smuggles it out during this evacuation or if it spreads across Westerley?<eos> Or the rebels use it to attack Qresh again?
That has the distinctive odor of another serial killer On the loose, and we cannot have that.<eos> Because all my hard work will be for naught,<eos> They'll come in here and close this place down, And I'll die!<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I-I just meant that I've poured so much into this place That if they ever closed it, I would just die.
Blake Reedy, design engineer on the Foil development team.<eos> I designed the home button... with Mr. Gross' input, of course.<eos> And you brought the prototype with you to the Deviceroy conference?<eos> Yeah. I'd work on it during breaks.<eos> And how can you be sure you didn't lose it during one of those breaks?
I do mean in bond court.<eos> Lucca is good.<eos> She's smart and forward-leaning and a prodigy.<eos> And with respect, she shouldn't be given grunt work.<eos> Your advice is welcome. The partners will consider it.
P-Paddle!<eos> Paddle, Stan!<eos> Now, now, now!<eos> Stan, hamburger buns were on sale, so I stole 600.<eos> When I have a baby, I'm gonna name it, "Recycling."
Your husband assaulted an innocent kiss cam operator.<eos> He got himself banned for life.<eos> Come on, Francine, let's go.<eos> Unh-unh, I'm staying here.<eos> What? ! First, you buy me a gift that is clearly for yourself, and now you're taking it away?
But now it's back with a vengeance. Oh!<eos> So you're gonna try to ruin his calendar thing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll become his assistant, and I'll help him make the calendar.<eos> And then when he's feeling all good about it, I'll destroy it!
I mean, sure, I could pay Steve back in spoons, but nowadays one spoon is worth more than $60.<eos> How would he even give me change?<eos> What, like a tiny, little spoon?<eos> Oh, my God, that sounds amazing!<eos> Let's rescue the tiny spoon and the boy who has it!
You don't have a leg to stand on, Virgil.<eos> We have a lease.<eos> This is literally the worst lease I've ever seen in my life.<eos> Uh, you mind if I make a copy of this?<eos> The boys at the office are gonna love it.
The Mountain will be spotting anything out there.<eos> We clear the fields, and we station the flamethrowers here and here.<eos> What if the fire draws them in?<eos> We have never used fire on them before.<eos> We don't know what they understand about it.
- He'd rather make a deal now.<eos> - You're gambling.<eos> I know that.<eos> If you have what you're saying, then we can make a deal. - Okay.<eos> I just want it in writing.
Erik of Sweden is a Protestant.<eos> An interfaith marriage could help stem the tide of anti-Catholic sentiment.<eos> It would be seen as a gesture of tolerance.<eos> Or the move of a weakened Catholic queen, bending to Knox and his followers.<eos> The Vatican would see it as a betrayal.
Another winner.<eos> Well, my point is that there's a chance Shady Grady keeps all his records non-digital as well.<eos> Happy and I should poke around. CABE:<eos> Be careful!<eos> These guys catch you sticking your nose where it doesn't belong, they cut it off.
Yeah, you like the woods?<eos> I bet you do.<eos> Okay, don't smoke drugs, and stay in school, okay?<eos> Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody ever tell you that marriage is forever... because, spoiler alert, it's not!<eos> Women take your heart out of your chest cavity... stomp on it and spit on it!
It seems like this was planned a long time ago.<eos> You only realised that now?<eos> -Your husband was writing a book too.<eos> -The one we found. "Men Down".<eos> I met him whilst he was working on it.
As prime minister, I have given the Norwegian people a future by doing this.<eos> Listen to yourself. "The Norwegian people"...<eos> You've pulled the wool over Norwegian people's eyes.<eos> You have deceived them.<eos> You've committed a criminal offense, and you've known it all along.
Change. Yeah.<eos> If we had secrets that the government didn't want revealed, we could... extort them.<eos> But instead of money, we would demand change.<eos> She said that we would be patriots.<eos> She saw an opening and she-she exploited it.
It says here Patrick told authorities he got through the assault by focusing on sand."<eos> His attacker made him stare at an hourglass while the abuse went on.<eos> He was told that if he didn't cry until all the sand emptied out, he wouldn't be killed.<eos> So the trauma of the assault was fused with the image of an hourglass.<eos> And launched an obsession with time, so much so that he went on to build devices that measure it with extraordinary mathematical precision.
(quietly): You've got to be kidding me.<eos> The minibar's in the cabinet.<eos> Oh, you don't have to tell me how to find a minibar.<eos> (music stops) Hi, can you send someone up to remove all the alcohol from the minibar?<eos> 'Cause I don't want it.
Another suture, please.<eos> You didn't close it down enough.<eos> You got one more shot at this bleed, Dr. Hudson.<eos> The problem here is this shiny structure, the vagus nerve.<eos> What's gonna happen if Dr. Hudson cuts it, Dr. Pinkney?
Okay, and I might have talked it up a little more than I should've.<eos> - It doesn't look exactly like the boat from Jaws.<eos> - Oh. You're still gonna buy a harpoon gun though, aren't you?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I don't care if we never use it,
- Yes.<eos> - No, no, no, no, Molly! - Yes!<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> Why would you do this without talking to me?<eos> Well, I know it seems crazy, but it all happened so fast, and I wanted to snatch it up before somebody else got to it first.
Mol, a real baby takes nine months.<eos> The least we could do is give them two weeks.<eos> Two weeks?<eos> I thought you wanted a baby.<eos> Okay, if you're not all in, tell me now because I will raise it on my own.
And if you need anything notarized, bring that, too.<eos> What's all that racket?<eos> Oh, that?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> After a half hour, you won't even notice it.
You really should finish it.<eos> A gift is totally unnecessary.<eos> Open it.<eos> I acquired this notebook at an estate sale in England.<eos> The woman who sold it to me said that the owner was a famous English writer.
Open it.<eos> I acquired this notebook at an estate sale in England.<eos> The woman who sold it to me said that the owner was a famous English writer.<eos> Apparently, it was the only blank notebook in his library.<eos> She said he kept it to remind him of the darkest time in his life.
Apparently, it was the only blank notebook in his library.<eos> She said he kept it to remind him of the darkest time in his life.<eos> A time he lost his voice.<eos> It's too much.<eos> I was just holding it, waiting for the right person.
I love it. No.<eos> I love it.<eos> It's so good.<eos> It's like a... like a nice warm bowl of tomato soup.<eos> If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head.
Why can't you see what's going on?<eos> Don't you remember the first time you met?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> It was right there in that office.<eos> Oh, I remember it like it was yesterday.
My sister hates me, my father's in the wind, Maggie can't help.<eos> Blair is a psycho.<eos> I'm at rock bottom.<eos> Since when, do either of us, need somebody else, when we've got each other?<eos> Why don't we do what we always do when we have a problem and solve the crap out of it, together.
Kirsten!<eos> How long can she stay in there without bouncing?<eos> I don't know, it's not a stitch, so there's no time limit.<eos> Linus, can you isolate the signal that's driving this avatar? - Yes!<eos> Do you want me to cut it off?
And I'm sorry. That was wrong.<eos> It was my idea, not hers.<eos> - Why would you do this?<eos> - Look, you said it yourself. Right?<eos> The right dress can transform the person wearing it. Right?
It was my idea, not hers.<eos> - Why would you do this?<eos> - Look, you said it yourself. Right?<eos> The right dress can transform the person wearing it. Right?<eos> Well, I think it can transform the person looking at it, too.
Different memory.<eos> Anna just walked in on the other associates talking about her behind her back.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause she was doing her job and doing it well?
Okay, Officer. Drive.<eos> Oh, and just so you know, the reason I want to become a policeman is to get rid of the bad guys, make the world a better place.<eos> We didn't know what had happened.<eos> I mean, there's obviously been some kind of mistake.<eos> Ma'am, if there's been a mistake, it looks like your husband made it.
Show some respect.<eos> Who's getting it?<eos> Who's getting it, huh?<eos> Oh, oh, remember this?<eos> This is where he takes a glove off and gives it to some kid before the match?
Uh, dude...<eos> We are never settling anything with that stupid game again -- ever.<eos> I'll paint here, so... you... paint yours here.<eos> Now, your sigil sets the table.<eos> Mine actually kills it.
No, it's not difficult at all.<eos> Before you left for Rome I couldn't help but notice you were spending a lot of time together.<eos> There seems to be... a connection between you.<eos> Are you encouraging me to take an English spy as my lover?<eos> As Francis' mother, if you want permission, I give it to you.
Okay.<eos> I doubt she knows anything about the Stitchers program.<eos> I doubt she knows anything about quantum computation.<eos> I mastered the adiabatic model in fifth grade.<eos> If there's a pattern here, I don't see it.
Kirsten, bounce in four, three...<eos> Good morning, this is your captain speaking.<eos> We are making our final descent into Los Ang...<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Matt did have his passport, and he had it in the pocket next to his heart when he died.
Which is sweet, delicious, and expensive?<eos> We keep the cupcake window, but we make it into a bar too.<eos> It's two great things put together! Like you and me?<eos> I was gonna say fat people and tripping, but yes!<eos> We keep the cupcake dream; we just add overpriced alcohol to it.
Isn't sleeping on it what got me in trouble in the first place?<eos> I thought of another pro for Randy.<eos> He looks like a man from the front and from the back.<eos> Very rare in these times.<eos> Okay, I'll put it on the list.
Not that long.<eos> So, what happens to the restaurant now?<eos> - I mean, you have to do something.<eos> - Like what?<eos> I don't know, but without the money, they'll shut it down.
You're right, it was unforgivable.<eos> Nathan's sorry, aren't you?<eos> Why would anyone set fire to a tree?<eos> I don't know, but I intend to find out.<eos> If it burns out now, you won't find it in the dark.
Gibney:<eos> How many times have you been to Natanz?<eos> Not that many, because I left few years ago, the IAEA, but I was there quite... Quite a few times.<eos> Natanz is just in the middle of the desert.<eos> When they were building it in secret, they were calling it desert irrigation facility.
I wasn't expecting to see her and I was jacked up on coffee and I just lunged at her, which she interpreted as a stranger lunging at her.<eos> -So sensitive.<eos> -I felt so stupid.<eos> She was freaking out. She gave me her wallet.<eos> - Did you keep it?
She was, but she's there now.<eos> -Hard to keep track of our girl, huh?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Okay. So, it's pretty cut and dry here.<eos> We plant an egg in a viable body, we fertilize it and out comes a baby. Bing bang boom.
-No.<eos> Not this again.<eos> -And the one with the skateboard?<eos> He doesn't ride it.<eos> He just carries it around.
You shorted him. -I don't care!<eos> -And people are missing the poem!<eos> Just a heads-up! Hey.<eos> What are you guys up to? We're doing "I drink your milkshake!<eos> I drink it up!"
Because you have one of the only female heart transplant surgeons in the world, and I am not gonna tell my patient and her sister that they aren't getting that heart!<eos> The reason you raised $150 million today is because I promoted you to CIO against the passionate pleas of the committee and just about every other department head here, who said I was out of my mind to entrust you with this position<eos> because when it comes to rules and procedure, they only apply to you when they suit your needs, Alex.<eos> And your point?<eos> I want you to get this heart and as quickly as possible, but I am not gonna release it until it's been cleared by Legal.
Tell her I know what it's like to be sitting in this room, waiting to hear if everything's okay.<eos> Explain the procedure is called...<eos> Heterotopic transplant.<eos> Deana's heart will stay inside her.<eos> We'll take Thomas's heart and connect it on top of Deana's piggyback.
Apply pressure, be firm.<eos> Here, Jesse. Thank you, Dr. Rorish.<eos> A Foley?<eos> Yep. All right, Dr. Lorenson, insert that catheter into the uterus.<eos> We're gonna keep kneading the uterus while you inflate it.
All right, then what's the problem?<eos> It's not on the list of devices assigned to employees.<eos> All right, so the target has spoofed his Mac address to stay hidden. All right.<eos> Look, man, you may have to check every device in the building by hand.<eos> I know his device is here somewhere. I just can't see it.
All right, so the target has spoofed his Mac address to stay hidden. All right.<eos> Look, man, you may have to check every device in the building by hand.<eos> I know his device is here somewhere. I just can't see it.<eos> Hold up.<eos> All right, you can't see it, but could you hear it?
This is such bullshit.<eos> You know this whole process of the auditions and stuff for you?<eos> I mean, if there's anyone who deserves the job, it's you.<eos> - If you actually want it...<eos> - If I want it?
No, I'm not done talking to him.<eos> Well, he's not our guy, his cousin isn't gonna press charges, so kick him.<eos> Jay, talk me through this route again.<eos> There's nothing to talk through.<eos> We change it up every week.
- You had faith in Szorlok once too.<eos> What makes her any different?<eos> Even if you had the final piece, what then?<eos> You haven't got any plan what to do with it.<eos> - I'll give it to the gods, they can protect it.
- Unless, Ana-Sett, where is the Hammer of Tek?<eos> Is it real?<eos> - The Hammer is real, but it is lost.<eos> - You wouldn't give Szorlok the last piece, not for a faint hope on some magic hammer.<eos> Gojun Pye wanted you to give it to the goddess.
You couldn't wait, like, five minutes?<eos> Hey, you were the one who said we should go dig up info.<eos> Tell him what you found on the Spartax spy network, Drax.<eos> Ronan is performing a Kree purification ritual in an ancient temple.<eos> Ronan only does it once every celestial cycle.
I heard legends of an artifact, a force for good so powerful it would bring peace to the universe, create a golden age for all life.<eos> That artifact was the Cosmic Seed.<eos> My father refused to let a prince of Spartax chase after a myth.<eos> But, of course, I went anyway.<eos> And I found it too.
You looked at the helmet.<eos> - Cece!<eos> - I did not.<eos> I did not. You had a sex dream about a Bear's helmet?<eos> Who was wearing it?
Okay, why won't this come off?<eos> Probably because it's a child-size medium.<eos> What?<eos> ! Why would you give me a child's helmet?<eos> I didn't think you were gonna put it on.
Okay, yes.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But right now, my parents are expecting us. So, you know, a lot of kids come into the hospital with stuff stuck on their head. Do you guys have a screwdriver or a hammer?<eos> Oh, uh, we can't break it 'cause... Nick's dad gave it to him.
Hello?<eos> I'm either home or having the best hallucination ever.<eos> Anybody?<eos> I smell coriander.<eos> Laypeople call it curry.
But I do know that after your two weeks in Thailand, your undercover mission for the CIA was over and you were supposed to go home.<eos> But instead you went rogue and you came to L.A.<eos> To keep tabs on you, I borrowed a GPS tracker from a friend of mine, Malcolm. And I placed it...<eos> In my watch. That was you.<eos> Yeah, only you left it in that Korean restaurant.
I'm ready, John.<eos> Took quite a lot to perfect the high roll.<eos> Did I get it right?<eos> You spent so much money tailoring this dress.<eos> Sure you want me to take it off?
We appeal, again and again if we have to, each time to a higher court.<eos> Which could actually be preferable to an outright win.<eos> A long, drawn-out case?<eos> How is that preferable?<eos> We take it to the national stage.
Virginia found out we did the initial interview with the Clavermores.<eos> She pitched a fit to Masters and now it's very likely we'll be taken off the case.<eos> Well, we knew that was a possibility.<eos> I'm sure that interview is on tape.<eos> And obviously, no one's heard it yet, or else we'd be packing our things.
- to continue to work together.<eos> - Oh, God, please don't start.<eos> - Your derision aside--<eos> - Okay, I...<eos> I just gave you the Clavermore case because your husband, who loves you, came in and fought for it so that I could give it to him so that he could give it to you.
- Your note?<eos> - Yeah, the-the note I sent you at the hospital with the roses... the two dozen long-stemmed roses.<eos> There was no note, no roses.<eos> No, the-the roses I left at the hospital.<eos> It was after visiting hours, so I gave them to the nurse, and told her to prop the note up where you'd be sure to see it.
Um... a few weeks ago, though, I woke up in the morning and realized I hadn't worn my diaphragm with Art the night before.<eos> But I don't understand. I remember you telling me how keen Art was to start a family as soon as you were married. What happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Art is as keen as ever.<eos> Then... why wouldn't you keep it?
Again.<eos> You know, your life can be a whole lot better than you think it can be.<eos> Why don't you just hammer the nail in?<eos> Because we are used to it.<eos> We just ignore it, like the rain in my bedroom.
In my fantasy, I bought the building and opened a sadness museum.<eos> Okay, that's it.<eos> Took care of the landlord.<eos> You killed him?<eos> I'll call Oleg; we'll get his friend's truck and take it from here.
- With me?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's ready, Dennis.<eos> Charlie, man, you gotta play that for Terry.<eos> Look, if he won't record it for you, man, I will.
[Kumpaya in Martu Wangka] Let me talk a bit about fire.<eos> This is how we learnt.<eos> Burn the country to create a burnt area and hunt there after the fire.<eos> We hunt game from the country.<eos> [Curtis Taylor speaking English] It's really important, the storytelling around a campfire... 'cause it kind of reminds us... that a lot of story about fire and how all the ancestral heroes used it, stole it, made the land and people better.
Just being out there, and just being out in the... [speaks Martu Wangka] [speaking English] ...in the homeland.<eos> Like, Kumpaya, she looks a bit frail.<eos> But when's she's out in the country and hunting, it makes her feel better.<eos> [in Martu Wangka] This goanna is full of shit!<eos> [Curtis speaking English] In preparation of the animal being cooked, we throw it over the fire, burn the sinew... and then we bury it inside a hole just beside the fire and cover it with coals.
[Curtis speaking English] In preparation of the animal being cooked, we throw it over the fire, burn the sinew... and then we bury it inside a hole just beside the fire and cover it with coals.<eos> That's a law, you know, and our custom.<eos> We don't bring any animals back that is uncooked.<eos> It's been like that for many thousands of years.<eos> We bring back cooked food and share it around with families.

Called me Roy.<eos> He says, "Did you cook this pig?"<eos> I says... I was afraid to say yes [chuckles] because I didn't have any business doing it, but then again, I said, "Yes."<eos> He said, "Come here."<eos> And so I really thought I was gonna get... get really blown out... but he got the moonshine jug and... poured a little bit in a glass and gave it to me.
They're not.<eos> They're not cooking at all in their homes.<eos> They're looking for the easiest way to have that meal.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> I go to the supermarket, they got a nice little chicken all roasted for me. I take it home, in the microwave for five minutes, my kids are eating.
And it still always works, you know.<eos> Omar, he farms.<eos> He brings his grain here to make flour.<eos> It's okay like that.<eos> People from the villages bring their grain, grind it here, and after they don't pay by money. They pay me by 10% of the grain.

They pay me by 10% of the grain.<eos> From the 10%, we take what we need for family and the rest we could sell it in the market.
Today, wheat is planted more widely than any other single crop, more than 550 million acres worldwide.<eos> And it all started in a region of the Middle East and North Africa, formerly known as the Fertile Crescent.<eos> Although wheat has its origins here and bread is still the staple food in these countries, the Fertile Crescent is no longer the bread basket it once was.<eos> The countries that make up this region today, from Egypt to Iraq, can no longer harvest enough wheat to feed their growing populations.<eos> So they have to import it from places that have surpluses, like Russia, Ukraine, Australia and the European Union.
So, a good way to think about the process of bread rising is you've got bacteria blowing, or farting, if you prefer, into balloons.<eos> And the more they fart into those balloons, the bigger those balloons get, leading the bread to double or even triple in size.<eos> What acts as the balloon?<eos> The best material anybody has found in the context of bread is something called "gluten."<eos> At our lab here, we take bread, or dough, and freeze it, and break it, and look at it under an electron microscope.
Try something new.<eos> Every bad thing you said about me... .. is true.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> And for a second, I was going to drop it and I was going to leave with you, but it didn't work out, so my plan is back on.<eos> And I'm going to see it through.
Lady Lola...<eos> I'm truly impressed.<eos> I will take your advice.<eos> I heard Elizabeth sent for you. Is everything all right?<eos> Elizabeth just asked for my advice, and she's taking it.
Or maybe he just let her name slip. Not a chance;<eos> Eugene wouldn't do that... he's a politician.<eos> Every word out of his mouth is calculated.<eos> You really think that he's running a sex trafficking ring?<eos> Or protecting it. I don't know.
Every email you've made, every text you've sent, all of your contacts.<eos> I wouldn't be using that phone if I were you.<eos> I knew something was wrong.<eos> That's why the phone was in my left pocket.<eos> I normally put it in my right.
You look like a broken puppet.<eos> I was just having fun with my friends. Oh?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Behind the people pointing and laughing?<eos> You don't know fun when you see it. Go, Mascot!
What could possibly go wrong?<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> There's literally nothing that can go wrong with that plan. Right.<eos> Keep it amongst ourselves.<eos> We don't want everyone doing it.
Previously on Wayward Pines...<eos> - We'll protect the harvesters.<eos> - What about the Abbies?<eos> We have never used fire on them before.<eos> We don't know what they understand about it.
Even if she picks up a card, you can't tell me it's anything more than dumb luck.<eos> She'll prove it.<eos> Give her food.<eos> She'll understand that's her reward.<eos> She wants them to have it.
!<eos> Pilcher told me!<eos> Jason, what is happening?<eos> I am your partner in everything! Talk to me!<eos> The past. You carry it with you wherever you go.
I like how you started with B and then segued to A.<eos> - That was sick.<eos> - Cheers, mate.<eos> - Hey, Donna... - For the last time, you left.<eos> This is my bunk now. You're not getting it back.
I'm not lurking.<eos> Vira Boyko.<eos> They're both Ukrainian.<eos> Maybe they remind me of my grandma.<eos> She wants the accident report on him so she can file with California Life Annuity Insurance, except I don't have it, so I gotta go check why the coroner hasn't signed off, 'cause I have nothing else to do today.
No.<eos> Ed had an affair with Opal.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I'll just bet you did.<eos> I know Ed made a mistake, and I know he's sorry, and I know that doesn't justify it, and I know that you're a saint and he doesn't deserve you and you don't deserve this.
It turns out that part of your job was setting up Bunchy.<eos> If I wanted Bunchy dead, why would I be asking you to stop U-A from killing the Panthers?<eos> You're not making sense.<eos> Attack of conscience after the fact. You didn't know they were gonna assassinate him.<eos> Look, Charmain, your job, whether you meant it or not, helped murder two people.
What are you gonna do with it?<eos> Well, what do you mean?<eos> It's in my drawer.<eos> Are you gonna take it back?<eos> Do you want me to take it back?
If she didn't want a ring on her finger, why does she care what I do with it?<eos> Because it's just sitting in that drawer like a loaded gun.<eos> And every time we have sex or a fight, he could just pull it out and point it at me.<eos> Do you even want the ring?<eos> I don't want it... right now.
'Cause that would be hell.<eos> No offense, but your timing sucks.<eos> You know why I brought Jen here.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I want you to take that ring out of your pocket and kindly throw it out the window.
Not now.<eos> Already?<eos> I take it that's work?<eos> Looks like they found a body in the woods outside Richmond.<eos> They're bringing it back to the lab with a potential witness.
Hi, Tommy.<eos> Uh, listen.<eos> Um, I'm sorry to bother you, and I'll be quick.<eos> Uh, remember how I said my sister has this restaurant?<eos> Well, we both kind of have it.
- A burner... so no GPS.<eos> - TARU just triangulated.<eos> The last call came from Saxon Woods.<eos> I got an emergency exception to put a Triggerfish on her phone.<eos> If it's on, we'll find it.
I need protection. I want cops outside of my house. Right.<eos> You have security, don't you?<eos> Uh, my cell's on the back.<eos> Tell them to reach out any time, day or night.<eos> - I'll make sure they get it.
At any rate, the rumours make people tetchy.<eos> Whoever gave Vigus a beating must have strong suspicions as to his involvement in the Trade.<eos> And were you able to discover who it was?<eos> No, I was not minded to at this stage.<eos> I hope the assailant will realise his error and not repeat it.
When can I go down the mine, mama?<eos> When copper is found.<eos> Will it be?<eos> I've never seen Francis more convinced of anything.<eos> Or more determined to be the one to find it.
If I go to prison for debt, this will mean more money coming in.<eos> The quicker the debt is paid, the quicker I'm out again.<eos> Unless the goods be found in our house, in which case you'll serve longer still!<eos> The cache will be built in the library and can be done in one night.<eos> Four or five men to dig it, six or eight to use it thereafter.
This will enormously ease your situation.<eos> I'm only grateful for your hesitation, and your loyalty all these months.<eos> Loyalty's not all on one side, Ross, nor ever has been.<eos> I regret I must decline your invitation for Christmas.<eos> I believe Francis would want me to spend it in his house.
Here you go. I've got potatoes...<eos> Mistress Demelza!<eos> Rosina!<eos> Is it your knee?<eos> 'Tis like it be long before Dr Enys mend it, only now it is worse.
Do you think I would ever have said those words had I known what would happen to Francis?<eos> And yet, they cannot be unsaid.<eos> I felt you needed to know that, if you were unhappy in those early days, then so was I.<eos> That the mistake was not yours, but mine.<eos> That "mistake", as you call it... ..has cost many people dear.
Contact information?<eos> Places of employment?<eos> It was all in my phone, which I dropped when I thought I was gonna die.<eos> It's back at my place.<eos> I'll retrieve it when I examine the scene.
Oh, just a... a mild strain of the effort of not wringing your neck. Monitor.<eos> All right, hey, look, look, look, look. Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Brute force is not what's called for.<eos> The Raven responds to the slightest movement of the fingers when handled properly.<eos> All right, just relax your thumb when you roll it.
Sal, you know me.<eos> My personal life will not affect my professional abilities.<eos> Now, you need this surgery.<eos> It's the only way to repair the valve.<eos> I know, I know... but I want Dr. Shane to do it.
- and they wouldn't go to sleep at night. - Okay.<eos> So he went to see what was up, and he discovered that his herd were eating the fruit off a coffee tree.<eos> I thought coffee came from a bean.<eos> It does, but the bean is the seed in the fruit. Ah.<eos> So Kaldi then goes to his local monastery, and he tells them all about his goats, and then they take the fruit, they turn it into a drink.
No.<eos> This was a completely mutual decision, as with the abortion.<eos> Like... a blood contract that Hazel and I had secretly.<eos> A big secret, a strong bond... .. which meant that, when it came to my idea of a joint venture to kill Trevor and Lesley, we had already signed a contract in blood that it is OK to kill a human.<eos> Hazel wanted it and I facilitated it.

I'd be on a beach right now.<eos> [Laughter] My future ex-wife is here.<eos> Hey, dollface, how about a sponge bath?<eos> And if that goes well, you can give me one.<eos> [Laughter] What happens when you take a blob of cookie dough, you put it in a cheap suit, and you give it chlamydia?
- And neither do you.<eos> - Irrelevant.<eos> The point is, this isn't a brothel.<eos> Enough with the slut-shaming.<eos> It isn't any less wrong when you do it to a guy.
Just give it back when you're done.<eos> Well, now that we're starting fresh, can we please finally get rid of that hideous duck painting?<eos> - No, Louis, we can't. - Why not?<eos> Because it's like you.<eos> I can't stand it, but it's part of the family.
All right. I'm done washing other people's underwear.<eos> You're on waste disposal.<eos> At least let me finish mine.<eos> Whatever this is.<eos> We'll pack it up for you.
You changed the lock. I don't know what you're talking...<eos> The vault, the pass code.<eos> Back off.<eos> You changed it. Yeah, we changed it, actually, several times.<eos> You're coming with me, and you're going to open it up. Okay.
Fuckin' hell!<eos> Evening!<eos> What can I get you?<eos> I need to use your phone, please.<eos> Someone's using it.
- What?<eos> - On your stag hunt.<eos> Quite a few, as it happens.<eos> I really need to use that telephone.<eos> I just told you, your friend is using it.
Do I turn it in?<eos> Do I give it to his wife?<eos> Do I keep it?<eos> Then I heard about the shooting last night and I thought,<eos> 'God, they killed him for this money and they still want it and I've got it, and I've just I've just gotta get out of this mess.'
Yeah.<eos> Ash's sister is taking me to court over the last frozen embryo.<eos> Awkward.<eos> I have to file an affidavit before the mediation, and I've just found out it's the day after tomorrow.<eos> Deb wants a court order giving it to her and I I don't want that.
Ms King, the first-named respondent, is seeking the same.<eos> What is your position, Mr Dolan?<eos> I don't consent to either of them having it.<eos> Do you wish for it to remain in storage?<eos> Or do you want it for yourself?
Todd got his money from exporting a car.<eos> Well, obviously, Simon's onto a different form of income.<eos> And I doubt it's got anything to do with cars.<eos> The bill of loading says 'fridges'.<eos> I'll believe that when I see it.
OK, there's a container arriving at the docks tonight.<eos> Imported by Simon Hamilton.<eos> Arriving?<eos> The bill of lading says fridges.<eos> I'll believe that when I see it.
Until then, a bit of trust would be nice.<eos> Have you written your security code anywhere?<eos> Told anyone?<eos> Let people see it? No.<eos> Someone used it to get in here last night.
Drought-resistant landscaping And a pool that wouldn't look out of place in bel air.<eos> The location is perfect.<eos> One mile from sharon, A mile from my daughter, and i spotted maybe One little deal killer.<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> See if you can notice it.
Soto and her team got lucky last night.<eos> Despite the absence of specific geographic markers, our Image Analysis got a lead.<eos> That little dot in the sky...<eos> turns out it's an LAPD airship.<eos> If we track the flight plan of this helicopter from four days ago and compare it with the ISIS video, we can discover where the image was captured.
And they say people don't change.<eos> But you're saying, Mike, that this currency was never distributed to the Sunnis?<eos> No.<eos> According to records, the Army personnel in charge of financial support were caught in an ambush and were ordered to torch the cash.<eos> And then it shows up here, where our victim uses it to tip a girl in a strip joint.
Well, our killer could, but it's hard to see How adrian was in thailand and a barbecue at the same time.<eos> Mike, is there a margin of error here?<eos> The print's just an estimation, so yeah.<eos> Look. The killer is crazy.<eos> So what's to say this adrian guy didn't chop off his own thumb, Leave it with the victim as he ran off to asia?
For one, you already had kids.<eos> I am a single parent working homicide.<eos> But, as captain, you do have more control over your hours.<eos> And, as you know, in this job, the hours control you, And as captain, i would be sympathetic to julio's needs.<eos> I'm more concerned with what he does With his time here than how he manages it at home.
Now all we have to do is find the person it belongs to.<eos> It's your mother.<eos> I don't feel like being manipulated today.<eos> I have said it a million times.<eos> As soon as this baby is born, She needs to put it up for adoption.
No, this is the first time.<eos> You worked with Jeff Dellinger?<eos> For five years, cubicle by cubicle.<eos> And you were working with him, next to him, when this alleged espionage took place?<eos> I don't know why they call it espionage.
- Very Vanilla. - In his Very Vanilla smoothie!<eos> Very Vanilla.<eos> What difference does it make how vanilla the smoothie is?<eos> Look, that oxy... That cost me a lot of money.<eos> I would never split it with that smug bastard ever.
Oh, my god. You little...<eos> where's the remote?<eos> Put the remote back on the table right now, Or I will arrest you for theft.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I don't want it anyway.
where's the remote?<eos> Put the remote back on the table right now, Or I will arrest you for theft.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I don't want it anyway.<eos> You probably touched it.
He's in the Army.<eos> How 'bout where he lives?<eos> It's so great he gave you this gift.<eos> Can I just look at it again for a moment?<eos> I'll give it right back to you, I promise.
I... i know.<eos> It's just this.<eos> What does this mean for our guys?<eos> As we have shortages, we'll hire new workers.<eos> Make sure everyone knows when they return, they can get their job back if they want it.
- And now it's too late to messenger the form over by the deadline at the end of the school day, and I-I really...<eos> I am so sorry... All right. It's okay.<eos> It's okay. You just have to call Dean Ward.<eos> Tell her I am personally asking for an exception to this rule.<eos> I mean, I would do it, but, you know, things are so crazy around here, and given our history...
Yep.<eos> Why are you printing out an evidence inventory?<eos> Well, I couldn't find pictures of the alley from the night of the shooting, so I thought I might look through the log and see if somebody might have mislabeled the files.<eos> But the alley wasn't part of the crime scene.<eos> I mean, the police locked it down to do a quick search, but...
- I'm forgetting things.<eos> Small things.<eos> Words.<eos> Like "mass spectrometer."<eos> Though obviously I remembered it now because I did a memory palace technique earlier today where I put the mass spectrometer
Well, based on lividity, it was clear he was moved afterwards.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, you're welcome.<eos> You told Detective Rizzoli that you were alone in the house when you killed Robert.<eos> - Go ahead and pick up that dummy and move it, there.
I called Miami to confirm.<eos> Another one's definitely coming.<eos> With Jack dead, somebody else must be picking up those packages from the dead letter bin.<eos> We need to get eyes in that post office and get that package.<eos> Well, how do we do that without alerting whoever's picking it up?
- Jane Rizzoli.<eos> - She's a detective with the Boston Police Department. Oh.<eos> And is that dress official police issue?<eos> [Maura chuckles] Uh, yes.<eos> Actually, you should see when my brother wears it.
Sorry, Maura. I'm with fat bomb.<eos> Finally.<eos> I have two procedures scheduled this afternoon and I would very much prefer not to miss either one of them.<eos> Nobody needs Botox that bad.<eos> I don't add poison to the body. I free it of excess.
I wouldn't even know where to start.<eos> Then you won't mind if we check your records, see if you purchased any controlled substances with your medical credentials? Yeah.<eos> I mean, that...<eos> that's... that's not a problem.<eos> The fat goes into decanting cannisters, and... and then I never see it again.
I mean, that...<eos> that's... that's not a problem.<eos> The fat goes into decanting cannisters, and... and then I never see it again.<eos> It's Sunland Medical Waste that removes it from the premises.<eos> But they are supposed to incinerate it right away.
Okay, that's just gross.<eos> She's transporting the fat in her trunk?<eos> Well, I wouldn't want that in my leather seats. [Chuckles]<eos> Hold on.<eos> Maybe she's not transporting it anywhere.
- what would you have done?<eos> - I don't know. I'll tell you ... the same thing.<eos> You didn't shoot anybody.<eos> You protected me, just... just like you wish you could've protected Marcus.<eos> You were just doing your job, and maybe in the midst of it, you realized that... You can really feel again after a long time of being too scared to do that.
No, but I may not hear anything for several weeks.<eos> Okay, you gave him three chapters to your mystery novel. - How long does this take?<eos> - Well, he's very busy.<eos> I'm sure I'm not high on his priority list.<eos> Well, you will be when he reads it.
- Oh.<eos> I'm guessing you're canceling dinner.<eos> Yeah. Just got called out to advise on a case.<eos> I'm on a plane for Philly in an hour.<eos> Yeah, the monkey suit kind of gave it away, so...
I've been dressing her wound for the past two days.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I've been re-dressing it.<eos> Coconut oil.<eos> We used it on everything at the commune.
I've bumped up against worse problems.<eos> Yeah, but why bring Champ into this?<eos> We need all hands on deck.<eos> Fine.<eos> But we make a plan, and we stick with it.
Go.<eos> We get a sample of the poison that Bobo used, and maybe Black Badge can reverse engineer a cure.<eos> There's a whole whack of it in the basement.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> 'Cause I was there when Bobo's guy made it. Shh!
For all of us.<eos> I know.<eos> But I...<eos> You asked him for help.<eos> He's giving it to you.
Vernon, it's Spence.<eos> Really?<eos> Sorry, I was just doing what Vern asked me to do.<eos> Put a pot of coffee on, please.<eos> Um, how do you take it?
NATO's founding principle is based on an open door policy for any nation that meets the requirements for membership.<eos> A moratorium is impossible.<eos> Admission must be unanimous.<eos> And the U.S. has veto power.<eos> All we ask is assurance that you'll use it.
It's not part of me.<eos> - How long have you felt this way?<eos> - Since I was a little boy.<eos> Four or five.<eos> I'd look at it and it just felt strange.
Okay, bye.<eos> Tito stayed in Morocco for two days.<eos> In the meantime all the containers had to be unloaded from our cargo ships.<eos> Not in Casablanca, but a few kilometers away at an American military base.<eos> Americans secretly transferred the cargo to their ships and then shipped it on to the U.S.
Maybe they found your sex tape.<eos> I don't have a sex tape.<eos> You don't have a sex... even I have a sex tape, man.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a really awful sex tape.<eos> If somebody found it, they definitely wouldn't want to watch it.
I don't have a sex tape.<eos> You don't have a sex... even I have a sex tape, man.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a really awful sex tape.<eos> If somebody found it, they definitely wouldn't want to watch it.<eos> And if they watched it, they certainly wouldn't want to talk about it.
They need it more than I do.<eos> Is that one of the issues you'll be bringing up in the final debate?<eos> The final debate was last week.<eos> Alderman Becks' campaign told us one more debate was being set right before the election.<eos> Um... this is the first I've heard of it.
Which isn't okay!<eos> You should be pissed off.<eos> And... And yelling.<eos> But the fact that you're not is...<eos> Maybe we're just both messed up, or the sex is so good that we can't see it, but this is not what a healthy relationship looks like.
How do you know that?<eos> Did you read my diary?<eos> No, I saw your pictures on your...<eos> Wait, you keep a diary?<eos> As a grown man, call it a journal.
You want one?<eos> No, thank you, I'm full of fermented fish from dinner.<eos> Oh, huh, me too.<eos> I'm really getting a taste for it.<eos> Do you know the Indonesians call it bunga bangkal?
You got to get Toby back in here!<eos> Are you sure it's on a pressure plate?<eos> See how the interior ridge is just above the outer frame?<eos> Well, that's 'cause the springs are compressed by the weight of the scepter.<eos> Okay... we lift it, something bad happens.
Multiple shooters!<eos> Spread out!<eos> Fan out! Here's your hall pass.<eos> Don't let the principal catch you.<eos> I swear I had it.
If there is even a chance that I have the same mutation,<eos> Mitch needs to know that there's another phase two subject - he can study.<eos> - Jackson...<eos> - No.<eos> - You know it's true. If they learn about it in Washington,
Right here, taking care of them.<eos> They're lucky to have you.<eos> You know, I was lucky once.<eos> I found some wild dill weed.<eos> My mother used to make okróshka with it back in Vladivostok. Russia?
Uh...<eos> (blows air) I do not know what you're talking about.<eos> Look, we know that the killer is someone at the hospital who is the baby in the belly in 1985, right?<eos> And we know that you inherit your blood type from your parents.<eos> That means if we somehow got a blood type from Jane Hollis and cross-referenced it with the blood samples we got from staff, we could figure out if there's a link.
Yes.<eos> It's too big an area for volunteers to secure, so the drone makes it easier to monitor.<eos> Have any of your other neighbors complained about your drone?<eos> Or is it just Dr. Nachmann? No.<eos> People love it.
- to carry virtually any weapon.<eos> - Okay, uh, this is, uh, entertaining, but I'm not sure why it's relevant.<eos> - It's not. - The havoc that drones can wreak isn't limited to weapons, is it, Doctor?<eos> No.<eos> Now, this drone looks like a basic hobbyist's toy, when, in fact, it's equipped with a... Wi-Fi router that tricks your computer into connecting with it.
Peter, you're always being indicted.<eos> If it weren't today, it would be tomorrow.<eos> I'll have my lawyer call.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You told Dr. Nachmann not to shoot a drone, so he brought it down safely and he returned it.
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.<eos> Can I make a confession to you?<eos> Sure.<eos> I never liked wine.<eos> I only drank it 'cause you liked it.
And my name is Seeley Booth, and I'm a special agent with the FBI's homicide division.<eos> When I'm called out to a scene where the remains are badly burnt or decomposed, I call in Bones.<eos> He calls me "Bones." Mm-hmm.<eos> Even though I'm his wife and the mother of two of his children, he still refers to me by a nickname I despise.<eos> Well, you used to despise it, but now I think you like it.
Where?<eos> Outside a bar?<eos> Close.<eos> Inside a glass recycling plant.<eos> Ouch. Yeah, there's a machine that breaks up the glass and spits it into a pile 20 feet below.
So... any more big tremors?<eos> No, but no more ghosts either.<eos> Well, I guess we'll never know.<eos> You know, I wouldn't have believed it either, and then after Lance died, I saw him, and he was telling me to move on.<eos> And it really helped, so I wasn't trying to be funny or flip, I just... if someone's trying to give you a message, I don't want you to miss it.
Uh, you hear about the Midnight Ranger murder?<eos> Yeah, the guy in the cape.<eos> Heard he got shot the other night.<eos> That was his phone.<eos> He used it to alert police to street crimes he couldn't handle alone.
A surgeon's no use.<eos> Only blood can save me now.<eos> I haven't the heart to take their blood.<eos> No, Mistress, no need to take it.<eos> We give it to you freely.
- Get out of here. - And miss this?<eos> I'm still a member of this distinguished club, Mellie.<eos> Just a non-voting one.<eos> You know, there is one way out of this.<eos> Nobody's mentioned it yet, but I'm sure we're all thinking it.
Or what?<eos> What are you people going to do?<eos> Oh, for the record...<eos> I know you didn't really transfer that money into my account, and that's okay.<eos> I don't want it.
Sir.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sir, we're lost.<eos> We keep looking for the exits, and instead, we keep finding gift shops.<eos> Only reason I'm wearing this hat is 'cause my grandkids made me get it and you know, the ears protect my neck.
Shure he has to erect his equipment.<eos> - Where?<eos> - What do you mean where?<eos> Up on the roof!<eos> He puts the aerial up on the roof, runs a wire down from the aerial, sticks it in the back of the telly and then we have BBC1, BBC2, UTV and the other one.
I want to watch that in peace.<eos> I don't want half the town round here.<eos> - I've told no-one!<eos> This humble cable is about to change your lives.<eos> - Will you just stick it in!
We'll escort these ladies to their wards, thank you, Sergeant, and leave you to get on with your business.<eos> Your truck is abandoned in the lane.<eos> It's obstructing traffic.<eos> Really, Sergeant. It's half past ten at night - there is no traffic.<eos> There will be traffic after daybreak - it will obstruct it then.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Got you a coffee. - Thank you.<eos> And I don't know if you take it black or with milk or soy or anyway...
Yeah.<eos> He was supposed to put out an article on a new daycare center opening up on the base.<eos> Started it at home but only got halfway through, so...<eos> I gotta finish it.<eos> Good thing he put it in the cloud.
The main action does tend to be sleeping.<eos> And although Primus is very suave and has the most charming yacht, I really need him to grab the bull by the horns before I start taking out my urges on the staff!<eos> Joking aside, if you need anyone to, er, service you...<eos> You have got one hell of an arm on you!<eos> You flung that disc like you hated it!
Yes.<eos> Actually, my husband wanted to talk to you about rent.<eos> Well, exactly, cos guests is extra.<eos> I think he was after a discount.<eos> I'll put it on the tab. Right!
I mean, she's, you know, already stated rather strongly that she can't save me.<eos> I'll keep my expectations low then.<eos> How's that?<eos> This may help.<eos> She's pregnant with another man's child who's out of the picture, but she's leaving soon to go live with her sister in Ohio to have her baby and then raise it... or give it away.
Afterward, I walked you to your apartment so I could tell you about my job.<eos> But there was this violinist playing on Kenyon so we sat in this stoop for a minute to listen... And I thought why ruin the moment.<eos> And when we finally got to your door I started to tell you about my job but you were distracted looking for your keys.<eos> I couldn't stop staring at that little cleft in your chin... thinking about how I wanted to trace it with my finger... And kiss you.<eos> 'So I never told you about the job' and I called them the next day and I told them that I didn't want it.
That's noble...<eos> But you can't hide this forever. At some point, people are gonna expect, you know... a wedding.<eos> Oh, my God, my bracelet.<eos> I-I had a gold chain bracelet on, and now it's not here.<eos> Well, when did you have it on last?
It's very specific and elaborate.<eos> You can't just buy something like that at a costume store, which means he had...<eos> Either the killer is an expert tailor and mask maker, or he had it made by someone who is.<eos> Okay, I was thinking the second option.<eos> Okay, so, then, all we have to do is use ourselves as bait to draw the green meanie in, and then figure out a way to cut a piece of fabric off his costume and bring it around to all the fabric stores in the area, see if they recognize it like they do in those forensics shows.
And then they disappear, never to be heard from again.<eos> Well, that's certainly one explanation for Pete.<eos> I never really, um, believed what she said, but... now people are disappearing again.<eos> She always said burn sage to protect yourself. Hmm.<eos> So why did she call it "the chitters"?
Regardless, I am asking for a truce.<eos> And if I don't give it?<eos> Please... don't make me go to your father.<eos> How do you think he'll see your refusal?<eos> I imagine he'll see it as the actions of a petulant child.
We have a problem.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Now what?<eos> Well, we got her number.<eos> Let's head back to the bunker, and we'll put a trace on it.
Why did you release it?<eos> Oh, I didn't release it.<eos> This is an attack, a message.<eos> Someone stole my work to use against my family.<eos> No one is coming to help us, but the alpha shield will keep it in.
No power, no shield, and we all get out of here.<eos> If the pathogen escapes...<eos> -No, I have done the math.<eos> We are 186 miles from the closest land mass.<eos> The water and the air will disperse it.
It's like a divorce in reverse.<eos> - How's your heart?<eos> - Oh, that.<eos> I-I had your little trinket taken care of. Thank you.<eos> Would you like it back?
Okay, so now pretend you're not talking to Johnny.<eos> It kills fear and triggers euphoria.<eos> The wall acts as a giant pacifier.<eos> No fight, no flight, total passivity.<eos> When they activate it, everyone in Old Town becomes some kind of... helpless, happy drone.
Uh, yeah, I have questions about where to park and stuff, but you know,<eos> Ha! What if the big letter comes back?<eos> I can't believe it just took a high fever for me to like this show.<eos> Not if it's silent!<eos> Well, I hate it.
Get out!<eos> Keep your hands up.<eos> Do it, Sam.<eos> Do it.<eos> You're gonna hear what the hammer claw sounded like when you got it deep in that pretty face of hers.
Her last.<eos> We need to get her body back.<eos> I need to see it buried.<eos> I need to see her.<eos> Molly, I want her body back, too, but they're not gonna give it to us.
Then Jamal Al Fayeed.<eos> And now President Bassam Al Fayeed.<eos> I am no longer an Al Fayeed.<eos> I am Leila Haddad.<eos> And if I am elected president, I will shut down that palace and turn it back to a people's park.
The result was a look inside the heartbreak, rejection, and ultimate triumph of globesmen.<eos> So this is... a globe.<eos> You got all the different countries in it, and then the continents.<eos> They did blue for the oceans.<eos> The... globe is tilted up so that when you face it...
Stop moping about who you are not and try being who you are, the guy that's in love with Caroline Forbes.<eos> You just vervained her, Stefan.<eos> In my playbook, that's a notch above flowers and chocolates, because when you love someone, sometimes you have to go to those extremes.<eos> Listen, I know that you've been locked up in a coffin for the last three years of actual civilization, but that is legitimately terrible advice.<eos> Actually, brother, that advice is so good that I have to take it myself.
They're three years old.<eos> They shouldn't be involved in this world. Not yet.<eos> Lizzie siphoned me the other day.<eos> The girls had their friend's birthday party, and Lizzie took Josie's goodie bag.<eos> I took it back from her and then she grabbed my arm. She didn't mean to.
Cabe, you need to get Homeland to shut down the entire L.A. blood supply until it can get tested.<eos> No surgeries, no transfusions, nothing.<eos> Can-can we get clean blood from a blood drive?<eos> We can't replace 25,000 units of blood with a blood drive.<eos> And if the hospital tries to buy it from a national blood bank, it'll take a day to get here.
There've been threats to infiltrate the U.S. health care system for years. This is terrorism.<eos> Is there some vaccine for Nibori so the patients can still get procedures?<eos> There is, but it takes two weeks to take effect. That's too long.<eos> Uh, just got word-- the FBI's on the case.<eos> Homeland wants us to get into it as well.
We're gonna take this to the next level, okay?<eos> Look, I just told you I can't give you what you want.<eos> And now you want more.<eos> Look, Christ, what is it with everybody, huh?<eos> You make an agreement, and then they change it on you?
You know the drill, I'm off to the press conference. -<eos> - Mette?<eos> Divers have found a cellphone.<eos> - - Does it work?<eos> They're bringing it to the technicians.
Who? Tony.<eos> Tony.<eos> Tony.<eos> We still have him in custody. He stole hank's cell phone so we know he was assigned to hank.<eos> I'll get it out of him.
Josef nebojsa In prague.<eos> We tracked it to a book dealer in leipzig And then here to portland.<eos> Turns out the book dealer who bought it Is related to a friend of yours.<eos> The book dealer was blutbaden Yet he chose to give the book to a grimm.<eos> I believe that you now have that book And you will give it to me.
But we can track her vehicle from our office.<eos> Oh, this!<eos> This is what I was talking about.<eos> "Chapter 10 -- Why I Never Answer Prayers, and You Should Be Glad I Don't."<eos> And chapter 11 -- "The Truth About Divine intervention and Why I Avoid It at All Costs."
You created worlds.<eos> I was stupid.<eos> Naive. I thought if I could show my sister that there was something more than just us, something better than us, then maybe she'd change.<eos> Maybe she'd stop... being...her.<eos> But... every time I'd build a new world... she'd destroy it.
She won.<eos> Okay, so?<eos> We need somebody to get close to her, someone with a... personal connection.<eos> Well, what are we waiting for?<eos> How do I smuggle this thing? We could always shove it up your --
Talking in riddles as usual.<eos> And who is Jocabed when he's at home?<eos> She.<eos> Moses' mother.<eos> Who put the child in a basket and hid it in the bulrushes.
I got a call yesterday.<eos> My dad had a small estate, and so they did a DNA test.<eos> Turns out he's not my dad, so I'm not even Jewish.<eos> Hey, this seat taken?<eos> Well, I was saving it for Adam Lambert, but I'm starting to think he's a no-show.
Gray Pharma.<eos> They actually have a warehouse here in Gotham.<eos> You think they could be a target?<eos> Well, they're the only pharmacy that carries the drug.<eos> If somebody wants it, they'll have to go to the source.
They've hidden him somewhere secret.<eos> Him fixing me is just the beginning.<eos> I want an army.<eos> I want an army like me!<eos> And he is going to give it to me.
Domestic-abuse victims are afforded greater protections now, so we need to create a narrative for the parole board that highlights the psychological trauma that led to your... episode with your husband.<eos> That was no episode.<eos> You're right. Bad word choice.<eos> Call it what you want.<eos> I call it my finest hour.
You're asking my client what's wrong with her when you should be asking what was wrong with the man that repeatedly battered...<eos> Connor, enough.<eos> Instead, you're putting the burden on the victim!<eos> Young man, you need to rein it in.<eos> My client has suffered a lifetime of horror, and you're just continuing the cycle of abuse, and I won't allow it!
You say you love me, right?<eos> Then come back inside.<eos> It was the fastest hookup of my life.<eos> That happened on top of my $400 duvet.<eos> I'll wash it tonight.
Add a tablespoon of curry.<eos> A whole tablespoon?<eos> Will you trust me?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm putting it in.
Is that electromagnet supposed to make me let go of the CryptoCube?<eos> No.<eos> It's supposed to get me inside the pod.<eos> This will make you let go of the CryptoCube.<eos> Freezing this device will not destroy it, Star-Lord.
To talk about the future.<eos> I think we all agree that there is one problem with bicycles...<eos> Pedaling.<eos> We offer the perfect solution, a small, powerful gasoline engine, not much larger than a lady's foot.<eos> My associate, Bill Harley, has engineered it, improving on a European design.
Let's try it.<eos> Good.<eos> This frame is too small, so we made it bigger.<eos> - Yeah, I see.<eos> - You see? Bend it out.
What is that?<eos> Broken auto glass.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You lied when you said that you sold your engagement ring 'cause you couldn't make ends meet.<eos> You just damaged it when you climbed into your husband's car to fire his gun.
Well, check out's at 11:00 and the bike rentals are free, but they go quick.<eos> Get out.<eos> - Okay. Yeah. Thank you.<eos> Don't look back.<eos> I put the condo in your name so that Ruby couldn't get her hands on it.
Hey, I killed myself to get where I am in advertising.<eos> When I was coming up, I had to fight for every opportunity I got.<eos> And it was that fight that made me appreciate it more.<eos> I guess that's all I ever wanted for you.<eos> You think I don't appreciate this job just because you gave it to me?
Especially for Mette.<eos> I noticed she was relieved when you two came to see us.<eos> Here's Mette.<eos> I need some wine. -<eos> - And I'll get it for you.
It was my fault that you were in danger.<eos> I was just acting responsibly.<eos> And now...<eos> I am, too. I am taking responsibility for saying "no" to a date with a great guy.<eos> Unless you'd like to call it a... a "joint social endeavor," in which case, we could go on one of those?
It's got nothing to do with you.<eos> Your fight, my fight... we ride together.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> You know how to handle one of these?<eos> Bolt release is a little gritty... I'll smooth it out for you when we're done.
Where you from?<eos> I haven't seen you around.<eos> Oh, the OC.<eos> Dave runs a fishing charter in the marina.<eos> My uncle owns it. I just run it for him.
I-I couldn't get away.<eos> You weren't at the office. So don't even try. - Oh, please.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> How do you turn this thing off?<eos> I'll turn it off when it's over.
Julius Burton is officially throwing all his financial support to Sam Evans.<eos> I'm tired of worrying about what men like Burton do with their money.<eos> I'm not going to renew the Defense Cooperation Agreement with Bahrain.<eos> Instead, we're going to move toward building a new base in Tunisia.<eos> We're going to bring our military and economic support to a country that has earned it.
Okay, so what about his cell phone?<eos> You think you can crack it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Assuming he didn't institute any anti-hacking features, which would wipe it clean on any unauthorized attempt or compromise.
No. The last thing we need is someone second-guessing this.<eos> Get Callen and Sam on the horn. Yep.<eos> Where are we?<eos> We're working on it.<eos> They were stealing the cesium and sending it to other bomb makers.
They just don't trust them.<eos> Christina Farnborough, your baby-sitter.<eos> Two kids, sketchy details.<eos> Apparently, there's a diary.<eos> Now, she didn't write in it for fear her mum might see, but she starred key dates.
Look, I've been doing this time travel thing for a little while now.<eos> And if I've learned one thing, it's you never know what's gonna change history and have massive consequences.<eos> What, you think this doesn't make me angry as well?<eos> But we have a job to do.<eos> And if we don't do it, we can make things a lot worse.
Saving history can be extremely wearing on the body.<eos> I'm thinking this amulet dates back to Late Antiquity and is Judeo-Christian in origin.<eos> Great.<eos> Is... is that great?<eos> Well, I can't find a reference of it anywhere.
Capone's men are taking over the ship.<eos> We got bigger fish to fry, honey.<eos> Rex's killer?<eos> He's tossing the ship. He's looking for the amulet.<eos> It's only gonna be a matter of time before he finds it.
That guy should be the criminal poster boy for what not to do against The Flash.<eos> So what are we gonna call him?<eos> - You mean like a nickname?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Cisco does it for all of them, he's like the master of it.
I realized I don't want to be scared of that anymore.<eos> I don't think it's gonna work.<eos> What do you mean, you don't think it's gonna work?<eos> I built this to go to absolute zero.<eos> I realize that. But we need the mirror to maintain zero-point energy long enough for Barry's molecules to pass through it.
All right, get out of here.<eos> I'm gonna try to stop that thing.<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Cisco, where'd it go?<eos> Can't track it if I can't see it.
What about the message? Come to this Earth. Get a fresh start.<eos> Well, what about your résumé as a world-renowned genius scientist?<eos> That's a good point.<eos> I guess we're even.<eos> If a string is in a knot, patience will untie it.
Okay, well, if more come, then we'll stop them.<eos> But Alchemy can't get Wally if he stays in the cell.<eos> Barry, we can't just let Wally suffer in there.<eos> And besides, burying our head in the sand is not gonna make Alchemy go away.<eos> Ignoring the problem does not get rid of it.
She's--I mean, she's just being protective.<eos> Hmm. To be fair.<eos> I didn't make the best first impression.<eos> Well, I, of all people, understand that sometimes doing a job means pissing people off.<eos> It just means that you're doing it well.
And in this case, it might just get you killed.<eos> I could really use a genie right now.<eos> I would wish that my kid was already born and sleeping through the night.<eos> Bro, fatherhood has made you so damn boring.<eos> If I had a wish, I'd use it to become the top MMA fighter in the world and take home a different hot chick every single night.
- Drop it!<eos> [Donna] Easy!<eos> Everybody easy.<eos> - I told you we couldn't trust him.<eos> - I don't want to shoot, but I will if I have to, now drop it!
Served three tours under Ronald Reagan.<eos> Had a fire drill every week, but never a fire.<eos> The SCIF is my first command, and look what happens.<eos> Commander, the building that holds the SCIF, also houses a bottling facility with 30 employees.<eos> Kind of seems like an odd choice for a super-secret hideout, so why did you put it there?
Spoke with Rebecca's CO.<eos> He said she reported for work yesterday at 6:46 a.m.<eos> and didn't leave till noon, which means the arsenic was ingested while there.<eos> Go to Rebecca's office, find that poison.<eos> We connect it to the suspect-- whoever it is-- we'll bring him in.
That is from this.<eos> A coffee pod? A coffee pod.<eos> Delivered in bulk.<eos> Anyone in Rebecca's building would've had access.<eos> You just inject arsenic into the top of the pod, make sure it finds its way to the right office and then... whoever drinks it dies.
So General Matthews visited Rebecca's office the morning she died.<eos> Yeah. Which would explain how he got dosed.<eos> If she made him a cup coffee after using a poisoned pod, then traces of arsenic would've leaked into his drink.<eos> I've seen a lot of murder weapons. This one's... pretty genius.<eos> Fresh, hot coffee, any way you like it, anytime.
Not sure.<eos> But we owe it to Danielle to find out.<eos> Yeah, but we have his prints. On a scrap of packaging.<eos> Doesn't prove much yet, till Sebastian tells us what was in the package.<eos> And we need to know who delivered it.
I was able to confirm that this morning's bomb was set off by a cell phone.<eos> I even tracked the signal, but I couldn't pull any data.<eos> Phone is encrypted.<eos> Russo's second phone?<eos> Can't be sure unless we examine it.
If you turn on Figgis, this doesn't have to end badly for you.<eos> You still have that file with all the evidence against him?<eos> You mean the one you handed me?<eos> That was a good idea at the time; we all thought that.<eos> Yes, that file's in a safe place, and you're never getting it.
I don't, I know, but this isn't a big deal.<eos> It's just a little savings I put aside.<eos> We're married. We're supposed to share everything.<eos> What-- you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?<eos> I'm calling it.
This-this man that we are chasing is wearing an indestructible suit that not even your big, dumb head could penetrate.<eos> Right.<eos> You got a plan?<eos> You want to tell me what your plan is?<eos> Sure. Soon as I figure it out, you'll be the first to know.
I'm listening.<eos> You still got that truck you used to haul around the shave ice carts in?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Well, a buddy of mine needs to tow his catamaran down to the docks, and I was hoping I could borrow it.<eos> Have it back to you by morning.
He's very handsome.<eos> And you have a rabbit bracelet, too.<eos> You must really like rabbits.<eos> My mommy gave it to me.<eos> She said I should never take it off.
(grunts) If you had to.<eos> In fact, I'd like you to rank them in the order in which you'd be willing to eat them.<eos> Listen to your gut.<eos> My gut is telling me very loudly not to play this game.<eos> I guess I could cut the mold off the crabapple, wash it really well, and technically... the cockroach is edible, if I cook it...
This ring belonged to my mother.<eos> Always struck me as odd that he ever held onto it at all.<eos> I never had him pegged as the sentimental type.<eos> As it turns out, he isn't.<eos> He was just holding onto it in case he needed it.
Power looks good on you, Seyah.<eos> They want to know what the wall is for?<eos> Show them.<eos> The wall acts as a giant pacifier.<eos> When they activate it, everyone in Old Town becomes some kind of helpless, happy drone.
Request permission to withdraw.<eos> Granted.<eos> Get to<eos> The crystal will not serve you.<eos> Nor you once I take it from this accursed city.
I couldn't save her.<eos> I was as helpless then as I am now.<eos> I couldn't show her the future she wanted.<eos> True power is not something that is found by those who seek it.<eos> It is something that comes to those who deserve it.
- Maxine?<eos> I guess it's taken until today for me to... see you as a woman.<eos> Wow.<eos> So, Gary's done me a favour?<eos> I wanna make it right with you. Offer you my support, when and if you might need it.
Not getting invited to my own son's wedding is difficult to ignore.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> She didn't invite any of us.<eos> It was spur of the moment.<eos> Well, we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.
Unfortunately, our clients have stipulated that they do not wish to adopt a premature baby.<eos> It's their baby.<eos> According to the law, my clients are under no obligation to adopt this child.<eos> Wait. Then who's responsible for this baby?<eos> If the bio parents choose not to adopt, Ms. Desai is welcome to keep the child or surrender it to the state.
I want to find out who it was.<eos> It doesn't matter who it was.<eos> Someone gave you a clean box of cash so Al would pin you down in an investigation.<eos> The bell's already been rung.<eos> All you need to worry about now is us un-ringing it.
I tried to talk to her.<eos> That's where you screwed up, talking.<eos> You either go get her and make this right for good, or you leave her the hell alone.<eos> You want to intimidate someone, Antonio, take it back to the 21st.<eos> If you're just giving advice, then I can tell you. I don't want it.
All the cynicism and phoniness that's part of the game just rolls right off you.<eos> It's a very attractive quality.<eos> When it comes to building political allies, I mean.<eos> How about a run for state Senate?<eos> There's a seat opening up in the fall, and I wouldn't bring it up if I didn't think it was real.
Who's Clive?<eos> Remember the old dude from the casino?<eos> He just told me that he and your mom are dating.<eos> Yeah, he came in today complaining of chest pains, and it's 'cause his nitro patch fell off.<eos> So it must have rubbed off on your mom while they were doing it.
We gotta get her leg to the O.R., okay.<eos> Get me a gurney now. Okay.<eos> Wait, I have a backpack. - Don't worry.<eos> - No, I came in with a red backpack.<eos> The medics will bring it right in.
In your house, Chasseron.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - To take your place.<eos> There are two options.<eos> Either I give it up or you take it.
- To take your place.<eos> There are two options.<eos> Either I give it up or you take it.<eos> Let's put it another way.<eos> I'll take it but it will look like you gave it to me.
Hey, excuse me!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi. We're looking for High Trail Lake.<eos> Oh, you're... you're standing in it.<eos> Drought dried it up.
Yeah, actually, um,<eos> I was thinking of maybe changing it to be about Kyle's case, hm, um, like juvenile justice.<eos> No, Callie, you're not changing your project again!<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because you've already changed it three times!
10 to 1 that'll be their local center of gravity.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Von Clausewitz...<eos> Center of gravity is a source of strength... Could be comms, transpo, munitions.<eos> We don't just disrupt it, we destroy it, make Castillo show his face, grab him and use him to smoke out the others.
- What is this place?<eos> - Store owner Bob said they loaded his food into shipping containers.<eos> Maybe that's what it is... A warehouse, a distribution center.<eos> By the looks of all of those "Peacekeepers," I'd say you're right.<eos> Castillo's hoarding his stash and doling it out to his people as calories for their hard-earned labor.

Are you getting that signal?<eos> Uh, yes, ma'am.<eos> It's staticky as hell, but I'll get what I can.<eos> I'm recording.<eos> I'll put it through the filter as soon as they're done.
You're just as human as the rest of us.<eos> I have to hold myself to a higher standard.<eos> Shaw was right about one thing.<eos> This country has lost its moral compass.<eos> It needs someone to guide it.
I have to hold myself to a higher standard.<eos> Shaw was right about one thing.<eos> This country has lost its moral compass.<eos> It needs someone to guide it.<eos> Get it back to its core values.
I know he's your cousin, but, seriously, what is up with that guy?<eos> Always takes it too far.<eos> When we were kids, he borrowed a neighbor's dog.<eos> - Borrowed, as in stole?<eos> - Everybody was looking for it.
Uh, I'll take two.<eos> What?<eos> This is weird.<eos> Wow, this condom has a bunch of holes in it.<eos> Oh, my God, you guys, here we are all just discovering it for the very first time.
- Excuse me?<eos> - Yes? - Are you wearing my hat?<eos> - What? I don't wear hats.<eos> Do you mind giving it back to me?<eos> - The doctor put it on my head.
The regional Authorities...<eos> - It's all here.<eos> - We need the doctor's contract.<eos> You've got it.<eos> We sent it to you last week by registered mail.
- Why the rush?<eos> - Why wait?<eos> Well, Kyle's got three more dates left on his tour.<eos> He's worried he'll miss them because of the surgery.<eos> Kyle, the tremor will only continue to get worse if we don't treat it right away.
Found it.<eos> How late do you think you'll be?<eos> Wish I knew.<eos> Uh, I made some chicken earlier.<eos> I'll... I'll leave it in the fridge for you.
Cyrus!<eos> Your father just hijacked my campaign.<eos> Jake?<eos> He's forcing him onto the ticket as Frankie's running mate.<eos> I was this close to getting David Rosen the job, and now I'm giving it to the man who killed my husband.
You've got quite an entourage these days. Is everything all right?<eos> No, Allison, it's not.<eos> I asked you to get me competitive bids on all the projects that Emil Kurtz was working on.<eos> I still don't have that report.<eos> I'll have it for you in the morning.
Erkki...<eos> We found the car later, on the way over Svartsjödammen, but the car was empty.<eos> There were footsteps from the car out on the ice...<eos> If he fell into the water, the corpse would have been stuck in the lock.<eos> But we never found it.
Good.<eos> Now move away.<eos> Like that.<eos> Hanne, come.<eos> - No, don't take it.
Okay? Your dad was neck deep in this stuff.<eos> Maybe-maybe he knew it, maybe he showed it to you.<eos> But when we were talking earlier, about the gene, that triggered something, some kind of memory.<eos> Whatever it triggered is gone.<eos> If the animals have the ghost gene and so do I, why don't you just get it from our DNA?
You know, I think I should just concentrate on one thing at a time. [cell phone rings]<eos> You know, job first, sex later.<eos> Gotta go.<eos> ♪ Ash, listen to me.<eos> You're never going to have great sex if all you do is stand around watching other people have it.
Elliott was kind enough to let me borrow you.<eos> Stand here.<eos> Are you deaf?<eos> Stand here.<eos> When I give you an instruction, you follow it the first time I ask.
Just... Just half the city.<eos> L.S. is a 46-year-old male raised by an abusive mother.<eos> He states that as a child he seemed to learn everything backward.<eos> He read not only individual words backward, but entire pages.<eos> When he was forced to read a book from the beginning, he has little sense of the story until he is able to read it again from the end.
Hey, genius.<eos> What's that thing do anyway, besides fry people?<eos> That's right. You were a military engineer at Torus.<eos> So that's why it's like a weapon or something?<eos> We're taking it with us.
Let's just see how far we get before the girls get back.<eos> If we could just skip the water world.<eos> I hate the water world.<eos> "Your princess is in another castle."<eos> Look, if we don't beat it this time, then I think I gotta call it quits for the day.
So, I'm 10 minutes away from going bowling... and I don't even like bowling... but... anyway, there's a knock at the door.<eos> And I... I open it.<eos> I'm thinking it's that weird neighbor asking if his Burmese python is loose in my yard again.<eos> But, no, it's Cameron, and... she has this look on her face.<eos> I'll never forget it.
And, hey, me and Donna have this same vase.<eos> - Pier 1, right?<eos> - It's not a vase.<eos> I commissioned that from Kayako Sakaniwa, a Tokyo artist.<eos> - Hmm. - She calls it "Serenity."
Wow, I can't wait to hear this.<eos> Let me guess, you're a human trafficker.<eos> No, no, no, no, you're an assassin.<eos> I lost a lot of money in a very bad deal, okay?<eos> Back when Andre was managing it.
Let me guess, you're a human trafficker.<eos> No, no, no, no, you're an assassin.<eos> I lost a lot of money in a very bad deal, okay?<eos> Back when Andre was managing it.<eos> I tried to keep it under wraps, but he's been fucking lording it over me ever since we stole Sizzle.
I'm going to need a lot of support A real team effort.<eos> But I like working at the exchange.<eos> It's never been a question of what you may or may not like, Pat.<eos> It's always been a question of necessity.<eos> Your job at the exchange, it's no longer necessary. So...you'll no longer do it.
Okay, all right, slow us down-- h-how do I do that?<eos> Between you and the pilot Steve.<eos> are three pull levers.<eos> The furthest to the left is your throttle.<eos> Push it down to 25%.
Um, so just-- let's use mine.<eos> Doesn't my dad need his liver?<eos> You know, I didn't know this, but the liver is actually an amazing organ.<eos> It can completely regenerate.<eos> So, they're gonna take half of your father's liver and give it to Uncle Steve, and then, in time, both livers will grow to normal size.
And do me a favor, please.<eos> Try to take care of the thing.<eos> I had it for 39 years.<eos> It means a lot to me, okay?<eos> You'll probably wreck it in two weeks.
You sayin' I'm not generous that way?<eos> No, you're not generous.<eos> I've never even seen you take your wallet out of your pocket.<eos> There's no way you're giving me one of your vital organs.<eos> Oy... If this liver comes with your negative attitude, I swear to God I'm gonna cut it out myself.
-Did you hear that?<eos> -Hear what?<eos> -It's like mice in the walls.<eos> It's like a crackling.<eos> - You ought to go see that Dr. White, 'cause that sound... I'm not hearing it.
Okay, it takes about 45 minutes to kick in. - I remember.<eos> - Um, you're gonna be fine, okay?<eos> So just stay here and relax.<eos> The record will just keep going.<eos> Unless you actually stop it, the arm lifts up and goes back to the beginning and the concerto just starts again.
Mom, I have a book report due.<eos> Okay if I work on it?<eos> Well, it's 4:00 in the morning.<eos> Maybe you should get some rest.<eos> But I'll get a bad grade if I don't turn it in on time.
There won't be any ships left if we wait.<eos> Our orders are to recon the station, not go after ships. We should advise Captain Syndulla.<eos> What if the Empire detects our transmission?<eos> I was given command of this assignment.<eos> I know what the objective was and I am changing it.
We haven't been... what?<eos> ! This is Mongolia.<eos> This is Shanxi. This is Qinghai. Qinghai.<eos> We lived here, but we travelled a lot because Mom was an interpreter.<eos> If you pay 1 euro for your rifle, and then you sell it to me for 1.50 euros, how much do you earn?
This is my coat.<eos> That's my mom's.<eos> I've told you... this is my coat!<eos> That's my mom's coat!<eos> She was just wearing it.
Who drew this? -<eos> - Rembrandt.<eos> Where's the earring now? -<eos> - At the Central Lab in Göteborg I guess.<eos> We'll have them send it over.
Why?<eos> Before the Nordkoster murder? -<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's you with your brother Sverker.<eos> Nice earring, who gave it to you?
Forensics found traces of blood. They thought it belonged to the intruders.<eos> You gave a sample of DNA and as it turned out, the blood was yours.<eos> Yes.<eos> We got DNA from the stamp on the letter that was sent to Nils Wendt... by Adelita.<eos> We matched it with yours.
You must cross it on a rope.<eos> I have trained for this.<eos> You will give me the key you found, and I will retrieve the object.<eos> But you still don't know what the object is, right?<eos> Only that the Court protects it, fears it.
There's something wrong with my eyes.<eos> I'm seeing double.<eos> The Flash hit me too hard!<eos> I'm gonna sue you, saucer-head!<eos> One day, I'll own that helmet, and I'll use it as an ashtray or a candy dish.
It doesn't matter, Stefan.<eos> That stain will always be on your soul, no matter how hard you try to wash it away.<eos> So, stop fighting.<eos> It's easier that way.<eos> Maybe I do deserve it, but Damon doesn't, because I made him what he is.
Yeah, well, let's steal it back.<eos> From where?<eos> For all we know it's in the trunk of her car.<eos> It disrupts her psychic power and it hurts like hell.<eos> She won't be carrying it around with her.
The detective will be pleased.<eos> And, you know, you make it look so easy.<eos> Where did you say you stopped that van again?<eos> - Spring and College.<eos> - We found it at Hill.
Like... this, here.<eos> - Right?<eos> Which is when he attacked victim number three.<eos> But victim number three had defensive wounds that matched skin flecks under the fingernails of number four, so I'm thinking Duncan dropped the knife...<eos> Okay, number four picked it up, right?
I can't see another way to save this place.<eos> Well, then, we need to look harder, Detective.<eos> This is about more than me.<eos> I mean, do you know the history of sin in this place?<eos> It was a, an institution decades before I ran it.
- Oh, I do, do I?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Undo it.<eos> - Do you know how many kids would kill to have a recording contract with Empire?<eos> Yes, I know, because I see it every day.
You're the best. You know I got your back like bra straps, girl.<eos> Yo!<eos> - I'm-a always get you what you want. - Yeah! Yes!<eos> "I asked for bread in the name "of love and mercy, but humanity did not heed me.<eos> So now I shall take it in the name of evil."
Thank you, thank you, get out.<eos> Lucious and Anika.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Hakeem, go get that peach cobbler for me, out of the kitchen.<eos> And I got some Cold Duck to wash it down.
Looks like Scrooge McDuck lady got her rocks off by collecting Nazi crap.<eos> Yeah, guess so.<eos> Uh, according to Marv's ledger, the watch belonged to a member of Hitler's inner circle.<eos> So where is it now? I don't know.<eos> The police didn't report finding it. And I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that it's probably not out there and probably not in here.
Okay?<eos> We're not gonna save the world.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause it doesn't want to be saved.<eos> So we'll save it anyway.
It doesn't matter, Philip.<eos> It takes time to adjust to a new school.<eos> And this isn't just new for you.<eos> I mean, I've... I've never done this parenting thing before.<eos> Why are you guys doing it now?
And yes.<eos> I'll take it all.<eos> Anybody else?<eos> Oh hell, I got a garage full of stuff.<eos> You'd be doing me a huge favor by clearing it out.
What's happening?<eos> Hang on, let me put this down.<eos> Where did you get that thing?<eos> Jill's garage.<eos> She gave it to me to sell.
I know Lukas identified the killer.<eos> - What is that? - That's the Larsens' dog.<eos> He's here for shots.<eos> The case is more complicated than that.<eos> Well, why don't you explain it to me?
I would advise that you do not get in the way of us completing our primary objectives.<eos> The place is looking nice.<eos> This place will be a safe haven for others like us.<eos> Those that wake up scared and alone, all will be welcome.<eos> And we'll build it together.
Obviously, that does not leave this room.<eos> Well, it ain't pretty.<eos> 48% say they'd view the trade unfavorably.<eos> Well, that's less than 50.<eos> With 32% saying they'd view it "extremely unfavorably." Oh.
Full working order.<eos> How's that gonna help us?<eos> We drag a Nixie behind us to fool a torpedo.<eos> What's to stop us from having it trick the mines?<eos> Rig the Nixie tube to the batteries on the helo, crank up the sound generator, and tow it through the minefield ahead of us.
Splitting hairs!<eos> They killed Clara and beat me half to death.<eos> And, they were about to stake you over an ant's nest.<eos> None of this would've happened if you hadn't stolen the skull in the first place!<eos> And then we escape by the skin of our teeth, and you just go right ahead and steal it again!
One final thing.<eos> I told the family about the baby.<eos> You had no right to do that...<eos> Regina found a codicil to my will.<eos> I didn't want them hearing it from her.
It's in her room if you need it back.<eos> Thank you, Rose.<eos> Not in front of her.<eos> She'd have no idea.<eos> ANNA: The last thing we need is Regina getting wind of it.
Go on, smoke.<eos> Smoke.<eos> Most Spaniards can't read, but they know that Cortez conquered Mexico, and they know it from paintings, prints, drawings...<eos> What's this got to do with Mexico?<eos> Son, an empire was born there, and here we may be burying it.
Don't mess with a man's coffee.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> One in.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Okay, so... you don't touch it yet.
Inside is a microchip with numbers to a Cayman Island bank account worth killing over.<eos> Easy now.<eos> Clearly I don't have the watch or I wouldn't be here.<eos> Right, but you know who does.<eos> And you're gonna get it for me or I'm going to put a bullet in the redhead I saw you hugging this morning.
Who is the buyer? What does he...<eos> Who is he?<eos> His name is Kane.<eos> And he wants the jewel. Even more than he wanted that Fabergé Egg.<eos> And if I can find it first, then I can flush him out and get what I want in return.
Like, when's the last time you took out the garbage?<eos> You don't do that 'cause you're a man, you do that 'cause it's what you like to do.<eos> Yeah, I'm not complaining, but it's just what we do.<eos> I take out the garbage and then you do the laundry.<eos> Yes, I do the laundry, but I only do it because if you did it you would mix all the colors together, and you'd shrink everything in the dryer.
Who's the buyer?<eos> Who is he?<eos> He wants the jewel, even more than he wanted that Fabergé egg.<eos> That's him isn't it?<eos> If I can find it first, then I can get what I want in return.
Oh, um... what did you need when you came by the office?<eos> I need your list of gerrymander districts.<eos> We have a bug.<eos> You do?<eos> How did you get it?
You know anything about that?<eos> No.<eos> See, it's not just what they stole.<eos> All that food left is gonna be destroyed.<eos> - No one's gonna eat it.
- What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> - Your implants.<eos> Your army implants.<eos> The Mass system?<eos> They put it in your head to help you fight, and when it works, you see us as something other.
The screening shows it.<eos> Is that what you want for the next generation?<eos> Don't feel bad about doing your job.<eos> The villagers won't do it.<eos> The folks back home won't do it.
Not ordinary! But, yes, imperfect.<eos> Human!<eos> Real!<eos> What that night with Elizabeth taught me... And God knows, there should have been other ways for me to come to my senses, but my arrogance... my... idiocy... has been spectacular.<eos> All I can say is... after that night... because of it... I came to see that if you take an idealised love... and bring it down to the level of an imperfect one... it isn't the imperfect one which suffers.
Then why are we here?<eos> Agent, you and I are like the snake and the cat.<eos> If the snake has the chance, it will kill the cat.<eos> And if the cat has the chance, it will kill the snake.<eos> But there are times when they see a big rat, and they both want to eat it.
Oh, you've not seen Davus, have you?<eos> I saved him a seat in the cart.<eos> No.<eos> I suppose you'll have to go without the big bozo.<eos> You don't want it, do you?
Oh, yeah, loving that.<eos> [CHUCKLES]<eos> I'll do that again, actually, and make sure- make sure I was correct.<eos> There's hardly any understeer at all.<eos> Poke the back out and hold it there.
- It was?<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom, why do you even set it?
The Jews, the vets, the gays.<eos> They all rejected it and said it was too big for their, like, showrooms or stores.<eos> The divorce table.<eos> He had to have it.<eos> I didn't want it, I paid for it, and guess who is now literally stuck with it?
I'm gonna make a suggestion.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about you stop being such an asshole?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll put it on my to-do list right under "join the gym."
You're welcome.<eos> Okay, I want to open this show with someone being shot into a cannon.<eos> You're joking, right?<eos> Well, because, see, that's impossible.<eos> Gah! Oh. Everyone, little miss nitpick hates the show, so I'm shutting it down.
No.<eos> Why not?<eos> You're running an illegal software upgrade.<eos> It's the only way you could have gotten on board without anybody noticing.<eos> Nieman gave it to me.
You know, her cousin is in jail on a hit and run. Look...<eos> Look, all right?<eos> This dinner is really important to Maxine, so when we get to the restaurant don't talk about how expensive the menu is, and nobody's gonna split a steak to save money, and nobody is gonna order a red wine with Coke in it.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Look here, Jerrod, it's called a Calimocho and they drink it in Spain.
You think you better than the Spanish, Jerrod? Huh?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't like this special effort we're having to give this man just because he's rich.<eos> Well, of course rich people get special treatment.<eos> They earned it.
- What is it?<eos> - I... I thought I felt something.<eos> You can feel the sadness in this place.<eos> It's the residual memories.<eos> All the dark energy surrounding it.
-Did he?<eos> - I left a branch in the attic window when I planted the recorder.<eos> Prop it back once you go inside.<eos> As long as the window's propped, the alarm's offline.<eos> That window closes, and the alarm's back online till someone shuts it off.
Where have you been?<eos> I've been looking for you everywhere.<eos> Davies has some kind of scrambling device set up.<eos> You can't get anything out.<eos> Well, unless we disable it.
Rakuunantie.<eos> You're going the right way.<eos> He's just a few miles ahead of you.<eos> How did Mitch sneak a tracking chip into Jackson?<eos> He didn't. Jackson put it in himself.
What's in the box?<eos> Subject change.<eos> Suspicious, but I get it.<eos> This here is a HiSeq DNA sequencer.<eos> It's my gift to the lab... although Rosie paid for it, and he doesn't know about it.
So...<eos> We will just have the check, please.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I don't normally like risotto, but if you put it in a ball form, and-and deep fry it, I can eat, like, a thousand of them.
I mean, who knows what else?<eos> According to the Feds, he's sticking to the party line.<eos> I mean, his brother's a hapless buffoon.<eos> He has no idea why weapons are in Luka's apartment.<eos> Okay, so Luka realizes it's not his brother calling, dumps the phone, trashes it.
He hated everyone... rich people, Jews, gay people, blacks.<eos> And then he started to hit me.<eos> And make me have sex even if I didn't want to.<eos> His brother, too.<eos> They would do it together.
Let's go.<eos> Let's leave a party while it's good.<eos> Yeah, come on, guys!<eos> But what about dessert?<eos> Um, we'll have it at home.
I'm going out on my own terms!<eos> I did it.<eos> I hurt myself.<eos> Oh, do you mind if I eat my lunch here?<eos> My husband makes me a tuna-fish sandwich every day, and I usually take it out to my car since the tuna's very fragrant.
Female yarelwood.<eos> I don't want that thing biting me.<eos> Fun!<eos> That's a fun detail.<eos> So, Bullock puts a plan together and you guys follow it through.
That's a fun detail.<eos> So, Bullock puts a plan together and you guys follow it through.<eos> What is the plan exactly?<eos> It's right here.<eos> We open it at the rendezvous point.
It was, but now it's back.<eos> What?<eos> So it's not gone?<eos> You're not good?<eos> I beat it once, I'll beat it again.
August Ames. I'm sorry, I left her off the list earlier.<eos> Jerrod.<eos> Why is it such a big deal to you that I watch porn?<eos> Well, because women watch porn because they're not satisfied.<eos> Men watch it because we're monsters.
It is such a fallacy that women's sexual appetites are different than men's.<eos> This is just a classic instance of society creating double standards in order to control women.<eos> Okay, uh, Maxine, please do not make porn sound boring.<eos> I'm not gonna lie.<eos> I think it's a little weird that you watch it.

Okay, uh, Maxine, please do not make porn sound boring.<eos> I'm not gonna lie.<eos> I think it's a little weird that you watch it.<eos> Well, I think it's weird that you watch it.<eos> I think it's weird that any of us watch it.
I know what it feels like to be disrespected and misunderstood...<eos> Here, have a baguette.<eos> Take some bread, please.<eos> She is a gluten-phobe.<eos> She doesn't want it.
We have to leave by 8:30 at the latest.<eos> Do you really think I'd forget On the biggest day of my baby's life?<eos> I love you, mom.<eos> Will you hang the dress up in my closet?<eos> Actually, uh, do you mind if I wear it tonight?
So, walking.<eos> You can walk around the block, you know?<eos> In the neighborhood.<eos> It's a really nice neighborhood.<eos> You should check it out. Yeah, I know, it's totally...
- Lip, please! - Hey!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I already have one other control addict in my life.<eos> I don't need two.<eos> You steal my van, which I love, and... and you sell it, and you spend my money on all of this?
We want you to be our maid of honor. What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - Oh, you're gonna love this.<eos> You stole a ring. So what?<eos> How we acquired it is beside the point.
Did you record it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good, send that out.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, instead of tracking people who send out that signal, can you send it out as if it were you?
- Here it is.<eos> - No, that's my ring!<eos> Well, seeing as you never actually married Laverne,<eos> I am the legal heir to his possessions and fortunes, so technically it's my ring.<eos> But actually, it's Hortense's ring if she'll have it.
A child who would have mud-brown hair, very straight spine. His name would be Tiberius and he would only communicate through dance.<eos> Tiberius, handsome name.<eos> Like the proud Roman emperor who oversaw the administrative apparatus that killed Christ.<eos> Oh! I have a wonderful idea.<eos> We will take her child and raise it as our own. Mm.
- but it's like... - Oh, heads up.<eos> - II'm gonna go...<eos> Okay.<eos> April grinds the coffee?<eos> And brews it.
Zack was a total jerk, but we knew that going in.<eos> And besides, his attitude was a lot better lately.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Last few months, a red pickup would pull up an hour before dinner service.<eos> We called it the "Ninja-mobile" because it had a white throwing star on the door.
We think Drea might have witnessed DJ Lucky's murder.<eos> It's possible the killer knows it.<eos> What?<eos> First you don't tell Nolan the real reason we're there.<eos> Then you take Drea's hat from the crime scene and give it to Dex.
- I thought I was crazy.<eos> - Me too!<eos> Damon Avery didn't fall.<eos> - He was attacked. - Mm-hmm.<eos> And a few weeks ago, a girl reported an assault, but the administration brushed it off.
Patrick Spring rarely left anything of importance to chance.<eos> When Patrick had me track you down... he knew.<eos> He knew he was going to die.<eos> Do you know, I'm beginning to think he didn't hire me to prevent his murder at all.<eos> I think he hired me to solve it.
- Sweet-and-sour pork.<eos> - Pork?<eos> Yeah, pork.<eos> You know, pig?<eos> Why do people call it "pork"?
Everybody was fearful that the restaurant would get really slow.<eos> I felt like I had to prove that I was still in the game.<eos> I feel like the determination kicked in.<eos> We need to keep showing people that we're still innovating.<eos> He would sketch a dish on paper and take a photo of it and send it to us.
He'll be like, "Burnt bread purée.<eos> Make sure it's burnt.<eos> Season it with this acid, but not too acidic."<eos> We'd go back and forth on the scale of, like,<eos> "If a pickle's a five and bread's a one, how acidic do you want it?"
Almost all of it is street-food rooted.<eos> You can trace back the courses.<eos> No matter how sophisticated and crazy they are, they're all rooted in something very local, something indigenous.<eos> Gaggan completely changed what we think we know as being traditional or classical Indian food.<eos> He takes it completely in another direction.
Teresa and Simonetta?<eos> They're back, they're at home with the family.<eos> Go!<eos> I like this color here.<eos> Will you use it?
It's a psychological syndrome, in which one deranged person transmits a delusion to another, creating a shared psychosis that's stronger than one could've developed alone.<eos> The second person can help push the first over the edge, and that can result in a psychotic break.<eos> So, you really think Emma and Audrey could be suffering from this madness of two?<eos> Seeing the news and the videos they posted online, it suddenly all made sense.<eos> I believe they can't move past their trauma, so they just keep replaying it.
It's kind of amazing when you think about it.<eos> I mean, they went in with the weight of the universe on their shoulders, and they came out free and clear.<eos> Hardly.<eos> Their memories may have been wiped, but their past still exists.<eos> And the past has a way of catching up with you, whether you remember it or not.
Besides, there's no harm in keeping them in there.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Not good.<eos> I think my foot's asleep.<eos> Well, let me wake it up for you.
I couldn't risk the coppers tracing it to me.<eos> The police have to see it.<eos> Once they see those texts, they'll realize Finch killed Molly.<eos> We hand in that phone, it'll never see the light of day.<eos> We don't hand it in.
The police have to see it.<eos> Once they see those texts, they'll realize Finch killed Molly.<eos> We hand in that phone, it'll never see the light of day.<eos> We don't hand it in.<eos> We plant it on Finch and turn it on.
Because he runs this place, too.<eos> Where else do you think he finds all his girls?<eos> The man killed my best friend. And he is gonna walk around free while I go to prison for the rest of my life.<eos> The phone is in his car.<eos> The police have got to be looking for it.
I'm here to ask you one question.<eos> Are you sure it was an accident?<eos> Shh! Mommy's coming, sweet pea.<eos> You like this rattle, don't you, little one?<eos> My mother used to use it to soothe me.
No one held a gun to her head.<eos> She's just one more person looking for a check.<eos> You don't seem too concerned about finding out who stole your kidney.<eos> It's done.<eos> It's not like I'm gonna get it back.
What is that called again? - Sweat.<eos> - Right, right.<eos> Still not used to being in a human body.<eos> And what do you do with sweat?<eos> Do... do you lick it away, is that right?
- Right, right.<eos> Still not used to being in a human body.<eos> And what do you do with sweat?<eos> Do... do you lick it away, is that right?<eos> No, you dab it with a cloth.
And also, maybe don't listen to me.<eos> I would love not to listen to you.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Basically, my life's work is 3,600 pages of garbage.<eos> Even Michael couldn't understand it.
She knows that we were texting.<eos> We need to contain this.<eos> We have to find Molly's phone before someone else does.<eos> Don't worry. My guy's on it.<eos> Soon as someone turns on that phone, we find it.
Surprise.<eos> We found Molly Ryan's phone in his car this morning.<eos> - What?<eos> - He switched it on.<eos> We've had a tracker on it since the morning she died.
Sure. It'll be tomorrow.<eos> Bets take a day.<eos> How much do you need?<eos> Really?<eos> "Field of Reference" states that the speed of an object in motion is dictated in relation from where you're viewing it. Good.
In America, I was free only in battle, never free to rest,<eos> and he who finds no way to rest cannot long survive the battle.<eos> And the young, white revolutionary remains, in general, far more romantic than a black one.<eos> White people have managed to get through entire lifetimes in this euphoric state, but black people have not been so lucky.<eos> A black man who sees the world the way John Wayne, for example, sees it... would not be an eccentric patriot, but a raving maniac.
And until that moment, until the moment comes, when we, the Americans, we, the American people, are able to accept the fact that I have to accept, for example, that my ancestors are both white and black.<eos> That on that continent we are trying to forge a new identity for which we need each other, and that I am not a ward of America.<eos> I am not an object of missionary charity, I am one of the people who built the country.<eos> Until this moment, there is scarcely any hope for the American Dream,<eos> because people who are denied participation in it, by their very presence will wreck it.
Well, you'd make a good police officer, wouldn't you?<eos> You want to try it on for size?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay, well, you take the wonton criminal, and you put him up here like so.<eos> And then you take the noose, and you slip it over his head, making sure to make it nice and tight.
Now, that's interesting.<eos> What's interesting?<eos> What is that thing? It's a displacement gun.<eos> One of the few things in time and space able to kill a Shadow Kin.<eos> It hits both target and shooter, tearing the body apart, scattering to the far corners of the universe, taking the Shadow Kin with it.
The seatbelt sign is on, sir!<eos> Don't try to stop me. Please.<eos> Come on. Now.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> Every other person on this plane is gonna die today, but you, for some reason, get to live, so be humble and grateful and get your ass out of that seat before I drag it out.
- This one's the director's favorite.<eos> - Only when you're not around.<eos> - So how's my code gonna save a life?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> And don't worry. I'll destroy it as soon as I'm done.
No.<eos> I miss my little boy.<eos> # Temptation's strong... #<eos> But what about your little girl? Getting to keep her baby.<eos> Maggie said she's keeping it.
I haven't even told Brady.<eos> He doesn't seem to have time for me, much less...<eos> And I haven't heard the heartbeat.<eos> I have to go back to the doctor to check.<eos> So if I don't hear it, I-I...
Yeah we are.<eos> Yeah, what are you, crazy?<eos> That's our home.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> I figure out that I love this place, and you're taking it away?
And Carthage?<eos> Would reward you.<eos> With, uh...<eos> The riches of a republic whose wealth is beyond imagining.<eos> When you pay tribute to our honor, understand this, you are not buying it.
I do.<eos> And his name is Cumelios.<eos> The empire that will one day rule the ancient world begins as a small but ambitious republic, with designs on absolute power.<eos> Power can either be good or bad.<eos> Uh, what really matters is who is wielding that power, what motivates them and how they use it.
When you look at these, um, examples of strong leadership, it's not about them, it's about the people who they are leading.<eos> It's bigger, um, than any one of them as individuals.<eos> Mago was right.<eos> Who was I to think I could do the impossible?<eos> You won't find the courage to lead in yourself, you'll find it in the belief of those who follow you.
I'm already sharpening my own blade.<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> I know what needs to be done!<eos> Don't let revenge blind you.<eos> If I need your advice, Cathbad, I will ask for it.
You don't know what you're doing.<eos> I know what needs to be done!<eos> Don't let revenge blind you.<eos> If I need your advice, Cathbad, I will ask for it.<eos> And when you ask for it, I will tell you this...
The Iron Hill murders.<eos> The one they never found was Eddie.<eos> You guys remember "Candle Cove?"<eos> That show used to give me the worst nightmares.<eos> Katie just saw it.
After you hear the truth.<eos> Please.<eos> This is important, even more important for you than me.<eos> What is this place?<eos> The Jews built it as a nursing home before the war.
I remembered it when I was going through my withdrawal.<eos> It was something my mind pushed away to protect me.<eos> Wait, who was dragging what?<eos> A body.<eos> I don't know who was dragging it.
No one's home.<eos> I doesn't mean she's in danger, Brady.<eos> Yeah, well, let's just figure out where she is first, okay?<eos> Where's the dog?<eos> Probably took it with her.
You guys remember "Candle Cove"?<eos> That show used to give me the worst nightmares.<eos> It's back.<eos> Kids will watch it just like we did.
Mmm. Feel harder?<eos> Wouldn't it be a little better with a little support?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> -Perfect. -[chuckles]<eos> I'll get it for you.
-This is a wonderful life moment for me.<eos> -What? Comedy trio?<eos> No, I'm a solo act.<eos> No, we don't accept your stupid check, okay?<eos> Okay. We don't want it.
I like bread, I guess.<eos> You love bread.<eos> I know that about you.<eos> I like it on sandwiches... toast...<eos> Sometimes I'll just... eat it with nothing.
Hard to reach him.<eos> Your phone still works?<eos> Sometimes. [chuckles]<eos> Like, there's no signal right now, but, you know.<eos> I mostly keep it off, anyways, to save the battery.
Where is he? He's a long way away from here.<eos> - He's not here?<eos> - He's paranoid.<eos> He's afraid the Tesla tower will fry his brain.<eos> Just sends me the signal. I transmit it out.
- Shit. It's all right.<eos> It's fine.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> And here's your bullet.<eos> Will you take it, please? Do you have a towel?
- Bye.<eos> I think that went splendidly.<eos> Oh, I'm glad you had so much fun.<eos> Well, you would, too, if you removed that lumpy piece of stick from up your ass.<eos> I will, and then I will hit you over the head with it.
Why would you say that?<eos> How am I gonna get people to play this for me?<eos> It's too small for the orchestra people.<eos> Well, never underestimate the power of free pizza and beer.<eos> I'm using it to build a whole cabaret.
Program?<eos> I'm not doing a TV program.<eos> No, no, no, the music program.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I just don't call it a music program.
I'm not doing a TV program.<eos> No, no, no, the music program.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I just don't call it a music program.<eos> I call it music and the sounds that make a family.
The Shadow Kin believe that they're an evolutionary mistake.<eos> Like... a peek into the universe's dark side that it never wanted, so they were cast down here to live in our shadows and be forgotten.<eos> They're pretty pissed off about it.<eos> Yeah. I've noticed.<eos> These are here to remind them that the universe will crush them if they don't defeat it.
Baby, baby.<eos> Baby, look. Remember...<eos> Remember her eighth birthday, yeah?<eos> And that beautiful blue dress you got her.<eos> It was her favourite. She loved it.
Are you reading The Darkness of Tarynsville?<eos> Well, I just picked it up to see what all the fuss was about.<eos> - And?<eos> - I agree with all the fuss.<eos> OK, I think that Desiree knows where the amulet is, and she's gonna be the one that finally finds it.
You've got to learn to read the words between the words.<eos> Wasn't expecting to see you midday.<eos> I'm not even here.<eos> I had to pick up some fresh clothes for my date with Cassie.<eos> You've got time off for the first time in, like, forever and you're not spending it with your own son?
That's correct.<eos> Choo-choo. One more question, and, um, this is a little weird, but can we... uh, shut you down?<eos> Yes, great question.<eos> There is a kill switch in a remote sector of the neighborhood in the event that I malfunction and attempt to harm the residents.<eos> If you press it, I will be destroyed.
Eleanor, I have kids.<eos> I have three beautiful children...<eos> Tyler, Emma, and little, tiny baby Phillip.<eos> Look at Tyler.<eos> Tyler has asthma, but he is battling it like a champ.
What are you talking about?<eos> The dress you had made to celebrate the 25th year of father's rule.<eos> I have a hard time believing you've forgotten.<eos> You loved that dress.<eos> The last time I saw you wearing it was the night I was sent away from the palace the night father died.
[Ethel] Can I help you, hon?<eos> Yeah, I-I'm Deputy Moretti from the sheriff's department.<eos> Oh, did you find my Social Security check?<eos> Well, my granddaughter called you about it last week.<eos> No, ma'am. I'm sorry. - We haven't found it yet.
What does it say?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> What did you write?<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's between me and everyone who sees it.
If only I was free to move.<eos> If only.<eos> It's never pleasant to see this kind of activity, Lisa. Particularly on a cell phone that is so much nicer than the one I own.<eos> All the fighting seems to start with who sits where on the bus.<eos> You seem to have a handle on the bus problem. Why don't you tackle it?
His numbers are better than you think, and he and Jones came over from Deutsche together, so...<eos> "continuity of client relations."<eos> - Whole thing's tragic.<eos> - Did you call Campbell's?<eos> They'll pick up the body as soon as the ME releases it.
A girl will never be able to throw hard enough to compete with boys, not as they start growing.<eos> It's biology and we can't change that.<eos> That's why we need a secret weapon.<eos> End of my career, this old Latin guy showed me a pitch.<eos> Was too late for me, but you're gonna learn it now.
Some identification, sir?<eos> If you'll step out of the car...<eos> Leave the vehicle running.<eos> If you'll give me your phone, sir...<eos> You'll get it later, along with the car.
And now they will be.<eos> See?<eos> He's different.<eos> Asha, A.A. doesn't give you your one-year chip the first day you walk in there.<eos> They give it to you after you've been sober for a whole year.
So you're a lawyer now on top of being Hector?<eos> I have done you a lot of favors, Mathias.<eos> I am now asking you for one.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> Return it to its rightful owner.
I have done you a lot of favors, Mathias.<eos> I am now asking you for one.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> Return it to its rightful owner.<eos> You might want to hang on to it yourself.
Start small, something simple.<eos> Are you gonna eat those fries?<eos> Keep going.<eos> They look delicious, no?<eos> I just might help myself to the burger next unless you're gonna eat it.
Lysergic acid.<eos> Have you done it?<eos> You'd remember.<eos> One of my father's biggest sellers.<eos> He only supplies it to the military, but I have my ways.

One of my father's biggest sellers.<eos> He only supplies it to the military, but I have my ways.<eos> Our parents' generation uses it for mind control...<eos> Interrogating prisoners, for example.<eos> But we use it... as mind expansion, as you'll see.
I'm not talking about direct proceeds. I'm talking about everything we have.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, including money she earned before she ever got wrapped up in that bullshit.<eos> They can't do that.<eos> Well, they're doing it.
Excuse me?<eos> Why hasn't it come through yet?<eos> Oh, there must've been a mix-up in the paperwork.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You're holding it up because he's threatening to sue you.
I don't think you understand.<eos> I'm not doing this just to stay alive.<eos> I'm doing this so one day I can knock on my kid's door, and they'll know their father is an innocent man.<eos> If I take this deal, that's never gonna happen.<eos> If you don't take it, it may never happen either.
I only took those meetings because I'm being pressured to take those meetings.<eos> I get it.<eos> That asshole wants your job.<eos> He doesn't just want it.<eos> If I don't let you go, he's gonna get it.
Without help, you're not gonna be able get back up.<eos> Please, take my hand.<eos> I appreciate your offer more than you know, Robert.<eos> But I've had my name first for too long. I can't go back to having it last.<eos> Jessica, if you don't do this, you're not gonna have it anywhere.
Don't worry, Tina.<eos> You're with us now.<eos> And we'll never leave you, baby.<eos> But now that you mention it, I do in fact have a plan.<eos> And everybody's gonna love it because it's a vast improvement over my opponent's untenable wall nonsense.
This better not be a trap.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Welcome to Underground Seattle.<eos> When they built the new Seattle on top of the old old Seattle, they left all these catacombs underneath.<eos> It was a real cesspool of humanity till the Red Hand cleaned it out.
I'll bring it to him at our weekly brunch.<eos> What would you like for it to say?<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - I don't care what you are.<eos> You want to get a message to the warden, you go through the proper channels and get it to him yourself.
- I'm making it your problem.<eos> We get all of your business, or we handle none of it.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You quit, you lose billables you can't afford to lose.<eos> We quit, and it looks like we realized your case was a loser and wanted distance from it, which you can't afford.
I want you to convince her that this is it.<eos> She has a one-time chance of getting immunity if she turns on her father now.<eos> How the hell do you even know this Cahill guy'll do that?<eos> Because I know how bad he wants Sutter, and offering Jill a deal is the best way to make that happen.<eos> Or he promises her a deal, then takes it away.
Bye!<eos> Thanks for coming!<eos> Man, two customers!<eos> The car wash hasn't been that busy since that mud tornado 15 years ago.<eos> They called it "The mud-nado."
But as soon as you find the monster, contact me immediately.<eos> I don't want you fighting this thing alone.<eos> One more time, what are you looking for?<eos> A monster.<eos> What do you do when you find it?
Well, it looks like he was stalking her.<eos> We found a stash on his roof... women's jewelry, underwear.<eos> So it would be helpful if you could identify anything that... that may have belonged to Ashley.<eos> Did you find her engagement ring?<eos> Uh, no, we're looking for it now, though.
Tyler... he wanted a little bit bigger cut, right?<eos> So you take a baseball bat... crack him in the head with it.<eos> Damn.<eos> Hey, Officer, do you mind if I grab my wallet?<eos> I don't want you, you know, shooting me as I reach for it, so...
She was an All Star third baseman?<eos> No, man.<eos> Look, McCoy gave it to Maya, Maya gave it to me.<eos> People give me stuff all the time.<eos> I didn't want to take it, but I didn't want to offend her, so, you know, it's yours, if you want it.
She could be in one of these buildings.<eos> Get the truck started.<eos> Audrey and I will go find Monet. Fine.<eos> One quick sweep.<eos> But as soon as you hear that truck start the bad guys are gonna hear it, too.
I want to go home.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You're [bleep] crazy!<eos> She is the queen of every hive.<eos> She is the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
Our victim, slash suspect...<eos> Handler, question mark.<eos> Who's the Ghost?<eos> That is the invisible man who pulls your strings.<eos> Now, if you tell me his name, I'd put it up there, but as you aren't telling me his name, I call him "the Ghost."
You're getting hard.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I'm gonna show you my fucking dick.<eos> Hey, leave him alone!<eos> - I want them to see it!
And I felt a connection with her from the very first moment that I booked the audition.<eos> I am the queen of every hive.<eos> I am the shield over every head.<eos> I am the spear of battle!<eos> Who but I am both the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
Shit, Shit.<eos> Sidney? Sidney, are you okay?<eos> Holy shit. Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.<eos> I am the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
Those two savages are still out there.<eos> We killed people last night, Audrey.<eos> The both of us.<eos> There's a video of it on that farm.<eos> I want that tape before someone else finds it.
Okay.<eos> What's going on? - Please, come with me.<eos> - Well... It's okay.<eos> I can't get the tube in.<eos> It's like something's blocking it.
I was proud of you, and now you're just being a dick.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Nothing, Mom.<eos> I just wanted to say thanks for the check.<eos> No, I-I appreciate it, Mom. I appreciate everything.
Yeah, no big deal.<eos> Just rudimentary science.<eos> Maybe saving the day.<eos> Think of her brain as a computer that's been compromised by by bugs and glitches.<eos> If we shut it down and reboot it, then the parts of her brain that have been hyperactivated should reset back to default.
And I refuse to be kept in the dark.<eos> I want to see the book.<eos> Well, I don't have it.<eos> Joseph does, and he's not here.<eos> And you will never get it.
No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Eli, no, please! It's not finished yet!<eos> Please don't kill me!<eos> You weren't against Joseph getting the power.<eos> You just wanted it for yourself.
It's come to our attention that your associate, Mr. Holmes, is looking for a certain... object.<eos> An object which may be at the center of some sordid gangland killings.<eos> Was this object in a metal box?<eos> If you could for arrange for it to fall into our hands, we would happily pay you a finder's fee.<eos> But maybe first you could tell me what this object is and why you want it.
They would have put it in a diplomatic pouch, sent it home.<eos> So someone else wanted the Chinese to get it, but not in a way that could be traced back.<eos> Why? There's a saying in Chinese, "Wanbi guizhao."<eos> "Return the jade intact to Zhao."<eos> It means to give something back to its rightful owner. It's based on a story where the Seal was stolen, and a hero brings it home unharmed.
If you insist.<eos> do you like it?<eos> I got a moon because of...<eos> Our song. Yeah.<eos> I'm never gonna take it off.
There you are.<eos> Looks like you got what you wanted.<eos> Now we know the serum works.<eos> It wasn't the serum.<eos> Hyde destroyed it.
You and Becca are bad people.<eos> We're bad people?<eos> Your wife stabbed you.<eos> I backed into the knife.<eos> Why was she holding it directly at you, then, huh?
Make sure it's a...<eos> Squidgy one from the middle.<eos> So his phone's not broken, then?<eos> Screw Kent - you deserve the fudge brownie.<eos> Tell the kitchen we'll have it here!
For the illusion of prosperity.<eos> It makes me weep.<eos> I'll pour you a bath.<eos> Opium is the only thing people talk about in the market.<eos> The merchants are afraid you will seize it all.
I can't do that, Meredith.<eos> A friend of mine from school... she's dead.<eos> They made it look like a Smurf. It's sick.<eos> It's in your interest to make sure I'm not arrested, but if I get picked up... you sure as shit are too.<eos> We found it, Rob.
His answering machine says "You have reached Nosferatu..."<eos> Tonight's guest is Tomasz Beksinski!<eos> I'm used to a certain order.<eos> The whole day should go according to a certain schedule.<eos> If someone disrupts it, I'm liable to get really upset and find it hard to actually function.
Entertainment.<eos> - You see her?<eos> Beady eyes, pair of whiskers, long tail.<eos> The rat?<eos> I want you to catch it.
How many of these seizures have you had already?<eos> Oh, you don't understand.<eos> When things are tough at home and money's short, I eat first.<eos> Then Theo, then my dad.<eos> And I get the best mattress, even if I can't really enjoy it.
You think that Malaysia flight just disappeared?<eos> Statistically, flying is still the safest way to travel.<eos> It's a business, isn't it? They need to be held accountable.<eos> You have to trust the pilot, but... it's a leap of faith.<eos> You get on a plane without a second thought. But you have no idea who's flying it.
A fifth bullet has been found.<eos> 50% of the DNA is shared with Le Saux, our missing witness. She was his daughter.<eos> Frank was my father?<eos> I wish he'd known that about me.<eos> There was a deal, Frank called it his goldmine.
So, from now on... ..you and me, we're gonna look out for each other.<eos> Understand?<eos> Yeah, this is me.<eos> Big shipment.<eos> You haven't found it, have you?
Left quite a dent in your topside.<eos> All corn mush up in there.<eos> Enough!<eos> You've been busy, Tomas.<eos> The problem presented itself; I did not look for it.
Let's have it.<eos> And, remember, it's cricket.<eos> So arm straight. I'm still trying to picture you arguing in favor of marriage.<eos> Yes, I know. I have spoken out against it in the past.<eos> Only if you count calling it a fiendish plot to subvert human biology, independence, and happiness.
I don't believe it.<eos> Unfortunately, we don't have time to chat, Bendu.<eos> We've come for the holocron.<eos> Ah, yes, the keeper of the shadow lore.<eos> Why do you want it?
That's his point, Ezra.<eos> Well, we still need it to save our friends, Kanan.<eos> So, are you gonna give it back, or not?<eos> The object you seek is a source of imbalance between you and your teacher.<eos> If you want it, you must seek it out with him.
This might be the coolest procedure you ever do here.<eos> And here I am, worried about Barry.<eos> The patient.<eos> So what, you're gonna take all the blood out of my body<eos> - and put it in the machine?
And in no uncertain terms.<eos> Then he hung the phone up on me.<eos> Well, he doesn't get to do that.<eos> He has a constitutional obligation...<eos> Don't you get it, Alex?
- Dr. Hamza?<eos> - Go.<eos> We have an issue with the bone bank.<eos> Apparently, we're still waiting for it to be up and running.<eos> The skull flap could be unusable if we can't freeze it.
But as long as I am and one of our own is unaccounted for, we do nothing that will jeopardize their safety any further.<eos> I agreed to 12 hours.<eos> These terrorists came to our home. They killed our people.<eos> Any sacrifices we make to eradicate them from the face of the Earth are sacrifices worth making.<eos> When a snake's in your kitchen, you don't invite it to dinner, you cut off its head.
This is gonna be very different.<eos> O...kay.<eos> So Rosie knows about this favor?<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> And I'd like to keep it that way.
Are you sure?<eos> I've been ready to do this since the day I found out the truth about Clark Kent.<eos> This is who I am.<eos> I can't hide behind my camera anymore.<eos> If there's a cost, I'll pay it.
We're good, we're good.<eos> To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?<eos> I just wanted to see how you were feeling.<eos> Well, thanks to you and your Martian blood, I'm almost at 100%.<eos> I hope you don't want it back.
Suite B.<eos> That sounds familiar.<eos> I thought so.<eos> I know who has the maintenance contract.<eos> I pay you double the bill if you can get it to me as soon as you can.
unconditional love.<eos> It's right there on the other side of the door.<eos> But you keep staring through the people as if you don't deserve it.<eos> I have a sledgehammer in my pocket.<eos> I will lift it up and bring it down...
Mom, you should practice fighting my wooden post.<eos> It took four hours, but I punched all the rage out of me.<eos> Look. You're just as bad as me.<eos> Me stubborn?<eos> When Adam gets a bad grade, who storms down to school and refuses to leave until they change it?
You couldn't put your ego aside for one start?<eos> - For the All-Star Game?<eos> - There's always another start, and another, and then another since you were 12 years old.<eos> You never liked baseball.<eos> You always tied it to Pop's death.
- Marcus, check!<eos> - To see if your thumb is on your hand.<eos> Ah. I need this thumb for work and driving.<eos> Door knobs!<eos> We just need to put it in a cold, air-tight container, we'll get it to the hospital, they're reattach it.
- Promise?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Here. This should do it.<eos> Oh, come on, not the guac. It's all slimy.<eos> You're not gonna feel it.
Rufus, you're up.<eos> My knife's in the pocket. You gotta sterilize it over the lamp.<eos> Um... what?<eos> The bullet's still in there.<eos> It's just under the skin, but you gotta take it out.
It's ugly.<eos> It fires 17 bullets. You won't need the knife.<eos> I like the knife.<eos> Just take it. The Derringer is more dramatic.<eos> Now, I appreciate the weaponry you provided us, sir, but I have staked my fortune and fame on this spectacle, and I will see it through as I imagined it.
In our... hearts?<eos> The objects we hold dear.<eos> Oh, the pendant you gave her that she wears around her neck.<eos> Precisely.<eos> She said she never takes it off.
Oh, thank you, and I'm sorry I lied about it.<eos> For what it's worth, you're a great liar.<eos> Oh, that's what Amy said.<eos> So what's going on with the research project?<eos> Are they gonna let you run it?
You wouldn't be saying it at all.<eos> That's the point.<eos> These spies are from a fictional country.<eos> It's totalitarian, murderous.<eos> But we don't call it Germany.
Damn double alimony.<eos> But we're living the life, man.<eos> I haven't even told you about our holiday spreads yet.<eos> We do a decent turkey dinner on Thanksgiving.<eos> Serve it up in the gym.
No, a mallard!<eos> Where'd you get that cacao from?<eos> Clint gave me a couple grams before he left last night.<eos> I've been micro-dosing it all day.<eos> Why are you rubbing it on your gums?
Clint gave me a couple grams before he left last night.<eos> I've been micro-dosing it all day.<eos> Why are you rubbing it on your gums?<eos> Are you teething?<eos> Clint says the buzz is stronger if I take it straight.
We killed it last night, huh?<eos> Me more than you.<eos> You gonna want this or not, I got to go do my podcast.<eos> I'm interviewing myself.<eos> I know a drug deal when I see it!
It was back and bi's, right?<eos> Well, you should know, you set up my iCal.<eos> Hey, Max, did you get my text about tonight?<eos> No, we didn't get it, did we?<eos> Um, I think he just sent it to my phone since I'm the only one of us dating him.
She's kidding.<eos> Nothing's changed, right?<eos> I think there's more choking now, but it's not my thing.<eos> All right, my phone's at 23%.<eos> I'm gonna go steal a car and finish charging it.
Why squander these resources?<eos> Because I owe it to him, Helen.<eos> I think I know what this is really about.<eos> You feel guilty.<eos> This Trouvier deal, you feel like on some level you don't deserve it.
During your stay, did you discover anything that suggested an actual stranger had been in the house?<eos> We had to step over a rotting carcass to get inside.<eos> This was no Easter Bunny, Inspector.<eos> That animal had been savagely killed and left there as a warning.<eos> Who do you think left it there?
You're like a bad penny, you know?<eos> -Who are you working for now?<eos> -I'm doing a story--<eos> -I know the story.<eos> Who wants it this badly?
Here.<eos> Sit.<eos> - I don't want to sit.<eos> - All right, stand.<eos> Pace, use my bed if you want, I haven't seen it since Monday.
I mean, it's okay if your job is important to you.<eos> But-but it's not, it, God...<eos> It's... just the thing I literally spend all my time doing.<eos> This isn't a good look on me, is it?<eos> Only if you don't own it.
You called him Time Clock?<eos> That was a joke name we gave him on account of he was always talking about his job.<eos> Wait, he works? Nah.<eos> Don't know where he went to, but it wasn't a real job.<eos> Did it every single day, though.
Then someone found him.<eos> It was somebody that Dave knew.<eos> But Dave quickly realized that it wasn't a friendly visit.<eos> The man had come to take his treasure.<eos> So Dave hid it in the only place that he knew no one would ever find it.
The sun can be a bitch.<eos> As you were.<eos> Will you go put some damn clothes on?<eos> I'm dressed.<eos> Uh-uh-uh, you take your narrow butt upstairs and put something on that covers it. We're having company tonight.
I'm surprised you know what day it is, since you don't have your watch on.<eos> Oh, must've fallen off.<eos> - You know, they're really flimsy...<eos> - Uh-uh. Roger.<eos> Okay, I took it off.
You seem like a good guy.<eos> You do.<eos> I'd like to think it went down like you said: two kids talking and all.<eos> So you found the building?<eos> And we've got people going over every inch of it collecting evidence.
You had your burning bush moment; it was a sign.<eos> Sex is all about intimacy between two married people, which is why I told on your grandmother.<eos> Don't lose your way now.<eos> Sexual pleasure is not the most important thing.<eos> That's why they call it Le petit Mort... "a little death."
Keep this up and I will make you eat a sleeve of Oreos for breakfast.<eos> That's legal!<eos> I've checked.<eos> Today's my art show!<eos> Sweetie, I'm excited for you, but Daddy is working, and Daddy has this ritual, and whenever somebody interrupts it, well, then he just has to start it all over again.
Stop wearing that suit, or else.<eos> Or else what?<eos> Or else I will put you at the top of my naughty list.<eos> You know, you're not talking to a little kid anymore, so get the hell out of my face, Santa.<eos> I like this suit, and I'm keeping it.
No, but we must on our mettle.<eos> The stout man, the man in the grey hat and the sailor.<eos> Any one of these has the potential to receive the diamond.<eos> We must be ready to follow any of them.<eos> Whoever takes the jewel from Mr Luker is likely to be an intermediary and will pass it on to our thief.
'My estimate, allowing for the flaw in the stone, was £20,000.'<eos> How did you come by this?<eos> 'Tis a family heirloom.<eos> Come, Mr Ablewhite, that won't do.<eos> My cousin inherited it.
My... my head is like lead and I cannot feel my feet beneath me.<eos> When morning came, your language and conduct showed that you were absolutely ignorant of what you had said and done overnight.<eos> And yours, you were resolved to say nothing on your side.<eos> The moonstone belonged to Godfrey Ablewhite, for him to do with as he pleased.<eos> Thus I persuaded him to pawn the diamond for well below its value by threatening to tell of its theft if he took it elsewhere.
Do you wish to speak to me?<eos> Yes, if I dare.<eos> It's a strange thing about the diamond, sir.<eos> Indeed it is.<eos> They will never find it, sir, will they?
And quick.<eos> My father died much more slowly.<eos> And after a lot of years in pain.<eos> When my brother... was 25 they removed a tumor the size of a... a baseball from his lung.<eos> We thought he'd beat it.
Nope. I'm all out.<eos> But maybe you've got some, in your pantry.<eos> I do!<eos> In fact, I was planning on making a shepherd's pie later tonight.<eos> You could come by, if you like, and we could make it together?
Fastest way to get Gregorio and the FBI back to DC is to root out the cartel.<eos> And the fastest way to do that is to work together.<eos> I'm still playing catch-up here.<eos> When you guys finish a case, doesn't it get reviewed?<eos> Pride reviews it.
Capturen a Martinez-- lo quiero vivo.<eos> ¿Comprende?<eos> Me no comprende.<eos> No?<eos> Well, that was some good Spanish, but you're gonna have to habla inglés the plan so I can understand it, too.
We assumed that it was left behind in the curse, but now we think it might be lost somewhere here in Storybrooke.<eos> There has to be some, like, magical way to find it, right?<eos> There is... a spell that could point the way with a sort of beacon.<eos> But it wouldn't be visible just to us.<eos> If Gold or the queen or even Zelena saw it, they would know exactly what it was.
We'll call you when we need you.<eos> Lift your arm up.<eos> There we go.<eos> Good.<eos> Now don't let me pull it down.
No, I hate riddles.<eos> It asks you to consider whether the baggage you carry is really necessary, or if it could just be set aside, if only you'd try.<eos> That girl you stalked.<eos> Raymond showed me her file.<eos> He wanted me to see it.
You need to talk to Elvis.<eos> He's the only other person who can figure out this breach.<eos> Patton, please tell me you've tracked down Elvis.<eos> Oh, your buddy Elvis is scary good.<eos> He turns his phone on long enough to make short calls, and then he powers it down.
We can't provide you with a police escort.<eos> - I wasn't gonna ask that.<eos> - Yeah, you were.<eos> - Yeah, I was. my lunch.<eos> It's not Schmaegalman's, but take it.
Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Hey, McGee.<eos> Look who I found in the elevator.<eos> Well, I've been riding it all morning.
And they dragged me back here to find out what I knew.<eos> Huh. Where'd you get the burner phone?<eos> One of them dropped it.<eos> It took me ages to grab ahold of it, and send that text.<eos> Praying that you'd get it.
Maybe.<eos> About my mother?<eos> Definitely.<eos> Got your message. You cracked it?<eos> Uh, we cracked it.
See, you're a technician.<eos> You're an operative.<eos> An instrument of a larger plan.<eos> I, on the other hand, I'm a strategist.<eos> You whip that can at me, and I'll catch it but only because I calculated the risk that someone might throw it in advance.
Call in the order, Harold, or that countdown represents what's left of your career.<eos> I'm not sending my men in guns blazing.<eos> Sir, I think I have another way.<eos> Fire-suppression system?<eos> Yes, if you manually set it off, the safety override should automatically open the doors.
Sabine came here to get us out.<eos> We owe her.<eos> We have to try.<eos> So what's your plan?<eos> I'll tell you when I figure it out.
You all right?<eos> These can't be comfortable.<eos> Let's get those off.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll get a, uh, nurse to take a look at that cut and... we'll clean it up.
You can't do that at school?<eos> I wrote some code that doesn't run on the lab computers.<eos> Solar aircraft, for the military?<eos> It's a civilian project.<eos> Okay, then why would Chapman keep it in a secure lab?
That is cool.<eos> I'm controlling a machine with my mind.<eos> Now, can we take that one step further and control a human?<eos> My brain is sending a command down to my arm.<eos> We're gonna pick up that signal and we're gonna send it over to your arm.
Luckily, Aron fools around with lightning for a living... using a gadget called a Tesla coil.<eos> What exactly is a Tesla coil?<eos> A Tesla coil is a high frequency air-core resonant transformer.<eos> Okay, now in layman's terms.<eos> It's a system that allows us to take a low voltage and turn it into a really high voltage.
Put my hand in the right position between these lenses, and it'll become invisible.<eos> Here we go.<eos> See how my fingers have disappeared at the edge?<eos> That's because there's a cylindrical zone where the light is bent around my fingers, creating invisibility.<eos> But if an object crosses into the center of the cylinder, the light hits it and it can be seen.
So our hands are tied.<eos> One day, Bunker Hill will be established enough so that the health department trusts us enough to act immediately.<eos> But, in the meantime...<eos> James, what are you doing?<eos> Scott, I want you to know that hacking is unlawful, thoroughly immoral and Bunker Hill does not condone it under any circumstances.
Just... writing and making the world come alive.<eos> I know you've been out, mister man.<eos> No, I-I was right here the whole time.<eos> My photo cube was moved, darling.<eos> I always proudly display it with your picture facing out.
I...<eos> Wow. That is rough.<eos> It was Halloween night, and I had finished rewriting my story.<eos> How's Adam's masterpiece?<eos> - Oh, my God. You're sighing deeply because you love it!
What'd you talk about?<eos> The sale of the haulage yard, the service-term contracts...<eos> The yard's for sale?<eos> Well, yeah, I mean, what does Frank's missus want with it?<eos> What's she gonna do, turn it into a dance studio?
Don't be so impatient.<eos> How close did Bruno need to get to trigger the explosive?<eos> Well, it's a long-range transmitter, so he wasn't, like, suicidal, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> As a matter of fact, he was trying to quit smoking and that is what actually killed him.<eos> The killer spiked his nicotine patch with a cyanide analogue about 20 minutes before he put it on, according to the adhesive oxidation.
I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to...<eos> He wants to find out where the earring came from.<eos> Of course he does.<eos> Well, right now, all I can tell you is that the prior owner was a female.<eos> Okay, so do you know how long Bruno had it in his ear?
Listen.<eos> - I already listened. - Now I get to talk.<eos> I've had my heart stomped on too.<eos> And I don't have any kids, but I'm pretty good with them.<eos> And my job beats me down on a regular basis, but, like you, I love it.
- Thank you guys so much for coming.<eos> I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.<eos> - My dad died, and--<eos> - Again, when this is done, Hitchcock.<eos> Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it.
- Broccoli che visto?<eos> - It's being used.<eos> -Quantieralavitolabella ?<eos> Tuttomatrolamente?<eos> - Just bring it back when you're done. -Ah!
Especially for the tracker?<eos> - Well, yeah, because...<eos> - What's it made of?<eos> - Well, leather, I suppose.<eos> - A little leather pouch. Did you make it yourself?
Yeah, by and large, they are still made of steel and plastic, and that consumes a huge amount of energy.<eos> So we had an idea.<eos> Are there more sustainable materials that could be used instead?<eos> Well, to find out, each of us bought a Land Rover Discovery.<eos> We then removed its metal body and replaced it with whatever we thought was the best solution for the future of the planet.
Unfortunately, he turned up and tried to argue that the similarly priced Ford Focus was a better bet.<eos> Yeah, I did do that.<eos> -I responded by driving off and refusing to talk to you.<eos> A bit rudely, I thought.<eos> I'm sorry, this is my film, my tour of England, and I didn't want him spoiling it.
- Yeah, look, I've got the rods attached.<eos> - It's parked.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - That's the grill.<eos> So we hold that with the pliers from my multi-tool, cut the fish up, fillet it...
I don't like that feeling!<eos> Here he comes, ladies and gentlemen, Richard Hammond.<eos> No!<eos> I could take solace from the fact that this system has already run twice with their cars and not failed - it's been tested.<eos> Or I could take a more realistic view, which is that those two fat oafs have already weakened it.
I have an idea for one more Thanksgiving tradition before we go to bed.<eos> Come here.<eos> What is it?<eos> So we're all gonna go around and say what we're thankful for.<eos> And then whoever's turn it is, is going to pull on this yarn and then throw it to the next person.
That's what happened.<eos> Why do you push all of that away?<eos> You can't just kill the feelings like they're some creature that you're afraid of.<eos> That pain is a part of you.<eos> I can see it now.
Or you're gonna regret it.<eos> I promise.<eos> Kate, will you please help me out?<eos> No, I hate this dress! I know.<eos> I don't care that you hate it, though.
Where did she get the tape?<eos> No idea.<eos> We're gonna run with it, right?<eos> Get a forensic video expert to verify that this footage has not been altered, and get a neurologist to make sure that this woman is actually unconscious and not acting.<eos> If those two things check out we'll air it tonight.
I can still take it.<eos> I've played along in front of the recruits, but are you really gonna give up your alias?<eos> I'm taking something from them, even if they don't realize it.<eos> If I don't give them something real in return, then they'll never trust me or the agency.<eos> Besides, it's not like I'm gonna use it again.
What... she never told you about it?<eos> - What's he talking about?<eos> - I didn't write it.<eos> Well, it's complicated.<eos> You see, she's going to write it - a few years from now.
It's complicated. No.<eos> The truth is not complicated.<eos> I don't know what the truth is anymore.<eos> Okay, the truth is she didn't believe in Rittenhouse until President Nixon just confirmed it.<eos> But for now, if Rittenhouse wants this document so badly, whatever it is, I want it first.
And we're clear. Incoming.<eos> And he looks angry.<eos> I thought you said Levi didn't kill Sarah.<eos> He didn't.<eos> So I debrief you after the suicide. You don't tell me about the video, then you play it live on air.
And be sure to help yourself to one of my world famous "Apple Dora's."<eos> No thanks, I never liked them.<eos> What?<eos> That scalding hot water turned his sock into a blast furnace.<eos> When he took it off, the skin came with it.
So I get this specimen labeled "synovial fluid, left hip."<eos> And I'm looking at it, and it's not very viscous.<eos> Obviously, I'm thinking maybe it's gout, but there aren't any crystals under the microscope, just cells, so I call the intern who drew it, and he tells me he's trying to rule out cirrhosis,
No problem.<eos> I just want to get outta here.<eos> When did the pain start?<eos> About a half hour ago.<eos> I was gonna ignore it, but my neighbor, he's a nurse, and so he said I should get it checked out.
I...<eos> Chicken salad, chicken wings, chicken tenders.<eos> Don't you have anything without chicken?<eos> Dude, can you read the sign?<eos> We only do chicken, and we do it "clucking" well.
- I just found this phone on the street.<eos> - You what?<eos> I'm the delivery driver. I just found this phone.<eos> That's my friend's phone!<eos> I'll take it for him.
- What's that smell, baba?<eos> That smell?<eos> _ Okay?<eos> Every time you get that smell, you walk the other way.<eos> Well, I smell it in the hallway all the time.
Tell me the indications for an emergent traumatic liver transplant.<eos> Acute hepatic failure, portal vein thrombosis, uncontrollable hemorrhage.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And I don't remember many case studies of this procedure being successful.<eos> Which is why we're not doing it.
- Nothing.<eos> Stop.<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> You're giving me that look, and I don't like it.<eos> Mom does it, too.
- Not really.<eos> I did what was best for the patient.<eos> No, you lost your damn mind.<eos> This tissue's falling apart in my hands.<eos> We'll clamp this, and then I'm gonna secure it with a tie.
Okay.<eos> Wound-vac, please.<eos> She still taught music classes every day, yelled at us about our homework, fixed us dinner.<eos> We grew up listing to that damn cello all day, every day.<eos> She played it for hours...
You can use a scuba tank.<eos> That's not for me.<eos> It's not for me either 'cause I'm not gonna be there.<eos> I can think of a million other things I'd rather do on a Saturday than go spearfishing.<eos> You'd eat the fish if I catch it.
And it's on bedrock.<eos> So, for safety's sake, we shouldn't drive over 25 miles per hour with the reactor in the truck, but Palos Verdes is only 11 miles away, so we get there well before the truck's battery can<eos> no longer keep the cooling system operational. I got a question.<eos> This thing weighs several hundred pounds.<eos> How are we gonna get it out of here and into a truck without banging it around so much that we all get toasted?
Isn't this just gonna cause an environmental disaster in the ocean?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Every seven centimeters the reactor drops, the radioactivity of the waste falls by half.<eos> You could be swimming ten feet away from it and get no exposure.<eos> It'll be safe until the Department of Energy can pick it up over the next 24 hours.

I'm gonna put it inside so they can track our location exactly.
McGee's ring is giving him nightmares and is turning me into a... geek.<eos> Well, you're not gonna like my master plan for it.<eos> Oh, no, Bishop.<eos> You're not keeping that ring here.<eos> I am gonna keep it here.
Should I talk about Charlie Rose?<eos> No.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Well, I like his interviewing style.<eos> The way he takes one topic and really delves into it.
Your mom is so ugly, when she goes to the zoo, she needs two tickets... one to get in and one to get out.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, they're saying that she's so ugly they think she's an animal.<eos> So she needs a ticket to get out of the zoo.<eos> So, you're saying if an animal had a ticket, the zoo would just let it out?
But thanks to Triple-A, I know to be here, at the monitor tree, where I occupy myself with work until they're separated.<eos> Now, this map identifies 36 such hot spots. Hmm.<eos> You know, some world-class behaviorists, like me, might say this will drive you crazy if it hasn't already. Oh, you're one to talk.<eos> You're avoiding the Happy situation.<eos> Just because I've stopped hounding her does not mean I'm avoiding it.
After you so generously open-sourced your rocket research, my guys adapted some of your best thinking to our bird.<eos> Walt's throttle's revolutionary. That's what I thought,<eos> - but it doesn't work.<eos> - I can assure you we have empirical evidence that it does.<eos> I know that your private beach launch last Christmas was successful, but when we scaled it up to a much larger rocket, we found some instability issues.
Let's get him a chest X-ray.<eos> I wanna see his lungs.<eos> You got it.<eos> Yeah, and pull up 10 of lido.<eos> Keigan, I'm gonna numb your wrist so we can fix it, okay, bud?
Are you sure?<eos> Do you remember things in Elysian?<eos> I know grief better than almost anyone, and I can tell you one thing.<eos> You can't go around it.<eos> You can only go through it.

I know grief better than almost anyone, and I can tell you one thing.<eos> You can't go around it.<eos> You can only go through it.<eos> But you do get through it.<eos> Somehow, you get through it.
Or like, I agreed to go out with you because you were gonna lose the weight - for me.<eos> And...<eos> - and I did.<eos> I lost some of the weight.<eos> And if I gain it back, I will lose it again.
Walk away, fine sir.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> He'll have a look.<eos> I will?<eos> Dude, I know you want it, and if you don't have it here, you're gonna go home, you're gonna stuff your face and you're gonna lie to me about it.
"Sincerely"?<eos> "Dear Nick, thanks for the tattoo.<eos> "Sincerely, S and Cece."<eos> You guys hate my gift?<eos> No, we don't hate it, we love it, I see it every time I blink.
You've ruined your leg.<eos> It is like you stole our souls.<eos> You depicted my wife as a common street whore.<eos> Fine, you don't want it?<eos> You can't have it.
She needs you.<eos> You play dirty, Clarke.<eos> I always have.<eos> Look, it's slim odds you're a match, but if you are, bone marrow donation hurts like hell.<eos> You're going to feel it for months.
Otherwise, we'll take our chances with Reynolds.<eos> I will support Reynolds and I will fight the old establishment of Evans and Dalton until we get the government that we deserve!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Well, at least he finally thinks government should exist.<eos> He took it down, but not before it got thousands of hits.
No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Rufus, come on!<eos> This patch is not as strong as the rest of the ship. - If they hit it...
By the way, if you hear the voice of God, it's just Mom.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Evan, take this loaf with you!<eos> Maybe the homeless will want it!
It's just...<eos> So, base jump parachutes don't have a rip cord.<eos> Instead, they have a pilot chute.<eos> It's held around the waist.<eos> You throw it out, the wind fills this, inflates it, and that, in turn, pulls the main chute from its case.
He made face-to-face apologies, promised to pay for Arturo's kids to go to college.<eos> And did Trenchman tell you about Arturo's memoir?<eos> We know that your brother was writing a book.<eos> What did Bennett Nealy have to do with it?<eos> Arturo sold it to a big publishing house.
They used to be plastic instead of metal.<eos> You had a hood like this back then, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was regulation back in 2001... same as today.<eos> If the fire started at the deep fryer, a hood like this would've slowed it way down, maybe even put it out.
You think Vince lit the fire, let Leo take the fall?<eos> The insurance payout did have a lot of zeros after it.<eos> I found something odd.<eos> Vince didn't deposit his insurance payout.<eos> He signed it over to Powell Associates.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> We have a code black!<eos> The prophecy.<eos> Frankly, I'm surprised it's taken this long for a kid to figure it out.
I say we clean all this stuff out of here so Don and I can have a hangout and,<eos> I don't know, maybe rebuild an old motorcycle.<eos> You have got to be kidding me.<eos> You... you want me to throw out all my stuff so you and your brother can have a motorcycle fort?<eos> Well, we're not calling it that.
it triggers something.<eos> Look, Andi, I'm asking you to do this for me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Let's try and clean this place out, so you can have your dork fort.<eos> Great, but we're not calling it that, either.
This is very, very bad.<eos> That wedding dress isn't in here.<eos> Well, then, it must be at the thrift store.<eos> You're right.<eos> Okay, we got to get down there before someone else buys it.
- Yeah, we're separated, Frank.<eos> - For what, two weeks?<eos> We both know it's been a whole lot longer than that.<eos> You asked me if I believe in fate.<eos> Yeah, fate, kismet, whatever you want to call it.
Apparently, there was some youth group that was associated with the camp.<eos> They bussed in juvenile delinquents from rough neighborhoods every summer for two weeks.<eos> St. Abigail's Angels.<eos> That's promising, right?<eos> Well, the guy who ran it, he works here in the city and I got him coming in now.
Denise, I'm not questioning your judgment.<eos> On the contrary, I'm worried about you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Agent Denise, sadly, suicide is not uncommon among candidates.<eos> They do it out of shame.
Your time is up.<eos> Who's going to confess?<eos> Why do you want to make it through?<eos> I have a lot to offer the Offshore.<eos> If I have enough merit, you will see it in me.
Trust you?<eos> How, Ezequiel, when you leave during the Process only to be seen with a child in the Inland?<eos> -So, you know.<eos> -Of course I know.<eos> You ask me to switch Aline's report and you think I won't look at it first?
Is there a... problem?<eos> Technically, he's the captain's boss' boss, which means he's my boss' boss' boss, which means I'm gonna mind my own business.<eos> But thanks, now that I know you think something's wrong, I'm gonna be worrying, too.<eos> I'm gonna go spill this out.<eos> You should take down your "ice cream" before Prosky sees it.
When you called, you mentioned some kind of strange behavior.<eos> Can you tell us what you meant?<eos> It might be nothing. But I saw he was murdered.<eos> And you know what the news always says-- see something, say something.<eos> He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it in here.
Can you tell us what you meant?<eos> It might be nothing. But I saw he was murdered.<eos> And you know what the news always says-- see something, say something.<eos> He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it in here.<eos> After he'd eat, he'd take it out there to the parking lot.
Yeah.<eos> Was here.<eos> This is everything you found on the thumb drive?<eos> These messages, plus multiple drafts of Russell Cole's paper.<eos> He didn't write it by himself, he had a partner who helped.
This partner have a name?<eos> They didn't use names when they communicated, which makes sense, they were already using a dead drop to keep their partnership a secret.<eos> Here's what I don't get.<eos> You talked to someone who said that that paper was full of sloppy work.<eos> Now, we find out two people went over it with a fine-tooth comb.
No, I can't...<eos> I can't go any farther.<eos> I need to rest, light a fire.<eos> No, no.<eos> We can't do that. They'll spot it.
I don't think they can keep going.<eos> Even if they could, it wouldn't matter.<eos> Okay, so if we can't run from the cloud, then we have to neutralize it.<eos> If only we had magnesium.<eos> That would react with the carbon dioxide and turn it into oxygen.
Tim's here.<eos> I'll fill him in.<eos> I'm gonna go check on Toby.<eos> We need to rock the car out slowly.<eos> We'll send the cable down, wrap it around the frame and slowly wiggle it.
We had a deal.<eos> You said you'd help me campaign.<eos> No.<eos> I held up my end.<eos> Toby's present is done, but if you want it, you need to do what you promised.
He cannot have a knife, he's 12.<eos> I got that knife when I was younger than Ralph.<eos> He's a lot more capable than I was.<eos> Look how he handled himself today.<eos> My grandpa gave it to me.
Hell yeah, I do.<eos> You're looking for an â€œattaboy,â€ aren't you?<eos> You know, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.<eos> Do you have any idea how hard it was to track down all those pieces?<eos> Look, I know you're the kind of guy that needs positive reinforcement, and I'm the kind of girl that can't give it to you.
Just tell me why you're doing it.<eos> Why I'm doing what, Tandy?<eos> Trying to ruin this building, Lewis.<eos> Why in the hell would I even do that?<eos> Oh, it's eating you up that we moved into an office building, so now you want us all to hate it so we can move to wherever you choose.
Am I... am I gonna be okay?<eos> Well, it appears so.<eos> How much did you eat?<eos> - Uh, just a bite.<eos> - Hmm. I mean, Chef Joe didn't usually share it with us.
I found this in Harry's wallet.<eos> We should check it out.<eos> You and Tyler, eh?<eos> These lies will spread through your relationship like a disease till there is nothing left but an empty, deformed husk.<eos> I'll take that deformed husk, and I'll turn it into a beautiful butterfly.
All right, then...<eos> opening arguments.<eos> Patent infringement.<eos> Now, it sounds complicated, but this is a simple case.<eos> If you leave your truck sitting in your front yard and someone takes it away, well, whose truck is it now?

I don't want a gun, I don't get a gun.<eos> I won't get one.<eos> You don't believe in abortion.<eos> Okay, sir?<eos> Do not have an abortion. Don't, if you are against it, don't get one.
All right, we gotta remove the kidney before he bleeds out.<eos> Wait.<eos> What about autotransplantation?<eos> Find another viable arterial source, preserve the kidney.<eos> Move it to where?
I mean, maybe the best?<eos> The bad guys, they have all the help that they need, but regular people who just need help?<eos> They-they have to settle for whoever they can get and usually it's no one and...<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna give you a piece of advice and I want you to listen closely 'cause you won't hear it from your parents,
To be canny and watchful and mean, so when the bad guys come, you know just where to stick the knife, 'cause it is a fight to the death and that is the only language they understand.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> You will.<eos> Well... thank you for your time.<eos> I... really appreciate it.
You're right.<eos> Why use science when you have guessing?<eos> I've seen this before.<eos> This is a message.<eos> You don't drop a corpse like this unless you want someone to see it, am I right?
Happy?<eos> I'm not doing this to upset you.<eos> Okay, I just want us to get better.<eos> I don't wanna get better.<eos> Where did you put it?
I don't wanna get better.<eos> Where did you put it?<eos> What?<eos> The truck, Brodie, where is it?<eos> I don't know, where you left it.
I remember seeing it till I was like 15,<eos> I know my mom tried to get rid off it a bunch of times, but it always found its way back to us.<eos> Did anything weird happen to it?<eos> Well I think that's weird enough.<eos> You know I bet if I looked hard enough, I could find it again.
Well I think that's weird enough.<eos> You know I bet if I looked hard enough, I could find it again.<eos> Okay, that's creepy.<eos> It's been like what, seven years?<eos> Well maybe you can find it for the next podcast.
What's this about?<eos> Do you own a dark blue truck, white camper shell?<eos> I do.<eos> Where... where is this truck right now?<eos> I keep it at my summer cabin up in the Catskills, but haven't been up there in over two years.
- They are monsters.<eos> That's why the three of us formed a... a secret alliance to help each other cover up our... our little mistakes.<eos> Like back in December, when I hastily purchased an expensive prop for an open house.<eos> Thanks so much for hiding it. Claire would kill me.<eos> And it's only till Monday, when I can return it.
- No one calls it that!<eos> The song isn't hip and I'm tired of singing it every year.<eos> Fine. Then you go in and tell your grandfather and break his sweet heart.<eos> He lives for that Hanuka solo.<eos> If you don't sing it, you'll literally kill that poor old man.
He built them a sandbox, and He filled it with tangible and sensual delights.<eos> Delights that we could never feel or taste or experience.<eos> He created paradise, and he handed it over to a pack of primates rutting in the dirt.<eos> Well, this world was meant for us.<eos> And we're gonna take it back.
So when she comes out here, you tell me if I'm wrong.<eos> Oh, I could just tell you right now.<eos> I hope this does the trick.<eos> Guacamole is my dad's favorite.<eos> He eats it like pudding.
The universe is sending me a sign. And when the universe talks, I listen!<eos> Well, I personally don't even really believe in signs, so...<eos> What?<eos> Then you deserve to die. - Ah...<eos> - The sign was real. If I ignore it and marry Rosa anyway, I'm basically asking the universe to stomp on my balls.
Time's up, Dr. Bull. Where is Mr. Colón?<eos> Your Honor, I wonder if, at this time, we might ask for one more continuance?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> That's not the way we work up here.<eos> We set a time, and we stick by it.
Thank you, Mr. Pigden.<eos> Dr. Bull, you're up.<eos> It's interesting.<eos> So isn't it true that, the diner had an incinerator out back that was used to burn trash, and they often used lighter fluid to get those fires started?<eos> Lighter fluid was on hand. It's easy to see why Mr. Walsh used it to set the fire.
This is huge!<eos> It's almost like a human footprint.<eos> You can see the front paw, the rear paw.<eos> We are now two weeks in and it's very frustrating.<eos> I've never actually been anywhere where the animals go after your equipment and destroy it, more than here.
Just tell me.<eos> Malik kissed me. No.<eos> I was tired, my guard was down...<eos> Okay, look, you don't have to explain...<eos> I don't date guys at work, and you know that, so I need you to find that footage - and I need you to delete it.
My whole life, I have thought that this was my fault. My weight.<eos> And now you're telling me after all this time that it's not me at all, it's this stupid tumor that's making me hungry when I'm not even hungry?<eos> It's simple.<eos> I want this thing out of me.<eos> And if you can't do it, I will find another hospital - that will.
These prions stick together in clusters called Oligomeric Aggregates, which are toxic to brain cells.<eos> We've been working on a new medication called PAI 120b.<eos> It's a Prion Aggregate inhibitor.<eos> This drug sticks to these abnormal Prion proteins so they can't clump together in these toxic aggregates.<eos> We've been producing it right here in our pharmacologic sciences lab.
He's putting on his brave face, but I can tell he's avoiding his pain... both dental and mental.<eos> I think he's coping pretty well.<eos> Yeah, he's holding up better than I would be.<eos> I cry when my phone dies.<eos> You can't see it, but as his dearest friend, I can tell you he is crying out for help.
Finally, she... gets down on a knee there with me.<eos> Puts her hand on my cheek. A-and just says,<eos> "Yes."<eos> And she gives me a kiss that I will never forget.<eos> And then we look for the ring together and we find it.
And then he destroyed them after they turned on him.<eos> We just flew into Mexican airspace.<eos> Thought you'd like to know.<eos> Is it true El Toro got his nickname because when he was 8, he got trampled by a bull?<eos> The next day he went out and slaughtered it with a machete.
Like details, secrets are all just things you want to keep to yourself.<eos> Should we open that wine?<eos> Oh, we can't drink, but we do have some delicious sparkling cider.<eos> Oh, honey, did we put that on ice?<eos> Well, I-I was saving it for the second course, but what the heck, let's live dangerously, right?
Like every other married couple on the planet.<eos> Dr. Bull, you don't understand.<eos> The way that we yelled... it was...<eos> It wasn't the first time that you fought about whether or not to tell someone about Carter's condition, was it?<eos> I know this isn't easy, but neither is hiding it.
The prosecution argues that the hacked sign doesn't matter...<eos> The prosecution argues that the hacked sign doesn't matter.<eos> Because John didn't see it.<eos> Because John didn't see it.<eos> And if he had seen it, well, obviously, he would have remembered it.
And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.<eos> I do now.<eos> That's a great theory! Whoa.<eos> But the bag is missing, so...<eos> Hey, how big of a deal is it if I, um, if I never find it?
I just realized how important my duty as a police officer is to me, you know?<eos> The sacred oath I took.<eos> Your speech really inspired me.<eos> Well, it was one of my better ones.<eos> Felt really good as I was saying it.
Asked if I was trying to look gay.<eos> Oh, that is charming.<eos> So I-I guess high school hasn't changed that much, has it?<eos> Look, I want you to put this back on and wear this with pride.<eos> This was soaking wet before you threw it in there, right?
- No, literally.<eos> You complete her.<eos> You're the butt of this joke.<eos> Give me the sweater.<eos> Marjorie is smart and organized, and if you ever need hand sanitizer or a Band-Aid, she always has it on her.
Now, those people have the Colts logo lit up.<eos> - That we can do. - Yeah.<eos> Well, this is nice... everybody in the car, together.<eos> How about we play a game?<eos> We'll call it "What's new in your life?"
But...<eos> Oh, no. How's JJ gonna get around?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We filed a report.<eos> They'll either replace it or insurance will cover it.
- This is where the magic happens. - to brush up on the four B's.<eos> Basket, blower, balloon, and first up, the burner.<eos> -Okay, so this is a modern day burner.<eos> -This is current technology.<eos> Whoa! We're pulling the fuel out of the tank as a liquid, and we're vaporizing it in these coils before we shoot it through this jet ring past this pilot light.
- Fire! - Liquid fuel burner it is.<eos> -Should we light both? -No.<eos> But that's only half the story.<eos> When you're inflating a hot air balloon, you can't just blow hot air into the empty envelope?<eos> You fill it with cold air first, which we do with this purpose-built fan.
We already have agents in place to make this work.<eos> This is one of our men here.<eos> Secret Agent Benson.<eos> He simply needs to add doses of estrogen to Hitler's food.<eos> But won't his tasters pick it up?
How did he do it?<eos> Here to help me figure it out, animal psychologist Dr. Aaron Blaisdell.<eos> Tell me, was Skinner completely crazy, or was he onto something?<eos> A little bit of both.<eos> He was crazy in the sense that the idea was to put a pigeon into a missile so that it can guide it to a ship and blow it up.
-Can I open it?<eos> -Yeah, go ahead and put the jar down<eos> -on the table and then take the cap off.<eos> -Gotcha.<eos> That way I don't drop it.
It was good for postage.<eos> You'd take this to the post office, exchange for a stamp, and they can mail the letter back to you in the US.<eos> Now, Carlo realized quickly that the coupons not only could be exchanged for stamps, but they could also be sold for cash.<eos> Now, he could buy a coupon in Italy, for let's say, a dollar.<eos> He'd ship it to the United States and sell it for, say, $6.
DB searches the bag for the GPS tracker he knows will be in there.<eos> Like I said, this guy's done his homework.<eos> All right, for an amateur, he had a well-thought-out plan.<eos> I know.<eos> Tell me about it.
I don't know if it'll catch the drone, but it's going to do some damage.<eos> Seeking safety in the city's forgotten corners, it comes here, in the early evening, to roost.<eos> But a master predator is on the prowl.<eos> The creature's mortal enemy.<eos> Armed with a sticky web, she tempts it closer.
Okay, let's break it down, so we can score it.<eos> One, how long have they been annoying?<eos> The first light was installed 150 years ago in London, and it was gas-powered.<eos> I mean, how annoying could it be if there was only one?<eos> Well, a month later it exploded, injuring the policemen operating it. So, I'd say pretty annoying.
It'll be as easy to mend as a bicycle flat.<eos> Except this tire is full of crap.<eos> First, they insert and then inflate a balloon to give the colon section a realistic shape.<eos> There's something you don't see every day.<eos> Patch the hole with stem cell material, cover with dye, and hit it with the laser for 10 minutes.
Hashtag "selfie Saturday"!<eos> Brilliant.<eos> We got promised jetpacks.<eos> We got the selfie stick.<eos> So, the million dollar question, which was the original selfie stick, who invented it and when?
And that patent is 1985.<eos> That's 20 years earlier.<eos> It was the work of this guy, Hiroshi Ueda.<eos> He was a keen photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta.<eos> He invented it after he asked someone to take a photo of him outside the Louvre.
While the carbon fiber cures,<eos> Tim gives me a tour of the hardware under the hood.<eos> -I see a brushless motor.<eos> -Right. If I ran this motor on one volt, I'd have 2400 rpm out of this motor.<eos> We're gonna run it on 33 volts.
Okay.<eos> ♪ Then you presented symptoms of brain damage ♪<eos> ♪ I'm convinced that you bumped yo head ♪<eos> ♪ Let my heart slip right outta yo hand... ♪<eos> Why do you forget it every time?
I don't have any.<eos> You have two, don't you?<eos> Who says I have two missing ones?<eos> Everyone says that you have two missing ones.<eos> - I'll submit it right away.
Me!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Hey, let me look at the bracelet.<eos> Just once!<eos> - Are you going at it again?
However, if it's the same person it will be more than $6 million!<eos> Let me have it appraised at least.<eos> Hyung, do you know why I keep that bracelet?<eos> I'll return it to Cheong when she leaves.<eos> If I give it back to her now, people like you won't leave it alone.
I can do that.<eos> It's my house. I'll make whomever I want to do it.<eos> Also, you'll see a fan in the storage.<eos> It will be dusty.<eos> We won't use it until next summer.
Hey!<eos> Hey, you fucking bastard!<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> I'll give it to you.
Hey, you fucking bastard!<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> I'll give it to you.<eos> I'll give it to you.
Veronica was offered the lead part as her porn debut.<eos> The story was a spoof of the original Hollywood film Wall Street.<eos> You wanna work with me?<eos> The reason I was really interested in this deal I knew that it was pretty groundbreaking what they were doing.<eos> Even if it wasn't necessarily the best way to go about it at the time, the fact that they were doing it and that they were a mainstream brand.
Why do you think Noel was so clever at this?<eos> Speaking as an entrepreneur myself most entrepreneurs when they come up with an idea it's because they saw a market need for something that they needed.<eos> Most entrepreneurs won't just like:<eos> "People need this but I don't really want it."<eos> Most entrepreneurs when they start something they want the product that's why they are making it.
What I find more immoral is about the way they deal with reporters and journalists, misleading them into thinking that the company is something that it isn't.<eos> But that's not illegal either.<eos> Because they're a private company and they can tell people anything they want to about their business.<eos> I think Ashley Madison were brilliant at marketing they seemed to know what the papers wanted.<eos> And they would take this little seed of truth, blow it up and that was probably what made them so successful in the media.
- No. What's wrong with not playing the way the other guys do?<eos> - Coach says the way I play is primitive.<eos> - It is primitive.<eos> It has a long and rich history.<eos> - Then why does coach hate it?
Terrifying!<eos> Perfect.<eos> Rodents.<eos> I'll set a trap tomorrow.<eos> After you catch it with the trap, will you release it to the woods?
I don't know.<eos> Can you show me how to fly this thing?<eos> Okay.<eos> It's kind of complicated.<eos> Do you want me to fly it?
This is from my new signature men's line.<eos> Ooh. Check it out.<eos> Awesome.<eos> It's limited edition, so you're not gonna see a lot of men wearing that hat.<eos> Yeah, no, I can't imagine anyone would be wearing it.
No. I can just tell by the pretty hat that you have.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> This-- no.<eos> This is-- this is actually a gift from my aunt.<eos> It's also a gift for me and everyone who gets to see you wearing it.
Where exactly is here?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Uh... It's not what i was expecting.<eos> So, what is this place?<eos> Well, they built it years ago, but then they ran out of money.
Yeah. His mom worked at the library?<eos> 'Course you remember his mom.<eos> Yeah, she was nice.<eos> And she didn't own a bra.<eos> Well, if she did, she never wore it.
On this sacred day, may I call you my daughter?<eos> Did I see you speak to her on my behalf?<eos> She needs to feel loved, convince her.<eos> They haven't brought me your Royal Proclamation speech.<eos> And they won't be bringing it.
And they won't be bringing it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because that's what I decided.<eos> Do you realize the importance of this speech?<eos> And I've been preparing for it since childhood.
I sent a gown? To Kristina?<eos> Several gowns.<eos> For Kristina?<eos> 18, to be honest.<eos> Why is the countess wearing it?
Time travel makes my head hurt.<eos> Alternate timelines are not complicated.<eos> It's merely a matter of tracking possible futures using an exponential growth and decay algorithm.<eos> Right.<eos> There is a switch, and I will find it.
Grass cutter!<eos> Left, left, left.<eos> And you're having any food that you want, from chicken, cow, fruit and vegetable...<eos> Any kind of fish that you want, we got.<eos> The fisherman is bringing it from the sea.
The Essex was lost through no fault of yours.<eos> I was as much to blame for...<eos> You are not the captain.<eos> But you were born to do this job.<eos> I was just born into it.
So it was decided.<eos> We prepared the body.<eos> We removed the organs. Separated his limbs from his body and cut all the flesh from the bones.<eos> After which, we closed the body<eos> and we sewed it up as decently as we could and committed it to the sea.
Rudimentary.<eos> Elementary.<eos> It's basically a child's drawing.<eos> You know what Albert Einstein said.<eos> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
Pete, what did you do?<eos> Dad!<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Come here. I'm here for your birthday.<eos> - Think I'd miss it? Huh? Again?
This place is making me sick.<eos> - I'm not staying here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You had a car accident, Angela.<eos> - Do you remember it?
Can we just go home?<eos> Most social interactions are awkward for me and for the person.<eos> Even when I try to compliment someone, it comes out wrong.<eos> You have a very nice haircut.<eos> Did you do it yourself?
Um, I heard I was one of 121 females nationwide... but that was a While back, so by now some-<eos> Come here.<eos> He's got a scratch on his left arm.<eos> İt's nothing.<eos> I got it this morning.
You don't want the money.<eos> I will give it to, uh, Gleb's crew.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We'll take it.
Alright, are you done?<eos> - Yeah, I'm done.<eos> - OK. - I'm just tellin' ya.<eos> - And I'm hearin' ya.<eos> Sully, call me after you find the next body, 'cause you will find it.
You here?<eos> Douglas?<eos> Sully, you nearly got your head blown off.<eos> Listen, Douglas, if you're still up for it I want ya to kill this bear.<eos> Thought Beckett was gonna adopt it, or somethin'.
- She's coming out.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> And then Marzin's gonna pull up in a stolen gray van with Carolyn's DNA under his nails, and everybody wins.<eos> You can forget about the van.<eos> We're not gonna find it.
We're not gonna find it.<eos> You know what I like about you, Ray?<eos> We're not even pretending to do this right.<eos> Meet the detective who's actually in charge?<eos> We're not just crossing the line, we're burying it.
Well, you know, you can't afford it.<eos> Steven, would you mind your own fucking business, please! I'm sorry, excuse me.<eos> You mean that we have an interview, as our family, today, in two hours at the New Compass School?<eos> People wait two years for such an interview.<eos> Two years. You have it in two hours.
I don't like noodles, okay?<eos> Makes me think of worms.<eos> Surprise.<eos> My uncle took me fishing one time.<eos> He took the worm, put it in his mouth and he ate it just to fuck with me, okay?
I said it was a bad deal.<eos> - I said it over and over.<eos> - Everybody, just chill!<eos> Just... Yes, we have a problem.<eos> And, yes, I'm gonna solve it!
The trick is finding them.<eos> So everybody join hands.<eos> And we're just going to communicate with the spirits. We're not summoning.<eos> And don't move and don't break the circle.<eos> Because if there is a spirit is present, our sphere of energy would constrain it.
Now... let's have a look at your arm.<eos> Looks like the origin site is spreading.<eos> Maggie, what happened here?<eos> - She broke it.<eos> - I cut it off.
- I need a volunteer.<eos> - I just did an exorcism.<eos> Man up, Brad.<eos> No, I'm okay.<eos> I guess I'll do it then.
I was never the nice one.<eos> When I saw you die, I remembered something.<eos> About the bread.<eos> I remember... you in the rain.<eos> And I burned it on purpose. To give it to you.
Here.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - A book.<eos> - Where did you find it?
- I'm sorry.<eos> - I think she can fix it, David.<eos> - Wait. What?<eos> I've been pirating your signal.<eos> Every time you turn it on here, I can see it there.
All your TVs, your doomsday room.<eos> You were boosting the feed from that Monitor thing.<eos> - How did you do that?<eos> - No big deal.<eos> They're running so much power through it now, a ham radio could pick it up.
But it looks like a lovely place to spend your last days.<eos> David... The Monitor is acting as an antenna.<eos> It isn't just receiving tachyons.<eos> It is taking a possible future and...<eos> And amplifying it, transmitting it, like a feedback loop.
- What do we do?<eos> Nothing, I'm afraid.<eos> Don't have the tools to reset the bone.<eos> Do you have a pocket watch?<eos> Give it to me.
Thank you, good man.<eos> Why can't it move independently towards the egg in, say, a... bucket?<eos> Where does the mother fit in? Exactly!<eos> You're off educating yourself!<eos> By the time we need you, we're... sucking the fertilized egg up into a funnel and then we shuck it up your...
But your journal accounted for--<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> It was in your coat pocket when you traversed.<eos> And you've had this the whole time?<eos> I was processing it as a data set.
It does not, George.<eos> Has there ever been a British-led drone attack on a city? In a friendly country that is not a war.<eos> General?<eos> I do not believe so, no.<eos> Then how can we sanction it?
Hey, how come I don't know you?<eos> Big world. Why would you?<eos> Big wave rider like you?<eos> I watch YouTube. I just never seen you.<eos> A tree falls in the forest, no one puts it on YouTube, did it ever really happen?
Maybe he will be better adjusted to this kind of world that you're trying to portray.<eos> The big difference, when he grows up... In fact, if we wanted to wait till the year 2001... He will have in his own house not a computer as big as this, but at least a console through which he can talk to his friendly local computer and get all the information he needs for his everyday life,<eos> like his bank statements, his theater reservations, all the information you need in the course of living in a complex modern society.<eos> This will be in a compact form in his own house.<eos> He'll have a television screen, like these here, and a keyboard. And he'll talk to the computer and get information from it. And he'll take it as much for granted as we take the telephone.
My name?<eos> Yeah. I realized i was kinda having fun not knowing, but now I think it's more weird than adorable.<eos> Is it hot in here?<eos> I don't really like my name.<eos> I just kind of-- i kinda hate it, and it makes me angry.
We're not walking.<eos> We're taking the Train of Thought!<eos> The train, of course!<eos> That is so much faster!<eos> But how do we catch it?
I suppose it's not as nice as the libraries you're used to, but...<eos> - It's marvelous.<eos> - It's wonderful.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> That means she likes it.
We took it out of a torpedo a while back.<eos> A good Belter never throws anything away.<eos> So we'll carry it out onto the hull until we get close to the cargo bay.<eos> And then I'll pull the shielding, and you'll throw it out away from the ship.<eos> And hopefully, if you're right, that creature will go after it.
So here... we... go.<eos> Joe?<eos> I didn't know he could draw.<eos> Well, that's the thing. Anybody can actually draw. It's just that some have more developed visual cortex and manual ability, as you know.<eos> And right now, these magnets are taking that part of his brain and lighting' it up.
- I think we've found the twine that was used to tie up Trish Winterman.<eos> - Stop the car.<eos> - No. Will you stop the bloody car!<eos> It's just stuff that got left in the cab.<eos> Why are you keeping it?
- Stop the car.<eos> - No. Will you stop the bloody car!<eos> It's just stuff that got left in the cab.<eos> Why are you keeping it?<eos> Why aren't you giving it back?
The prophet Abraham and the one who done ordered that sacrifice.<eos> The Captain spoke of the conspiracy of the slave power.<eos> He shared my disdain for abolitionists who are unable to take direct action against it.<eos> that dust that wouldn't settle... he had it, too.<eos> Except he had a name for it.
But signal strength triangulation places Michael's mobile phone in the vicinity of his grandmother's nursing home and not the abduction of Hana Reznikova. Right.<eos> Well, we all know how this works.<eos> There's a chain of evidence, it starts with the investigating team, goes on to the Senior Investigating Officer, who presents it to the Crown Prosecutor.<eos> The Prosecutor can only consider the evidence put in front of her.<eos> What we don't know is how Huntley presented it all when she
Play nice.<eos> Hap, go fix you a plate.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I was just reminding Leonard of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.<eos> You familiar with it? Hap is very familiar with them ol' Baptist queer allegories, ain't you, Hap?
But I wasn't that mad, you know?<eos> He was always throwing up and falling off of things.<eos> I wasn't that mad 'cause... he wore a suit and tie.<eos> I don't know where it came from.<eos> Lord knows I never saw it again after, but, um... that day... he wore a suit and tie... for me.
So you want me to review it.<eos> Would you?<eos> I'm not saying I've got fucking dyscalculia, but if I'm gonna put my ass on the chopping block, I want to make sure I'm not missing something.<eos> Send the report over.<eos> I'll take a look at it.
I'm just a big, fat, no-talent loser.<eos> Even your magic pills couldn't help.<eos> - What magic pills?<eos> - The ones in your purse.<eos> I filled it with other pills so I wouldn't get in trouble.
[tense music]<eos> Oh, I see. In your eyes, I'm always gonna be a... criminal.<eos> ♪ ♪ This is fascinating.<eos> Apparently the spear will glow in the presence of divine blood.<eos> Yeah, and it also revealed the message when Mick lit it on fire.
It feeds on light but it homes in on sound.<eos> So what's going to happen?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Bit of noise, lure the beast here, Drive it back through the gate.<eos> But how do we keep it there?
Hey, you want to talk to Liz?<eos> - No. No, no. I...<eos> - I'm gonna go get some cake from the back.<eos> Why?<eos> They bring it to us.
All right, you guys have fun.<eos> I'm gonna go play host.<eos> What's up?<eos> What happened to your tuxedo?<eos> Ah, man, I felt a little self-conscious in it, so I, uh, took the shirt and jacket and I hid it under the bathroom sink.
Is this the standard speech to delinquents?<eos> - I'm just talking to you, Sam.<eos> - Yeah, because you fancy my mum.<eos> Because I don't want my daughter mixing with a thief.<eos> That chain you gave Chrissy, you stole it, didn't you?
Ford always knew where to put the camera.<eos> [man] Suddenly, from behind the clouds, the Japs attack!<eos> [airplanes humming loudly] [gunfire]<eos> His response is purely cinematic.<eos> At that moment, reality comes to him, and he moves to meet it. [humming, explosion]
Threading together the available pathology and forensics,<eos> Niall Swift met his killer on Carn Mhor.<eos> His wrists were bound with a rope similar to this.<eos> Who stocks it locally?<eos> Do they remember anyone buying it?
Uncle Leo!<eos> Peter,<eos> - Gotcha!<eos> Be careful.<eos> The gun thing makes me crazy, but Peter and his friends seem to be loving it.
When he saw what we were spending, he said,<eos> "Your little vanity project "is going to bankrupt the federal government."<eos> People need their history. It gives them strength.<eos> They need to know that real men actually lived here.<eos> Not ghosts and storybook legends, people who faced adversity and overcame it.
What's going on here, Mr. Day?<eos> She threw a lit cigarette next to the gas pump I was standing at.<eos> I put it out.<eos> Is that how people usually put out cigarettes, on someone's car window?<eos> I know guys put it out in their mouth.
Just look. That's all I ask.<eos> I can't imagine living up here.<eos> Like a bird in a nest.<eos> Look.<eos> Hot water, whenever you need it.
The lab is sealed.<eos> - There must be some way in.<eos> - We have to go!<eos> We have to leave now!<eos> Tell me how to get that bomb and shut it off or I'll batter you to death right here!
Do you understand?<eos> I know, but we can't ignore this, it's big.<eos> It's a blogger.<eos> Not just any blogger, a celebrity blogger, and one who claims to have proof.<eos> Look, what if he's picked up on all the exposure threats from last year and somehow pieced it together?
They're here because they want a glimpse of who they could be.<eos> Billy!<eos> Let's go.<eos> The only thing your story tells me, Mr. Sizemore, is who you are.<eos> Well, isn't there anything you like about it?
Nurse Mary.<eos> Private Starks.<eos> The boy came with the post.<eos> Um, I can't... Make out the words.<eos> Would you like me to read it?
Dying for her beliefs and her God, true to herself no matter the darkness that gathered 'round her.<eos> It's said she sang on the pyre as she died.<eos> A tragic end.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> She heard a voice and believed it.
We know Ellie Connock framed Tommy for the fish market fire.<eos> And we think your Jack went along with it.<eos> No...<eos> No, you're off your head, no.<eos> Anyway, we believe they used your boat to dispose of Tommy's body and then torched it to cover their tracks.
I guess it wasn't a dream.<eos> Crickets.<eos> Well, there goes my deposit.<eos> And my pizza.<eos> And I'm going to put it right in the ready grill.
I assume this is about the opportunity<eos> Donna brought you. It'd be an opportunity if the numbers added up, Jim, but they don't.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought you were the type of man that was willing to take risks.<eos> I am... but not if it puts people I care about in jeopardy, which is why I'm here to tell you that when Donna offers you her 401(k), you're gonna tell her you don't need it anymore.
What criminal activity?<eos> This crate was delivered to his trailer. I took the photo<eos> - this morning.<eos> - Could be anything.<eos> Then why are his colleagues guarding it with guns?
- Screw the courts.<eos> Why can't we just leak it to the press or something?<eos> - Show people what the man's been up to.<eos> - The warden was smart. He's not in any of these pictures, and we can't even prove that he took 'em.<eos> Now, we leak it, it just gives him a chance to cover his tracks.
The only way out is through that front gate.<eos> Well, can't we just leave it where it is, under the tarpaulin?<eos> But what if the police come back?<eos> What if they look around?<eos> I don't know, set it on fire?
No.<eos> There are no surprises waiting for them.<eos> I promise.<eos> For what it's worth, I believe you.<eos> It would be pretty ironic if the evidence to clear Josh was in this house, but one of Susan's bombs blew it up.
It's a meeting to discuss your family, Majesty.<eos> I felt it best that we formulate recommendations<eos> - before involving you.<eos> - Good.<eos> I want to discuss my family as well and what you have done to it.
Well, there is a method in my book I've explored, but it's a long shot.<eos> We need to calm him, bring him back around.<eos> I have conducted several experiments that demonstrate that classical music can draw a patient with this kind of psychiatric collapse back into cogency.<eos> It might just be enough for a confession.<eos> What do you need for it?
Not a chance.<eos> Why you say that?<eos> 'Cause it was one of our patrol cars that hit him.<eos> One of ours?<eos> Luana just ran right in front of it.
I need to find a shoebox.<eos> - Our missing Gail?<eos> The one without any friends?<eos> Turns out she's a Lonely Hearts girl, kept all her letters in a shoebox. - That's... that's great.<eos> - Which were delivered to Missing Persons upstairs who now can't find it.
You? You stay exactly where you are.<eos> - And what is this about?<eos> - She got a hold of smallpox.<eos> She took it from the lab.<eos> You're so protective of this town, that you don't want anything to happen to it? Fine.
Who's unaccounted for?<eos> Dan Curnow, Ted Carkeek.<eos> We don't stop until they're found.<eos> Forgive my intrusion.<eos> I thought to bring you the news before you heard it elsewhere.
You know what I mean?<eos> That's the most confusing thing I've ever heard you say.<eos> Morning.<eos> Dutch analysis on the full human genome of George and Ash's killer finally came through.<eos> Would you like me to take you through it?
This looks more like a squad room than a home.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Jane, you need a break.<eos> I mean, a home is a refuge... a place where you're supposed - to get away from your problems.<eos> - Till some psycho burns it down.
I thought it was time we talked.<eos> Go for it.<eos> Well, I've been thinking, I've taken time to heal from what you put me and our family through, and I'm ready to start the process of taking you back.<eos> Listen, Brooke, I've had a lot of time to think too.<eos> At Burning Man, we all wrote down our regrets with quills on scraps of parchment and put them in a house made of twigs and set it on fire.
- No. I just... I can't find the right job.<eos> My only friend stopped talking to me.<eos> "Only"?<eos> What's all of this?<eos> My dad's stuff from storage. After he died, the department boxed up his desk and sent it to us.
$28.<eos> Do you have anything else?<eos> No, that's the only soup we offer.<eos> - No, that sounds really good.<eos> - It's so good. - You're gonna love it.
If he's stopped, he's stopped.<eos> Let's not argue with Mr. Stabby Fingers right now.<eos> Keep searching for the door.<eos> Look for irregularities.<eos> If Cassandra was here, she'd spot it.
We're the best thing that's ever happened to them.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I think we got everything you wanted.<eos> Yeah, except for the popcorn that comes in a Danny Wheeler collectible tub.<eos> I dropped it by accident, and then kicked it all over the lobby.
Well, if I'm so boring, how come I have a lead?<eos> Come take a look at this.<eos> This is security footage from the day the backpack went missing.<eos> 11:00 a.m., the bag's over a chair.<eos> Now let's fast forward and see what happened to it.
I don't know where to start.<eos> Start with the hydrangeas.<eos> And for the record... no.<eos> It's not my life's plan to be watering these things... feed them bone meal so they stay blue.<eos> She loves it, so...
Especially with an American citizen involved.<eos> Do I have permission, Minister?<eos> Given the situation, that it is a change of mission. That it is now a missile attack on a British subject. Two British subjects, and an American citizen, in addition, in a friendly country.<eos> Minister, you have heard the arguments, he has not.<eos> And the rules of engagement means that the Prime Minister has already approved it.
And I'm appealing to your sense of humanity right now.<eos> There is a maniac trying to kill me.<eos> And I'm asking you to be the bigger car and help me out.<eos> I'm just a guy looking at a car<eos> and asking it to love me.
- Aunt Alice has to leave now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Still waiting on that updated guest list.<eos> - I'm working on it.<eos> You could have told me that you read it, that you liked it.
Thank you, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Often, when I stand before the film community, there's an elephant in the room.<eos> Me. And I thought I would address that.<eos> The blacklist was a time of evil.<eos> And no one who survived it came through untouched by evil.
Not necessarily.<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> The navy hasn't made its case yet.<eos> The navy isn't going to make a case.<eos> The navy will do whatever Parliament tells it to do.
I'm going to roll you now, Mr Mills.<eos> I'm sorry, I know it's uncomfortable for you.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> It's looking very much better.<eos> I'm going to seal it with the egg white.
What?<eos> What Pettigrew found beneath the ice?<eos> His buried treasure?<eos> I know what GPR data looks like.<eos> We use it to find stuff all the time.
And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well.<eos> They never truly recovered.<eos> "The Dance of Dragons."<eos> Why is that a dance?<eos> It's just what they call it.
Previously on "Nashville"...<eos> The energy, the connection, I know you felt it, too.
Thank you for this, Mr. Hubble.<eos> Such invaluable research for my latest novel.<eos> My pleasure, Lady Felicia.<eos> The Beresford collection is the only private museum to own a complete set of 12th dynasty embalming tools.<eos> Did Father Brown tell you the name of it?
'Being awake was such a relief.<eos> 'But it got harder to forget the dreams.<eos> 'And finally... the night came.<eos> 'And they carried her out to the stake.<eos> 'And as the skin started to blister and crack 'and the smell of it filled her nostrils... '..she knew it was the other life that was the dream.'
I'm gonna prove to him that I'm the best grandma ever.<eos> "Grandma," "gam-gam," "bubble" --<eos> Didn't matter what she went by.<eos> My mom was determined to be the best.<eos> She changed the toy. She fed it.
I only lie when someone's safety is at risk.<eos> Or if a juvenile aged eight years or younger asks about Santa Claus.<eos> In which case...<eos> I feed them some reassuring pap about the logical impossibility of proving a negative.<eos> It's sentimental drivel, but they eat it up.
It was too dark to see.<eos> It was black.<eos> It was always black in the hole.<eos> I know it was small... 4'9" on the east and west walls, 6'" north and south.<eos> I measured it every day.
Yes, what?<eos> Yes, Agent Keen was on that ship, the Phoenix, as part of the official duties of our task force.<eos> You're walking down a very dangerous road here, Director.<eos> You understand that if you perjure yourself...<eos> You asked me a question, and I answered it.
- Welcome.<eos> I got something else.<eos> - We have ourselves a murder weapon.<eos> - Any prints? Yup.<eos> I ran it through AFIS, and nothing, which normally would make me want to say, like, five bad words in a row, but I was pulled out of the darkness by this frame.
- They're not ghosts!<eos> ...have been trying to kill you, why haven't you abandoned the base?<eos> That was my call.<eos> We have 1 trillion worth of mining equipment here.<eos> We're not just going to abandon it...
"it produces? Let's put it on a rolling road and weigh it."<eos> Why don't they just make the figures up?<eos> That's what the Italians always do.<eos> They do!<eos> Right, once Alfa finally give us the convertible version of this, let's get it together with the Mazda and we'll sort out which is best.
If .<eos> Go to Lake Pub. Do not tell Pierre.<eos> Warn Yang, go find your daughter<eos> Then quickly leave the city.<eos> When you are in front of it,
I can barely make scrambled eggs.<eos> What am I going to cook for nine people?<eos> Tex-Mex Lasagna.<eos> Okay, I have no idea what that is, but it sounds amazing.<eos> It's super simple. 20 minutes prep time, pop it in the oven.
Who's hungry? Have you guys had lunch?<eos> I've got a cow in the deep freeze.<eos> - Charming.<eos> - Is it one of yours?<eos> - Yeah, shot it in the back paddock. - Wow.
So, I've been thinking, and talking to Peggy.<eos> I think that we should send our information to the agency, and if she still wants to meet with us, then we'll just take it from there.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> I'm just relieved, I guess.<eos> I sent it in a few days ago.
Cleveland's tryin' to frame me.<eos> He's got my miniature portraits of cool guys.<eos> Peter, those are baseball cards.<eos> Whatever.<eos> He's using it to frame me for murder!
Remember I told you that?<eos> Every room reverts to its original condition.<eos> Logically, the teleporter should do the same.<eos> "Teleporter" -- fancy word.<eos> Just like 3D printers, really, except they break down living matter and information, and transmit it.
How was the first day?<eos> It was awesome.<eos> I attended all my classes in the proper order.<eos> And at the afternoon pep rally, I got to go, "'8th grade.' say it a little louder now. '8th grade!<eos> and I didn't think the pizza bag could get any better, but strapping it to aunt Edie's oxygen cart has kicked it up to a whole new level of portability.
Freedom of the press, officer.<eos> It's detective.<eos> How about a little decency?<eos> That kid's got a family.<eos> I'm not instagramming it.
Unless it's with your car.<eos> Oh, I'm going to an invitation-only sale at one of my favorite boutiques tomorrow.<eos> - You wanna be my plus one? - Aw.<eos> I can't remember the last time I was plus one'd.<eos> - That sale won't know what hit it. - Mmm.
So, you know what?<eos> I won't shred this check you gave me, and we'll just... this check was for a new car.<eos> - That car is used.<eos> - Yeah, by you.<eos> We don't know what's happened to it in the last five minutes. Mm-hmm.
That's me.<eos> Okay, looks like Clark wants to dance.<eos> We want to take your car for a test-drive.<eos> But you just drove it here.<eos> Well, that was when it was a new car. We don't know what's happened to it in the last... six minutes.
I told you I come with a lot of baggage.<eos> Yeah, I thought, like, emotional baggage.<eos> What is it?<eos> My life's work, everything I've ever recorded.<eos> I like to keep it close by in case I need to reference it.
All wanted in connection to illicit arms dealing.<eos> Four containers at 48 feet.<eos> That's a hell of a lot of guns.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyone going after that much firepower is either gonna sell it...
The police doesn't know what to do with it... and I am not getting any help from ROC.<eos> Help me out... and the battery is yours.<eos> That kernel is burnt.<eos> That unit was shot.<eos> The cop who shot it, swears it was repairing itself.
-Please.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> So Christine, how do you like your new home?<eos> She says she likes it very much indeed!
You said she tried to cut you?<eos> No, she tried to eat me!<eos> Eat you?<eos> Like, like the pictures in the Weeping Book.<eos> And then I grabbed the verbena plant and I burned her face with it.
I didn't mean to disrespect you.<eos> All right, there's... There's just a lot going on, and I...<eos> And I can't tell you about it.<eos> That's okay. I believe you.<eos> I really hope you figure it out.

You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don't think this thing's gonna go off the rails?<eos> Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question...<eos> your own goddamn work.<eos> Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn't run, I wouldn't burn it forever.<eos> "You evil piece of shit!" Just light it on fire.
What is all this stuff?<eos> It weighs a tonne.<eos> End of term presents from the kids,<eos> ~ mainly candles and World's Best Teacher mugs. ~ Can't we dump it?<eos> ~ No, what if somebody found it?
- Yes. - 'Cause you know.<eos> It's the 28-135 p-class ultrasonic.<eos> That's right.<eos> You... you know the deal.<eos> I'm well aware of its rarity and its cost and of what salt water could do to it.
Right.<eos> These aren't normal Hydra attack patterns.<eos> Ugh, what is this stuff?<eos> Totally gonna stain.<eos> Never seen it before.
I am not real!<eos> You are not real!<eos> Have I answered your questions And provided good customer service?<eos> This call may be recorded!<eos> You're getting it now!
I fixed it.<eos> Bonnie and I came here every day.<eos> It as the closest thing I had to a picture of you, and I needed every reminder I could get.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I used to have so many good memories of this house, and after just one bad one, I burned it down.
Listen up.<eos> This is a real small room.<eos> If you start getting on each other's nerves, do what I do with my babies:<eos> Go to separate corners.<eos> We call it "alone zones."
Do you remember it?<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Yeol Moo.<eos> Give me the bag.<eos> I can hold onto it and give it back to you.
Back then, I...<eos> I was on my way to throw away Han Byul's things.<eos> We were packing to move, and then I saw my mom packing my brother's things.<eos> I was determined to throw it out.<eos> So I took it and ran out.
Good.<eos> Come on, I'll show you the main set.<eos> Oh!<eos> What's that smell?<eos> Ugh. They don't call it the bowels of a building for nothing, huh?
Ta-da!<eos> Is it inside that box?<eos> No.<eos> That's the ship.<eos> The boxy shape keeps it from going too fast.
The past and the future twist into a noose.<eos> I endure eternity as if nothingness.<eos> I lose the sense of it all it's all out of joint, so it seems.<eos> Everything is knotting...<eos> Present existence seems real with consciousness resisting it.
Watch out. There's a camera right there.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, so after they're done upstairs we drop it in here, it piles up until it's full.<eos> Half the time the drivers don't even bring it upstairs first.
It's just a wildly inspiring tool, really.<eos> I like to record it in analog at the highest level and listen to it that way.<eos> But that's not what's happening on the street.<eos> That's not where our audience is.<eos> You want them to live their lives the way they want to live it.
- What kind of a car is this?<eos> - A BMW.<eos> - That's German.<eos> Would you like a Tune, Martin?<eos> If I hum it, will you play it?
We got caught doing a bunch of stuff.<eos> Or not doing a bunch of stuff.<eos> Okay, Manny is going to be here soon, so let's go over the plan.<eos> When we hear him coming, we turn off the light.<eos> Then when he comes in and turns it on, we all scream "surprise!"
Wow.<eos> Wanna see wow?<eos> EMG's picking up myoelectric feedback.<eos> Your brain's talking to it.
Great news.<eos> Chloe's gonna be fine.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> The surgery took a little longer than expected.<eos> There were some complications, but Chloe came through it like a trooper.
You must make your heart still.<eos> But the crown, like everything, has its price.<eos> I only hope you're ready for it.<eos> Your Grace?<eos> I think you're gonna like it.
Like a trophy? Prove you're badass, pulled off the feat of the century?<eos> No, it was more practical than that.<eos> I couldn't leave it in the plane, couldn't throw it out. Someone would have found it.<eos> So you put it in a bag and then gave that bag to Arlo?<eos> He said he'd burn it.
Castle's not gonna die.<eos> We're not dealing with an evil spirit. We're dealing with a guy who has a return address. Uh-huh.<eos> Why does everybody keep asking about box 1135?<eos> Wait.<eos> Who else has been asking about it?
Mm, what's the occasion?<eos> Did you throw down that credit card?<eos> Yes, but I'm afraid...<eos> We'd like two steaks, all the trimmings.<eos> Put it on this guy's tab.
Do you get it, children ?<eos> Go to hell, Peppino !<eos> You talk bullshit like all fishermen !<eos> Your story is more fake than the tobacconist's boobs !<eos> Firstly, leave Rosa's boobs out of it.
Dad.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> We were just making some dinner. Surprised to see you.<eos> Yeah, well, Maddie left her soccer gear in the car.<eos> I figured she'd need it for her game tomorrow.
He was buying up all the pay phones in Manhattan, but they stopped him.<eos> I don't know about you, but I don't really want to see what happens when an evil multinational becomes omniscient.<eos> But why you would leave it so vulnerable?<eos> You made the machine to protect everybody.<eos> What did you do to it that it can't protect itself?
That's the junction box, Harold.<eos> I'll take it over there, please.<eos> Careful what you wish for, Ms. Groves.<eos> This communion that you're seeking, it may not be what you think. This isn't about me.<eos> It's about saving the machine, not just from Decima, but from what you did to it.
Yes, sir.<eos> Miriam denied it.<eos> Probably ashamed, sir.<eos> I was searching her to see if she had any bobbin waste about her.<eos> Some of them hide it up their skirts.
No one wants to talk about it. So how do we ever educate anyone about this epidemic?<eos> You know, Obama has semen ants.<eos> He rarely talks about it, but he's got 'em.<eos> Are you gonna try and Google it?<eos> Yeah, you won't find it on the normal Internet, but it's all over the deep Web.
I'll be! On you next time.<eos> All right.<eos> A single-yolk mooncake?<eos> The government banned them long ago. How did you manage to get it?<eos> Social Welfare has to give it to many people.
He had to quit the coppers because his contracting business was so successful, then Tammany noticed, and all these things, one after the other.<eos> But he started with a dirt floor, knowing only he wanted more than dirt.<eos> Here's the truth:<eos> Greatness starts with... everyday boring stuff.<eos> It's how you approach it that matters.
And dad was disabled, so I was worried about him.<eos> Dad.<eos> I got this.<eos> So Sean put the box up into the loft area.<eos> We didn't want anybody stumbling onto it and being able to get in and take my guns.
Mr Cameron has decided there should be a ban on internet pornography.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> That means we will no longer be able to look at pictures like this.<eos> Wait a minute, is this wise? !<eos> He hasn't banned it yet.
I don't drink... not because I don't want to but because I can't.<eos> It wrecked my life, it destroyed my relationships, and I'm still picking up the pieces, but if you want a glass of wine, you go right ahead.<eos> Won't bother me at all. I'm his sister.<eos> So once I finally quit drinking, I had all these feelings come up, and I didn't know how to deal with them, so I started eating.<eos> Every night after work I'd come home, I'd take a bag of salt-and-vinegar potato chips, I'd hit it with a book so it was just crumbs, and I'd mix it with a pint of vanilla ice cream.
I don't want your porn, sir.<eos> Well, what about some, like, "hood rat" shit?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Listen, I see something, I have to say something.<eos> If you see an interracial gang bang, you could say you want it.
What?<eos> We're hot tub buddies.<eos> Look, in our condition, it was not safe to go in here alone.<eos> Where's the key?<eos> I think that lame-o cop-stripper we stole the handcuffs from still has it.
Don't you pick and refuse me<eos> 'Cause the things people refuse Are the things they should use<eos> Do you hear me<eos> Hear what I say<eos> I've heard this song before, but I never placed any significance in it.
- Illuminati.<eos> - The Illuminati.<eos> And they say that Hillary Clinton is a lizard.<eos> The thing is, if you look at the sky enough, you will see lasers shooting out of the moon.<eos> If you really, really look, because I have seen it.
Wanna go take a look at it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll just get my coat. All right.<eos> It runs great.<eos> It's got a lot of miles on it, but I kept up with the maintenance.
I actually learned English watching reruns of Solid Gold.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're serious?<eos> Yeah. They-they've done studies on it.<eos> The brain takes in information, like a new language, or a math equation, much more quickly and retains it better, when that information is delivered through music.
This where he did it?<eos> That's as may be, Silas, but you can't be here.<eos> So, what about this rope business?<eos> Did you get the impression that was something in her private life?<eos> She just offered it up as an image, and we explored it.
Behave yourself.<eos> - I guess you didn't read my note.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I read it. Both sentences.<eos> Each so terse, I figured you must have written it at gunpoint.
Yes, we do.<eos> Do you have any evidence to that effect,<eos> - Mrs. Florrick?<eos> - I can gather it.<eos> Then gather it.
You can stop now, Henry.<eos> No matter how good a friend you are, I don't think you can justify the stupid, irresponsible things I did last summer. I know I can't.<eos> You burned it down on purpose?<eos> No, I...<eos> We, Dylan and I, burned it down by accident. You didn't burn down anything.
And we think it could belong to the killer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Does it look familiar?<eos> Not offhand.<eos> Would you mind taking a closer peek at it?
Previously on Continuum...<eos> Police!<eos> Freeze!<eos> My suit is damaged.<eos> What did you do to it?
Dammit. Alec, where are you?<eos> Living large. What can I do for you?<eos> My suit is damaged.<eos> I wouldn't know where to begin.<eos> What did you do to it?
Helmut Torben.<eos> To my knowledge Mr. Torben has had no involvement, financial or otherwise, with McClarenTruth.org.<eos> Then your knowledge is limited, isn't it? Well, doesn't matter.<eos> I've filed a request for all the information pertaining to contributions made by<eos> If you don't hand it over, I'll have you thrown in jail for contempt.
So there's a couple of options for us to discuss here.<eos> One is called a Van Ness rotationplasty.<eos> I amputate your leg, I rotate it 180 degrees And then re-attach it.<eos> Essentially, your working ankle will become your knee.<eos> After that, you attach a small prosthetic to it. With that, you can run, you can jump. Keep working.
A really, really big bird.<eos> Tell Evan we've got a sighting.<eos> No one's answering on their cell phones.<eos> Maybe there's some kind of interference from the anomaly.<eos> Or interference from whatever came out of it.
That explains her bizarre behavior, why she had a sudden urge to take a dip in the lake.<eos> Hydatid cyst?<eos> Tapeworms are in their larval stage.<eos> That thing's filled with eggs.<eos> And if we don't get it out before it ruptures, this young woman dies.
It's our company's residence hotel.<eos> I'm headed there now.<eos> Don't you need to inspect your car a little?<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> I'll go take a look at it now.
Rafi tried it, but he said the foam right here was a little too tight on his junk.<eos> But I'm gonna set my sights higher. I'm gonna tinker with these bad boys until they produce the legendary brown note.<eos> And what might that be?<eos> An infrasonic frequency that's so low that it causes human beings to lose control of their bowels.<eos> I'm gonna sell it to the military.
Milly wants her shit, dude.<eos> What the fuck are you thinking coming over here?<eos> If you want something from us, you send us a fucking letter!<eos> I'm gonna let you go, but if you come back here, I swear to God, I'll fucking kill you.<eos> I'm putting all her shit in a box... so you don't have to stare at it anymore.
- Yes, I'm here.<eos> Go to the pier.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Where's yourboat?<eos> Has something happened to it?
Oh, son of a bitch.<eos> That's really on there.<eos> Yeah, afraid so.<eos> - Well, I have another idea.<eos> You're not gonna like it.
Sam, I checked it out. There's nothing on the NEST sensors.<eos> Signs of struggle.<eos> I'll keep looking.<eos> NEST teams are drawing a blank.<eos> A nuke signature has to be more radioactive than anything else around it or else detection equipment can't find it.
I would think that party planning could get pretty darn messy.<eos> It depends on the party.<eos> Uh, anyway, I gotta go.<eos> - The center camera?<eos> - Bank robbers shot it out, so I synced up the two outlying cameras.
I can't believe my small Southern town has a dark history of racial injustice.<eos> Man, I hate stupid, dumb, stinky old Stoolbend!<eos> Cleveland, I know that's not true.<eos> You love this town.<eos> You sang that whole cracker-ass song about it.
It's us and two other companies.<eos> Linda said someone at the top knew what the other two secret bids were.<eos> Were bribes involved? That's right.<eos> She told me she might blow the whistle to someone at city hall.<eos> You did the right thing. I appreciate it.
If I give you information about this man and anyone finds out, I will lose my job.<eos> I'll be branded a traitor and very likely go to jail.<eos> I won't go public with the information.<eos> I can't even use it in court.<eos> Then what do you want it for?
I understand there is a problem with the jedi prisoner.<eos> An incursion team attempted a rescue, but the situation is taken care of.<eos> Are you in possession of the information the prisoner is carrying?<eos> Not yet, but we will soon have it.<eos> You are aware that this information will tip the scale of the war to the side that controls it.
♪ Giordino: XIII is on the move, Mr. President.<eos> What's the latest?<eos> My people track credit card activity for two airplane tickets to Denver.<eos> Traffic cameras got a hit on a car rented by Samantha Taylor, travelling towards Green Falls, Colorado.<eos> The information got passed onto the NSA before I could derail it.
We all want the same thing, even if we call it by different names...
Good luck with that, agent LaRoche.<eos> Background on Montero.<eos> What do we know about him?<eos> Single, self-employed, spent half his time abroad Importing ancient art.<eos> Sold it from a warehouse in san Francisco.
Then, here.<eos> He disappears into the bathroom, but then something else happens, something the judge didn't know about because he wasn't there when it happened.<eos> Now, the police must have known because they were watching this monitor.<eos> Here, you fill your hand with pills and take 'em.<eos> Then chase it with whiskey.
Before he did what he did to her.<eos> She was really pretty.<eos> Had long hair, blonde, sweet looking.<eos> She had...a life.<eos> And she enjoyed it.
- Sir, please calm down. - Ju...<eos> let me stop you right there, okay?<eos> I don't care what seats you have left, all right? Do you see this?<eos> I am a vista Atlantic platinum flyer, all right?<eos> Is this card gold? No. Look at it.
Sir.<eos> You think there's nothing to this story about Mary and Nugent, don't you?<eos> I'm certain.<eos> Look. We all know it happens.<eos> The News Of The World is full of it every Sunday.
What?<eos> She didn't mean that.<eos> Don't be stupid, honey.<eos> Not you.<eos> Put toilet paper in the windows and lit it.
I have the love of a fine woman and the joy of raising her two wonderful children.<eos> I have money enough to retire... At least I will once I sell some property.<eos> And when my legal troubles are behind me, I intend to do just that.<eos> You built this town, now you can have it back...<eos> Atlantic City and all that goes with it.
I mean, she was always calling me with some crazy dream she was sure was a sign, that kind of thing, but...<eos> Uh, is it true Nikolai had a real vision of his death?<eos> That's what we were told, yeah.<eos> Well, so did she -- the day she died. What'd she say?<eos> Well, you can listen to it if you want.
What's it called?<eos> - "Daddy Say Yes."<eos> I wrote it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm glad you liked It.
JAX: - Mm. GEMMA:<eos> - Armenians. Very unstable people.<eos> Well, I really appreciate your cooperation, but we'll still have to conduct a full investigation.<eos> You know, I really hope this attack doesn't have anything to do with the threat on Dr. Knowles.<eos> The hospital confirmed it.
You can't.<eos> Because all of your money... and mine is in this house that we agreed to flip and make a mint on... and now we can't because the economy is in the shitter.<eos> Do you think I like carving 20 pumpkins and getting squash guts under my nails?<eos> I am trying here!<eos> I'm trying to make this place warm and inviting and spectacular... and have this Halloween party shot by Elle friggin' Decor... so someone will see it and sweep in and take this place off our hands.
- Don't, Fred.<eos> You've got to be strong.<eos> - Why?<eos> Remember what it was like to watch her kiss another dude right in front of you... her lips on his.<eos> The lies, the betrayal. How she took your trust and soaked it in gasoline and set it on fire.
And sometimes things are even better when they've matured.<eos> - Is this potato soup good or should I throw it out?<eos> - Save it. As harsh as it sounds, I think it's ready for the garbage.<eos> How could you say that?<eos> If you knew the soup as well as I do, you'd know it's got a few good slurps left in it.
I have failed it because I thought I was better than Greendale.<eos> See, I went to a university, so I thought it was my job to improve this place.<eos> But it turns out that the only thing wrong with Greendale is that it's run by an insecure wreck who holds five dances and two talent shows a year because he's afraid that the school isn't good enough.<eos> But Greendale is good enough because it accepts me for what I'm not.<eos> Greendale is the best school in the entire world, and I'm so sorry what I've done to it.
This is my town.<eos> You will lose your office, lose your house.<eos> I can cut you down to size until you're a tiny, shrunken little creature, and this will be the only roof over your damn head.<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> You take that delusion out of my son's head, and you crush it.
You were wrong.<eos> Don't feel too bad.<eos> We all were.<eos> His trachea wasn't swollen.<eos> It was blocked by a pseudomembrane growing across it.
Please, hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Let me say this again.<eos> I'm not discontinuing football or any other sport.<eos> I'm only changing the eligibility rules, so that kids who need extra time in the classroom don't lose it on the field. Whoa, whoa.
It's my fault, it's my fault.<eos> I didn't securely attache it.<eos> I got distracted by Ainhoa, and I went to look for something to strengthen them, but then I forgot.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't check it out!
I don't care what you do to me.<eos> I want to know what you've done to Gaius.<eos> Gaius had some information I needed.<eos> The whereabouts of the sorcerer Emrys.<eos> If he gave it to me willingly, his suffering would not be prolonged.
A party at the German embassy could make one night feel like a thousand years.<eos> Laughing at all their jokes was like eating breakfast from the gutter.<eos> The way I see it, for America to join the war would be like a man who's never been in a relationship interfering in a 50 year marriage.<eos> Thank you for a wonderful party, Your Excellency.<eos> I'm glad you're enjoying it, Mr. Lan-Ting.
Not knowing what direction to go, he decided to spend the night where the 4 roads met.<eos> As he was starting to fall asleep, the birds of the night went quiet and a fresh breeze woke him.<eos> he looked up and a dark shadow appeared in the night sky cloaked in a black cape, and a large hat.<eos> a human like form descended upon him.<eos> The creature reached across Robert grabbing his guitar, and with long thin, terrifying fingers tuned it to a sound that never been imagined before and dropped it by Robert's side.
And excuse my appearance.<eos> I don't forget this place.<eos> It is most filthy home l ever lived in.<eos> Why is it so cold?<eos> Henry kept it in the freezer.
It's gone into overload.<eos> is it?<eos> cos all the excess radiation gets vented inside there.<eos> Vinvocci glass.<eos> Contains it.
Where it finds a tunnel, it funnels down like a bloody creek.<eos> We have 60 blokes manning the pumps night and day just to keep the water level down.<eos> If we lose even a few of those men, bloody mines'll be useless.<eos> Where did they get this lot?<eos> The sappers are getting it wherever they can find it now, sir.
Only lts appearance leaves a little to be desired.<eos> Please, Mr. Judiciary.<eos> Sun ..<eos> Why do not you write d you first?<eos> When I first write it, I take it even possible to write to me first.
- Cut?<eos> Yes!<eos> They're not working!<eos> Maybe the line is down.<eos> They're probably fixing it.
You say the word, and I will provide you a list of the students... I believe should be rounded up and shipped off immediately.<eos> I am sorry, Sue.<eos> This is insanity!<eos> What you call insanity, I call inspiration.<eos> Let me break it down for you.
Thanks to this computer, with a word processing app linked by this cable to a printer; also computerized.<eos> If it's a ruse to swipe my carbon paper there'll be hell to pay!<eos> No, boss, I threw out your carbon paper.<eos> You did what?<eos> You don't need it anymore.
Well. Here I am.<eos> - Tell me about this new weapon.<eos> - You're looking at it.<eos> I'm looking at what ?<eos> Two steps forward and you'd actually be kissing it.
Half the people in this city, right?<eos> Yeah. But how did she get her hands On davis's championship medal?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Borrowed it, stole it.<eos> And maybe this shelly davis wanted it back.
We're doing work next door and nicked a main, so we're gonna have to shut down your water.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay. No problem.<eos> It shouldn't be too long.<eos> If you need it, there's a porta-potty out front.
If a crime occurs, please solve it.<eos> What do you mean, a crime?<eos> The person who solves the crime is the 'detective.'<eos> Any one of you can be the detective.<eos> Once a solution is proposed, everyone will vote on it.
You gave it to me...<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Yeah, the box that I brought in from the landlord,<eos> She said that her tenant had left things behind.<eos> What if he left it behind because he died?
It's perfect, Olivia.<eos> Just make sure they're tightened down.<eos> Walter, you really think that this is gonna work?<eos> There's no reason it shouldn't.<eos> I mean, something stopped this creature from developing, and because it's part mechanical, if we pump it with enough electricity, we should be able to restart it, like jump-starting a car.
You see, when I first went foraging, what I actually found was the smoldering wreckage of the ship.<eos> Ignoring all danger, I charged inside to liberate our provisions.<eos> So, this is the trail mix Fry gave me!<eos> Yes.<eos> I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops.
Devries, get out of the car!<eos> Step away from the car.<eos> Information is currency.<eos> That's what they say.<eos> And you turned it into cold, hard cash.
My elastic line is going to get infected again.<eos> Are you really not bringing someone to Cerie's wedding?<eos> I don't care about having a date.<eos> What about Floyd's wedding?<eos> If I have to sit through that alone, I will rent a car, set it on fire, and drive it off a waterfall.
Does my hand smell like dogs to you?<eos> Okay. I'm assuming that's because we're sharing a room, and not because you actually just smelled my hand.<eos> I'm fine with the room arrangement, Hoyt.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> I'm happy that you're fine with it, sir.
Do you know how much this embarrasses me?"<eos> Stuff like that. I-I think he was having an affair.<eos> Did you ever see the woman come out the house or I.D. a car?<eos> He loved that bear.<eos> He devoted his whole life to it.
The queen's never even on the table. It's not a bank.<eos> Hardison, where do the police keep evidence,<eos> I mean the really valuable stuff?<eos> That evidence, that ships out to Holyoke First thing tomorrow morning.<eos> In the district, then they transfer it out.
Let's set up a pool table that's like a time machine.<eos> If a ball enters one pocket, it travels through a wormhole and it can exit another pocket before it entered the first pocket.<eos> So it's a time machine.<eos> So now suppose the ball really does go through the first pocket, emerges before it entered, and then hits itself before it entered the first pocket.<eos> That would deflect it, preventing it from entering the first pocket, and thus preventing it from having exited the second pocket and done the deflection in the first place.
Because the cup can be used for evil as well as good.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Many centuries ago, it fell into the possession of a great warlord.<eos> One night, he gathered his army before him.<eos> He took a drop of blood from each and every man and collected it in the cup.
I avoided the critical points.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just wanted to give you the mail.<eos> Love card, golf resort, Kim Tracksuit Freak and...<eos> Give it to me later.
There's something you want, that's why you followed me around like a teaching assistant, right?<eos> I am here for Sensei's glass mask.<eos> I see...<eos> Come to the workshop.<eos> But it's not a promise to sell it to you.
Thank you.<eos> - Take a seat there. - Huh?<eos> Sure.<eos> Hold this.<eos> I wrote some lines, and I want you to read it after you inhale the gas.
And we don't make deals with terrorists.<eos> Oh, please, we do it all the time.<eos> He'll say he's been tortured, we'll deny it.<eos> He'll say he wants a broadcast, we'll refuse it.<eos> He'll make crazy demands, and we'll reject it.
They grew shells by tapping into the atmosphere's carbon now dissolved in the ocean.<eos> These strata are the accumulated shells of those billions and billions of micro-organisms.<eos> Thanks to them, the carbon drained from the atmosphere and other life forms could develop.<eos> It is life that altered the atmosphere.<eos> Plant life fed off the sun's energy, which enabled it to break apart the water molecule and take the oxygen.
My death.<eos> But before we go there, we need to go back to a time where it all started, when God was getting busy with the creation of the universe, where there was only cosmic goo.<eos> God's Play-Doh, if you will.<eos> While God was messing with this Play-Doh, creating all living things, he put death into a ceramic jar for safekeeping, until he could figure out what to do with it.<eos> One day, God gave the jar to a frog and a toad to guard it from harm while he went off to create something more fantastic.
Miles wants to be the guy that nobody can beat.<eos> The deal with Samuel and Joshua. He went to a lot of trouble to get some revenge.<eos> - But what else did we find in the car?<eos> - Diamonds.<eos> He steals from the U.S. Military, he sells it for a profit.
Watch this part, here.<eos> That's what it is, lipstick?<eos> But do you play golf?<eos> Me, golf?<eos> Those professors gave it to me when they left.
- It seems to be activated by a liquid.<eos> What does?<eos> The parasite?<eos> The yellow powdery stuff in the vials? They're like eggs. But the catalyst is stomach acid.<eos> So the victim just needs to ingest it. Exactly right.
Keep your voice down.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Would you just take a look at the people that she did fight with?<eos> All right,sport,you want to slip a name in the old suggestion box,fire away.<eos> Grace mentioned that someone went through her stuff back at the mansion-- destroyed it.
I'm just getting this old stuff ready to sell.<eos> Won't bring in much, maybe some grocery money but every little bit counts.<eos> - Who's gonna buy that old junk?<eos> - Tommy said he'd buy it.<eos> He's gonna use it for his rental properties.
And the only way to bring them together was by your death. You understood.<eos> It's why you were about to kill yourself when I stopped you.<eos> If all I had to do was die, then why did you stop me?<eos> You had critical information that would've died with you.<eos> Once you'd given it to me...
that's right, isn't it?<eos> I asked how you guys knew that!<eos> You should ask Geum Jan Di if she still has it.<eos> What?<eos> Not sure if she dropped it or threw it away, but she probably lost it on the mountain earlier.
Well, he's obviously disguising it. I mean, he probably used his left hand.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Or if he was a lefty, he used his right hand.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Or if he was ambidextrous, he probably got drunk and then wrote it.
No,no,this isn't right.<eos> I have to talk to her.<eos> I have to change her mind.<eos> She's made it clear she doesn't wanna speak to you.<eos> But if you write a letter we'll see that she gets it. Now...
You can't do this.<eos> I think you'll find in the coming months we can do whatever we want.<eos> What about the laws?<eos> We've always been above the law, Adelle.<eos> Only now, we're also writing it.
I suspect it had crashed before.<eos> Crashed?<eos> Yes, like a car crash.<eos> It might have been broken.<eos> I took a picture of it.
- Lookin' good, Red.<eos> - Thanks, Adam.<eos> Pretty great about Jake's new gig, huh?<eos> Crazy fast.<eos> I mean, Cass asked me one day and my buddy Zach hooks it up the next.
- See this?<eos> - The QR code.<eos> So?<eos> The conference-room table is covered with smart glass and is smart enough to read that.<eos> What'll the code tell it to do?
I'm glad you're back.<eos> She needs you.<eos> No, she done all right.<eos> All them people she helped to freedom... it's amazing.<eos> Last time we saw each other, we was runnin' from danger, now she runnin' into it.
Less than a day later, her cabin exploded.<eos> Liv, you were with me in the hospital The night of the assassination.<eos> You saw Cyrus.<eos> You saw how grief-stricken he was.<eos> Just because he killed Frankie doesn't mean he didn't feel bad about it.
We are more than ready, okay? I even have an ice luge shaped like Party Steve's dong coming.<eos> Aw. Didn't they make one small enough to replicate yours?<eos> Don't even trip, okay?<eos> My dick is gorgeous.<eos> You put a wig on it, it would look just like Penelope Cruz.
Who?<eos> The nerd I remember.<eos> Careful with that.<eos> It's an exact replica of one Barnum Brown excavated at Hell Creek.<eos> I saved this spot for it.
What color is the wall?<eos> - White. - What color do you want it to be?<eos> You can make it any color you want. It's your wall, Mary.<eos> The wall is right here, Mary, not over there.<eos> If you don't focus on what you want, you can't get it, because there is nothing in this world that you cannot change if you bring your full force of will against it.
No, no, nyah!<eos> Let me handle it.<eos> I just... I don't want to destroy it until we know what happened.<eos> Well, that's fine.<eos> Let's just put it somewhere where nobody can look at it till we know what the hell is going on with it.
Well please indicate to the court, where she is.<eos> Is this true, madam?<eos> Yes, Herr Richter. The provisions of the divorce state that<eos> Mileva Maric, married Einstein, will receive an annual stipend of 9,000 Deutschmarks.<eos> Adding to this, Professor Einstein promises her the full proceeds of a Nobel prize, should he be awarded it.
It's niche news for morons. It's not!<eos> It's a superb car, because you can have it with the same 500 horsepower engine that you get in the Quadriplegio.<eos> And with that... with that you get four-wheel-drive.<eos> So that one will work in the wet, will it?<eos> Hammond, when somebody has a baby, OK, do you go up to it and... "Look at my new baby that I've...
Tie a knot in it.<eos> What went on in there?<eos> Since when's it my job to do yours?<eos> If you put the report on my desk, DS Flynn,<eos> I'll be sure to take a look at it.
Oh, it's delicious.<eos> I love their chicken ramen.<eos> It has these really nice yuzu lemon notes.<eos> Big fan of yuzu.<eos> I wrote this whole article about it for my blog.
Out where?<eos> Buses are okay, but I don't like the feeling of the seat on my back, so I sit like this.<eos> I don't know how people stand it.<eos> Maybe they've developed thicker back skin from riding the bus so much.<eos> There's a type of Antarctic cod that has a special protein in its blood that stops it from freezing.
Wait, you don't think he'd be happy for you?<eos> He dedicated a year of his life to me.<eos> He-he taught me, and he gave me structure, he gave me purpose.<eos> This thing we do, this isn't just a job to him, it's-it's...<eos> it's something much more, and I'm just gonna turn my back on it.
That's right.<eos> Go get the hostages out of Tehran.<eos> One of my Delta instructors... name is Diamond Dave... he was on that mission.<eos> The plane carrying the operatives lands in the desert somewhere to refuel.<eos> While it's on the ground, a Navy helicopter crashes into it due to the heavy winds.
Now, it is carrying an asteroid harvested by the Republic so it could be exploited for its heavy metals.<eos> The problem is, the capsule is gonna crash in about 20 hours, and with it, everything they've worked for will be lost.<eos> I believe you mean meteor, not asteroid.<eos> Meteors are asteroids that pass through our atmosphere prior to impact with the earth.<eos> But this asteroid is in a protective capsule to prevent it from burning up during atmospheric passage.
We were square.<eos> Then I'm sure you won't mind showing us your personal financial records. You can identify the payment you issued him.<eos> I would, only I didn't pay him in cash. I paid him in information.<eos> He came to see me at my office. I had about a-a third of what I owed him. I told him I'd get him the rest by the end of the month.<eos> But he said he didn't want it.
Can we have a word?<eos> What's happened?<eos> That was among the crap found on the beach.<eos> What you have here is a human heart.<eos> Something's had a wee chew at it.
You know, it's really easy to just sit there and be the naysayer, when you don't actually do anything.<eos> You know that we only comprehend about 4% of the universe. 4%!<eos> - Across the board! It's four!<eos> - Abby, Abby...<eos> We all believe in the scientific method. I've dedicated my life to it.
Don't kill it!<eos> I've been doing this a long time.<eos> I can't tell you if there's a heaven or hell or what's out there.<eos> But one thing I can tell you for certain is that evil exists.<eos> You can run away from it, you can bury it maybe you can even slow it down but you can't stop it.
We need to go there and see what attracts the asteroid.<eos> Once we know why it is coming We will find out how to send it to another place.<eos> This plan is so stupid that i wish it had a face i can smash!<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> instead of running away from a deadly asteroid You want us to run directly towards it ?
Tell Jamie it's a trap.<eos> Where are you going, little mouse?<eos> Ah, let go of me, you brute, or I'll tell my godfather how you grabbed me.<eos> Stand and watch, Hugh.<eos> My personal favorite has you turning a broomstick into a poisonous serpent and commanding it to attack the comte, sort of like a latter-day Pharaoh and Moses...
rattling around in your head, you.<eos> It is, unless I misheard, Two Soldiers, and you... you almost have it,<eos> but for blowing a note or two, you should be drawing.<eos> A more intimate instrument does not exist.<eos> You... you give to it the most cherished gift a man has...
Well, well, well.<eos> I've been looking for you for days.<eos> Man, are you two fucked.<eos> This shouldn't make you uncomfortable.<eos> It's the circle of life, or the approximation of it.
We're ready.<eos> Let's see what do we have here.<eos> A few words from our Distinguished Citizen?<eos> Well...<eos> I'm very honored for this gesture that perpetuates my image... or at least something slightly similar to it.
When people come and go, they're gonna look back.<eos> Steve Aoki's gonna have a huge impact on what happened.<eos> Even though you may not say Steve Aoki made EDM huge, Steve Aoki was one of the step stones.<eos> [Will.i.am] When it comes to passionate people, go-getters, hustlers, manifesters, whatever you wanna call them, Steve Aoki is that guy.<eos> There's a wall in front of him? He's a hustler. He goes around it, over it, under it, through it.
Oh, believe me, I know, and I see that.<eos> But it really can't be helped. Besides, you're still gonna be on the case.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You're cross-designating me to Eastern?<eos> Like you said, you've been working on it for two years.
But the baroness could not carry a child to term.<eos> They say her body rejected the fetuses because they were deformed.<eos> Now, you must excuse me.<eos> I have to put this animal out of its misery.<eos> What's wrong with it?
That's called Barrington House.<eos> The family that owned it gave it to the state in the '30s.<eos> The state turned it into a living history museum.<eos> Every elementary school for 50 miles used to come here for field trips.<eos> The place was running a long time before the modern world built up around it.
Where was it? Like, on his desk or something?<eos> Yeah, with...<eos> Other crap all over the place.<eos> Yes.<eos> And it's not like something was for sure going to happen to it.
I never thought we'd get here.<eos> He didn't seem so happy about it.<eos> Happiness is not exactly his strong suit.<eos> In fact, his disposition is one of the things that's kept him from rising to the top of his laboratory.<eos> God knows he has the brains for it.
Professor, please eat or it will go cold again...<eos> Someone has sent the Association's commission after you.<eos> They're questioning your work.<eos> But we'll show them your inspirations. That it shows the years of colonial exploitation.<eos> - That's the title I gave it.
You're number one for now, but soon, I'll be number one.<eos> You're number two for now, but soon, I'll be number two.<eos> That Brainiac is a jerk.<eos> Did you see the way Superman threw that thing?<eos> Put some serious spin on it.
What's this?<eos> Uh, that's the sequel.<eos> You wrote another book based on me and Sherlock?<eos> Wait-- before you take my head off, I already told the editor that he can't have it;<eos> I was just putting the finishing touches on it when you came by the house the other day.
Hi, Sheldon.<eos> What's up? Good news.<eos> You're an asteroid.<eos> Uh... please tell me what to say next.<eos> Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.
Who knew? - I knew.<eos> I knew the moment...<eos> I knew the moment you gave that valet a dollar.<eos> Can't sleep without the fan on ever since I was little.<eos> Even have a name for it.
Tell me how that went down.<eos> It was dimly lit.<eos> Through the darkness I saw an Adonis.<eos> He looked at me, I looked at him.<eos> The nipple went in my mouth. I loved it.
'Cause nothing would grow in Wayward Pines.<eos> Why is that, Kerry?<eos> What's wrong with the soil here?<eos> Why didn't Pilcher account for it?<eos> What did we do to it?
Um...<eos> "It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at oneself through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.<eos> One ever feels his two-ness...<eos> An American, a negro.<eos> Two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings, two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder."
Stop him!<eos> Stephan, let me go.<eos> No!<eos> No one admitted to helping them, but I've seen people sneaking food and provisions into the barn.<eos> Once we have it surrounded, we set it on fire.
Or do you want it for yourself?<eos> I'm seeking an order that it be destroyed.<eos> Your Honour, Mr Dolan waived parental responsibility at the ti...<eos> In regards to a child.<eos> We're talking about an embryo. It's my genetic material, so I should have the right to decide what happens to it.
This ring belonged to my mother.<eos> Always struck me as odd that he ever held onto it at all.<eos> I never had him pegged as the sentimental type.<eos> As it turns out, he isn't.<eos> He was just holding onto it in case he needed it.
The temple is close by.<eos> Wait here!<eos> - You stole that sacred manuscript.<eos> - No!<eos> Jian sneaked to look at it one day. That's all.
Just a little something in case you get an infection.<eos> Be good to go in a day.<eos> - Hey, that wolf is ours.<eos> - She might have a different opinion.<eos> - What did you do to it?
It's gonna be a Jamba Juice. Cool, huh?<eos> Yeah, it's really awesome watching you guys tear apart everything I built.<eos> Too late for second thoughts.<eos> I just came from the bank. I deposited the check.<eos> Although I took a picture of it first so I can put it on my wall.
Take him away to await our verdict.<eos> His closing argument could've gone better.<eos> We need to go after him.<eos> He didn't want our help.<eos> That doesn't mean he doesn't need it now.
Okay. I give up.<eos> What's your favorite baseball team?<eos> That's the one with the hoop and the tall guys bouncing the ball, right?<eos> A courtship ring.<eos> You know, I've just learned that there is a long-standing mating ritual here where if you like it, you should've put a ring on it.
Go, go, go, go!<eos> It's this way.<eos> The bridge.<eos> We can pull these pins.<eos> We can collapse it right under 'em.
Right, and just like any computer, it can be upgraded with new software but it can also be hacked-- made to do whatever the hacker wants it to do.<eos> Like accelerate instead of brake?<eos> Yeah, in this case, exactly.<eos> Somebody overrode the accelerator module wirelessly.<eos> Told it to keep going faster.
I saw him.<eos> We were all in a warehouse.<eos> Um, the address is 22... 23 Seventh street.<eos> He made me memorize it so I could drive back, 'cause he needed me to get something for him.<eos> It was important and he needed it.
This is our chance to learn more about our planet and maybe even save it.<eos> - And I'm sure you all would agree that even if such a...<eos> - Wait, what is this? - ( Victor Von Doom )<eos> Victor Von Doom is on here.<eos> He started this project and devoted a decade of his life to it.
Don't believe me?<eos> Dig Callum up and see what I did to him.<eos> Now let's try that again.<eos> When Katherine was a young girl, I gave her a rabbit.<eos> Every day she fed it, played with it.
Oh, I like that.<eos> All right, so we'll go every other night so I have a little time to stockpile?<eos> No, no, no, none of this "every other night" stuff.<eos> No, we're waiting until my peak ovulation window, and then, ka-blooey!<eos> My uterus won't know what hit it.
I've had enough of hearing about the wretched things.<eos> It's quite ghastly.<eos> The rats concur.<eos> So he says to me, "Arthur, I dunno what's up with me windscreen,<eos> "it don't matter how much I cleans it, it's like a fog." So I says, "Don't worry about your windscreen.
Good thing is, I know the recipe.<eos> You take hydrogen, you add oxygen, you burn.<eos> Now, I have hundreds of liters... of unused hydrazine at the MDV.<eos> If I run the hydrazine over an iridium catalyst... it'll separate into N2 and H2.<eos> And then if I just direct the hydrogen into a small area... and burn it.
Um... He was in the Serengeti on safari... -...and he had just gone into his tent when a hippo wandered into the camp.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> He was attacked by a hippo? No.<eos> No.<eos> I guess the hippo started to charge when the guide grabbed his rifle and shot at it, but his aim was off, and...
- Hurry up!<eos> - Please, don't!<eos> Needless to say, Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.<eos> And the killing didn't stop.<eos> Pablo had tasted blood, and he liked it.
She's good.<eos> Ordered this kit of recipe cards. Saw it on the TV.<eos> So now every night, we eat delicacies of the world. Mm.<eos> Some men like that. Variety.<eos> She put a soufflé on the table last night... perfectly good casserole... and lit it on fire with a kitchen match.
All right, he's hiding something big from me.<eos> He won't look me in the eyes, and he said he'd rather walk around with open wounds than heal. Oh.<eos> Oh my God, I don't know. I'm sure it's nothing.<eos> I'm not so sure, all right?<eos> Today, he got a maxi pad out of the ladies' room and said he needed it for stuff.
What's he fighting, Will?<eos> You were asking about the dog.<eos> Last night, a vet called the police.<eos> Leeds and his oldest boy took the dog into the vet the afternoon before they were killed.<eos> What's going to happen to it?
That was the amount it'll cost to rebuild the center.<eos> I cut a check for that and your signing bonus this morning.<eos> So you want to help the Nation? No. Never.<eos> But it's your money-- you do with it as you choose.<eos> But if I was you, I would... rebuild the center and put a studio in there, naming it after myself... so I could protect my legacy.
That weren't nothing.<eos> Just an owl.<eos> 'We were afraid to go up there at night, 'which is probably why we did it so often.'<eos> You hear what they say about the phantom coach?<eos> Anyone who sets eyes upon it be cursed to die an 'orrible death.
Won't happen again, sir.<eos> Thank you, Detective.<eos> IA told me if I go within 100 feet of that guy, I'll be suspended.<eos> What makes a man like Mr. Weiss become a killer?<eos> Guy like that, living an unhappy life, answers an unorthodox Craigslist ad, finds he likes it.
No, but she is an unverified asset.<eos> Ergo, it falls to us to verify her.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Sweet Jesus. What the hell is this place?<eos> We don't have a name for it yet as Congress is suspicious of allocating monies to Secret Services.
You know what, I have no choice because it is important to my sons.<eos> Yeah, and what about your own needs?<eos> Parents do not have needs.<eos> You ever read the book The Giving Tree?<eos> It's about a tree, and this kid keeps coming and taking stuff from it his whole life, until there's nothing left but a stump.
We found it in your little love nest under Nicole's house.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The lighter's mine, I'll admit that.<eos> It was a gift from my dad, but I quit smoking years ago.<eos> Oh. So you found a new use for it. No.
Okay, let's start with the bus driver.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's.<eos> The whole accident was his fault.<eos> He wouldn't even apologize for it, and when I asked for his insurance, he got really squirrelly and wouldn't look me in the eye.
It's possible.<eos> I don't remember ever having a Teddy Bear like that.<eos> I don't remember anything before my father ditched me with Ed Clark.<eos> Why would I start remembering that stuff now?<eos> Could have something to do with hooking your brain up to a quantum computer and running enough power through it to light a very small city.
- Howell, I thought you said you were certain. Are you or aren't you?<eos> I'm certain.<eos> But I need a better picture.<eos> Look, the hacking device.<eos> Howell had a look at it.
For shits and gigs.<eos> This is thick.<eos> I would take you all up to my bedroom... - Oh!<eos> - Oh, she's crazy!<eos> And then I'd roofie you, roll you up in a duvet, and light it on fire.
Why?<eos> I'm a DIY kind of guy.<eos> Taco, masturbation is DIY.<eos> Yeah, well, I've been having a rough time lately.<eos> If I spend the whole day drawing a picture, it kind of takes the element of surprise out of it.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm doing good here.<eos> I'm helping Merida, and then when she's done with the wisp, it'll be my turn.<eos> The wisp isn't a toy you can share.<eos> She can't just give it to you.<eos> The person who whispers to it becomes its owner forever.
Goodnight, Fitz.<eos> How long are the nights on this planet?<eos> There has to be a sunrise eventually.<eos> Where is the sun?<eos> What did you do to it? !
Mommy.<eos> Mommy.<eos> Jill.<eos> Miles, what's going on?<eos> I was sliding down a rainbow, then Dora the Explorer set it on fire and kept saying, "Can you say climate change?"
You wanted their attention,<eos> I gave it to you.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> As the end of its life would approach, the phoenix would build a pyre nest, set it on fire and be consumed in the flames.
Seeeeeeee...<eos> Youuuu...<eos> In helllllllllllll!<eos> Your show... helped me to forget what happened to my village.<eos> I burn it down.
and, um... you thought you'd get married.<eos> It was Mom, wasn't it?<eos> Can I get your opinion on a pepper mill at the restaurant?<eos> - What?<eos> - I took a picture of it.
Black rage.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> ISIS. Oh, God.<eos> This chicken tastes like shit.<eos> What'd you do to it?
Hey, ladies, up here, coming down the stairs.<eos> Let me know if there's anything in my way.<eos> 100% vision over here, but this side is real touch-and-go.<eos> Well, is your eye still smarting'?<eos> Let me take a look at it.
What? Oh, hell, no!<eos> I'm not aborting my baby.<eos> - Our baby.<eos> -That I'm carrying.<eos> For us, so we have the ultimate say in what happens to it.
Because you are a child.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> A child doctor, Becca?<eos> A child doctor with a BMW 7 Series and credit score well into the five hundos?<eos> He almost got fired because during a hip resurfacing, he took his sunglasses, put them on the patient's testicles and took a picture of it.
As do you.<eos> I like this.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> This old thing? I... come on.<eos> I just wear it because I don't care if anything happens to it.
Oh, cool, what'd you get him?<eos> I-I bought him a dress shirt and a tie.<eos> He's a securities trader.<eos> I don't really know what that is, but he's got to wear a suit every day.<eos> I think he'll love it.
because it was... It was the most beautiful tree in the forest.<eos> It had the strongest wood.<eos> It could be used for anything.<eos> It was the World Tree in Norse mythology.<eos> You couldn't say anything bad about it.
To foul our beliefs, trample our freedom.<eos> And in this, not only did they fail... they granted us the greatest gift.<eos> A chance at our rebirth.<eos> We will rise. Renewed. Stronger and united.<eos> This is our time... our chance to get back to the best of who we are. To lead by example with the dignity, integrity and honor that built this country and which will build it once again.
If you eat the heart...<eos> Now, I know that is crazy.<eos> Now I understand.<eos> - But at the time...<eos> - At the time it was the word of God, and I believed it absolutely.
Get in the car. Tell Dewain I want to see his<eos> Really?<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, thanks. Well, coroner's report confirmed that Rick Dawson died from a head contusion.<eos> Ann must have dumped the body and then set it on fire.
God loves you, for your virtues, and for your sins.<eos> There's the Corbett whistle.<eos> Lor...<eos> Look at you...<eos> A coat of paint would sure spruce it up nice.
There's the Corbett whistle.<eos> Lor...<eos> Look at you...<eos> A coat of paint would sure spruce it up nice.<eos> Needs a match, put it out of its misery.
Time 51 got one.<eos> Plus, it would really piss off Mouch.<eos> No way.<eos> Peter Mills, where is that dog?<eos> Um, I found a home for it. - You did?
!<eos> Not lock me up or take away my throne, but, no, you would "advise me"?<eos> ! Edward, the council feels...<eos> No, it doesn't!<eos> The council feels nothing but what you tell it, and you will turn them against me!
She's right.<eos> This has gone far enough.<eos> Mom, everybody, out, now!<eos> Let's go.<eos> This was your olive branch and you torched it.
Because the best drops happen in plain sight.<eos> Yes.<eos> Got him.<eos> So easy.<eos> Just gave the number. Check it.
Um, I thought I read in the police report that the mugger also stole your husband's phone.<eos> Yeah, well, like I said-- Wallace is a packrat.<eos> He never threw anything out.<eos> That's his old phone.<eos> A few weeks before he died, someone bumped into him on the street and spilled coffee all over it.
Okay, I'm helping a friend pursue a dream.<eos> More like delusion. And if you're really his friend, you should help him open up a bowling alley or something safe.<eos> Not, uh, something that defies the law of gravity.<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you the guy who helped him buy the helicopter in the first place?<eos> Yes. Under duress, one; and two, I never thought that any state or any federal agency would-would license that man to fly it.
Hey!<eos> [Vic] Who the hell are you?<eos> Where did you get that phone?<eos> Some guy named Zip.<eos> He said he didn't need it anymore.
A couple of years ago, News Night got a new EP and the show...<eos> Boy, is your wife...<eos> Linda is my ex-wife.<eos> The show took a turn and what?<eos> David posted things about it on the Internet he didn't like.
He said he'd killed people.<eos> I believed him.<eos> But some of the others thought he was bad luck.<eos> Especially Lee. Lee Bysack.<eos> Alex had a pet rat and Lee didn't like the way he spoke to it. He thought it was creepy.
Gasoline, Sterno, butane.<eos> Whatever the arsonist's particular appetite calls for.<eos> So you're assuming that it's arson?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah. Someone doused this bench, lit it up.
Chad, adultery is bad... Mmm-hmm.<eos> ...but incest is fucked up!<eos> Oh, please don't let him tell Mommy about our secret tickle time.<eos> Secret tickle time?<eos> You got a name for it?
You know, probably buy himself a hotel in the next couple weeks or so.<eos> Not on clogs.<eos> He's just doing that.<eos> He's gonna use that to buy some stuff, soon as he gets enough. He's gonna get nabbed.<eos> He ought to go in the drugstore and buy himself a new toothbrush cause he's gonna need it.
- Uh, I'm getting it.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> I chose it.<eos> Charlie doesn't have anywhere to put it.<eos> He doesn't like it anyway.
- Six.<eos> - Check banks Check banks in the same towns, for cash withdrawals.<eos> Not deposits - withdrawals.<eos> Same amounts, from other bank accounts at the same time.<eos> The money wasn't stolen, he was given it.
Oh, it's anything but simple.<eos> I agree.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> So your immune system is designed to defend against germs, viruses, that kind of thing, but if something gets inside that looks like your own tissue...<eos> In this case, the nerve tissue of the pigs... your body can't tell the difference and starts attacking everything around it too.
Either way, if it's not Ryan's body, we have a new victim.<eos> And a new murder suspect.<eos> Ryan needed a fresh body to pull this off.<eos> So, if he was desperate enough, he may have been willing to kill someone.<eos> He cut himself to leave the blood, then planted his I.D. on the body, set it ablaze to conceal who the victim really was.
You have got to be kidding.<eos> You're all crazy. I'm going in.<eos> Well, then, I'm going with you.<eos> Can we please talk?<eos> It's like he took our future into the woods and shot it in the face.
She seemed so real, holding the crystal right in the hallway.<eos> And she was looking for your mom.<eos> Did you see-- no.<eos> But my mother was talking to her like she was right there.<eos> The spell didn't just show me where the crystal was-- it showed me everything that was happening around it.
Listen, the lab is down on the third floor, and the lab tech will take your DNA swab. Oh, that's okay.<eos> I brought my own.<eos> This is a piece of my, uh, columella.<eos> That's like the, um... the little nub that divides up your nose?<eos> My guy took a whack at it yesterday, gave me that as a keepsake.
You're welcome.<eos> Have a nice evening!<eos> Sorry, Lily.<eos> So, you guys really know how to find this wolf or what?<eos> (IN NORWEGIAN) What do you think you're gonna do to it?
CARRIE: Wow, you're really good.<eos> We already know what's in this file.<eos> No evidence Hagan drugged his wife, some bruising on Nora's arms but not enough to positively say they struggled.<eos> Not very helpful.<eos> Then it can't hurt if we take a look at it again.
Whoa there!<eos> Bad idea, Grandpa. Bad idea.<eos> I loved that truck.<eos> That trick was a piece of shit.<eos> Is that why you set fire to it?
But shall it be that you that set the crown Upon the head of this forgetful man Shall be fooled, discarded and shook off?<eos> Say no more.<eos> Now I will unclasp a secret book,<eos> And to your quick-conceiving discontents I'll read you matter deep and dangerous.<eos> Send danger from the east unto the west, So honour cross it from the north to south, And let them grapple!
I know, right?<eos> Oh, and I noticed you had some sort of gunky buildup in the front end here.<eos> First, I had no idea what I was looking at.<eos> Then I remembered you had me replace that front fender a few months back when you ran over that deer.<eos> We went at it with the steam hose, cleaned it up for you.
And from books.<eos> I always say if it weren't for books...<eos> Don't give me books!<eos> If you're going to study, you study what's in the curriculum.<eos> People who stray outside it have done this country no good.
Said the walking, talking professional invasion of privacy.<eos> I am here to work with you. I thought you understood that by now.<eos> I'm sorry, wasn't it you that said we were supposed to be learning more about each other?<eos> That's how companionship works, is it not? Is this because of the violin yesterday?<eos> Because I think you made your point when you set it on fire!
My blood, tell my story.<eos> To all those I love, I greet you.<eos> I hope to meet you again in heaven.<eos> lnch'Allah.<eos> A very big tree... and another, smaller one... that's growing next to it.
Say it.<eos> The booze is king.<eos> Not king, no.<eos> It is God.<eos> You give your life to it.
It'll have to be fracked.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> It's the end of the ranch, Elena!<eos> Oil's in your blood!<eos> When did you turn your back on it?
White Fang.<eos> - This guy Befriends a wild creature.<eos> But he must, he must set the animal free because that's what's best for it.<eos> I know the plot of White Fang. But the animal won't go.<eos> So with a breaking heart, he throws stones at it until it runs away.
They trashed this place looking for it.<eos> How'd they know to come here?<eos> Pushkov may have installed a beacon that turns on when you power it up.<eos> Anyone with an access code could follow it geographically.<eos> And they're willing to kill anyone who comes in contact with it.
So did anything happen?<eos> Yes... I mean no. Aside from the fact that the Second Officer came by.<eos> Nothing else happened. - The Second Officer came by?<eos> It's probably because of that problem.<eos> Are they going to swallow the food only when I put it into their mouths?
I'm telling you, we sent it out.<eos> You were on the list.<eos> - I did get the invitation.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yes, and I paid so little attention to it that I didn't even bother to RSVP.
I mean guys in turbans pulling up in vans and stuff like that. Ha ha!<eos> Bogdan is Romanian.<eos> so... there's always...<eos> You got a real nice place here.<eos> A shame if something happened to it. That angle.
Crazy days and crazy, crazy nights...<eos> Tea?<eos> Cocking hell.<eos> Oh, it's my lunch.<eos> I wondered what had happened to it.
No -- he's strong.<eos> Look, I know you're different--<eos> I'm different too, Tyler--<eos> I know you think you're helping your Dad but you're actually making him sick.<eos> His body can't handle what you're feeding it.
- No, listen, fine, fine, fine!<eos> Listen, all right, I have never been in love.<eos> It just never happened. But I imagine that if I ever was, I wouldn't go hiding from it or saying that I didn't mean it.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I would walk right up to love, and I would just grab it by the breasts and squeeze.
Maybe to get the money, I don't know.<eos> It was my chance to run.<eos> So basically you killed the mission.<eos> But you still have the passports.<eos> Yeah, but the moment that Chupino's men step inside the store and see that you torched it, they'll spook.
Well, I had to, didn't I?<eos> You're still not changed?<eos> I had to mend the veil.<eos> What?<eos> What did you do to it?
You're still not changed?<eos> I had to mend the veil.<eos> What?<eos> What did you do to it?<eos> I didn't do anything to it.
It's only stupid humans that shed emotional tears.<eos> And elephants.<eos> Fuck off do elephants cry!<eos> When one of their herd dies, they travel, hundreds of miles to go and look at the corpse.<eos> They huddle round it and shed real tears.
How's the sex?<eos> I know.<eos> It's awful, right?<eos> More like nonexistent.<eos> - Dennis couldn't get it up for almost a year.
Bloody hell! Why didn't you say anything?<eos> What, like...<eos> Not a cancerous lump? I'm afraid so.<eos> I discovered it last night when I was sucking him off.<eos> We went to A E, and the doctor had a go on it and gave him the all clear, but I don't know.
But the planet has a protective shield, like a sheet of Plexiglas that protects a globe from shotgun blasts.<eos> It's called the magnetosphere, a gigantic magnetic field generated by the planet's churning core.<eos> It extends out 43,000 miles.<eos> Just as a ring magnet repels another ring, Earth's magnetosphere repels the magnetized plasma from the Sun.<eos> A billion tons of superheated, electrically charged plasma hits our planet and, normally, just rolls around it.
Sally!<eos> Oh my God!<eos> - Oh, it's definitely working<eos> - You're good at that<eos> - Oh my God, he likes it!
Or pour paraffin over a parakeet and see if it'd fly twice as fast to put out the flames?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Well, I have.<eos> All of 'em and a lot more besides.<eos> The parakeet was my little sister's, and my mama caught me setting fire to it.
Instead she bought me a beautiful little kitten.<eos> She made me totally responsible for it.<eos> I had to feed it, worm it, pay for its vet bills, all that kind of stuff.<eos> She figured it'd teach me the value of life over death, so I guess it kind of did.<eos> Man, that little cat meant the world to me, and I looked after it like it was my own little baby.
- In its entire life...<eos> - ever since it was... a bit of meteorite... a million billion years ago...<eos> How the fuck did this get here?<eos> Up there in space... it's been waiting... to come here... right... right here.<eos> I've been moving towards it my whole life.
- Because of you.<eos> - Where do you even get off speaking to me like that?<eos> You have no idea what went wrong in that OR.<eos> Here's what I know. I know that you're new here. I know you probably still have a chip on your shoulder 'cause your parking space at Mercy West was better.<eos> And I know you're an anesthesiologist, which means you make buckets of money logging reasonable hours, sitting on your behind and flipping through Architectural Digest while somebody on the other side of the curtain does the real work, and gets sued for it.
Is he there?<eos> No, he left a while ago.<eos> Hey, did he forget his cell?<eos> He left it on purpose.<eos> Said he was done with it.
They were all over the appliance used to bludgeon Mr. Wolf to death.<eos> Are you talking about the rotary evaporator?<eos> My prints are on it because it's mine.<eos> I loaned it to him the day before yesterday.<eos> He said he needed it to make something really special.
What are you talking about?<eos> To take in Lucifer, it would be more than you've ever drunk.<eos> But... why?<eos> It strengthens the vessel.<eos> Keeps it from exploding.
I've been doin' the window frame to try and stop damp comin' in.<eos> Milk?<eos> Erm...no.<eos> Here be careful, there was a ruddy great rat in our coal hole last night.<eos> I hit it over head with me shovel and slung it in the yids' hole.
OK.<eos> Plan B.<eos> This is all wrong, isn't it?<eos> Dad marrying up, finding the good life on his own.<eos> You ran from your past, but you never turned your back on it.
It was injured, perhaps dying.<eos> It was having great difficulty breathing.<eos> There was a tall cliff behind me.<eos> And I had the sense that the animal had fallen a great distance.<eos> And I was standing over it with a large stick.
Amy is a sassy lady.<eos> She's really got a mind of her own. She doesn't tend to take the Doctor's word as gospel.<eos> She just has her own opinions on things and doesn't listen to everything he says and she questions him and challenges him all the time.<eos> That's what's lovely about this relationship.<eos> It's quite tempestuous because Amy's very strong willed and is not afraid to give the Doctor a clap across the face if he needs it.
I'm sending nypd a bill.<eos> - Knock yourself out. - Fin just found the real van.<eos> - Is the boy inside?<eos> - I hope not.<eos> Let me guess. No one saw who lit it up.
I mean it, Mom. I am done. I am packing my bags tomorrow morning, and I am going to find a college that I want to go to.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What college? Are you talking about Dartmouth?<eos> I don't know, Mom, but I'm certainly not telling you.<eos> I am tired of running away from my future. It's about time that I start running towards it, no matter how far from here it is!
Thanks.<eos> Candy cane?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Look, there's a serious situation with your peace-on-earth crystal.<eos> The containment lab is closing in on it.
And those moons tidally heated the interior and kept it molten, allowing currents to be generated and thus producing a magnetic field.<eos> Now, if a half a billion years after Mars' formation, those moons crashed into the planet, that could have destroyed the magnetic field.<eos> For most scientists, the pieces of the impact theory don't fit.<eos> Could satellites large enough to do such damage lose enough inertial energy to be captured in the first place?<eos> This idea that Mars had moons that crashed into it within the first half billion years is pretty unlikely, but it's not completely impossible.
Yeah, I foolishly believed that if I could find a way to travel through time then things would have improved, a utopia would have emerged, but here we are over a century later and things have actually gotten worse.<eos> The divide between rich and poor, hunger and famine, war and violence and hatred, all flourishing beyond control.<eos> Indeed men have found new ways to kill each other that were inconceivable in my day even by fiction writers.<eos> But millions of us are struggling against that every day.<eos> This planet needs a rest from what you've done to it.
It's hard.<eos> It's a hard life to be a stick insect.<eos> And what's that tree all about?<eos> Trees... dangerous trees.<eos> I was worried about scorpions and spiders and shit fucking tree with knives coming out of it.
Till he finds his next victim.<eos> Rai<eos> Captain say how long we'd be here?<eos> Nah.<eos> He's at the old precinct, trying to clean it up.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.<eos> Yes, your little flat. - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?<eos> And what are you, widowed or divorced?<eos> Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.<eos> That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
You have one.<eos> Be glad.<eos> It will be the war you die in.<eos> Tell the believers and the nonbelievers: Tell them we've taken the spring.<eos> They can have it back when they pray for it.
But it won't be here. We don't do that.<eos> That's a bit premature.<eos> Whatever happened to bail?<eos> That's up to the judge.<eos> Personally, I wouldn't count on it.
- This movie with a lot of wet...<eos> - Daya, maybe it's, uh, time to rest?<eos> Yeah, I just gotta get my gun back from Pidge.<eos> What?<eos> Still can't believe you let her have it and not me.
I was gonna leave a note, but I felt like this is more personal.<eos> You just gonna roll out here with this shit? Yeah.<eos> Dying's easy.<eos> Family's hard. Don't worry about me.<eos> When my Aunt Annie died, I had a cousin who flew 3,000 miles to go the wake, which made me look bad 'cause I lived a block away and I missed it.
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.<eos> Neither here nor there.<eos> I literally uprooted my entire life for this play. It's the only reason I'm here, sir.<eos> And the crazy part about this whole thing is it's actually really good... it is.<eos> But no one's gonna come see it, sir, unless you tell them to, so I am begging you, please... give us another chance.
Where's my Precious?<eos> Precious.<eos> Now, see, do you think that he is gonna fit in that basket?<eos> Get real.<eos> Look, Mrs. Hughes, if this is about the part of Clarice, I can't discuss it.
There's a scuffle.<eos> If he was all over my wife like that, I'd have something to say about it.<eos> Is it still going on?<eos> You and Margaret?<eos> You were going to end it.
I'm a little hungry.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> It... came off in the water.<eos> Came down to it or me, so...
Yeah!<eos> Too much?<eos> You know, people don't really need to see the inside.<eos> Whoever buys this house is just gonna tear it down.<eos> Then we're going down with it, like Benjamin Guggenheim in the Titanic.
That is obscene!<eos> I mean, James May is a wealthy man, but that bus driver has bought his car for him.<eos> Where's the justice in that?<eos> You're paying for his car.<eos> Do you know that? You have paid for it.
Pick it out, any color, you name it, it'll be tied up with a bow, and it'll be at your house tomorrow.<eos> And you say, "Well, what's the catch?"<eos> And the catch is... that it's the only car you're going to get in your lifetime.<eos> Now what are you going to do, knowing that that's the only car you're ever going to have and you love that car?<eos> You're going to take care of it like you cannot believe.
That is how we win!<eos> No, we win if Neolution is exposed, and Westmorland is stripped of his myth!<eos> Where's your smoking gun, Rachel?<eos> There's nothing for you here.<eos> Oh, you gave it
He talked a lot about a guy named J.P. Who's that?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> There's also a page missing.<eos> And?<eos> Did you remove it?
We'd have to come up with a solution in 24 hours.<eos> Weddings are expensive. You had me at six figures.<eos> Now, the Hechnian reentry capsule suffered computer failure due to a solar flare.<eos> Now, it is carrying an asteroid harvested by the Republic so it could be exploited for its heavy metals.<eos> The problem is, the capsule is gonna crash in about 20 hours, and with it, everything they've worked for will be lost.
You're looking at a guy that solved a triple murder in Cole Valley off a bent coke spoon.<eos> Can you make that any clearer?<eos> Not with the tools at hand.<eos> All right, send me a screen cap.<eos> I'll send it to Jenny. She'll work on it.
I don't want to be Troy Maxson!<eos> I just want to be me.<eos> You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.<eos> That shadow wasn't nothing but you growing into yourself.<eos> You either got to grow into it, or cut it down to fit you, but that's all you got to make a life with.
You were hard on that flight attendant first time out.<eos> You lay into her again like that?<eos> - But you do got one option.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Let her do it.
They're organized.<eos> They have a new leader.<eos> - His name is Marius.<eos> - I'm finished with this war.<eos> Well, it's not finished with you.
I need a drink.<eos> - How much do I owe you, buddy?<eos> - 12 bucks, pal.<eos> I always hated that palm tree.<eos> Never trusted it.
Well, later on, of course.<eos> When your body feels strong enough.<eos> Later on. Of course.<eos> Life.<eos> What can we expect from it?
Are you trying to say that God sent us that message in a bottle?<eos> What if it's true, Carl?<eos> If there is a force that protects us?<eos> Standing by in railcar 23, seats 33 and 34.<eos> That propels us all toward good if only we're open to it?
Can you break them down?<eos> In sum, according to qualitative analyses, Cartet remains the first choice of teachers. But sales figures give our competitors a big lead.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Our aim is to strengthen its quality as a reference book, while striving to meet market expectations.<eos> Look through it at home.
Is that what you really think happened?<eos> - Well, we found this interview with you from the LA Daily News.<eos> This... do you remember it?<eos> No.<eos> In it, you say you thought his death was very suspicious.
So, you... you retired... not just from HHM, but the law?<eos> That's not good, Chuck.<eos> The law... needs you.<eos> Just stop it.<eos> And you need it.
The Irish Citizen Army and I suppose this thing here is for taking a pop at agents of British oppression, yeah, people like me.<eos> How does it feel to be on the other end of it?<eos> Take it!<eos> Joke of a thing for a joke of an army.<eos> I want it and you out of here now, you're not welcome here anymore.
The Church needs people like you.<eos> - You don't know what I'm like.<eos> - I do, I can see it.<eos> You're the sort who lives for his faith.<eos> I don't live for my faith. I'll die for it.
Coal people... they're coming for us again.<eos> Nothing to get fitful about.<eos> - They just...<eos> - No! This time, they got bombs!<eos> This time, they blowing us all up, our homes, our chillun, this whole damn hill and everything on it, and not one of you would have knowed!
Only because her car is bust and she said she would...<eos> Tell me, why is your mother's car busted?<eos> - Tell me.<eos> Why?<eos> - She wrecked it.
We could take the contraption, but... we don't take him.<eos> I created the goddamned thing.<eos> Oh, you want to take credit for it all, huh?<eos> Dutch built it!<eos> She can run it.
A loose wire.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's see what we can find.<eos> ♪ Oh, where did you get that hat Oh, now your mother used to love this song.<eos> She would make me dance with her to it.
We all have our way.<eos> - People are trying to be nice.<eos> - People are full of shit.<eos> Uh, who brought that bubble water maker? Not her.<eos> The skinny one bought it.
With... With Ayla.<eos> - With everything.<eos> - You knew about her affair with your father before I confronted her.<eos> Yeah, but she didn't know that I knew!<eos> I made peace with it until you ruined it!
She was murdered three days ago.<eos> Look, I had no problem with her.<eos> Really?<eos> Because your wife is in jail because Drea Torres lost her case.<eos> Ms. Torres asked us to take the plea, but Carla refused because she didn't do it.
Wilbur ain't in his shadow no more.<eos> He'll be skipper of the Ironworks.<eos> Hackman spoke nought of this.<eos> All Hackman cares about is the team.<eos> He lives for it.
My wand.<eos> But how?<eos> Don't you keep it protected by magic?<eos> Blood magic.<eos> I locked it away to keep her safe from it, but I forgot the key.
Anyway, um, Raf and I have this glider.<eos> We love it because it is so comfortable, especially if you're gonna be up long nights, feeding the baby...<eos> I'm not worried about late nights.<eos> I have a night nurse.<eos> Oh, well, maybe she wants to sit in it.
I wouldn't even know how to begin.<eos> Baby steps, I guess.<eos> I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will always have the dent to remember it by.
If you're gonna give me the widow trick, please give me something I haven't seen on American telly.<eos> Anyone ever tell you, you have a really thick accent for an American?<eos> Everyone -- apart from my mum, who moved us back to London after I was born.<eos> Tragic story about your ex-wife.<eos> I wonder what she'd make of it.
- Okay.<eos> Bye, Robbie. Bye.<eos> Hey, Jessica.<eos> Here's that card.<eos> If this ship's going down, I'm going down with it.
I'm so confused by your question, that I'm just going to answer it, uh, directly.<eos> Yes, I've seen them.<eos> Hmm... but have you seen the cherry that I'm talking about?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I... the... I was with it, and then the cherry's gone.
Sophie's constantly using it to criticize me, so I disconnected her app.<eos> I mean, how many times can she yell at me to wash my hands after going to the bathroom?<eos> Every time?<eos> That doll is driving me crazy.<eos> Plus, I think I'm... starting to have feelings for it.
Just got married.<eos> Spent his honeymoon with me here training for an op.<eos> Nonstop sacrifice.<eos> Commander, there is something I need to know.<eos> Admiral Chernow has great confidence in the operation, but you're the one who has to lead it.
Seeing as it's your job.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> Why don't I do some digging and get back to you on that?<eos> Would you like a shovel?<eos> Only if you bring it, father.
Yeah.<eos> And after that, you went back inside?<eos> I called 911.<eos> Then this couple walked into the store, and I saw the weapon.<eos> You found it?
I'm "hangry" right now, and I would love to get some food.<eos> Find me the closest taco shop.<eos> Here's what I could find on how to make taco shells.<eos> No, not a recipe for taco shells.<eos> Now, not only does the machine talk to you, but you can talk to it.
All the time, he would just fall asleep on the couch, a cigarette hanging out his mouth.<eos> I'd go by and put it out.<eos> Then one night, not too long after, he fell asleep on the couch drunk as a skunk, that cigarette hanging out of his mouth.<eos> I got you and your brothers and sisters out of bed, and we went over to aunt mabel's to sleep.<eos> And that night, that house that I loved so much burned to the ground, and your Uncle Clyde burned right with it.
You'll lose a lot of friends in Congress.<eos> Let's force them to take sides.<eos> That means Jackie Sharp, too.<eos> Introduce legislation.<eos> She either votes for it or we hit her hard.
- But if his prints are on the inside, game over.<eos> - Oh. There's an envelope in the front seat, sir!<eos> Hey, can we just wait until the bomb guy gives the all clear?<eos> "The police are welcome to this car.<eos> Hope you have as much fun with it as I did."
If you'll come with me.<eos> With you where?<eos> Some place far away from here.<eos> Even without me,<eos> Starling still has heroes to watch over it.
You get twice as much sword.<eos> Who would want a single-edged sword?<eos> Maybe ask samurais.<eos> There's another thing I've been meaning to ask.<eos> If a cat had a white stripe painted down its back, would a skunk really fall in love with it?
This is a patient of Dr. Scott's?<eos> Yeah, and she's a real piece of work... bullied him into having a plastic surgeon in there making all of her cuts.<eos> - For a thyroid surgery?<eos> - Yeah. She must be persuasive.<eos> Well, that's one word for it.
The rest of the money's in a safety deposit box.<eos> Cheltenham Station.<eos> I expect he'll try and pick it up, with me indisposed.<eos> Then we'll make sure we're waiting for him.<eos> In the meantime, there's a cell in this station with your name on it.
Delivered to the office of Admiral Xavier Meade."<eos> November 1, 2012.<eos> Easy enough to make that disappear... no one was tracking it.<eos> Oh, yeah, but then Senator Gundersen comes along with her nomination. I mean, you couldn't very well bury it again.<eos> Not with so many political eyes on it.
Hopefully, you'll then start producing and distributing the vaccine, and we can get to the task of rebuilding our great nation.<eos> Godspeed.<eos> We have the cure, sir.<eos> Dr. Scott was able to produce it right here on this ship.<eos> Guess you wouldn't have any need for it yourself.
- Every dose is accounted for.<eos> - Not my problem, is it?<eos> I'll expect a call from you within 48 hours, telling me where and when I can get my medicine.<eos> The Mother Cell.<eos> - How do I even know you have it?
Without you, we are lost.<eos> We have rights on which we can't act.<eos> The door is closed to us.<eos> We are excluded from justice.<eos> Without you, we don't even know how to begin to find it.
Maddie!<eos> Hey, come on, now!<eos> Cut it out, you two!<eos> What's going on here?<eos> She stole my letter, and she started it.
What happened to it?<eos> I saw it on the floor when we first found her.<eos> I couldn't just leave it there, broken.<eos> And I... I didn't want to have to explain myself to get it back.<eos> So, you took it?
- Your stupid ship did it!<eos> - Don't blame my ship!<eos> - It melted a child!<eos> - My ship doesn't do anything...<eos> - It killed it itself!
Liv, come on, open up.<eos> (knocking) Olivia, open the door.<eos> Wait a sec.<eos> - Why is it locked?<eos> - Did she lock it?
- Really?<eos> Did you get in a fight?<eos> No, it fell out.<eos> Well, is the tooth fairy something I gotta deal with, or did your mom already handle it?<eos> She handled it.
Are we clear?<eos> We don't need you to be okay with this.<eos> Good.<eos> Jibril was a known critic of the House of Saud.<eos> As far as they're concerned, she did it.
This is only part of it.<eos> The rest still has to be decoded.<eos> - Who found this list? - Lydia.<eos> - How?<eos> - She wrote it.
The way white blood cells fight off bacteria or a virus.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Which is why I'm afraid that Mack's... most likely dead.<eos> There are other possibilities.<eos> What if the city didn't kill Mack, but co-opted him, made him a part of it?
The pace of the city has a lot to do with how we feel about things.<eos> Those paddle wheels make a distinctive rhythm.<eos> A streetcar going down St. Charles Avenue... making this clackety-clackety sound.<eos> We have become complacent with some old-world charm.<eos> Oh, man, when you get steeped in the history, you get seduced by it.
We have guns.<eos> Not Ellie.<eos> Uh... she packed hers.<eos> No, actually, mine's on me.<eos> Well, I-I thought you said you weren't comfortable traveling with it.
-Come on, man.<eos> -No, I mean, I'm...<eos> Here we go...<eos> The car I would take away from this and own happily and live in a cottage in Devon and rear geese is -the Alfa 4C.<eos> -Maybe walk through a park kicking through autumn leaves with it.
She's smoking hot.<eos> And when she gets pregnant, she's gonna stay hot, because Japanese women carry it all in their bellies.<eos> There might be a little spillover to the boobs, but that's it.<eos> You shouldn't share that theory with anyone.<eos> - She knows it.
Well, you're kind of nosy.<eos> Am I?<eos> I've gone on dates.<eos> Well, then you can go on one with this woman.<eos> And then you could tell me all about it. You could kiss her.
What? You heard me. You liked it.<eos> You like having sex with that thing more than you like having sex with me.<eos> (SCOFFS) Malcolm, I was asleep.<eos> Mm-hmm. Talk to the hand.<eos> I was... That's the hand. Talk to it.
Hey.<eos> Catherine still got her force field up after the whole Alex thing?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I never should have tried to make it work with Alex.<eos> You had a history, you needed to see it through.
Oh, yeah.<eos> I... I must have left it in my overcoat.<eos> So I'll see you later.<eos> Wait.<eos> Keep it.
I made sure she was protected.<eos> Is that why you were sent away?<eos> Look, whoever did this, how do you know he's not still molesting little girls?<eos> Because he swore to me he wouldn't.<eos> Well, he broke the law, and if you don't tell me his name, you're breaking it too!
We'll probably have to bring you in for questioning.<eos> But remember, we're the good guys.<eos> Just here to find out the truth.<eos> "Truth won't set you free, bitches."<eos> "I'm going to bury you with it."
She ain't going anywhere.<eos> Are you ready to give yourself to the pit, once and for all?<eos> Yes.<eos> The pit gives, and the pit takes away.<eos> It is an honor to go be with it, away from this earthly plane.
- It's our only option.<eos> - Well, what do we do when they turn on us?<eos> Because they will turn on us.<eos> - We'll just have to trust that we'll see it coming first.<eos> - Remember, April, your weapon chooses you As much as you choose it.
Ed Ross... adviser to the spirit world and renowned paranormal psychologist.<eos> I'm sure you must have heard of me.<eos> You have "renowned" on your business card, if that's what you mean.<eos> Uh, so, you want to tell me about this stuff?<eos> This "stuff," as you call it, are all the tools of my trade... paranormal-data recording equipment, mostly.
She tried to steal your song.<eos> Dixon... no.<eos> Ade wasn't trying to steal my song.<eos> She couldn't have.<eos> She wrote it.
Looks like Silver was right.<eos> Ade clawed her way back into the spotlight.<eos> No, dude, it's not like that.<eos> Ade wasn't trying to steal Michaela's song.<eos> Ade wrote it.
This is gonna ruin everything.<eos> Who the hell could have leaked that demo? ! Adrianna.<eos> Adrianna?<eos> She had nothing to do with the song.<eos> How could she leak it?
I couldn't tell you the day I went to the doctor.<eos> When I went, there wasn't a heartbeat. It was just gone.<eos> Dixon:<eos> Ade wasn't trying to steal Michaela's song;<eos> Ade wrote it.
Let me tell you a little story.<eos> Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn't very good at her job.<eos> It was you.<eos> But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial.<eos> She got it. Look, I was so jealous.
And he's repainting anyway, so I can pick the colors.<eos> I didn't want to go with the traditional blues or pinks, so I am trying to decide between baby turtle, Cancun sand, or Dorian Gray. Dorian Gray.<eos> That paint never gets old.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, I thought that this mold thing was going to be terrible, but it turns out I'm getting a whole remodel out of it.
With each person it takes, it gets smarter.<eos> More powerful.<eos> It's learning about us.<eos> We cannot tell what is real and what is our imagination.<eos> We believed we were studying this entity but this whole time, it's been studying us testing our defenses, our weaknesses.
May I offer you a ride?<eos> She's only a child, Ruthven.<eos> She knows how to ride, I dare say.<eos> Don't go with him.<eos> The pearl stays pure forever while the oyster's flesh rots around it.
I come from a poor, distant land in the Ganges Valley.<eos> They say you can get rich in Britain, so I decided to try my luck.<eos> What's that?<eos> A plant from back home.<eos> It grows all over. I feel less lonely with it.
So could you get permission tonight?<eos> Tonight?<eos> You want me to drive the car...<eos> You want me to drive, tonight, with it?<eos> You in it?
It is you, my queen.<eos> Yet another kingdom falls to your glory.<eos> Is there no end to your power and beauty?<eos> So poisonous was the reign of Ravenna, that nature turned on itself, and people turned on each other.<eos> The land died, and with it, hope.
- Oh really? Check-out G.I. Joe.<eos> Is that kind of welcome normal here?<eos> What do those guys want?<eos> Well, obviously Humbert's tablet.<eos> They must know you have it.
Think of the lives saved just 24 hours ago with the drone strike you ordered.<eos> Using the new drone fuel.<eos> Was that an attempt to embroil me in this conspiracy?<eos> It's not as if it's your first, Prime Minister.<eos> I hope to God that you've held on to your body armour, General. Cos you're going to need it.
Mr. Bohannon, has anyone ever told you what an insufferable ass you are?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, boys, let's get this spur finished.<eos> Hey!<eos> That must be some fine tail if you're willing to risk your neck twice for it.
Keith, don't!<eos> Don't!<eos> Do you think I'm going to sit there and watch, while the murderer of my son is awarded a medal for bravery?<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Oh, so you took it, did you, Keith?
Uh, after one particular blow up, Mother wanted to make peace. She gave me a black orchid.<eos> Oh! Very delicate flower, the orchid.<eos> Well, I was determined to let it die out of some form of foolish protest.<eos> So I refused to water it, denied it light, and yet, day after day, it thrived.<eos> And then I saw someone tending to it.
I don't understand.<eos> It can't start this month, because we're already half way in.<eos> I understand how a magazine subscription works.<eos> I don't understand how my son could give away my home.<eos> He did not give it away, he just put it in her name.
"Why do I have any right "getting stressed out about anything when I know that that light is waiting for me?"<eos> And here's the thing, it's not just when you die.<eos> I think it's here.<eos> I think it's all around us.<eos> And it's just waiting for us to tap into it.
Oh yes, and all because you're irresponsible!<eos> No I'm -- well, not with the car...<eos> - Sterling, you left it unlocked in an unattended garage!<eos> - I don't, um...<eos> - She took it.
Up at the Rollins Savanna Forest Preserve.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> The snowmobile-- it just started changing directions.<eos> Okay, Grant, slow down.<eos> Were you steering it toward the trees?
Potassium... check.<eos> Lisa, medic...<eos> That means ace bandages, antiseptic wash, and a pint of my blood from the downstairs freezer just in case.<eos> You bank blood in the downstairs freezer?<eos> Every day at approximately 3:45, the mail came, and with it came the hope that I'd get good news about the internship I applied for.
As you can see, the hits just keep on coming.<eos> You think this might be one of your gang.<eos> What's her name, Sonya, the medic?<eos> Could be any one of them.<eos> But if medical skills are required she's the one providing it.
Whenever I appear as the Grandmaster everyone acts nothing but courteous I can't see the other side of them<eos> Dressed up like this no one will recognize me It allows me to see my true self<eos> Howdy Grandmaster<eos> Chen-style kung fu comes from daily life and is integrated into life<eos> The way to live life is to adapt to nature and learn from it
I don't really know how I'm supposed to talk about him anymore.<eos> Well, we all have a few of those.<eos> You can't give up, then!<eos> My affirmation of the day was, "The answer lies within your reach.<eos> It's up to you to move toward it."
I put the peanut butter on my balls and let the zebra lick my ding-dong.<eos> I love that zebra.<eos> I loved it since the day I met him.<eos> The zebra loves me!<eos> I want to have zebra babies with it.
I had to come clear across the airport looking for you.<eos> - Sorry. I just got the call.<eos> - Uh-huh, sure you did.<eos> Can we just get him on the truck, please?<eos> It's not exactly flight attendant duty. Why have they got you handling it?
Hell no.<eos> She's a hot mess. Girl causes nothing but damn trouble.<eos> What kind of trouble?<eos> Last night, she drove off in Cassandra's car.<eos> Everybody knew Cassandra's whole life was in that car. She couldn't function without it.
Your place isn't far from here, right?<eos> Uh, yeah. Sure.<eos> Come.<eos> What about your bike?<eos> She'll look after it.
Girlfriend?<eos> He was having an affair?<eos> With a Natalia Roosevelt.<eos> She's a local.<eos> The wife got wind of it, sent him up here to break it off.
For the love of God.<eos> But if you need somebody to talk to, I'm here.<eos> You know, maybe you could help.<eos> There's this girl that I'm interested in.<eos> And I am really not sure how to pursue it.
Standard banter.<eos> Look, I've done some shit here that at any other school would definitely get me fired.<eos> Maybe even arrested.<eos> But Fraser has never shouted at me, never got me in trouble.<eos> And, you know, he loves this school, he'd do anything for it, it's his life. And,
Whatever's going through your mind right now, this is not the answer.<eos> They're calling us traitors.<eos> Everyone thinks I'm a coward.<eos> No one thinks that, son.<eos> I'm taking back this boat and returning it to my country, or I will die on the bottom with it.
Vice is gonna have a field day with this.<eos> I have to admit, this is the best-looking room of suspects I've ever seen.<eos> Great. Then you'll have a good time sussing out if any of them are carrying.<eos> Or if any of them will cop to having a relationship with Nicholas.<eos> Do you think she's in on it?
The people elected me to represent them, to lead them, and I lead.<eos> You ought to try it.<eos> I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens and I have tried to profit from the example of it, but<eos> if I'd listened to you, I'd have declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter.<eos> And the border states would have gone over to the Confederacy, the war would have been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery as we hope to do in two weeks, we'd be watching, helpless as infants, as it spread
But you wouldn't.<eos> I'll do or say anything if I believe in it.<eos> But I have to believe in the cause.<eos> You'll make a lousy consultant when you're out of this line of work.<eos> Well, I won't be out of this line of work as long as you're in it, sir.
You're a good man, Michael.<eos> You have a good soul.<eos> Defend it.<eos> Guard it.<eos> Cherish it.
It's just--it's bloops and scratches.<eos> But it's not a voice.<eos> It's her language.<eos> And she's the only one that can speak it.<eos> She invented it.
That stuff's bad news.<eos> I am done with it.<eos> It's not for me.<eos> It's for Steph, and it's her birthday.<eos> She asked me for it.
[GUNSHOT]<eos> [SPEAKING IN FRENCH]<eos> [EXHALES]<eos> He has no further need of that pistol.<eos> Why don't you take it and cover the stairs?
My name is Roger Brown.<eos> I am 1.68 m.<eos> You do not need a psychologist to understand that it must be compensated.<eos> My house, for example. Ceiling: 30 million.<eos> I do not like it, and can't afford it.
What's your favourite toy?<eos> Oh, that's an easy one.<eos> Hands down, LEGO, because of the infinite possibilities.<eos> You know, you could make a house or a plane or a ship.<eos> You name it!
What if you're tracking the wrong person?<eos> - Dana Gray was here.<eos> - You think she took the bomb?<eos> Why would she do that? No.<eos> She didn't take it.
- Could you imagine?<eos> - Have you gentlemen decided?<eos> Hello.<eos> How'd you get this section? I thought you were down there.<eos> Well, I'll be covering this section today, unless of course you want to handle it.
She wore a red sweatshirt, jeans, sneakers. Mm-hmm.<eos> Um, thin, uh, Jean jacket, cap, blue eyes.<eos> And what did he say?<eos> He told me to get down on the ground, and then-- was the door open?<eos> She opened it.
Ok.<eos> - Do you like rock music?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I am an old rocker.<eos> She didn't take it.
Who is Tom Starling?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> You borrowed a gun from the armoury this morning.<eos> Where's yours?<eos> - She's got it!
Long enough for the Captain to have run out of grog.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> If this is the Captain, then what's the siren?<eos> Same as us. A stowaway.<eos> She killed it?
A lot of tchotchkes.<eos> Salad bowls, wooden trays, men's jewelry boxes, That kinda stuff.<eos> The box from Russell's desk is gone.<eos> What?<eos> She took it?
Yeah, and so am I. We both contain the knowledge of over 900 years of memory and experience.<eos> We both wear the same bow tie, which is cool.<eos> - Because bow ties are...<eos> - And always will be.<eos> But how did the Flesh read you? Because you weren't linked up to it.
My second novel was just rejected.<eos> The board in Dallas wants to cut your column.<eos> I quit.<eos> The magazine doesn't need me any more and I don't need it.
Why don't you just tear off a little corner and let me give it up gradually?<eos> King me.<eos> So where did you put my blanket?<eos> I put it in the hall closet and locked the door.<eos> We'll see if you can do without it until dinner.
Get it all down in your nooks and crannies.<eos> Someone's gotten pretty oily...<eos> So, hey, hate to interrupt your conversation...<eos> It wasn't a conversation, Lana.<eos> I was just talking to my gun, not with it.
My necklace is gone.<eos> It's not in there at all?<eos> No.<eos> Do you think she took it?<eos> Yes, I think she took it.
Box on the ground.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm gonna shoot it, and we can get out of here.<eos> Come on.<eos> If you kill the box, then the truth dies with it.
They can't take the mask.<eos> And I know, to you, it's just a mask.<eos> And I know how I must look.<eos> You don't look --<eos> I kept this for 25 years by fighting for it.
No one shall enter the building.<eos> It is extremely dangerous.<eos> Okay, thank you. That's it.<eos> Keith Johnstone says that we get into trance when we put the mask.<eos> For a moment we are obsessed by it .
And apparently it's day three without caffeine for Officers Shaw and Swarek.<eos> Whoever caffeinates first pays the tab at the Penny tonight.<eos> (Sam) Your stupid idea.<eos> (Oliver) You know what?<eos> It was my wife's stupid idea, dude, and you didn't have to agree with it. All right, people.
It's the quality. He moves overseas, it's gonna kill the goose that laid the goddamn golden engine.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you didn't get emotionally attached to the client.<eos> I'm emotionally attached to me.<eos> Look, I made a bet that this company would grow and my billables would grow with it.
Where is Anna now?<eos> I don't know, ok?<eos> I don't even know for sure if she took the necklace.<eos> She was the only person who heard us talking about it.<eos> Of course she took it.
The family appreciates everything you've done In this terrible time.<eos> Can't say that enough.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Thank you, and I sure do love that song.<eos> - Is it true you wrote it?
Of course not.<eos> It's obviously just a cruel prank, but I still wanna know who's responsible.<eos> It had to be someone who knew about the original note. Well, let's see.<eos> Obviously there's Martha Huber.<eos> Obviously she didn't send it.
They put out a list of license plates once a month.<eos> So you found the car, started following it.<eos> Why didn't you radio for backup?<eos> It all happened so fast.<eos> We saw the car, changed lanes behind it, we turned the corner, and we were short stopped.
You get pretty close to someone when you spend that much time with them.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> We'd get into it a lot-- differences of opinion-- but even in the middle of that, there was...<eos> Heat?<eos> Did she feel it, too?
The point is, you can't choose where you were born, but you can choose where you live.<eos> I love this town.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.<eos> And that's why I wrote a book about it.
Honey, I gotta go be a mom now.<eos> I know it's just a manic Monday, but I can't be up burning the eternal flame.<eos> Don't try to talk to me in bangles titles.<eos> My life's just evolving, okay?<eos> We just gotta evolve with it.
I figured she should be part of this discussion.<eos> There is no discussion.<eos> Agreed.<eos> If you truly want to protect the Warehouse, you must destroy the coin.<eos> Destroy the coin, and whatever Sykes wants from me will be lost with it.
The truth is, I broke up with Zoe not because of you but because she's really, really annoying and volatile... and negative.<eos> And a little bit of a slutty lush.<eos> Well, I hope you're in the mood for tuna.<eos> He... Merry Christmas, George.<eos> Oh, uh... I hope George made his bed, because it looked like he was gonna have to lay in it...
Yes, your sister has a faulty picker. But we don't know for sure that this particular dirtbag is a thief.<eos> Thank you, mom.<eos> Fine, let's pretend that we haven't lost several major appliances after one of Victoria's conjugal visits.<eos> Yeah, I do miss that Margarita machine.<eos> My night stand looks naked without it.
- Is it?<eos> - Get off my back about it, Ders. I washed her.<eos> - You did-like when- how many days did you- ago did wash it? - Yeah, no, I just threw her in the dishwasher, put it on, like, the heavy pot scrubbing mode. - Okay.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> I'm, like, itching already just thinking about it. - She's not a sex doll because none of us are having sex with it.
No, it's not.<eos> I understand perfectly.<eos> You came back here to recover a murder weapon.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> All right, then. You...tossed it for someone else.
Let's talk to him.<eos> Is there any news?<eos> As a matter of fact, there is.<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, we'd rather talk to you about it in private.
Even if she had that power, why did she leave out?<eos> Maybe all this has been armed by the NSA to get it.<eos> She does not work for the NSA.<eos> See, she never made the union complete with you, right?<eos> Just because I do not know every micro detail about it... not to say that I does not know, okay?
Hello?<eos> Sam, it's me.<eos> I want you to keep the line open.<eos> I want to hear everything that's going on in there, you understand?<eos> If you get ugly, the line goes dead, your wife goes dead with it, you understand?
He was about to throw me out.<eos> Hardly.<eos> You impressed him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Filis contemplated alone, at midnight a candle whilst she worked under its flame for a white moth flirted around it.
She said the painting was an irreplaceable treasure, but the Gallery had simply not been able to match the overseas bid.<eos> We agreed on 900.<eos> 900,000 or I keep it.<eos> All right, fine, you asked for it.<eos> I'm keeping it.
- Please do not hurt yourself.<eos> - Where's the car?<eos> Was in the garage. Together.<eos> True.<eos> I'll take it with me.
It's a trapped creature.<eos> Maybe it'll just... I don't know, hang out and chill.<eos> It's violent, remorseless, relentless.<eos> It won't give up ground without a fight.<eos> Think of it as facing me.
Yeah, I can manage.<eos> - Good luck to you, James.<eos> - Thanks, doc, for everything.<eos> James!<eos> If the island's going down, I'm going down with it.
- Because she stole my cow pen.<eos> - But are you sure she stole it? - Yeah.<eos> Because mine used to keep jamming and then the next day she wrote with it. And it kept jamming. Just like mine.<eos> And she said it was brand new.<eos> But I know she took it from me.
THEL: I had him!<eos> Commander you fool!<eos> Athousand hells await you!<eos> MASTER chief: They're scuttling the ship.<eos> And uswith it.
Sheila Jackson-White, Channel 9.<eos> Have you had a chance to form an opinion about Roy Colburn's resolution to try Lost Boys in adult court?<eos> - You want my opinion?<eos> It's a barking-at-the-moon resolution offered for cynical and divisive purposes.<eos> - So you're against it?
Get it through your head- he's a manipulator.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> What about you? Where the hell did you get all the money To get all this shit if you didn't take it?<eos> - None of your fucking business.<eos> - See, rene? She took it.
To get my mind off it. Dr. Cox, may I ask you a question?<eos> Do you see that shadow? Over there?<eos> Do you see how it's just quietly standing Against the wall, not askingnane questions That make me crave the sweet taste a hollow-point bullet?<eos> That's you-- a dumb, quiet shadow.<eos> Act like it.
You're over the hump.<eos> - Nice, Jim.<eos> - Hey, I try.<eos> I'm no you.<eos> But then came night five, and with it, trouble.
I have never shown anyone the proof of my discovery.<eos> In fact... the film was not even developed.<eos> I was obsessed with this new creature.<eos> I tried to chase it down while it leapt from branch to branch.<eos> I tried to communicate with it.
You ready to scrub in?<eos> I have a valve replacement.<eos> You know, I...<eos> Yang is still here.<eos> Can she do it?
That can't be a coincidence.<eos> Bobby Mann had a history of heart disease and on the autopsy reports it states that the cause of death was a heart attack.<eos> That can't be a coincidence either.<eos> - Did Lanie do the autopsy? - No.<eos> But she sent it to me.
Did you read the prophecy? Mmm-hmm.<eos> What did you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's only far-fetched if it isn't true.<eos> Don't tell me you believe in it, too?
I'll give him that.<eos> Look. I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but once more, I shall try.<eos> This fly is a major problem for us.<eos> It will ruin our batch.<eos> And we need to destroy it and every trace of it so we can cook.
Oh, hi, Eddie.<eos> Remember me? I...<eos> I brought you a little something.<eos> I'm not supposed to open the door.<eos> Well, tell your mom I'm here, and she can open it.
After a while, the shooting stops.<eos> And the baby isn't crying anymore.<eos> And I played dead until they set fire to the store and then leave.<eos> Somehow I was able to get out.<eos> I went back to my house, and it was burned down too.
Just anxioi guess.<eos> Why did I didn't say your relationship end? Nstable.<eos> Objection.<eos> Relevance.<eos> You started it, mr. Resnick.
Two-credits-into- a-music-major Chang?<eos> Ok, how about not calling me anything?<eos> Why are you guys in this class?<eos> We chose it together.<eos> The real question is, why are you in it?
I never joke.<eos> This picture tells a story, professor.<eos> I don't see myself in that story.<eos> No, but you see the case.<eos> And now you've got it.
Don't what?<eos> Don't overthink it, okay?<eos> That feeling in your gut... you gotta learn to listen to it.<eos> It's telling you what you need to do.<eos> You gotta learn to trust it.
Come on.<eos> Be nice!<eos> Are you having trouble?<eos> This machine doesn't like old bills.<eos> Or it doesn't like me, which is nuts because I've never been anything but nice to it.
- Hey, sir!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My car is ready. Hey.<eos> Thank you, man.<eos> Appreciate it.
He was bringing us some statue worth 200 grand.<eos> So you and Danny killed Landon and took the statue.<eos> No.<eos> No, why take it when he was gonna give it to us?<eos> Maybe you took it, Murphy.
Fine.<eos> You can if you want to, but they'll ignore you.<eos> Wow.<eos> Then I quit.<eos> The magazine doesn't need me anymore and frankly I don't need it.
Come quickly...<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> The thing about marriage, it's not a simple case of love.<eos> It was so deplorable.<eos> That camera... you were going to sell it, but you wanted to look good in front of your girl friend so you didn't sell it.
There it is!<eos> I worked hard on this formula.<eos> I hope it's worth.<eos> I do not know what happens to me, Len.<eos> I've fallen surrendered to it.
Your soul is resisting.<eos> Wha- What do you mean, the soul is resisting?<eos> They have a strange capacity of resistance.<eos> Oh, for Chrissake. What-What do we do now?<eos> You have to look inside and reconnect to it.
You need an agent.<eos> You are excellent.<eos> Now, what will you do to act?<eos> What are you willing to sacrifice for your art, son? Yes?<eos> Are you willing to die for it?
You are excellent.<eos> Now, what will you do to act?<eos> What are you willing to sacrifice for your art, son? Yes?<eos> Are you willing to die for it?<eos> Are you willing to cry for it?
Now, what will you do to act?<eos> What are you willing to sacrifice for your art, son? Yes?<eos> Are you willing to die for it?<eos> Are you willing to cry for it?<eos> Are you willing to lose your manhood for it?
Tonight we fight on yours terms, my brother.<eos> But the mornings comes and with it my death.<eos> When we'll meet again, will be on my terms.<eos> -My brother die on a battlefield with honor.<eos> The only way deal with the night like last night, was to try not to deal with it at all.
Someone has got some very powerful magic.<eos> Someone very close by.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - What?<eos> I know my sword, and this isn't it.
No wife, no kids.<eos> Used to say he was the company. His very blood pumped through the building.<eos> Wow, okay.<eos> So slight workaholic.<eos> Maybe he's still here, you know, watching over the company even killing for it.
She was an addict. She killed herself.<eos> We talked to Haley's boyfriend.<eos> He told us about the stash of meth Haley was holding for him.<eos> It was hidden in her room.<eos> And when it went missing, they figured, you found it, flushed it.
Why you're so pushy?<eos> I've promised to so many people!<eos> That's your problem, isn't it?<eos> Listen.<eos> When the first time you made me... a sculpture of a pregnant woman? I didn't tell you who paid for it, right?
I read about it in yourIast book.<eos> I bought the deluxe DVD issue.<eos> Did you read it?<eos> No, mywife is reading it.<eos> tell me about it.
Give me Megan first.<eos> Now, show me the stuff.<eos> How do I know it's real?<eos> Stop!<eos> Send her over with it.
- I'm confused, though;<eos> like, I just, I mean... at least tell me what brought you here this morning.<eos> I don't know that it matters, but I got this picture in my head about the night that your mom disappeared.<eos> And yeah, there was someone named Harmony in it.<eos> Although... that makes no sense and... and actually you were in it.
What deal?<eos> He said he can show me ways to manage the condition.<eos> And in return I said I'd let him meet you two. But that's great!<eos> It's not great, because now it's here.<eos> Isn't it bad enough this thing happens to me once a month, can't I have somewhere I can hide from it?
Okay, okay... would you just stop this ?<eos> Enough !<eos> Would you...<eos> I thought we were done with this nonsense.<eos> - She started it !
I don't know what is best.<eos> We have a conscience for a reason.<eos> Birds don't have one, as far as I can see.<eos> Dogs don't show much sign of living by one.<eos> We are given our conscience, because if we don't live by it, it hurts.
Your quest is to leave this place and marry Elizabeth.<eos> The beast is wounded and likely to die.<eos> Honour is satisfied.<eos> Well, you know where it is?<eos> Take me to it!
Don't you, sergeant?<eos> Do it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Harry. Did you know the house was going to be demolished?<eos> And your garden with it?
- No, she isn't, Pierce. No.<eos> She's the bane.<eos> You were prolific under her roof.<eos> So I need you to face your fear and write a poem about your mother.<eos> And we will go over and invite ourselves to her little party and you will read it in front of all her fancy friends.
Let's hope they can turn it around before Rockville Center on Wednesday.<eos> Poor Jack... he'll be beside himself.<eos> He shouldn't have had the puck in the first place.<eos> I mean, Kyle had his man beat.<eos> He should have shot it.
Please note that down.<eos> Ten thousand francs debited the account of the Duke d'Orleans.<eos> There's no greater pleasure than losing somebody else's money.<eos> I was hot on her heels, the scent of victory in my nostrils.<eos> Then the stag fell into the ditch and I fell in with it
If Marcel has seen something similar...<eos> Then we're all on the chopping block.<eos> I need to purify you both. No!<eos> Not yet.<eos> If the Hollow can look into me, then I can look back at it, find out what it is, what it wants.
_<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> You don't want to... do...<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> If you have the baby, how are you gonna take care of it?
Ugh, there's a baby here?<eos> If I weren't already stoned, I'd drive somewhere else.<eos> My bad.<eos> Yeah, see,<eos> I thought we were gonna compare notes on bedtimes and how asleep a baby has to be to have sex in front of it.
Or worse.<eos> Then Syd came.<eos> She woke me up.<eos> The monster realized it couldn't hide anymore.<eos> And it...
Okay, let's go.<eos> You got to pay your tab there, Drunky McSlurry Bum.<eos> Put it on Uncle Jack's tab.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Make him pay for it.
You just have to try, you just have to cut people open.<eos> Resecting the tumor load out of your heart will help your symptoms and buy you time.<eos> Yeah, this tumor, it's just, uh... it's part of me.<eos> It's like my hair or my boobs or my weird-looking toes.<eos> I made room for it.
What's that all over his face?<eos> It's radiation poisoning.<eos> McGarrett!<eos> McGarrett, get in here!<eos> I think we got it.
I told you it was a weird one.<eos> So our burglars moonlight as killers now?<eos> No. The body was already dead.<eos> Yeah, they stole it from a mortuary.<eos> They wanted to make sure all eyes were on it instead of on this.
Into a baby hybrid?<eos> But how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But this egg, I think it's calling for help.<eos> The razorbacks have come for it.
You attached the beacon to a drone with a bum fuel cylinder.<eos> - We had to rescue it. - So where are the hybrids?<eos> Oh, they're here, trying to bash their way into the plane.<eos> We're going to fly back to Mexico and drop this beacon into the volcano.<eos> And the hybrids along with it.
- And that's just one of the amendments.<eos> - I know them well.<eos> "Rebellion," "invasion." That can mean anything.<eos> That's a blank check for the federal government to suspend our rights for any reason.<eos> The world has changed, Iris, and this country has to change along with it.
Oh, well.<eos> I'm sure the kids took him to their room.<eos> - They love that bear.<eos> - They do?<eos> Now that Devon's gone, I'm sure they're gonna be fightin' over who's gonna sleep with it.
And war.<eos> This is not conjecture.<eos> This is a fact.<eos> One way or another, our world is coming to an end.<eos> The question is, will we end with it?
That I wanted someone to make me laugh, so I could feel good?<eos> You're not the only one who's got wants and needs.<eos> But I held on to you, Troy.<eos> I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you.<eos> I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it.
But I can't disappear.<eos> But I don't want to leave you.<eos> Honey, look.<eos> No one ever saw that dragon again.<eos> And I never told another tale about it.
Martha won't die tonight.<eos> Master Wayne.<eos> Alfred.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry for listening in, but I've tracked the Russian's phone to a warehouse near the port.<eos> You're locked onto it.
Your name.<eos> You didn't ask for it.<eos> It was given, when you were born.<eos> That's it!<eos> Knowing the demon's name gives us power over it and we can cast it out.
My father's message, I've seen it.<eos> They call it the Death Star.<eos> But they have no idea... there's a way to defeat it.<eos> You're wrong about my father.<eos> He did build it.
Stay in there.<eos> Baby, where'd you put my phone?<eos> I want to call your dad.<eos> I think it's in my bag.<eos> He took it?
I'm just thinking about work.<eos> Well, it's obvious that you're married to your job.<eos> You know what?<eos> I am.<eos> And I want to have kids with it and grow old with it.
Well, it's obvious that you're married to your job.<eos> You know what?<eos> I am.<eos> And I want to have kids with it and grow old with it.<eos> And when it's too old to remember who I am anymore, I want to read it stories, and then I want to be buried next to it under the old apple tree in front of the precinct.
Yeah, but what's the fire got to do with Tommy?<eos> There were these rumours that he'd started it.<eos> It was the gossip that got to him the most.<eos> People he'd known all his life believing he could do a thing like that.<eos> There's no proof he did it.
And I hear him howl like he hurt himself.<eos> I ran out and found him on the ground covered with some kind of... crust.<eos> I took his hand...<eos> and we saw flashes ... random events, ending with a horrific car crash.<eos> - He sees it, too?
Can't you tell by all my colorful Post-it notes?<eos> So, you're giving up.<eos> You know, when I wanted the show back, you fought me tooth and nail, but now that it's a little weirdo and dick for brains, you're just gonna hand it over to them?<eos> This show is our baby.<eos> We got to fight for it.
Yes.<eos> Describe him, the orderly.<eos> Nondescript.<eos> Look at his face now.<eos> Let your eyes move over it.
You too have a talent.<eos> And God doesn't want you to hide it.<eos> Father... you've just mentioned his talent.<eos> Yet for years no one's cared about him.<eos> What does talent have to do with it ?
What did Danny have to say about that'?<eos> He won't be the problem.<eos> The problem will be getting AFOs to work with him.<eos> He's not the easiest skipper, but he's good at his job.<eos> I'm learning loads from him. So I'd rather keep at it.
My book.<eos> The Lumen!<eos> I warned you. A half strigoi is still a strigoi.<eos> The Born.<eos> He took it?
Thank you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Are you at my house? I found the backpack.<eos> The dead kid's best friend, a nice young man named Liam.<eos> He took it.
And you are the sweetest, most gentle man in the world.<eos> I know you're not a killer.<eos> Spence Westmore, you're under arrest for the murder of Peri Westmore.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, he didn't do it!
For the record:<eos> I am absolutely convinced that it's time for a woman to captain a Constitution-class vessel.<eos> But with respect to Commander Garrett... I'm not convinced she is that woman.<eos> The board's damaged.<eos> I'll need to bypass it to access the ship's logs.
Rest assured, we will not stop.<eos> They're just trying to scare us. They got nothing.<eos> They got nothing.<eos> According to our research, the website was made on a gateway computer.<eos> He bought it!
Mission control is over a mile from the launchpad, so camera surveillance is all they're seeing of the rocket.<eos> You know, I hate to point this out, but in Speed,<eos> Dennis Hopper spotted that the film was looped; it didn't work.<eos> That was only because there was repetitive patterns to the bus passengers' movement.<eos> The rocket's a motionless, stand-alone object-- nothing around it's moving.
The lead drone's computer will automatically readjust to get it through the narrow static pass.<eos> Right through here.<eos> What about the rest of the drones?<eos> Based on the flight pattern that I saw, the drug runners have a single pilot controlling the lead drone.<eos> Now, the rest link up to it remotely and fly in formation.
Shannon, why don't you show Mimi your science project?<eos> She made an erupting volcano.<eos> Actually, I haven't done it yet.<eos> What?<eos> ! But your volcano is gonna win the blue ribbon, and we are gonna take a picture with it as a family.
Oh, I almost forgot.<eos> This funeral was paid for on the card, which earned Mr. Neiderhoff this Discovery card beach towel.<eos> Yay!<eos> Thank you.<eos> He would have wanted to be buried with it.
What do you mean, "What does he look like?"<eos> He's a giant pig named James Franco.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> It's my friends' pig, and-and I only just now realized how much it means to them, so... I need it back.<eos> They need it back.
Forgot my phone.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just don't know whether or not to start episode eight, because we were watching it together, you know, and... Oh. Oh.
Wendy!<eos> Wendy?<eos> So, the secret to this is to go slow.<eos> This ragu needs love, patience, and commitment.<eos> I want to eat it. I don't wanna settle down and have kids with it.
This is the old way. The way women have taken care of women and their babies since time out of mind.<eos> Now, unbutton your shift.<eos> Now all you need to do is lie down on your side.<eos> I love this baby so much.<eos> And you're doing what's best for it.
He talked about a 3-year-old crime he wasn't witness to.<eos> A few small-time BEs.<eos> It's good.<eos> You got him talking.<eos> Now we get him talking specifics... the next job, his role in it.
Yes, sir.<eos> And Mr. Reid... now that Mr. Shine's last actions have delivered him into your custody, does he speak?<eos> He does not.<eos> And never mind what Mr. Shine did to him, it's... it's as if the marrow has been sucked from his bones.<eos> Well, betrayal, he has suffered... a perception of it, at least.
Without it, you will remember everything that you did.<eos> I ain't having this Mass shit. No more.<eos> No way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... Maybe you should see what life would be like without it.
She's been on the road with you like a dozen times.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Brendan knew about the aneurysm.<eos> - That's what we usually call suspicious.<eos> - It means he didn't do it.
Yes, Majesty.<eos> I am a warrior in His Majesty's horde.<eos> Somewhere there, this heart beats.<eos> And Rannus did one thing right.<eos> His anchor is going to lead us right to it.
What?<eos> Did you do this?<eos> No.<eos> No, I did not, but this is what I'm trying to tell you is that I'm gonna take the blame for it when it was her asshole husband who did this shit.<eos> He did it.
A miniature horse, really.<eos> Tiny as a dog.<eos> And he had a trainer work with it for half a year.<eos> And then he brought you to the stables, to this sweet little horse.<eos> And when you went to it, it did as it had been trained and bowed its head.
Many hours later, and with no help at all from Spider-Man, the roof was finally off and the bat was free to move.<eos> But would it?<eos> Why doesn't it go and live in there?<eos> Because, let's be honest, that's perfect if you're a bat.<eos> Yeah, well, it might, but it's got to decide to do so.
You know that Cal U football player that was killed? Mm-hmm.<eos> Jason Moore. Yeah.<eos> I saw him rush for 250 yards against Monroe his senior year.<eos> Last night, my brothe was arrested for his murder.<eos> He didn't do it.
No.<eos> Right.<eos> - You want my professional advice?<eos> You don't stop evil.<eos> You can only protect yourself from it.
Oh, I'm going to do that am I?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sarah, you don't have to do everything she tells you.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> If I even see a hint of a dinosaur I'm going to personally feed you to it.
And wants to possess her?<eos> Usually, entities of this type, living in the dark, they want to possess the bodies of the living so that they can leave the dark and return to life.<eos> But there's another kind of a spirit.<eos> It's an even worse kind.<eos> One that does not wanna leave the dark, that wants the souls of the living to join it in the shadows.
There's 130 acres out there, George, they can be anywhere.<eos> I need you to find their location somehow.<eos> Sophia was worried about Tessa.<eos> She had Lindy load malware into Tessa's phone.<eos> He took it.
You fool yourself if you think you conquer pain.<eos> You cannot conquer pain.<eos> Pain is key.<eos> You cannot work against it.<eos> You must work with it.
No. At least let them know where you are and that you're alright.<eos> No.<eos> What about your boyfriend?<eos> No!<eos> When he sees the baby, he's going to fall madly in love with it.
I promise you I am here for you and your baby, and everything's going to be alright.<eos> Nothing happens in obstetrics and gynaecology without my say-so.<eos> Those were my exact words.<eos> It was an emergency.<eos> When he sees the baby, he's going to fall madly in love with it.
You know that Sunil Merchandani?<eos> He just stole from me.<eos> Took me a month to write that essay.<eos> Vocational packages, that subject is enormous.<eos> Now he's gone and taken it.
It's on its way to the DA's desk right about now.<eos> What?<eos> You...?<eos> - You thief. - Takes one to know one, doesn't it?<eos> You took it?
Approaching Daytona.<eos> How do you know?<eos> NASCAR.<eos> A twister's forming at one o'clock!<eos> Well, head towards it.
Having secrets no one would understand.<eos> I didn't write my first book.<eos> My friend.<eos> - The one who died.<eos> - He wrote it?
Let's get you back in your proper body, though I'll likely have to torture Freya and Esther to do so, which actually might be quite fun.<eos> No, Nik.<eos> I'm staying put.<eos> Eva's gone for good, but her body, this body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> I can feel it, and if I leave it, then it dies, and Davina and the others die with it.
Previously on "The Originals"...<eos> We take Hope and the pack, and we leave town tonight.<eos> This body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> If I leave it and it dies, then Davina and the others die with it.
Smashed.<eos> - See if you can get that fixed.<eos> - Will do.<eos> Awkward place to pick.<eos> If he did pick it.
He had... he had his gold watch and his ring.<eos> The ring is gone.<eos> What kind of ring?<eos> Um, it was a... a ruby ring. He got it when he went to Rome with his mom.<eos> He treasured it.
Where are you staying?<eos> - In a small hotel.<eos> After the sauce go buy a nice chicken, with the right texture and firmness.<eos> He's tough, he talks to me, he has his own vibration.<eos> You have a relationship with the animal, you are connected to it.
I might have the receipt.<eos> Here, that's it.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You know, my dad, he'd freak out if he saw how you treated your tools.<eos> He'd say, "a tool will treat you as well as you treat it."
- It's easier if I do it myself.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Aw come on, don't be a sucker.<eos> You're a cop.<eos> He'll fix it.
Don't wait here.<eos> He asks for passport.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> - You don't have that, too?<eos> - I do, but that hoodoo has it.
Are you okay?<eos> Oh, uh... yeah.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - There was just a stray dog.<eos> I think it was more scared of me than I was of it.
- What happened?<eos> - There was just a stray dog.<eos> I think it was more scared of me than I was of it.<eos> I tried to take it in and stuff, but it had other ideas.<eos> - Uh, actually, it... it was a Chihuahua.
- Well, i guess i haven't conveyed The full gravity of the situation.<eos> I keep hoping things will improve, you know.<eos> I don't want to worry him.<eos> Now he's gonna book us a trip that we may never take.<eos> - There is no question That lullo is the one behind this attempt on our lives, But the cops have no way of connecting him to it.
Oh, boy, I can't wait to see this word.<eos> You know, I thought you were gonna say<eos> Now, Midge, uh, thanks for coming and alls, but, uh, since frontier days, we've needed bullies to steal land from Indians and, uh, uh, punch locusts.<eos> But not anymore.<eos> Let's push bullying to the ground and make it cry and point and laugh at it.
And now that justice has been served, I declare this court adjourned.<eos> He gets away with Lena's murder.<eos> Well, he'll still do 25 to life for the other two charges.<eos> Maybe you two will be roommates one day.<eos> He did it, you know.
I had two choices:<eos> tell the truth and face murder charges when no one believes my story, or make a run for it.<eos> Buddy?<eos> Hey, I saw this wounded bird.<eos> I was gonna pray over it.
Something just rammed into us.<eos> The last thing I remember seeing is Evan Lee Hartley's face.<eos> Whoa...<eos> - Are you sure it was him?<eos> - He took it.
I mean, yeah, I'm a bad person.<eos> Good people don't...<eos> Good people do not do what I did.<eos> You did a bad thing, but that doesn't make you a bad person... necessarily.<eos> He's got this online profile, and she is the only one who matched it, the only one.
Be good, lad.<eos> Thank you, Baroness.<eos> Chamberlain.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Perhaps if Erik allowed you a seat at his negotiating table, he might still be sitting at it.
Have a nice time.<eos> -See you<eos> -Bye.<eos> I've forgotten my wallet.<eos> -Call Niclas, he can bring it.
- Wait.<eos> He gets away with Lena's murder.<eos> - Well, he'll still do 25 to life for the other two charges.<eos> Maybe you two will be roommates one day.<eos> - He did it, you know.
No, we can't.<eos> We got to find a safe place for her and your baby.<eos> Anything happens to you, that kid is Plan B.<eos> Plan B?<eos> What exactly are you planning on doing with it?
I had two choices:<eos> tell the truth and face murder charges when no one believes my story, or make a run for it.<eos> ♪ ♪ - Buddy?<eos> Hey, I saw this wounded bird.<eos> I was gonna pray over it.
Well, according to this, Morpheus has a website where he always posts his work.<eos> Yeah, that's right. He doesn't post any comments.<eos> It's through a proxy server, so it's impossible to trace.<eos> He took credit for the first 3 pieces in Detroit, but there's been nothing on the website about the Russell Pearson murder.<eos> Because he didn't do it?
She was tired of coming in second.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about romantic love.<eos> I have not had the best luck with it.<eos> But if I ever really had it,<eos> I think I'd fight for it.
He's shoulder proud.<eos> Nobody likes that.<eos> [Chuckles] "Shoulder...<eos> Proud." As Dr. O'Connell ran out of the crumbling building, carrying the two children to safety, the roof collapsed, shattering his shoulder.<eos> But not the puppy cradled beneath it.
There has to be a server blade somewhere.<eos> Whoa. Avery, I found a server blade!<eos> So, is that it?<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> This is it!
And purple lesions?<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> It's a cancer.<eos> There's a strange reaction in the immune system.<eos> It's collapsed. Won't fight.
Now get out!<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> I'm investigating him over the killing your boyfriend.<eos> Did you have to threaten him?<eos> He didn't do it!
Come on. Let's go see your weird-ass building.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh... this looks right.<eos> See that... that big red building with the arches?<eos> - Right next to it with the...
For King Horik and Jarl Borg have agreed to join us.<eos> And perhaps we will not have to return so quickly, but stay in their land for awhile, explore it, maybe even winter there.<eos> Who knows?<eos> But, I tell you, these are interesting times.<eos> The world is changing and we must change with it.
You're never off the clock, are you?<eos> I'll be back before you know it.<eos> Ivan held up well under questioning, but ultimately, he saw the benefit of opening up.<eos> Oh, I'm sure we made a very persuasive argument.<eos> He admitted to buying CIA intel, using an account with his name on it.
Just that he was married. She called him mr. Darcy.<eos> She thought it made her sound smart And not like every other dumb girl obsessed with jane austen.<eos> And is there any reason you think that mr. Darcy Had something to do with her death?<eos> He was some sad old man, bored with his marriage, Excited to be doing a hot, young piece of ass.<eos> She probably got sick of it and broke it off,
Maybe we can use this ship as a bomb.<eos> That's the only way.<eos> Can you set the coordinates on a collision course for the power core?<eos> Yeah. Yes, I can.<eos> But I'll need you to release the Beamer from this ship's tractor beam, or it'll get dragged down, too.
I'd just come from an early-morning soulcycle class and forgotten to eat breakfast, so when I got to the office, it hit me...<eos> I was really, really, really, super-super-duper hunggs.<eos> "Hunggs"?<eos> As in, like, famished.<eos> So I was about to legit pour myself a bowl of banana peppers [gasps] When I spotted it.
The vortex will open here again, but not in a billion years.<eos> Then when?<eos> Er, 74 hours.<eos> Three days.<eos> Three days to think of something new because now it knows what to expect, now it's scanned me and will kill me on sight, thanks to PE here.
Why is she a threat? What are these powers?<eos> Whenever she gets angry or frightened... It's like she's got command of the heavens.<eos> At first, it seemed involuntary, but she's getting the hang of it now, and that is probably because she has been meeting with an Espheni.<eos> Oh, hold up, now.<eos> An Overlord has been here, and Lexi's been meeting with it?
I'll show him the gold.<eos> Tell him, tell him!<eos> Say I'll climb inside the truck, tell him it's hidden under the sand.<eos> No, no, stop!<eos> He says he'll get it.
No, nothing. Look harder!<eos> Stop yelling at me.<eos> I'm trying to help you. Oh, please.<eos> (scoffs) you're doing this for yourself.<eos> If my marriage ends, jane won't give the baby to rafael, And then you'll end up with it.
I asked her once how she gave up everything to be with you.<eos> Do you know what she told me?<eos> She said, "there's good in him, Will.<eos> And when you see the good in someone, you don't give up on them... especially if they don't see it themselves.<eos> And if you're ever lucky enough to find true love, you fight for it every day."
The ruler of the popular crowd.<eos> Highborn, as it were.<eos> I was an outcast, cursed by my extreme intellect and the itchy blazer my mom made me wear.<eos> As different as we both were, our paths were soon to cross.<eos> Winter was coming, and with it midterms.
Sam, what, are you 13?<eos> You can't do a sit-up. You think you're gonna hook up with the cal...<eos> Reporter: More news on the investigation of the horrific murder-suicide of Massachusetts Senator Christian Ward.<eos> FBI sources claim that while the senator did leave a recorded confession, other evidence found at the scene suggests another party may have been involved.<eos> He did it.
But understand this.<eos> When I have subdued Thor, I will come back for you, and we will have our reckoning.<eos> It is you who does not understand, brother.<eos> The horn itself commands the highest price.<eos> Without it, you're worthless.
This dog here got more manners upon four legs than most Savannah people walking around upon two.<eos> Generations of us have hunted on the river and fields of our county... something passed between father and son.<eos> If history is our religion, then hunting is one of its sacraments.<eos> Ward Allen once wrote it down,<eos> "The river belonged to us, and we to it."

Images arrange themselves systematically, and actions, ritually only able to be realized elsewhere.<eos> Elsewhere, everything would be different.<eos> Here it is hanging.<eos> A knot...<eos> How did he describe it?
Hydriatic procedures in the treatment of insanity were quite common<eos> I was not, I'm afraid, ever convinced of their efficacy.<eos> But I was the junior and he was my father.<eos> And your father, he employed this treatment?<eos> He gave up on it in the end.
What?<eos> It's not cool.<eos> It's sad.<eos> It's incredibly sad.<eos> This creature was kept... Against its will... In a totally unnatural environment for it.
Do you think I did the right thing?<eos> [Sighs] I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this Avatar counseling thing.<eos> But I know your heart is in the right place.<eos> You'll just have to trust it.
I'm so glad.<eos> Hey, don't be ashamed.<eos> God is releasing your pain.<eos> Where does it go?<eos> He takes it.
Or a racist plate collection or a racist saltshaker collection.<eos> - Yeah, she was a real--<eos> - Racist?<eos> Well, I was gonna say "collector," but she was probably both.<eos> See, the whole point of having a child is to love it... and to nurture it and to worry about it.
What about Barnabas?<eos> Did he deserve to die too?<eos> Yes, Barnabas was loaded with dough.<eos> He promised to pay for the elephant, then decided he could just take it.<eos> So you killed Carson because he had it.
Punish?<eos> Sometimes, I just have to wait patiently, it' s in my hands .<eos> Since I really don't like shaving I always do it too fast and too hard .<eos> To me, the ass belongs to the domain of sex.<eos> So it is subjected to this modern shaving-duty as well.
How did it get up there?<eos> There must be a loose tile and he's climbed in, and can't get out.<eos> Craig?<eos> The name, Luther, comes from my grandad.<eos> He chose it.
I... I found your bear.<eos> I brought it back for you.<eos> I can't keep it.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm only allowed to play with it when I'm with my mom and grandpa.
I loved those men like if they were my sons.<eos> I trusted them with everything, and they brought the authorities to my door.<eos> You bring me that laptop clean, and nothing will happen to you. Comprendes?<eos> What about your enemies?<eos> Do they know about it?
I think somebody hid it but I can't get anything out of him.<eos> Harrison, did you take the TV remote?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> He says he didn't take it.
I asked whether you think that.<eos> There are so many places where you can get information.<eos> But you don't want to...<eos> when the baby's here... do you?<eos> Someone has to look after it for the first few years...
Hell, no!<eos> Get back over here.<eos> First thing we're gonna do is we're gonna acknowledge that this guy's awesome.<eos> What?<eos> I mean, he shoots Theo Tonin, fakes his own death in a spectacular fashion, pushes a guy out of an aeroplane while he's flying it, parachutes into Harlan County with enough coke and cash to jump-start the economy of a small country,
- I am the same.<eos> Why didn't you just say you were sick?<eos> Because I'm not sick, and I'll make sure the pour is okay.<eos> Yeah, but I've already handed it over to another construction director.<eos> Ivan, he's gonna pick it up from...
I am not thinking of myself, Catherine.<eos> I'm thinking of your son.<eos> Look, if he fails at this, it will follow him his whole life.<eos> It'll define his entire career... this failure...<eos> and he didn't even choose it.
Except for it ain't gonna.<eos> Yeah, okay, that sounds good.<eos> All right, I'll see you later then.<eos> The world is moving.<eos> You either move with it or you get mowed over.
Any idea where he went?<eos> Oh, so many hallways, so many possibilities.<eos> You are going to tell me what you did with your rabbit.<eos> Did you hurt it?<eos> Did you touch it?
It's a fairy tale Terminator, really.<eos> Aah!<eos> No!<eos> The plan worked, sending the wraith to another world.<eos> But it dragged mother and daughter along with it.
I want to show you.<eos> Nolan, what have you done?<eos> A 15-week-old baby was taken out of the pediatric ward.<eos> A guy in a white coat told the parents that he needed to weigh the baby<eos> - and he just walks out with it.
We? Me and Emily.<eos> Travis nearly killed us!<eos> Do you have the device?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's got it?
Where did you get those eyes?<eos> I'm surprised to see you packing.<eos> I thought you didn't live in fear.<eos> I said "we".<eos> Ethan's gone and his dream with it.
Yeah. Yeah, I know who he really is.<eos> Well...<eos> Don't talk my ear off.<eos> Yeah, I get why you want to kill the ass hat, but get in line. Everybody does. I mean, the guy who dropped the bomb?<eos> - Yeah, that's right, I dropped it.
But I'm gonna need your help.<eos> - With what?<eos> - Taking care of the baby.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> I'll take good care of it like you take good care of me.
uh... there's a community outreach program that's very important to me.<eos> i was wondering if you'd like to head it up.<eos> absolutely, sir.<eos> i won't just head it up, i will head and shoulders it up.<eos> i will dive in, swim around it, and just be altogether good with it.
You already saw The Bachelorette finale, right?<eos> Nope.<eos> Well, she gave someone a rose.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Hey, Deb, I was telling Ray about Cappy's eyedrops, and he said that he'll give it a try.
- And if we can't?<eos> Decommission it, flood it.<eos> Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?<eos> The world is not ready, yes.<eos> Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it.
Well, you always obsess about the lawn when there's something bothering you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, what is it?<eos> There's this kid.<eos> He's a suspect in his brother's murder, and I don't think he did it.
I don't know. They didn't feel like the mob.<eos> They had masks and machine guns.<eos> There it is, east on Jefferson.<eos> I'll get him.<eos> Call me, track the signal, direct me to it.
Our intel was wrong.<eos> I didn't anticipate the Fairy Warrior or the Succubus being there.<eos> He must pour quite the pint to employ such loyalty.<eos> Pity about the eye...<eos> But, if you have no use for it...
There's not a lot I can do about that right now.<eos> You know, there is something really wrong with that guy.<eos> The one with the little girl.<eos> She is in some sort of big trouble.<eos> And he is it.
Here, take...<eos> Well, you said you liked the rain.<eos> This body is super bendy.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> Um, and you should probably start referring to it as my body.
Lip playing hooky today?<eos> He, uh, dropped out of school. So Fiona gave him the boot.<eos> I think he's staying with Karen.<eos> See, Karen's like cancer:<eos> You know, you kill it in one spot, pops up in another.
These profilers, man, they're just a cut below psychics.<eos> They make these broad generalizations that apply to almost anybody, then congratulate themselves for being right no matter what turns up.<eos> I had no idea it was such a sore point for you.<eos> Well, let's just say I've been accidentally pulled over enough to know that there's a difference between a profile and a suspect.<eos> Is this it?
I'm gonna see the little guy on Friday?<eos> - Yup. For like a second.<eos> Hi, Celeste, it's Karen Jackson.<eos> I decided to keep the baby.<eos> I can't give it away. I'm so sorry.
Yeah.<eos> Just hard to imagine.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> The skull reflects your own power without limitations.<eos> It's like you said, I felt my connection to it.
Why can't I be the one to use the skull against Eben?<eos> 'Cause your dark magic isn't advanced enough.<eos> And you don't know what you're dealing with. Now give it to me.<eos> Yeah, why can't Cassie do it?<eos> She's just as connected to it as you are.
I'll take her into the room.<eos> Come on.<eos> So obviously, they're going to question you about the fight with Derek and Ethan, so...<eos> Is Ethan being accused of Derek's murder?<eos> - He didn't do it, Dan.
I said hi.<eos> Get your things off the table before your dad gets home.<eos> [ Marty Narrating ] I wish my mom wouldn't worry about what I watched or drew.<eos> The only reason she cares is because of a picture I drew in art class last year.<eos> My teacher freaked out about it, So Mom had to come to school and talk about it.
Steel my soldiers' hearts.<eos> Possess them not with fear.<eos> Take from them now the sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.<eos> Not today, O Lord, O, not today, think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown!<eos> I Richard's body have interred anew, and on it have bestow'd more contrite tears than from it issued forced drops of blood.
- I'll call you back later.<eos> - You're the informant.<eos> Where's his phone?<eos> Whole let easier for me to search you after I shoot you.<eos> He took it.
Once again, Brandi and Leslie are essentially the same person.<eos> How do you respond to Newport's claim that the city parks need to be cleaned up?<eos> Pawnee parks were rated in the Indiana top ten for cleanliness and maintenance.<eos> 78% of Pawneeans label our parks, "pristine."<eos> And we all know the better-looking a park is, the more attention it will get from lady parks who want to have sex with it.
I must say it's a bit more complicated than printing a double-sided sheet.<eos> There are people who've died for that.<eos> I'll talk about my mission to Dominique. Its up to him if he wants to talk about it or not.<eos> Look, tell me a bit about your boss.<eos> No right to speak of it!
You had sex with an underage girl who answered the door. - I don't want to go back.<eos> - You don't want to go back?<eos> Then why don't we help each other out?<eos> Did Pena ever talk to you about the crime that he committed eight years ago?<eos> Yeah, he kept saying he didn't do it. Wouldn't give it a rest.
He's in holding.<eos> Now, this isn't just about McKeen's dead son.<eos> His empire is crumbling.<eos> He's burning the house down.<eos> He's trying to take us all with it.
I spent my whole life trying to impress you, trying to please you.<eos> All it did was make me hate you, hate myself.<eos> And when I finally found someone who loved me, who I thought i could love back, it made me hurt them,<eos> I tore that love apart...<eos> And myself apart with it.
It is this idea that the brain and body work together. That is taking the hunt for AI in a<eos> I have come to meet a scientist who has built the world's first anthropomimetic robot.<eos> Because he believes that our fiscal form actually helps shape the way we think. Without a body, artificial intelligence cannot exist. 6.<eos> What we are interested in is how the brain controls body and having built the body we have realised what a serious problem that.<eos> Can I interact with it?
Green goo equals a spectre.<eos> Which equals ghost, right?<eos> Mm, yeah, kind of.<eos> A spectre is an avenging ghost.<eos> It, uh... it possesses you and finds out whatever betrayals you're feeling and forces you to act on them.
72 is a good mark, Liv.<eos> Yeah, I know, but you always want to improve on the last time, don't you?<eos> Cut yourself some slack.<eos> You're doing well. Robert, don't leave without clearing your plate.<eos> It's OK, I've got it.
It's her I have to worry about.<eos> Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Look at this face.<eos> How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?
Look, I try not to judge what you guys do, but please don't tell me things like that.<eos> No, no, Jess, Jess.<eos> White Fang.<eos> - This guy Befriends a wild creature.<eos> But he must, he must set the animal free because that's what's best for it.
You could've told me later though, we've been together for over a month Vanessa.<eos> Okay, you had just been done with being totally depressed.<eos> I wasn't gonna lay that downer stuff on you.<eos> Do you get it?<eos> Yes, I get it.
Would you have?<eos> Been a traitor?<eos> I had a dog... when I was a little kid, and one day, it turned on me, bit me.<eos> My dad... shot it.<eos> Said once a dog turns on you, you never trust it again.
Too bummed about Thanksgiving to make a pun about screws.<eos> Eh, screw it.<eos> Huh, even at my lowest, I'm funnier than everyone else.<eos> I'll tell you, Rallo, this time of year's the worst for me.<eos> Mom ditches me to go to Florida, never even brings me back a baby alligator, even though I'd totally take care of it.
We're trying to have a baby.<eos> What?<eos> I just can't imagine it, Lucy holding a baby.<eos> Why?<eos> She wouldn't know what to do with it.
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.<eos> You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.<eos> I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar...<eos> Under love's heavy burden do I sink.<eos> And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
The kids were right.<eos> I guess I'm not who you thought I was.<eos> So where's the real Armageddon device?<eos> Back at the OSS, where it's always been.<eos> And now I must get back to it.
If GANTZ dies, what will happen to us?<eos> That is...<eos> Right?<eos> Extermination... perhaps.<eos> We, who were revived by GANTZ will also disappear together with it.
She's my daughter.<eos> This green river.<eos> Yellowish.<eos> I neverliked green.<eos> And the shadows of trees that lie upon it and move.
She was cutting me a big piece of chocolate cake, and we were laughing.<eos> Uh... remembering moments like those can make a difficult situation worse if you think you can never be happy like that again.<eos> But if you see a chance give yourself hope, you can allow yourself to believe that those moments are real.<eos> - I remember a little stuffed bunny.<eos> I slept with it all the time.
I already said all this.<eos> Yeah, we noticed your parole hearing was in a week.<eos> We thought that might jog your memory.<eos> Look, honestly, I didn't see it happen.<eos> But... Church told me he did it.
I gotta go!<eos> Where's your, uh, your inhaler?<eos> No.<eos> It's not in there.<eos> The bald man in the store... He took it.
I've seen a thousand times, but...<eos> I still try to see it anew every time I come back.<eos> Right on the edge of the biggest volcanoes in the world, it's lively, it's electric.<eos> I've dedicated a big part of my life to riding here.<eos> Now this place is a part of me as much as I am a part of it.
I'm going out with Shahrzad for the Fireworks. I have promised her.<eos> Why don't you take him to the 8th floor?<eos> But Shahrzad has left her cat with them.<eos> Just for an hour please. I promise I'll be back soon.<eos> - But what am I supposed to do with it?
It-it's more than doable.<eos> Wow. And pretty soon, you won't be all alone.<eos> You'll have the most interesting person you'll ever meet in your entire life to keep you company.<eos> No.<eos> Don't cry. Look, your husband may have put that baby in you, but that doesn't make you or it his property.
But they evolved at a cost.<eos> Using wireframe computer simulations of pterosaur movement,<eos> David Unwin has investigated how they moved on the ground.<eos> What I've done is feed to the vital statistics of this pterosaur into the computer, and build this model that you can see on the screen.<eos> It's easy to see that walking on flat surfaces would have been quite difficult for it.
Look, I know my family, okay?<eos> They think that I'm still that flaky, irresponsible girl that I was six months ago, before I accidentally got pregnant.<eos> But, you know, I'm gonna show them that they're wrong.<eos> How?<eos> We're gonna get the cat back, we're gonna give it a great home, and... and we're gonna take that C.P.R. class ourselves.
He's lying to you.<eos> No.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> He did it. He killed her.
We go together.<eos> All right.<eos> You cannot escape me, Thor.<eos> I will possess the Hammer of Invincibility.<eos> The heart is on the other side, and the Hammer with it.
This is where you belong, Shane.<eos> How's that, Dale?<eos> This world, what it is now, this is where you belong.<eos> And I may not have what it takes to last for long, but that's okay.<eos> 'Cause at least I can say when the world goes to shit, I didn't let it take me down with it.
Laverne, Shirley has a very bad feeling about this little scheme of yours.<eos> I don't understand what the big deal is.<eos> You don't want him to do this.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, no, no. I-I'd actually love to do it.
Please maintain a distance Of at least three steps from the body.<eos> Why?<eos> Because this body is a no-Jane zone.<eos> It will not be a playground for you.<eos> You will not touch it or sniff it or place playing cards on it Or borrow it for an interrogation.
Uh, four brothers.<eos> We fought a lot.<eos> It's like a Chinese burn,sort of.<eos> All I'm saying is here, it's a mess, but it's Dennis' mess.<eos> Let him wear it.
Where are they?<eos> Under the olive tree in the garden.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sellers is on it now, sir.<eos> He'll do it, sir - take care of it.
Why have you brought her here?<eos> She is not asking you to just give the child away. She will give you a lot of money.<eos> If both of you ever come here again then I will kill you.<eos> First of all, that child is of no use to you.<eos> Secondly, today I am giving you money for it.
I say just let her work through it.<eos> Well, okay, that's fine, but it just can't be like world war III around here anymore.<eos> Honey, it's not like we fired the first shot.<eos> That's what my mother said about the divorce.<eos> He started it.
We went to the end of the road, and we actually walked back this way and discovered Adam's body.<eos> They lured them into this area by telling them that there was a mutual friend of theirs that had gotten hurt while they were hunting.<eos> This house obviously was not here at the time.<eos> You can see, as this is coming out, how it's coming around, so it's gonna be somewhere about- somewhere in that concrete is gonna be about where his body was discovered.<eos> Once we actually processed the scene and we moved the body, once we moved the body, there was a cigarette butt under it, which we collected, and there was also another cigarette butt close by, but the one that was under his body,
Hello, sports fans.<eos> This is Irv Superfon.<eos> Before we move on to the round-table discussion, still getting calls about T.K.'s meltdown the other day.<eos> Kiss my ass, irv.<eos> The Hawks have got to seriously think about hopping off the T.K. train before it derails into a fireball and takes the team with it.
I don't want to do this in front of you.<eos> Do what? Tell me!<eos> Okay.<eos> So I found your laptop.<eos> Inside Ethan's Jeep. He's the one who stole it.
It's not a big deal.<eos> I just gave them your work history and your soc--<eos> Wait a minute. You gave them my social security number?<eos> Where did you get my social security number?<eos> From dad. Where I always get it.
My firm represents a certain big chain megastore.<eos> They're securing land outside of town.<eos> I was hoping a man inside BlueBell might help.. - facilitate dealings with the townspeople.<eos> You were going to use me?<eos> Face it, George, the world is changing, you got to change with it.
- Does Lee Dong Wu know too?<eos> - What about Lee Dong Wu?<eos> I can't stand guys like that, who only know how to cheat on and use women.<eos> Then what about this ring?<eos> This ring is pretty so I snatched it.
I was able to use your description of a mole on his chin.<eos> - Traced him to a clinical trial for basal cell carcinoma treatment.<eos> Oh, my God, he's got cancer.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Don't worry about it. He's fine.
ask for steak sauce.<eos> This party could be all of our tickets to champagne wishes and caviar dreams.<eos> "Dear Virginia and Burt, "please accept this toilet as a gift.<eos> "It was flown business class all the way from Japan.<eos> "I'm told sitting next to it, was Mr. Barry Bonds.
If the Regent Sanctum was constructed during the era of Warehouse 7, it predates H.G. by centuries.<eos> What does Sykes want with her?<eos> No idea.<eos> All knowledge of the sanctum was purged from warehouse records when it was finally shut down for good. That was over 100 years ago.<eos> And... if it was just a meeting place, why would he even care about it?
Kiss, kiss, huh?<eos> Julian...<eos> I have a question for you.<eos> What would you keep a peacock in?<eos> My darling, I would set it free, and then make love to you in front of it.
Because I thought it was too soon.<eos> Siobhan...<eos> We talked about it.<eos> This baby changed things.<eos> And without it, I just don't know where we stand.
Have a nice life.<eos> Wish I could help you.<eos> Joan.<eos> Call in your team.<eos> Langford doesn't just know something about this murder... He's behind it.
You've been protesting about my piece in "The Ecologist"<eos> with which Magnus absolutely concurs, so will you not just agree that nuclear is just too expensive and just too damned dangerous to live nearby?<eos> Patricia, the greatest power station in our solar system is dangerous... the sun.<eos> It creates deserts, melts icecaps, causes cancer.<eos> We've been living with it since our ancestors crawled out of the primeval slime.
And this mulberry tree, the fruits make one pass gas.<eos> Fartie?<eos> Are you making fun of me right now?<eos> When I was in Shinju, I named a white birch tree Pat Pat.<eos> Three men could hang from it and it would not budge.
You just told me they had half a dozen drivers.<eos> Not like this one.<eos> This kid is special.<eos> I've been working with him for a while.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.
It can solve crime.<eos> Where's the sun so early in the morning?<eos> This is the mortuary. This way, please.<eos> The bird is afraid to go in.<eos> Find someone outside to take care of it.
Under the Empress's instructions, you threw yourself into my arms and tried to have sex with me.<eos> But you gave away the show unexpectedly.<eos> You wouldn't let me touch your acupoint...<eos> That smacked of transfiguration. When I entered the Monastery just now, You spoke for the deer with ventriloquism.<eos> Every time the deer appeared, it's you who spoke for it, right, Jing'er?
So Sara told you not to bring her.<eos> No, she's not to blame.<eos> Not to blame.<eos> Why did you bring the cat?<eos> Saba wanted you, Grandma, to look after it.
- Barry?<eos> - We're on the parking.<eos> - What's he saying about a bean, Barry?<eos> - You mean, I didn't have to?<eos> Bro, he's landed you right in it.
Paired with gratitude.<eos> The messenger had the desired effect, then?<eos> My concerns have been laid to rest, Sharing grave with barca and his thirst for winnings.<eos> There's no chance the magistrate Will deduce the source of this message?<eos> Not unless hades speaks of it from the underworld.
No, I'm busy.<eos> A conference.<eos> The love we've shared has to be free in order to breathe.<eos> Just like music.<eos> If you cling on to it, it'll die and wither like a rose in your hand.
I would never have bet if I knew Spiro was injured.<eos> - But you did, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Take your winnings.<eos> The whole world's falling apart, and Manchester United with it.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Oh, look at that.<eos> A raccoon got fried in the painfield.<eos> And this buzzer tried to eat him.<eos> It got fried too.
Old Gleason's got a satellite phone.<eos> We can use that for backup.<eos> Shut up, Barlow.<eos> He does, he uses it for emergencies.<eos> I'm calling it in.
I've seen the future, and you're it, kiddo.<eos> Your act is too good for this top.<eos> What are you talking about? This is exactly what we need. You heard the crowd.<eos> This will save us.<eos> This place is dying. You don't need to die with it.
Lucy, we're friends. It would be an honor.<eos> Aw, ben, that's so sweet.<eos> what are you doing here?<eos> Were--were you talking to your cadaver?<eos> I thought I heard that you were supposed to talk to it
Yeah.<eos> Big job ahead of us.<eos> - Get some sleep.<eos> - I can't.<eos> See, in my head, the only way the plane remains aloft is if I'm rooting for it. So it stands to reason, if I'm sleeping, I'm not rooting.
Monster? We got a monster in our village?<eos> I've been many places over the years, but...<eos> I've never heard of such a monster!<eos> It could come from a foreign land along with firearms.<eos> Do we have to deal with it, whatever it may be?
So ', perhaps, when he' the guy, tell 'to all his fellow Viper<eos> "Hey, if Lala and 'made in and sold you.<eos> Dates start a war ... with Lala. "<eos> But tell us who he was and your name will not be 'never out.<eos> One condition ... I will not ever, ever again ' revise it.
Last night on the news,<eos> There was a bear and kitten, and they were best friends. If they can do it, so can men and women.<eos> Mm-hmm. How'd that story end?<eos> The bear killed the kitten...<eos> After getting too frisky with it. All right.
Is your Uncle Darren in?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> He's on me Dad's allotment.<eos> He's took it over.
Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't believe in wearing costumes.<eos> She isn't the free spirit I am.<eos> Okay, well, forget it.<eos> I'm not spending my New Year's Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.<eos> He says he'll wear it if you'll be Aquaman.
Doesn't have one for the nights of the other two murders, either.<eos> Way Berryman tells it, he spends most nights watching TV at home by his lonesome.<eos> Still and all, I know this guy's broke, but, uh... He just doesn't strike me as the home-invading, execution-style-murdering type.<eos> It's him.<eos> He did it.
And I know how that sounds, but I've seen it.<eos> I come in tonight.<eos> Marie is standing in front of the alarm.<eos> And it's dark.<eos> But I'm pretty certain that she was talking to it.
If you can't kill, what you good for, eh, Dalek?<eos> Dalek.<eos> What's the point of you?<eos> I was there on set when Chris was doing this scene and it's kind of a hard thing to do, do you know what I mean?<eos> To talk to an inanimate object and have a sort of duologue with it.
- Are you taking it easy, tali?<eos> Adam mentioned his family reunion.<eos> - Oh, he got here early to pester me.<eos> - He's probably just checking in on his kidney.<eos> Making sure you're taking good care of it.
- What? - Do you mind?<eos> I need to check my contacts.<eos> - Mozzie?<eos> - He's good at this kind of thing.<eos> - You sure he didn't do it?
- His underwear? Visible above the waistline.<eos> Very visible.<eos> Very particular brand.<eos> Plus the extremely suggestive fact that he just left his number under this dish.<eos> I'd say you'd better break it off now and save yourself the pain.
No!<eos> It's going to eat us.<eos> It's going to eat us, it's going to eat us, it's going to eat us...<eos> Is it going to eat us?<eos> Maybe we're going to eat it, but I don't like the odds.
Of course you didn't.<eos> Now, do you know what this is?<eos> Of course you don't. This is a blight called UG99.<eos> It's a variant of the black stem fungus native to Russia.<eos> Modern wheat has no immunity to it.
Shake it, shake it!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Oof!<eos> Steady, Finn.<eos> This place is probably more creeped out of you than you are of it.
But unlike the shooting gallery where the bullets, or in this case, flashes of light, always travel in straight lines,<eos> asteroids and comets curve toward their targets.<eos> Jupiter tends to draw in the asteroids and comets through its gravity.<eos> So it's kind of like, if I start with my aim way over there,<eos> Jupiter pulls the barrel of the rifle toward it... giving me a direct hit.
Shoo!<eos> I've searched the entire palace.<eos> There's no sign of the goblin anywh...<eos> What happened? It's that pesky goblin!<eos> You let it escape, and it's ransacked my premises.
And the kid likes it when it's cute.<eos> It grows up.<eos> The kid gets other interests, gets bored with the dog.<eos> They lumber the parents with it.<eos> The parents get bored with it.
- I must be allowed to say something.<eos> It war your idea to come here, and then you just sit there.<eos> And this guy cunts his minutes whilst reading the paper.<eos> - He pulled at my bra.<eos> - He started it.
I love that he's trying to find the perfect gift, but he's running out of time. So I'm guessing I'll be getting earmuffs and a fudge log.<eos> Which I'll love.<eos> What'd you get him?<eos> Hmm, this really cool leather bomber jacket.<eos> Has he been hinting for it?
That's hard to believe, isn't it?<eos> It's a collector's piece.<eos> But it's yours now, Stanley.<eos> Really, Mr Lipwig?<eos> I have got a place ready and waiting for it.
SOLDIER:<eos> Zubaidi will be on the middle chopper.<eos> Get tight on his exit.<eos> (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)<eos> Swing it around.
Some say she's 2,000 years old.<eos> You believe in that Dungeons Dragons rubbish?<eos> Where I grew up, we're very superstitious.<eos> Cragwich is particularly fascinating to me.<eos> The book of folklore tells the story of this village, and what Carmilla did to it and its daughters.
He dead.<eos> He got so ate.<eos> -Who's your daddy now, huh?<eos> -He got all ate up.<eos> The only safe place is right under it.
You better get out of there, Mikey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> One of the problems with running a criminal conspiracy is that there's no real way to avoid trust issues with your co-workers.<eos> Where's the painting?<eos> - He... he took it.
What's wrong? Your father's mad at me 'cause I can't take care of his fucking dog.<eos> Why does he need you to take care of it?<eos> 'Cause he's going back into AA.<eos> He says he can't do with any more responsibilities. Besides that he, he's gotta stop drinking.<eos> I mean, ain't like I don't wanna take care of it, but I leave at 7:00 in the morning to go to work!
You again, Kanna Endo...<eos> He wouldn't put himself in such a dangerous spot.<eos> I told you, the robot was remote-controlled!<eos> Is that what it looks like?<eos> They're confronting it!
Bye.<eos> - Tobey!<eos> - I took the shortcut!<eos> - What shortcut?<eos> - The dog, he killed it!
Do you live close by?<eos> Just there.<eos> Rent a flat.<eos> Who owns it? Your father?<eos> He pays for it.
Well,this stain here must have hit Diane Sidman almost exactly where the tumor formed.<eos> You're testing me on the cancer chair? Well,you're wearing a suit.<eos> Plus,it's not radioactive anymore. We're going to need to take this chair. No,no,no!<eos> You don't just go around doing human testing on people,Bones. I got to go to the bathroom.<eos> Well,I touched it with my bare hands.
"One day he's -- gonna carry me... "if I'm lucky enough not to mess it up."<eos> You won't mess it up.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Because you already know that love is the only thing that has a chance against death.<eos> You know, it causes us a lot of pain, but without it, we feel isolated, untethered, lost in space.
Do not you tell me what you think of the book.<eos> You even ran away from home?<eos> Gives a good story.<eos> You have a style writing clear and succinct.<eos> And I worried with the character principal, not only for being naturally curious but get me really relate to it.
All marriages suck.<eos> Your marriage sucks.<eos> No.<eos> I love her.<eos> He loves a tree in Oregon more than he loves you, but he can't have sex with it.
Miranda.<eos> It's the blackest of magic.<eos> Miranda's daddy got it off a dead Indian.<eos> It's true.<eos> - How do I get rid of it?
Darling,are you readyto watch me become rich?<eos> I'm gonna relish this.<eos> Oh,what the hell?<eos> This is not good.<eos> If that plane doesn't cometo us,we got to go to it.
You know,I may have found a flaw in your logic,Kitt.<eos> Really?<eos> Your assumption was whoever set the fire Ended up at Phil Driscoll's office.<eos> Based on the spectrographic analysis, That was correct.<eos> But Eddie admitted he set it.
Step back from the door,please.<eos> Did you hear any sort of gunfire this morning?<eos> Don't tell hime anything<eos> Sure he heard it.<eos> He fired it.
Maybe we can.<eos> Alec was experimental.<eos> That's one of the things I liked about him.<eos> What about SM? Are you offering?<eos> He got me into it.
- All right, man.<eos> Hey, yo, I'm gonna get you this top hat, all right?<eos> No, please do not.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - He asked for it.
These hieroglyphs have been misunderstood.<eos> The most important section is wrong.<eos> This depicts a monument on the west bank of the Nile.<eos> Amentet.<eos> With what appears to be the sun rising behind it.
I'm not hungry.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> We have ants?<eos> There was a dead cockroach.<eos> They were all over it.
Well, the baby just now.<eos> It's not yours ?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, it's not mine.<eos> You seem to love it anyway.
Thank you.<eos> I can hear you breathing out there.<eos> Hello?<eos> Please take care of this bird.<eos> You said take care of it.
I haven't heard from you in over 20 years, mate.<eos> Over 20 years.<eos> What was that?<eos> Let's just face it, eh?<eos> You wanted the past dead and me along with it.
I am serious!<eos> She already shotatherine.<eos> Now she's got a taste for blood.<eos> There's no reason to tell her anything.<eos> I broke it off weeks ago.
LAPD?<eos> FBI.<eos> You want to tell me what that was all about?<eos> That was fair warning.<eos> Don't get between Benjamin Polk and the bullet with his name on it.
- The med student?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Everything was circumstantial, blood spatter,<eos> Clarence was wearing a Bulls sweatshirt two days after the murder.<eos> But that lady stood right up in court, pointed at Clarence and said, "He did it."
Glaber commands from the rear.<eos> A coward's position.<eos> He will advance his troops in tight formation, intending to overpower.<eos> It is the Roman way.<eos> We will teach them ours.
-(LAUGHING) Dramatic, don't you think?<eos> -What's funny?<eos> A professional soldier doesn't enjoy killing, Vaughan.<eos> -There are exceptions.<eos> Seven people were killed here in the last year, two of them ours.
- Joseph.<eos> - It's wonderful to see you again, madam.<eos> Now, rumor has it, sir, that you've come about the money.<eos> Retire and recall all bills.<eos> Your spies are better than mine.
Thank you.<eos> You may put your head out.<eos> We are gone. Here... did you bring them pies, did ya?<eos> "The nameless slave shall wear a silver crown." His words, sir.<eos> Not mine.
- Good evening, sir.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I don't buy and sell cars.<eos> I just sell them.<eos> But the cars I sell are mainly, uh, not mine.
We should simply ask the enemy not to invade on a Sabbath cause Private Doss here is a prayer.<eos> Alright.<eos> Now we got that clear.<eos> Now let me tell you my requirements.<eos> They're not as complicated as yours.
I don't know which are which.<eos> Truth is, I never drink coffee at home.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> There!<eos> I don't need my coffee mugs 'cause I got yours!
I don't want to brag, but i'm somewhat of an expert.<eos> Do you want to see my scars?<eos> What do you think?<eos> You like 'em? Huh?<eos> Yours are gonna look just the same.
I've never been sick a day in my life.<eos> Let them stay in if you want to.<eos> You're not hurting anyone but yourself.<eos> But these children's tonsils have got to come out, all but one...<eos> - Hers are as sound as a dollar.
He knows what it means if I'm not on the field on Saturday.<eos> Yeah, totally, man.<eos> You know, nine times out of ten...<eos> These girls want it even when they say they don't.<eos> And the one time they actually didn't, it's my word against theirs.
But I thought my old magazines might provide light relief for our ladies.<eos> They have some very useful fashion features.<eos> I've never needed an editorial to instruct me on how to put myself together, and I've never had any complaints.<eos> I've come across a few sailors from Somaliland, but not many of their wives.<eos> Most prefer to stay in Africa, but my husband is more handsome than theirs.
I mean, it feels no sudden.<eos> It's not a joke.<eos> You've seen what's happening outside. And if the 12 Monkeys ever got to you...<eos> They won't get with my Daughters around.<eos> My army is better than theirs.
What about you?<eos> Danny Vacarro for an in-law?<eos> Talk about a labor of love.<eos> Thank you for the tip, Raymond.<eos> The families, theirs and ours, we're getting together tomorrow.
George is being very obliging.<eos> Doubtless he would be... if Elizabeth would let him.<eos> But she will not.<eos> George's ambition, before Francis died, was to drive a wedge between our two families.<eos> And the easiest way to do it was by befriending theirs.
Yeah, I unders...<eos> Are you sure you can make this site safe for my crew?<eos> I agreed to build a shopping center here, not a graveyard.<eos> I understand, Mr. Borja.<eos> Let us do our job, and we'll be sure your people are allowed to do theirs, risk-free.
But there's a real difference here.<eos> The people whose cases you're reviewing...<eos> They went through the system. They faced a jury of their peers.<eos> You did no such thing.<eos> Your experience is 180 degrees from theirs.
Yes, Charles Kessler.<eos> He was also at the gala.<eos> He's a State Department suit who's been coordinating relief efforts throughout the horn of Africa.<eos> So we cross-referenced his travel history with the two victims.<eos> Several of his itineraries line up perfectly with theirs.
All my life Ive been respectful.<eos> Done what men told me.<eos> I know better now.<eos> Im worth no more, no less than you.<eos> Mrs Pankhurst once said that if its right for men to fight for their freedom, then its right for women to fight for theirs.
My aunt, Rachel, possessed a beauty as powerful as it was unearthly, and she wielded it like a sword.<eos> My aunts, Zilpah and Bilhah, were Laban's daughters by a slave-wife, and were given to Jacob as part of Leah and Rachel's dowries, although he never treated them as lesser wives.<eos> I can still hear their laughter the songs and stories they spun like gold, and the sacred rituals passed down from their mothers, for the gods we worshipped in secret.<eos> In the cool shade of the red tent, they handed down their memories to me like gifts, and it was through their voices that I came to discover my own.<eos> But if my story began with my mothers, theirs began the day my father walked into their camp.
I know.<eos> But that's... That is just circumstantial evidence. It could be anyone's.<eos> It could be... Like, his sister's!<eos> He's got, like, eighteen sisters, you know?<eos> It could be one of theirs. I'm sure of it.
These attempts get reported? You know what I mean.<eos> I do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Instead of working their way up like I did, they try to take shortcuts.<eos> Want to take what isn't theirs. Anyone stolen from you recently?
It's lucky you wrote about that.<eos> A little crazy, you're thinking, to share that much?<eos> Not crazy.<eos> Unusual to be so intimate with people you don't know.<eos> But I do know them. They read my blog, I comment on theirs.
The... The last war.<eos> The squalor and the mud and... and the awful, awful misery of it all.<eos> What am I?<eos> What am I? !<eos> What you are, sir, is either on our side or theirs.
Cheeky Girls, get them out.<eos> Hello, Nigel.<eos> Hello, Adoha, good evening, Mary.<eos> How is the campaign going?<eos> If they shit on my doorstep, Adam, I shall shit on theirs.
That's not the point of the question.<eos> Why not?<eos> Oh, ours is not to reason why, ours is just to test or die.<eos> So on a test like this we can't ask questions about their questions?<eos> The PCAS isn't about answering your questions; it's about you answering theirs.
Lochlan turned... for much less.<eos> Archers.<eos> I beg your pardon, sire? Won't we hit our own troops?<eos> Yes.<eos> But we'll hit theirs as well.
My unnatural thoughts have returned.<eos> That's bad!<eos> And I remember the little creatures that smelled like me.<eos> That's why I left.<eos> His smell mingled with theirs in the ground.
- Presumably to compromise you.<eos> - Why should she want to harm me?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I have known many prostitutes.<eos> I hasten to add, in pursuance of my own profession, not theirs.
- Waiter!<eos> I'd like some sausages and beans.<eos> - Me too!<eos> - Me too!<eos> - Like theirs!
It's after eleven.<eos> You have to get up early tomorrow and drive.<eos> I have to get up early and drive.<eos> Yes, I understand.<eos> I have my life and other people have theirs.
"Down with the factory"<eos> All on his own, at night?<eos> He took a brush, paint, and did it.<eos> Crazy, eh?<eos> I think that one day people will start saying their houses, their factory, their streets their country, are all theirs but everything is different not necessarily worse
It's a transitional period.<eos> I'll have to carry the cross of mediation to Calvary... for the new order.<eos> These thousands of restless corporations... must be made fruitful. Isn't that so? - Yes.<eos> My cross has become heavy.<eos> - But so has theirs.
Matt Weaver and his father before him.<eos> The Reb?<eos> People aren't simple, are they?<eos> Yes, I've been hired to kill Matt Weaver.<eos> Save your breath and tell them they've been wasting theirs.
No, I mean, when did you talk to Van Stratten?<eos> Seems you were pretty chummy with some Nazi collaborators in Vichy.<eos> Have some champagne.<eos> - They didn't even ask for a receipt. - I've heard that story before.<eos> Now their families can't even prove the money's theirs.
When do we reach the hospice?<eos> You should've seen it.<eos> Hundreds of mothers. Trying to see the child's face.<eos> Naturally.<eos> Fortunately he wasn't any son of theirs.
For people of color, there's a world that we live in that's different than yours.<eos> One you'll never, ever experience. Terri...<eos> And the way we express those experiences, out of context, can be taken to mean something that they don't.<eos> I wouldn't want anyone going through my e-mails... but you talk about white trash, y-you talk about white entitlement.<eos> That's nothing compared to what my family and families like ours deal with daily...
Oh, yeah, sorry.<eos> 'Cause if we lost her a second time, ohh, that poor family.<eos> Could you ever count on anything again?<eos> I mean, it'd be like we were throwing away a second chance.<eos> And not just Georgia's, but ours, 'cause we're never gonna see this again.
Several of them would participate today if you weren't forbidding it.<eos> Most of my staff has never seen a lynching. I have. Have you?<eos> Did you know most of the times No. They castrate a man before they string him up?<eos> Why do you think that is?<eos> Fear, I suppose, based on erroneous stereotypes, stereotypes a study like ours could begin to dispel.
Everything that boy do, he do for you.<eos> He wants you to say, "Good job, son." That's all.<eos> I ain't got time for that, Rose.<eos> He's alive, he's healthy.<eos> He's got to make his own way. I made mine.
We'll look after you.<eos> You're going to look after me?<eos> My baby sister?<eos> Don't be like that.<eos> You see that's the difference between your home and mine.
Master?<eos> This short man just took my carrot directly out of the basket.<eos> Well, give it back, turd.<eos> That carrot is a vital ingredient for my supper.<eos> It's pretty vital for mine an' all.
- Thank you.<eos> So, did you, uh, solve the other mystery you were working on?<eos> I decided we should just keep it professional.<eos> Angie and I are partners. We're work colleagues.<eos> She's got her life, and I've got mine.
Tap water tea.<eos> Oh, thank you, children.<eos> I'm not too peckish at the minute, but... I think Auntie Jess is and she would love a cup of tea.<eos> - I'll make her one.<eos> - Oh, no, just give her mine.
It must have been hard, having to forsake your home, your heart.<eos> It was.<eos> Will you be a good king?<eos> Will you bring England and France, Catholic and Protestant, closer together?<eos> So that my family, and families like mine, can feel safe again in the land that they were born to and love?
Who are you? - Me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm your prince.<eos> Okay. Fine.<eos> I'm just a guy who'd rather live in your reality than mine.
The exact same thing.<eos> Which hell spawn is yours?<eos> Pearl.<eos> The one with the pipes.<eos> Mine's Becca, the one with the bangs.
I need to enlist the services of the A/V Club. What did you have in mind?<eos> My shame at appearing so low on the Glist has made me reevaluate my image at this school and beyond.<eos> I've now realized that in today's culture of bad boy athletes and celebrity sex tapes, a good reputation is no good at all.<eos> Artie, you know how our Glee Club assignment was to find a song with a bad reputation and rehabilitate it?<eos> Well, mine is going to afford me the worst reputation in this school.
I trust that man with my life. You have nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Not if he's your father.<eos> And in fact, this store's as safe as anywhere, provided you stay away from those two.<eos> Let's go see what's in that locker, all right? Are you okay?<eos> This isn't a Buy More key, so I'll have to use mine.
You be careful in New York. There are a bunch of kookies there.<eos> - Okay, I will.<eos> - Call me frequently, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I've got you on my speed dial, and you're on mine.
"You know they sell them at Kmart and shit?<eos> Three bucks."<eos> "He died in the Korean War for that flag."<eos> "What a coincidence.<eos> Mine was made in Korea.
So are you.<eos> Robin, I think there might be a boy underneath all this dirt.<eos> Rebuild... there.<eos> Let Sherwood remain our home until Richard returns to Nottingham.<eos> Let it be mine as well.
The ingestion of caustic soda is not of itself proof of attempted suicide.<eos> You know as well as I do, the only people who knowingly take it are those who seek to kill themselves.<eos> Which is against the law.<eos> I do respect your position.<eos> I'm asking you to understand mine.
This is getting better by the minute.<eos> Billy!<eos> Billy! The other day I went up to my girlfriend.<eos> I said, "You know, I'd like a little pussy. "<eos> She said, "Me, too. Mine's as big as a house. "
I'm telling him to get up.<eos> - Me? - Get up.<eos> I'm going to show you your room. OK?<eos> - My room?<eos> Mine?
Then a late supper at the Grand Hotel.<eos> When it's midnight and all is well, then we'll dance, if you're willing.<eos> How mad, how wild, how thrilling.<eos> I'm going to Maxim's, where all the girls are queens,<eos> Each kiss goes on the wine list and mine is quite a fine list.
Can you imagine being in the hospital?<eos> I mean, how embarrassing!<eos> I just can't imagine the passion it would take to shatter a urethra in two places.<eos> You sound a little envious.<eos> Do you want me to smash yours?
You are an unpleasant creature.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can I, uh, help you with something, ma'am?<eos> Yes, I've always wanted to steal a car.<eos> So I'm gonna steal yours.
Christ, is that why you agreed to this... because you thought I'd come running back?<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no...<eos> - No, Mother.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> I'm going to be Jeremy's wife, not yours.
It was wrong of me to say that.<eos> - Don't talk to your sister like that!<eos> - That's your sister! Everything is fine.<eos> WEDNESDAY 14:06<eos> Yours looks like shit.
Everyone needs to know.<eos> Kara?<eos> Hello, sister.<eos> Look, I picked out my own outfit without any fashion advice from you.<eos> All these years you've pushed those dowdy sweaters and skirts on me! Trying to cloak my beauty so I don't outshine yours.
I mean, we just met, you live out of town, you're not even coming to the graduation, so what's your respect gonna do for me?<eos> Thanks for the check, Grant.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Look, Maxine, I came to get the money from your dad.<eos> I sold my integrity so you could keep yours.
I will.<eos> Let him go. And what is your strategy?<eos> Remember, little girl, I can read your mind.<eos> I didn't forget.<eos> And while I'm this close I can read yours.
Have a talk with Mr. O'Dwyer.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It's the official opinion of the backup deputy... that a talk with him is a good idea.<eos> Say goodbye to my wife.<eos> I'll say hello to yours.
Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that Furry Balls Plop<eos> Menacingly On the Table is holding you back.<eos> Good luck with your company, dude.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good luck with yours.
Just the law firm.<eos> Mark Brown, Family Law.<eos> Pretty drastic step to settle a custody dispute.<eos> LAPD said the lawyer found a note on his door.<eos> "You ruined my life, hope I ruined yours."
He's mine.<eos> (grunts) Lightning doesn't work underwater?<eos> You learn something new every century.<eos> You are in my kingdom, now, you jade freak.<eos> My might is greater than ever yours.
Ah, little girl.<eos> You have jacket?<eos> Of course, everyone has a jacket.<eos> Of course.<eos> Please go get yours, huh?
- Get it off!<eos> I-I-I'm... I'm... done.<eos> Look, grandma! Quickie bake oven!<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> A toy oven to crush the spirit of brilliant little minds like yours.
Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage.<eos> And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.<eos> When the time comes, I will not hold you back.<eos> Then I am yours, my lady.<eos> I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that.
You took our love and ripped it apart!<eos> And now you're gonna pay!<eos> Rotten to the core.<eos> I just wanted to win... For once.<eos> You took away our happiness, and now it's our turn to take away yours.
You're all I have left.<eos> And even though the blood in your veins is not my blood, I would do anything to protect it.<eos> What are we gonna do, mom?<eos> Today, I finally decided what kind of man I truly am.<eos> I never got my old man's approval, but maybe I'll get yours.
Also known as the Tequila and very nice after a round of ass-cubing.<eos> Ass-cubing, what's that?<eos> Trade secret.<eos> Damn you!<eos> Fine, you won't give me back my identity, I'll steal yours.
No?<eos> No?<eos> You need to leave. Yeah.<eos> You need to remember that every snail leaves a trail, buddy.<eos> And I am all... over yours. Hey?
- Mom, those aren't rumors.<eos> - Lita, don't start.<eos> Mom, it's between me and the label, okay?<eos> You're 16 years old and I'm the mother.<eos> Mom, it's my career, not yours.
- Hmmm.<eos> - Casa Regina. I had a station set up at my house in east Riverside.<eos> - ¿La sala o la cocina?<eos> - La sala, claro, la cocina es para cocinar.<eos> Girl, this chair over here is yours.
Okay, I cannot fake it one more second.<eos> Hey, girlfriend!<eos> Looking hot.<eos> I am so stealing this sweater.<eos> Not if I steal yours first.
She said she hinted at it.<eos> - Give me the keys to your car.<eos> - What?<eos> I can't take mine; it's a Porsche.<eos> Let me borrow yours to go pick her up.
- I'm going to call her.<eos> - I haven't done anything...<eos> - Tell her you're messing around while she's watching the babies.<eos> - I haven't got babies.<eos> - Trying to hook my honey because yours is barren?
Because your house has just been on the market.<eos> It has. lt was on the market for six months.<eos> Six months?<eos> You know, the estate agent said to me, a year ago you would have had 20 viewings.<eos> Because yours was a very Des Res.
He is fucking with you, Ade.<eos> Your girlfriend here can she use a gun?<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> Put a leash on your team.<eos> Put a leash on yours.
- Don't.<eos> I'm actually doing better than I have in a long time.<eos> Well, let's pray for Miss Jeanette then.<eos> There's something evil out there and it wanted her soul.<eos> You're not careful, it's gonna come for yours too.
It's all right.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> You're safe.<eos> Please, don't leave me.<eos> I daresay my faith in humankind is stronger than yours.
I think you'd better fuck off home, mate.<eos> Home?<eos> Fuck off home?<eos> This is my fucking home, mate.<eos> Where exactly would you say yours was, eh?
Only because of who we are, we can't help each other achieve these goals.<eos> So more inmates get hurt. lt's-- lt is so frustrating.<eos> Sister, we both believe in a greater power.<eos> His will be done.<eos> His will or yours?
You're fucking generous, you Cockneys, aren't ya?<eos> - Sophie? - Oh, yeah.<eos> Ta.<eos> - How's your mum?<eos> - Fine. How's yours?
Child?<eos> Her child?<eos> My God.<eos> I'm going to be sick.<eos> You did not hasten that tiny life... you stole hers.
But just because I showed compassion once doesn't mean he deserves it now.<eos> Maybe he doesn't.<eos> But that young woman is now an ER doctor.<eos> She saves lives.<eos> And the world's a better place because you saved hers.
- Did it work?<eos> - Is it gone?<eos> - But, Julia, there was a complication.<eos> - What do you mean, lost her shade?<eos> - When the mudang cut the demigod's soul out, they... they nicked hers by accident.
So am I.<eos> Priests get scared, too.<eos> I don't know if you know this, but I've known your mother a very long time.<eos> She loved coming here when she was younger.<eos> We all need an escape, and this was hers.
Now, is... is there anything you want to ask me about the family, your... your grandfather?<eos> Are there really pirates attacking our shipments in the Gulf?<eos> Yes, of course there are.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, I thought, perhaps, it was a ruse to get rid of mother, send her off to Mexico, have whoever cut Fernando's head off do the same to hers.
And your mother knows that.<eos> Your mother told me the hunting story.<eos> That... that you had a deer right in your sights, and you couldn't pull the trigger, because you couldn't kill a living, breathing animal.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> And it's not your job to sacrifice your life for hers.
You're right. You know what you just did?<eos> - Huh? - You just made me inspire me as much as I inspire you.<eos> Everyone, this little piggy and I are the same!<eos> Sure, I may be three, four years older than her, but why do we need to hide her tails?<eos> Fozzie's tail is out, so is Bobo's and Yolanda's, but I guess hers is okay because it's long and thin.
I told you, she needs to be muzzled.<eos> Back off.<eos> Actually, the problem isn't my mouth, it's yours.<eos> I got to tell you, Dr. Brennan's got a mean right hook for a squint.<eos> Yeah, well, I think my hand's gonna feel worse than hers after filling out all these incident reports. Ouch.
So I spend the next six weeks bombing Caliphate territory.<eos> But how many more innocent people will die?<eos> How many more children?<eos> I don't see those children's faces anymore.<eos> I just see hers.
They'llfacemy blastersquad unlessyousurrendertome.<eos> You can't.<eos> You're too important.<eos> And my daughter is not important?<eos> I will trade my life for hers.
I believe that is love, knowing that without the person you love... you die faster.<eos> And... you hope for a miracle, even if you don't believe in them. Until suddenly it happens and you find someone with whom every day is an adventure.<eos> "Collons".<eos> I'd better leave, but first I have one piece of advise for you.<eos> You lived your life. Let your daughter live hers.
I'd love to answer that.<eos> Um, you know, just whenever I look at her face and the attached physique.<eos> And you?<eos> He makes me laugh.<eos> And, you know, there's really no one else's opinion who I care about more than hers, so...
No, I said.<eos> Can I show you some pictures?<eos> These are prints from there.<eos> They are size 35.<eos> I assume they are hers.
- I see.<eos> - Make it stop!<eos> I've got my hand wrapped around this woman's soul.<eos> I can tear it from her body.<eos> But if you promise me your soul in exchange for hers,
I promise.<eos> Son of a bitch didn't even mention they had a daughter, and now he's all she's got left.<eos> Probably why Christa was getting out there. Looking for a better man.<eos> "Your soul mate could be just one click away."<eos> Well, let's see if Christa found hers.
I would know that smirk anywhere.<eos> Hello, mother.<eos> I believe you're offering a deal.<eos> Kaleb will link this hourglass to esther's.<eos> Ours will mirror hers. When last sand falls,
Raccoons put your blood in Denise's car?<eos> Where is she, John?<eos> Saving the girl may be the only thing that spares your life.<eos> My life is over.<eos> So is hers.
Now she wants to stop me getting married.<eos> She's been trying to scare Celia with awful rumours...<eos> How long have you known Mademoiselle Celia, monsieur?<eos> All my life.<eos> My people were in India, like hers.
If he was moonlighting, she didn't get a whiff of any cash.<eos> Bearing in mind what she was used to, it could have driven her to desperation.<eos> Not kill, though, surely.<eos> Well, she said her husband investigated people's belief systems.<eos> He destroyed hers.
That is for you to decide.<eos> You must hold this candle over the heart of your sacrifice and whisper their name.<eos> And when the candle is lit, that person's life will be traded for your mother's.<eos> All she ever wanted was for me to be good.<eos> I can't trade someone else's life for hers.
Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Why do you think my wife's calling me about beets?<eos> She wants to hear your voice.<eos> And I presume you want to hear hers.
You did your job well, now keep your word.<eos> - He'll kill us both. - Shut up.<eos> - He will.<eos> - I said shut up.<eos> I'll keep my word when the queen keeps hers, where's my wife?
The woman belongs in prison.<eos> So go to the police.<eos> The things I know about her, I-I can't prove.<eos> I don't have any hard evidence.<eos> It would just be my word against hers.
The girl fabricated the whole story.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> How can the truth not matter?<eos> What matters is whose truth plays better.<eos> And hers was quite detailed.
Olivia?<eos> Okay. I think I got something.<eos> You need the original printout of the file.<eos> Exactly what am I looking for?<eos> When I was a little kid, my mother used to call me olive and hers did too.
I found satan's room.<eos> Oh, we should not be in here.<eos> Of course we should.<eos> The cow has perpetually tried sabotaging your life.<eos> Time to sabotage hers.
Excuse me?<eos> My daughter wants one.<eos> Oh, uh...<eos> My old lady loves it.<eos> It's hers.
What can we do to help ourselves out on this?<eos> First of all, you don't ever lie to me again.<eos> Secondly, when it comes out about this hooker... and it will come out...<eos> you deny, you understand?<eos> Deny, deny, deny. It's your word against hers.
How's that?<eos> - Uh, I can't tell you. Okay?<eos> But if I could, I would tell you<eos> That when she had the choice to hide or tell the truth, This woman stood up.<eos> She risked her life for a country That wasn't even hers yet.
Like, the girl is not even talented, she's not even a nice person.<eos> You know she stole my idea. You know it.<eos> I don't know that.<eos> You know it because I told you!<eos> It is your word against hers.
We don't know who she was or where she lived.<eos> And in fact, we have no physical evidence of her at all.<eos> No bones. No stone tools. No beads.<eos> But we do know that she existed because of her genetic legacy.<eos> And some scientists have felt moved to name her Europa, because in one sense hers is the founding lineage of Europe.
Sara is with child?<eos> Congratulations!<eos> This is like the 4th of July and Christmas Day rolled into one.<eos> I am asking you, father to father, to leave her alone.<eos> You can kill me if you want to kill me, I'll trade my life for hers.
So you wouldn't have to wake up every morning and see the face of the person who took your sister's life.<eos> Where will she go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She saved my life.<eos> And you spared hers.
I'll bet.<eos> Your niece doesn't have a license to carry a concealed weapon,does she?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> You should've seen where this one girl hid hers.
Billy!<eos> Billy! The other day I went up to my girlfriend.<eos> I said, "You know, I'd like a little pussy. "<eos> She said, "Me, too. Mine's as big as a house. "<eos> You see, she wanted a littler one cos hers was... big as a house.
That is her herd.<eos> She must be around here.<eos> I won't touch it.<eos> Other people's traps are sacred.<eos> Especially hers.
You don't know how badly I wanted you to ask.<eos> Omar Fatah murdered my son.<eos> You've brought wolves to our door, Charleston.<eos> To my door.<eos> If I could trade my life for his, I would...
I guess what I'm trying to say is that you should go and talk to that girl.<eos> You still don't understand, Olivia.<eos> We're not supposed to know what people think.<eos> Simon, don't let your ability stop you from living your life.<eos> I may not be able to read your mind, but I read his.
Best way to find her is to dig into the other two abductions.<eos> If it is the same unsub, their lives are gonna tell us about hers.<eos> Okay, our victim approaches from here. He's not drunk.<eos> He's cautious, responsible.<eos> If the club was as crowded as the police say, his view was occluded.
I think that'd be a good idea.<eos> Okay, 73 seconds station to station.<eos> And in that time frame, Tom Finnerty is stabbed.<eos> We assume the cowboy sees Jimmy with the knife, pulls out his gun.<eos> Security guard sees that, pulls out his.
But how?<eos> I'm not becoming a Cheerio.<eos> Wait.<eos> I don't need to be a cheerleader. - I just need to date one. - #Yeah, yeah #<eos> Get ready, black girl from Glee Club... whose name I can't remember right now. The Puckster is about to make you his.
And they were drooling over his date.<eos> The victim had a date at the bar?<eos> No, at the opening night mixer.<eos> An attractive young woman.<eos> You called her his ho-ho-ho. Oh, come on.
Touching, really.<eos> Poor miss Julia Talben.<eos> One so easily played.<eos> Julia Talben, all ambition with nothing to lose, perfectly inclined to be my willing guest.<eos> This house of a thousand tragedies required only a single tragedy all its own to become complete.
I don't know, um...<eos> Stay with my mom's transition team.<eos> Maybe go with her to Harrisburg... if I can.<eos> And what would be stopping you?<eos> This town has its own particular gravity.
But you're not ready for this.<eos> Garsiv's cavalry will lead the way.<eos> Princess Tamina.<eos> The Persian army, my princess, has not moved on.<eos> Their faith has little love for any truth other than its own.
Please.<eos> Wow, I really did teach you how to be a rich little twit, didn't I?<eos> I don't have a good excuse for what I did.<eos> I guess I just liked fitting in with those people.<eos> But this can be our own little club... every bit as fancy as theirs.
I'm not just a Sikh or a woman.<eos> I'm a red-state Democrat.<eos> That's three strikes.<eos> The last thing I can do at a time like this is vote my conscience over my constituents.<eos> Well, you may not want your faith to define you, but this bill defines my people by theirs.
Lobbying is about foresight.<eos> About anticipating your opponent's moves and devising counter-measures.<eos> I'd like to discuss my future.<eos> This is hardly the time, cookie.<eos> The winner plots one step ahead of the opposition, and plays a trump card just after they play theirs.
Casey won't be.<eos> He'll come after us, take her away and there won't be anything we can do about it.<eos> Well, then, we'll go to the police and tell them what you're telling...<eos> They are the police, Pa.<eos> My word won't hold up against theirs.
So what's the problem? Oh.<eos> I got this letter from G.F.C Records.<eos> That's your label?<eos> Yeah. Well, my former label, yeah.<eos> - They say the song's theirs?
You son of a bitch.<eos> Why on earth did you do that to me?<eos> Why on earth did you do it?<eos> Why is it that people covet what doesn't belong to them?<eos> They mistakenly think that what actually belongs to someone else is theirs and ultimately lose what belongs to them.
I would not have gotten through that surgery without you.<eos> Is that clear enough?<eos> You would have done the same thing for me.<eos> You know, I don't blame you for being scared.<eos> The family has changed your life, you've changed theirs.
If you're worried about coming forward, we can discuss your fears before you tell us what you know.<eos> Mrs Le Saux?<eos> "I am here with the police today."<eos> "I'm here with..."<eos> "I am here with the police today... ..to add my voice to theirs in asking for your help."
Try to save a guy's life and he kicks you right in the nuts.<eos> - You don't understand. Listen.<eos> - No, you don't understand.<eos> These people, they got their ticket to the future... by stepping on people like you and me!<eos> You wanna trade your life for one of theirs?
Keep the mainsail tight!<eos> Took me a while to get a feel for this part of it.<eos> Raise the black too soon and the prize will run.<eos> Raise it too late and you'll induce panic and a greater chance of resistance.<eos> You ought to show your colors at just the right moment to get them to strike theirs.
Rope off across the staircases and the back wing.<eos> Who are the guides?<eos> Do we need guides?<eos> Can't they just have a look and leave it at that? I don't think so.<eos> Not if you want them to go away happy, and leave behind what's not theirs.
I got a call from Czech Intelligence.<eos> I was told to let him walk.<eos> They wouldn't give me any details at the time, but I found out later that he was a part of a British operation.<eos> MI6.<eos> Dmitry was one of theirs.
What does it give me?<eos> Options.<eos> And all of them are good.<eos> The first thing it gives you is the Plaza will be empty.<eos> What can the people possibly protest about when the choice of who leads them is theirs?
You've said plenty.<eos> A professional like yourself wouldn't trust the camp to protect you.<eos> You had to get some sort of insurance directly from the parents, didn't you?<eos> Make sure that they were just as culpable for the crime.<eos> Your word against theirs wouldn't hold up in court, not with a child testifying to your abuse.
That's it?<eos> Closer to 30 after taxes.<eos> You're gonna miss him.<eos> Already do.<eos> The agency is burying it, but Megan ainsley was one of theirs, briefly.
Can you dig it out more?<eos> I can try.<eos> Same... said of... military.<eos> Our people... properly trained.<eos> Theirs are not.
Is that what they say?<eos> It seems to me the police force should be keeping the people safe.<eos> Sol have an idea.<eos> You do your job and you do your job.<eos> And don't come here telling other people how to do theirs.
He was the who's trying to... - No, no. He's only following their instructions.<eos> They can't do that.<eos> They said they'd stand by me. - They said...<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa... What did they say?<eos> They said the prosecution would try to divide us, use my word against theirs to make us all look guilty.
To my great regret.<eos> I need the name of that couple.<eos> I'm not at liberty to give it.<eos> Give me the name!<eos> They may have discovered that you let them be outbid in your baby auction, and decided to take back what they believe is rightfully theirs!
Doorman says he hasn't been there in weeks.<eos> ( Sighs )<eos> Okay, first thing we need to do is make sure the sheriffs stand down, not overreact to any understandable displays of resistance.<eos> You think they'll take that order from an aide?<eos> Our office to theirs.
Couldn't let your troubles interfere with what had to be done.<eos> The deal's all closed.<eos> Ain't nobody can touch it now.<eos> Doyle's family's on their way to our property up north.<eos> The future will be theirs, and theirs alone.
He brought a tree with him that he grew from seed<eos> He's determined to plant it for me when we get there<eos> Ah, when we get there ...<eos> My parents keep a brave face... but... no one should outlive their children<eos> The sicknes may be mine but the tragedy is theirs
- P.P.L. Is being sold as well.<eos> What?<eos> Why wasn't I told?<eos> Didn't seem pertinent.<eos> Trying to keep our company calm as well as theirs.
How tall was he?<eos> - What colour were his eyes?<eos> - I do not remember.<eos> It was long ago and in another lifetime.<eos> What matters is, I have returned to restore faith and hope to my people, to lead them back to the way of honour, and the glory that once was theirs and can be again.
- Their house is right by the water.<eos> - Really?<eos> With some of these people, it's like they're going down lists.<eos> Half the time, they're not even listening to you.<eos> They ask all about my family and don't tell me about theirs.
He spilled that oil, they say.<eos> No one saw him do it.<eos> Tatsuo wouldn't do that.<eos> Nigishima folks are selfish.<eos> It's our land, not theirs.
You gotta go. You gotta go.<eos> You've got nothing to worry about.<eos> Nothing to worry about at all.<eos> We've dealt with the committee before and they're really very understanding.<eos> They understand our problems and we understand theirs.
I can't even make the monthly payments.<eos> Salaried workers without pay, confined to this subproletariat where they are manpiulated...<eos> Shit!<eos> The cops!<eos> They'll never know that our struggle is theirs too, for we live in a weak and corrupt society where it's every man for himself lt's blocked off here too.
- Thank you.<eos> - You got tools, mister?<eos> - Um, I actually, I...<eos> No need.<eos> Use ours.
Right.<eos> Well, do either of you have any idea what they were after?<eos> We have customer records and files, but we checked, and everything's accounted for.<eos> What about the private offices?<eos> Miss Koha and I checked both ours.
It's not like you were really doing anything.<eos> Oh, you're going to be just fine.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You certainly have the eyes for it. Yes.<eos> They're even bigger than yours.
Oh. Erik didn't tell me.<eos> It's always been a secret dream of mine to live with Ole.<eos> I can see why.<eos> - Your eyes are brown. - Yes.<eos> Yours are blue.
Yes, yes.<eos> Your precious pack, that family you chose over us, and in doing so, you chose over hope.<eos> Is that what you were planning on telling her when she got older and asked for me, that I abandoned her?<eos> My parents left me!<eos> Yours turned their backs on you!
- to go outside of the family.<eos> - All right.<eos> So, my gays or yours?<eos> You know, let's do mine.<eos> Yours are still "just roommates."
You get them back when you leave.<eos> All parties may frisk all parties.<eos> I'm sympathetic to your grievances, but I can't be caught in the middle of them.<eos> I'm not the one trying to muscle in on someone else's rackets.<eos> [ Clears throat ] They're not yours.
Please, you can speak Norwegian.<eos> I'm a dedicated student to your culture.<eos> This will have consequences.<eos> Well, you started it.<eos> You beat up one of my guys, I beat up one of yours.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.<eos> I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.<eos> I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.<eos> And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves. But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.<eos> This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I'm afraid I have some bad news, gentlemen.<eos> The older wolf is sick.<eos> It wouldn't be a fair fight, at least not fair for all those who have laid down money.<eos> Ahh! I know how much you appreciate a good wolf fight and I don't wanna disappoint you, so we'll just watch this one transform, and that should salvage the evening somewhat, no?<eos> Or you could volunteer some of yours to fight him.
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry I lied to you.<eos> But yvette and the girls were there for me When robert and I split.<eos> They made me feel strong when I was weak.<eos> Listen, I'm the one who should be sorry.<eos> I have my friends, and you should be free to choose yours.
Kill him!<eos> Where is here?<eos> Hotel!<eos> Where are my clothes?<eos> Yours are dirty worn, I've got rid of it
NCIS probably doesn't need me back for awhile.<eos> Glass tray.<eos> What is it?<eos> I mean, clearly, it's a strand of hair, but...?<eos> I found it in the victim's hair. It's not hers.
[I can't believe it.]<eos> [She's a little angel.]<eos> [She is.]<eos> [She has your eyes.]<eos> [Hers are brown.]
Knees like brass doorknobs.<eos> Elbows so rough they could take the grain right off a two-by-four.<eos> And her eyes.<eos> They say the eyes are the window to the soul.<eos> Hers were more like steel-reinforced security doors with a combination I just had to crack.
You know, terrorists.<eos> Like your brother Rasheed.<eos> He made quite a name for himself.<eos> Men, women, children-- he's an equal opportunity killer.<eos> My brother's crimes are heinous, but they are his own.
You've come to the right place.<eos> Yeah, Liz is the, uh, world's preeminent authority on our parents.<eos> Nobody's been studying them longer.<eos> I lived among them for 18 years.<eos> Theirs is a crude and primitive world, but in some ways, it's beautiful.
It's obviously self-published, but listen to this.<eos> "All democracies from ancient Athens to the Roman Republic to the city-states of the Renaissance end.<eos> And they end the same way... As corrupt alliance of extreme wealth and centralized power.<eos> Ordinary citizens are deprived of liberty.<eos> What's rightfully theirs is taken away, and their children are sent to die in rich men's wars."
don't get hot and do anything stupid with that thing.<eos> I won't if they won't.<eos> What's taking your boys so long?<eos> My boys aren't coming.<eos> This is our problem, not theirs.
What about them?<eos> They're locked up back there.<eos> You always said leave no man behind.<eos> Dylan, I called in a favor to get you out of here.<eos> - I'm your father, not theirs. - Father?
Why didn't she just come home?<eos> Cos she's ashamed and she's confused and because she's bloody terrified.<eos> The men who do this, they have total control over these kids.<eos> The baby... Whose...?<eos> Is it one of theirs?
- I found this in her room. - What is this?<eos> "Triggerobjects.<eos> Astudyof humanemotion andtheafterlife."<eos> Her Bible.<eos> "Spirits bind themselves to earthly possessions, drawn by an object that was once theirs."
Just like the others.<eos> Charles!<eos> Come!<eos> Rescue your weaklings!<eos> Give your life for theirs!
What would we do without them?<eos> What do you make of her?<eos> It all sounds a bit daft, but she gets me.<eos> She's a liar.<eos> She tricked her friends to come to Germany for something that's not theirs.
They were my dad's.<eos> I don't have a receipt.<eos> Well, that's your problem, then.<eos> I can tell you everything that's in there without opening it.<eos> Yeah, I got guys coming in here all the time, claiming stuff is theirs.
He needs to verify the value.<eos> It was a pleasure doing business with you these past few months.<eos> You would never steal from your family, would you?<eos> The collection was mostly my mother's anyway.<eos> It is more mine than theirs.
We need to dig it up.<eos> Klaus.<eos> Aurora's bullet very nearly killed Elijah.<eos> When she returns, and she will, I would prefer the vampires of New Orleans be obligated to protect us.<eos> They'll be more likely to do so if our lives remain linked to theirs.
- No, he isn't!<eos> The moment he ambushed my soldiers in that lawnmower attack he became a rebel.<eos> Now, I take no pleasure in his punishment.<eos> Whether they know or not, those parents aren't going to give you any information.<eos> He's not one of theirs.
- How would he know?<eos> - Your clothes on the bed.<eos> If I'd answered the damn intercom and asked who it was, he wouldn't have come up.<eos> Okay, so go to the neighbors and explain you should've answered.<eos> - What business is it of theirs?
If I stop entertaining you, throw me to the curb.<eos> You wouldn't stick with your mechanic if he stopped fixing your car.<eos> I'm in a service industry.<eos> I'm just overpaid, okay?<eos> And a lot of... I feel a lot of artists, pop artists especially, sort of infringe upon... responsibilities that just aren't theirs, in terms of their audience, maintaining their audience at an emotional level.
With all that we went through I thought the worst was behind us.<eos> Dad had a heart attack about six months back.<eos> Nothing anyone could do.<eos> At least he passed quickly, You know, on his own terms.<eos> Not theirs.
You expect me to take care of them?<eos> They are your family.<eos> If Roman is dead, the Russian Pack, they will leave my children alone.<eos> What makes you so sure?<eos> This is Roman's blood feud, not theirs.
- Sorry.<eos> Mind your manners, boy.<eos> - If Jamal Al Fayeed gases Ma'an and a thousand of us perish, nothing.<eos> When our children die, we weep alone.<eos> Yet they expect the whole world to howl at the death of one of theirs.
No, it's because you're annoying.<eos> They were very probably letting us go before you started talking to them.<eos> That's harsh.<eos> I was trying to cut a deal.<eos> By offering them something that was already theirs?
The Jersey City PD asked very nicely for the same access that you are.<eos> We said no.<eos> So, they asked not so nicely.<eos> Now it's in the courts' hands.<eos> You can wait for a decision if you want, but I got to tell you... I'll take our lawyers over theirs any day.
"I can't find the words."<eos> But what if you didn't have to?<eos> Now, there is no way to prove whether our early ancestors used language as we know it or not.<eos> Yet, if language supplanted this older communication, the obvious conclusion is that language must be superior, sequitur quod, so are we.<eos> More to the point, what evolutionary advantage would our form of communication have over theirs?
And respect me?<eos> - Yes. Very much.<eos> - Which is it?<eos> Like or respect?<eos> It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in a language chiefly made by men to express theirs.
You know, sometimes we just... we do things for the people that we care about.<eos> Which is why... you should be calling Wade right now.<eos> I just tried, but he's still not answering.<eos> So I don't believe in marriage.<eos> You know, my parents... theirs was a complete sham, so why would I?
That's good news.<eos> So you're really happy I'm not dying? I am happy.<eos> Hallelujah.<eos> I got everyone gifts.<eos> The boys opened theirs.
Could it be we are no longer a beaten, drunken, vanishing people?<eos> We are united.<eos> We will not be harassed and intimidated anymore.<eos> These men have my back!<eos> And I have theirs.
We should leave now.<eos> Scatter into the cities, propagate until the odds are in our favor,<eos> - then let the humans decide...<eos> - Decide what?<eos> If they want to live in our world... or die in theirs.
We should leave now.<eos> Scatter into the cities, propagate until the odds are in our favor,<eos> - then let the humans decide...<eos> - Decide what?<eos> If they want to live in our world... or die in theirs.
After centuries of peace living that way. The aliens of Planet Penis are in danger of extinction just like their ancestors foretold.<eos> Their birthrate plummeted.<eos> So they end up invading Earth to retrieve their comrades?<eos> Bingo!<eos> It's not really retrieving. Technically, they came to reclaim what was already theirs.
But later, if anything comes of it.<eos> But how?<eos> Couldn't Sir John Darnley put in a good word?<eos> I'm sure, but the new owners won't take orders from him.<eos> Now that it is theirs, they'll do as they think fit.
And if you keep the house, then she'll be What?<eos> Less right?<eos> She could tell me she's sorry.<eos> We spend our whole lives waiting for our parents to apologize.<eos> They spend theirs Waiting for a thank you.
Well, you can be sorry later, because right now, we have to use your powers to find Doctor Light.<eos> Cisco, your abilities, how do they work?<eos> Uh, I get these feelings sometimes, these vibes, visions of the breachers when they come to this Earth.<eos> I just... I'm not sure what triggers it. Sometimes it just happens.<eos> Sometimes it's when I'm touching something of theirs.
Put down your weapons.<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> You're gonna kill the hostages no matter what I do.<eos> "No witnesses," I heard you say it.<eos> If my life can save theirs,
There's no conspiracy here. The insurance company will lose this battle.<eos> Well, I-I don't think your battle's gonna be with the insurance company.<eos> I think it's gonna be with these two boys.<eos> I think he's right.<eos> These boys have got too much honor to take something that's not rightfully theirs.
Their dispute has nothing to do with me.<eos> I will save this man his life if I can.<eos> That is what I do.<eos> Whatever your feelings, he has to go back, or they'll kill him.<eos> No knowing how the Chinese will take to this, hauling a half-dead of theirs into their midst.
Fiona helped me too.<eos> Mr. Gallagher, you have very special children.<eos> That's why I had to leave, Your Honor.<eos> I couldn't stand to see them live through my battles with addiction any longer.<eos> It was my fight, not theirs.
I'm flirting. [ Sighs ] That's what I was afraid of.<eos> I'm not gonna pretend I'm stupid just so a boy will like me.<eos> Of course not.<eos> But you don't have to put the poor guy to shame.<eos> Flirting with boys is about increasing your value, not decreasing theirs.
The dates of those e-mails correspond to payments made in Milverton's ledger.<eos> So Milverton was blackmailing Garvey and Garvey was paying.<eos> But we're still gonna tell the police about the videos before his parole hearing, right?<eos> We will discuss the matter with the three girls' parents at the appropriate time.<eos> The decision should and will be theirs.
That's what I thought.<eos> While I was recovering from the procedure, there was a fire.<eos> Our house burnt to the ground.<eos> And when I went back, it was just ash.<eos> And I needed something of theirs to touch, to connect to them.
Happen you better ring her mum and dad.<eos> I'm not ringing her mum and dad.<eos> Oh, well, that's grown up.<eos> They hate me. Well, they need to know, they need to share some of the responsibility, she's their daughter, that'll be their grandchild.<eos> Unequivocally, theirs.
You need to pull it together.<eos> I don't even know what that means, Lydia.<eos> Let the cops do their job.<eos> - And you can do yours.<eos> - They can do theirs.
Then you have a Shojo that will do whatever Dale compelled it to do right here on the box.<eos> Wait. Except it's not killing the people that screwed him over.<eos> Well, Dale's widow said the company was his baby.<eos> So, if he really wanted his friends to feel what he felt...<eos> He would take theirs.
- It is over.<eos> And it doesn't make it okay.<eos> I can't see anything.<eos> It's probably helicopters.<eos> Yeah, but are they ours or theirs?
Then she wasn't kidnapped.<eos> She ran.<eos> What about this Huck character?<eos> Is this really all there is? Well, Huck is obviously not his real name. CIA denies knowing him, but they also sent three agents over to my office to encourage me to stop checking into his background.<eos> So clearly he's one of theirs.
It doesn't feel like that.<eos> It feels like there's a child drowning... and I can't get there in time.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I teach my kids everything I know.<eos> Everything that's in me is theirs... cos I want them to be bigger, better and smarter than I am.
I spent all my money.<eos> Troy, you can't bring that in here.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> It's all-terrain, dummy.<eos> I made a plate of cookies for the study group, but my boys ate them, so since they took something of yours, you all get something of theirs.
Jones has lied to you.<eos> Everything that he's said.<eos> There's no war.<eos> Our two universes are allies now.<eos> Our world is helping to heal theirs.
He thinks you're making me say this.<eos> No, they're not.<eos> I promise.<eos> What I did today, it was wrong.<eos> It's my fault, not theirs.
- It was like a little shrine.<eos> - Yeah. He's their patron saint.<eos> You wanna hear my theory, sheriff?<eos> Cartels use scouts to find the best place to hide a grow.<eos> Freddy must have been theirs.
This and only this, sometimes on the sly, sometimes rudely, sometimes gently, sometimes brutally, but it has been going on and on.<eos> Yet only in one way, like a rat attack from ambush.<eos> Becouse for this perfect victory, it was also essential that the other side... think is, everything that's excellent, great in some way and noble, should not engage in any kind of fight.<eos> There shouldn't be any kind of struggle, just the sudden disappearance of one side, meaning the disappearance of the excellent, the great, the noble.<eos> So that by now these winning winners who attack from ambush rule earth, and there isn't a single tiny nook where one can hide something from them, because everything they can lay their hands on is theirs.

Enough, now shut it you two.<eos> That's my kids' stuff!<eos> The Delays identified it.<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> They say it's theirs.
I mean, isn't that a little...?<eos> She's thinking it over.<eos> Do your parents know?<eos> No. If I told them, they'd totally fuck it up.<eos> I mean, like, this is my life, not theirs.
Ill give him that.<eos> What exactly did he say?<eos> He said he was scaling down the operation, he needed to let some people go.<eos> He said, "Gerald, you've run your race.<eos> "You need to let the younger employees run theirs."
- How is he still alive?<eos> - He loves the lord, sir.<eos> Well, it seems that's a pretty one-sided relationship.<eos> When you blaspheme in this room, you insult agent Clarkson.<eos> Even the doctors, men of science, agree that his fate rests in God's hands, not theirs.
So?<eos> We do, too.<eos> - We have to sleep separately again.<eos> Stop acting like a child.<eos> These bodies are just as much theirs as ours.
- I don't know.<eos> - A big amount.<eos> - Enough to get to the World Cup?<eos> You know why those men were chasing us?<eos> This is probably theirs.
I'm different to all of you.<eos> I have blood on my hands.<eos> I can't tell if what I did was right or wrong.<eos> I'd like to think it was to save my friends, or as part of some noble crusade to save my country.<eos> Really it just comes down to the fact that I valued my life over theirs.
What if I do develop one? Well, unfortunately, that type of aneurysm is inoperable. So there wouldn't be anything we can do for you anyway.<eos> - So I should let the V's heal me?<eos> - Chad, as a doctor, I can only recommend what I know to be medically possible.<eos> - And as a friend? We don't know the long-term effects of the Visitors' healing methods.<eos> So you can either trust our medicine or theirs.
If you're truly interested in friendship, Hondo, might I suggest you stop threatening these farmers?<eos> Threatening them?<eos> Oh, please tell me you have not been listening to this bounty-hunting scum.<eos> Scum?<eos> We're just here to help them protect what's theirs.
If this leads to a lawsuit, we have no defense.<eos> - Jack, what's wrong?<eos> - I know one of these families. They live two blocks from me on Wisteria Lane.<eos> Then maybe you're the best person to tell them.<eos> How do you tell parents the child they've been raising, the child they love, isn't really theirs?
I saw myself laugh in the mirror last night, And I thought it looked a little horsey,<eos> So now I'm gonna say it instead of do it.<eos> Seems natural. Tell me more about shot slut.<eos> Oh, you don't get to play.<eos> I've known these idiots for years. They know my dirt, but I also know theirs.
There's something I need to tell you...<eos> It's the kind of thing that could end our friendship.<eos> A dying nurse made a confession...<eos> The people who run this hospital need to know what I did.<eos> How do you tell parents the child they've been raising isn't really theirs?
Oh, really?<eos> Are you gonna be there when my colleagues order up the trial transcripts and pass them around for kicks?<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> Look, they'll never take me seriously again.<eos> If I can't even watch my own back, how are they ever gonna trust me to watch theirs?
And so is she, I know. - About moving in--<eos> - I think we might be moving a bit fast.<eos> I love the idea of our family sharing a place together.<eos> One day. It's gonna be complicated, to say the least.<eos> We need to find our way and the kids need to find theirs.
"Tax" meaning "bribe", right?<eos> Fortunately, I happen to be very good at bribes.<eos> I agreed to meet you, Mr. Rist, because I thought you were a serious man who might be able to help me.<eos> But this isn't about helping me or anyone else, is it?<eos> This is about you playing the role of the charming, rich businessman who travels the world, getting his hands just dirty enough to go back home and tell his American friends how meaningful his life is compared to theirs.
Suit yourself.<eos> So the other jurors said you were a hold out, is that correct?<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> They all thought they were so much smarter than me.<eos> My vote counted just as much as theirs.
Ever tell you how old i was when my parents died?<eos> 5.<eos> I never really knew them very well.<eos> Everything about my life is not really mine.<eos> It's theirs.
All right, well, check the hospitals.<eos> - A bleed like that you're gonna have to take care of fast.<eos> - Okay. We got 20 witnesses, 20 different stories.<eos> Here's what we know for sure: three robbers, four FBI agents.<eos> They got two of ours, we got two of theirs.
Guess he sold them out.<eos> All right, we've got Buckley's phone.<eos> Where's Buckley?<eos> That's a lot of blood.<eos> It's not theirs.
Run along.<eos> G.<eos> You must know how greatly pleased I am that we have come to an arrangement.<eos> It's not good for little ones to be without their mother for so long.<eos> - My life for theirs.
As the crow flies, 40 leagues due east and two days, our banner will fly over Gunnere.<eos> No!<eos> It is time.<eos> For too long, our warriors have shunned that dreaded isle.<eos> Feared to tread on land that is theirs.
They're blocking subspace communication with a broadband inversion.<eos> They're hailing us again.<eos> is the inversion affecting sensors as well?<eos> All short-range sensors are useless.<eos> Which means theirs are useless too.
Could we get back by transporter?<eos> I know nothing about transporters.<eos> - No one knows them like O'Brien.<eos> - Ours.<eos> Who knows about theirs?
- Ba'el.<eos> - Tokath.<eos> Long ago, when your captives asked to stay here, ... ..our hope was to avoid dishonouring our children on the Homeworld.<eos> But perhaps, over the years, we lost sight of our children that we raised here.<eos> This is our prison. It should not be theirs.
What?<eos> Nine out of ten remain that way.<eos> Those kids came to bother me last night.<eos> Want me to retire.<eos> Says this street is theirs.
We have been very generous.<eos> It's not a question of generosity but justice.<eos> France is generous with her natives.<eos> We got them out of barbarism.<eos> I don't know if it's ours or theirs, given the series of atrocities we've been through.
Oh god there's those two runners from the beach... and Nancy.<eos> Hardy's mother, Jake's cousin<eos> I wonder what they're planning now?<eos> It's one conspiracy against another.<eos> Yours against theirs, yours to drown and theirs to prosecute.
That is fun.<eos> - What do you wanna do, Dean?<eos> - I wanna go to Harlem.<eos> Niggers are gonna riot.<eos> They think this country's theirs.
Good. Thank you.<eos> If he moves, kill him.<eos> Letek, we have broken our agreement with their captain.<eos> We will accuse the humans of preparing to ambush us.<eos> It will be our word against theirs.
- Hey, you guys, come on.<eos> In a time before the Earth, before the sun, and before the light of the stars, when all was darkness and chaos, the old gods, the forgotten gods, ruled the darkness.<eos> But what was theirs now belongs to the world of light and substance, and the old gods, the rightful masters, are jealous, watching mankind with a hatred that is as boundless as the stars, with plans for the destruction of man that are beyond imagining!<eos> There's a passageway between our physical world of light, pleasure, and their spiritual world of madness and pain.<eos> A gate behind which the demons wait for the chance to take back what is theirs!
- Hi.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - Found these boys with alcohol.<eos> That alcohol, officer?<eos> Oh, that's not theirs.
Mr Richet.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> I've just been told that the De Luca brothers gave out some toys to certain students.<eos> It was generous of them, but sadly, those little guns don't really belong to them.<eos> They bought them with money that wasn't really theirs.
It's my parents' house.<eos> They on vacation?<eos> No. They're dead.<eos> Then it's yours.<eos> No, it's theirs.
- Careful, Centurion.<eos> Watch you don't go too far.<eos> - So, what do you want?<eos> - Pay for my legionaries.<eos> They've not received it for months, because the money that is theirs has been distributed to your bodyguards.
I haven't?<eos> Well, it's the money, Mrs. Lampert, the money.<eos> The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction.<eos> Those three men want it, too. They want it very badly.<eos> But that's Charles's money, not theirs.
Those three men want it, too. They want it very badly.<eos> But that's Charles's money, not theirs.<eos> Oh, Mrs. Lampert, I'd love to see you try and convince them of that.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - But then whose is it? His or theirs?
They don't try to understand us.<eos> We should forget about them.<eos> We can be classmates and not be pals. They can't believe we're good in French. After a test the prof gives me a grade of 12 out of 20.<eos> I'm glad but I see how they look at me.<eos> They can't get over it. French is their mother tongue. They can't bear seeing a boy who began to study French when he was 7 years old get a higher grade than theirs.
Don't give them names.<eos> They may have had so many other adventures.<eos> Don't forget the dog.<eos> Why is a dog with them?<eos> It's not theirs.
- Hold your fire!<eos> _ Out of my way.<eos> _<eos> I'm a proud Bindawu man.<eos> My people we lived here for thousands of years and I'm here to take back what's ours.
They're settling this season's accounts and their buses stopped less in my restaurant this year.<eos> - How much less?<eos> - Half.<eos> López took them to the neighbor.<eos> Is the neighbor ours?
What the hell is this about a dissent memo?<eos> Now, tell me Madam Secretary, when are we going to see NFL football in, say, France?<eos> Well, that... that's a...<eos> that's a tricky question.<eos> I think, uh, every country loves its game just as much as we love ours.
As of now, plans for the King's memorial dedication remain intact.<eos> More on this story as details develop.'<eos> It won't change anything.<eos> It might fool a few people, but it won't fool your children.<eos> This monument is about memorializing your father's relationship with his kingdom, it's not about repairing ours.
'And what's left behind? Seats.'<eos> 'You just need to extend your support..'<eos> '..to our party, after Kundan's dead.' 'Who'll be the leader of your party..'<eos> '..of course, only you will decide.'<eos> 'That will take care of your job, and ours too.'
What are you guys doing at our table?<eos> What happened to der kaffee hausen?<eos> Our time in this room yesterday proved more pleasant than expected.<eos> It's got a good energy.<eos> That table is ours. This room is ours!
She has nowhere else to go. Debbie:<eos> I know that,honey.<eos> And we're not saying we're going to kick her out right away.<eos> We're not?<eos> Debbie: No,but we have to figure out a solution for her sake as well as ours.
This is actually how we fought.<eos> Historical European martial arts is the study of Europe's traditional fighting systems.<eos> I'm doing this because I had previously studied Asian martial arts and I wanted to study martial arts related to my own culture and the place that I'm from.<eos> Martial arts from Japan or China or southeast Asia, as valid as they are, I wanted something that was from my culture and for me.<eos> I came from a long background of doing martial arts so I wanted to see how modern arts compared to the old arts and it seems that their standard was every bit as complicated as ours, and possibly more so.
was a piece of microfilm which, when enlarged, proved to be photographs of the Engels Hydro-Electric Complex marked here and there for demolition.<eos> So there is no doubt that this man,<eos> Nathaniel Benton, who came to our country, supposedly, on a friendly scientific mission, is in reality, a paid saboteur.<eos> The State defender may now address the Court.<eos> The defendant, Nathaniel Benton, is an agricultural chemist respected in his country, and in ours, until his arrest.
Well, you make allowances for the ones you love.<eos> I made allowances for my brother till I saw that was going to get him killed.<eos> My mom made allowances like Nick's drama was giving her purpose.<eos> At least when we get back, your brother will be happy to see you.<eos> Mine?
You hide yourself up on a goddamn mountain.<eos> That's a goddamn coward!<eos> Drop the gun, Wade.<eos> Yeah, I don't think that's too likely right now.<eos> If you don't, I'm surely gonna use mine.
My lord, you have certainly...<eos> What is it?<eos> "Your lips... hungry... "devour me.<eos> They steal my breath.<eos> "Your body is mine.
Hey.<eos> How was your "not a date"?<eos> Well, it was interesting.<eos> I'm sittin' there at a place where you and I have been a thousand times before, and I'm thinkin' about how you always ordered the rib eye and a salad.<eos> But you didn't want the mashed potatoes, so I'd order double... 'cause when the food came, you'd always eat half of mine.
He's just a big, weird doll... like you said.<eos> - Hey, buddy.<eos> - Hmm? You know, I got a puppy in the back. You want to pet it?<eos> Uh... okay.<eos> You're mine!
- (MOCKINGLY) Yeah, a million bucks.<eos> I don't have a fucking million bucks, are you crazy?<eos> You fucking cheapskate!<eos> You walked away with a million fucking dollars!<eos> It wasn't all mine!
Listen to me, you bumbling little fool, we agreed, your problems, they're your problems, not mine.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - One, rude.<eos> Two...<eos> Okay, I'll just call her back on mine.
- Where are you going?<eos> - You're not the only one who took an oath.<eos> Bless you, doc. But I can't let you go.<eos> Let me?<eos> You do your job, I'll do mine.
- How soon can we move on this?<eos> - You want to conduct the mission?<eos> Would it keep you from resigning?<eos> Well, I--<eos> I need your expertise and your experience, and if both are telling me I'm wrong, I'd rather trust your instincts than mine.
You're all he cares about.<eos> The gods are dead.<eos> I am the only god.<eos> The one god.<eos> (thunder rumbles) All is mine.
By that time, we will have missed harvest. Come on.<eos> We can do it in less time than that.<eos> How much is it?<eos> Owner says the boudreauxs are offering eight.<eos> But he said, if I get closer to nine, it's mine.
I'm not a soldier.<eos> You were in the military, right?<eos> - Um, Major Philip Barrett?<eos> - You got shot.<eos> Your PTSD is no less significant than mine.
That part has to be played by a manly man.<eos> ( deep voice ) I can be manly.<eos> He must be such a manly man that there is another man inside of him.<eos> I'm sorry, I did not bring an extra adult diaper.<eos> - You can use mine.
- Already in the control room.<eos> You don't... You don't have to stand so close to me.<eos> Uh, you're the one standing close to me.<eos> This is my spot.<eos> Mine.
- Duh! What about you, sweetheart?<eos> - Rudolph the Reindeer.<eos> - He's so pretty I might have to take a bite.<eos> - No, Daddy!<eos> It's mine!
Okay.<eos> Yeah, you're okay.<eos> Your turn.<eos> I don't know any tricks though.<eos> C'mon I showed you mine.
Go see Patrick. He's got special equipment for you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Did you come up with your spy name yet?<eos> Mine would be "Amber Valentine."
I missed what?<eos> No, you didn't... you didn't miss anything.<eos> There's nothing to miss. I don't get my diploma for, like, a month.<eos> Which address did you give them, Shoshy?<eos> I think she gave them mine.
Johnny, what were you thinking?<eos> Look, I'll admit I didn't think everything through. But there was a level 5 out on him.<eos> I had to claim it before someone else did.<eos> BY using my name?<eos> Well, I couldn't use mine. I'm not licensed for kill work, you are!
Some would say your son is in a better place.<eos> I happen to believe true paradise lies in his father's arms, to be here with you<eos> in this moment<eos> and that is not our choice.<eos> God has made his plans and we cannot question his design, just as my people cannot question mine,
Perhaps I've said too much.<eos> That should give you something to think about, anyway.<eos> Are we, uh, we done here?<eos> Working out how you question Rusty alone is gonna take some time.<eos> Your problem, captain. Not mine. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I mean, I know it's been a while, but, uh... I imagine I don't have to remind you how he is.<eos> Baby, I'm fully aware of your Uncle's eccentricities, but I need his expertise.<eos> Don't worry. He ain't working for me. He's just working for me.<eos> You ready?<eos> You take your truck, I take mine.
You know, shouldn't take me more than a day or two just to get them someplace safe.<eos> And I request to go with him, Captain.<eos> Make sure he comes back.<eos> The boy can hardly wipe himself without my counsel. Oh, shut up.<eos> He just want to run into some more Indians so he can get a scalp like mine, sir.
I had nothing to do with that airport attack.<eos> Nothing.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Your DNA was on the bomb, pal.<eos> Whatever DNA you have is not mine!
You're leaving?<eos> Yes, we're about to go.<eos> Professor, I had a great time.<eos> - Professor, it was an honor.<eos> - The honor was all mine, Director.
Boss said back off, leather dick.<eos> Why don't you check yourself before you wreck yourself, Short Round, or I'll sic one of my new culebra girls on you.<eos> That's right.<eos> You'd be surprised at what you can find at a truck stop these days.<eos> You have your Greek chorus, but mine is so much more beautiful.
You were waiting for me to go to the bathroom. Then you were gonna give it to her like it's just from you. Gee.<eos> I hadn't thought of that, but thanks for the idea, idea man.<eos> Enjoy the bathroom.<eos> Give me the present.<eos> Until I get my $4.26, it's mine.
Guerrero!<eos> You think I'm fucking around with you, brother?<eos> This time, stay dead.<eos> Tell Mama I died like a man.<eos> Guerrero, you're mine.
Honey?<eos> Amy, we got that storage locker for both of our things, right?<eos> Not crazy about the bass in your voice, but, yes, that is true.<eos> Interesting.<eos> And yet nothing of mine lives here.
Yeah, reminds me of the time I smoked past you for a breakaway.<eos> How is it that you're the one who got to go pro, huh?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Is this your place, or what?<eos> Yeah, been mine for a while now.
Yes, sir.<eos> This is Tom Mason.<eos> I am told this is how you greet one another with honor.<eos> And I am honored to meet you, Tom Mason.<eos> The honor is mine, sir.
- That must be your hatchback out front.<eos> I bet it has a lot of leg room.<eos> Mike, a word.<eos> Did you need a napkin, ma'am?<eos> 'Cause that's mine.
Hello, Natasha.<eos> Sorry, lover. I don't really fancy you anymore.<eos> - That was really sad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Push me, somebody. This bastard is mine.
Really?<eos> He came to see you without my permission?<eos> Don't worry, Counsellor.<eos> It's under control.<eos> You do your job, I'll do mine.
Could you please tell him I came by?<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you for taking care of him.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's not mine.
- Ooh, that's a little heavy.<eos> - Well, it's your gun, Johnny.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> I'll manage.<eos> - You can try mine if you like, but you're always so rude about it.
Here you go, honey. You can hold him now.<eos> - No, I don't want to.<eos> - You should say goodbye.<eos> Just take him away.<eos> What the fuck, Karen? Thought you said it was mine.
I also use this living room as a photo-shoot set.<eos> Here's the kitchen and behind there is the laboratory, where I reveal the photos.<eos> This place has a special light for photos.<eos> You have no idea how helpful it is. At the end there is my room, this will be your room and also the guest's bathroom.<eos> It's a little small, so we can share mine if you'd like.
Don't ever drag me into a situation like that again.<eos> - What situation?<eos> - Your issues, whatever your cause is this time.<eos> - My name is on that hospital.<eos> - As is mine.
What the hell's going on?<eos> I need to flush out any back-up, make them come running.<eos> There's no back-up, it's just me. Yeah?<eos> So, you're looking after your own, that's not in the Anticorruption Code, mate.<eos> Well, it's mine.
- Wait, seriously? - Told you, dude.<eos> - I'm the best!<eos> - You're the worst.<eos> I'm out of the group?<eos> You're out of mine!
You know what?<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm not sorry that I fucked your little daughter.<eos> That I was the first one inside little Emma.<eos> That mine was the first cock she ever sucked.
We're doing fine without all that other stuff.<eos> Listen, cookie, I like your food, I really do.<eos> But do you think people actually come here to eat?<eos> The "other stuff" you want to drop from the menu earns another five bills every time somebody orders.<eos> I don't care, all right, the truck is half mine.
Got another one coming in.<eos> Dibs on footprint face.<eos> I got an unconscious sexy zombie nurse.<eos> - I'll take it. - Oh, no. No, no.<eos> This one is mine!
He needs to marry and give us grandchildren.<eos> There are plenty of women who'd have him.<eos> None of sufficient nobility, my love.<eos> And if he can't marry a title, he shall have to inherit one.<eos> Are you suggesting that I retire and give him mine?
Mr. Ultimate Fighter here.<eos> Oh, look at this. It's the chief.<eos> FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.<eos> That's right.<eos> I showed you mine. You want to show me yours?
Care to show me what's in your briefcase?<eos> A girl's got to be safe.<eos> Aw, damn it, Mikey.<eos> You're killing me, here.<eos> I showed you mine.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I thought... That both of our mothers were raped by the same man.<eos> Are you my sister?<eos> No.<eos> I ran your dna against mine.
When I saw you, I thought... I'm the tailor's son from Vasendorf. - I know.<eos> - What?<eos> The Baroness told me.<eos> What?<eos> That the teacher is from the village next to mine.
- I'm glad. Very glad.<eos> - I read your front page.<eos> Great headline: "The Matador."<eos> - How did you come up with it?<eos> - It's not mine.
It's still weird.<eos> You know, I used to be that young and hot.<eos> Now, at night, I sit in front of that damn magnifying mirror and pick at things that don't need to be picked, and all I see staring back at me is a big pile of old.<eos> Honey, it is not you. It's that damn little mirror.<eos> Look, mine's right here.
Jesus Christ!<eos> I'll kill last every one of you! You god damn hell whore!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> Hold it!<eos> This clown is all mine!
You're close now.<eos> Very, very close.<eos> You can't fight me.<eos> You.<eos> You are mine. Mine.
- We have time.<eos> There's no rush.<eos> - I'd really like it if you'd stay.<eos> - Yes, Captain, stay.<eos> - This is your diversion, not mine.
You're Nicolai.<eos> You're the man who blew us in Greece.<eos> Thank you, colonel.<eos> I've done your job.<eos> You help me do mine.
Suppose I reflect a transmission beam off the security shield, feed it back through a link crystal bank... and boost it through the transducer?<eos> Couldn't have put it better myself, master.<eos> I don't think you could. Ha!<eos> Agree.<eos> Possibility of your explanation being better than mine, less than 1%.
Oh, well. How about you?<eos> Everything is in readiness, master.<eos> We merely await your word.<eos> Tonight, my unconventional conventionists... you are to witness a new breakthrough... in biochemical research.<eos> And paradise is to be mine!
Won't it stand?<eos> You have to obey me.<eos> Go on!<eos> You're made like a woman.<eos> Now mine is standing!
What can we do now?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll handle him<eos> My pleasure, professor<eos> But not mine.
- Where is he?<eos> Mister, I'm looking for that miserable no-good, low-down sinner myself.<eos> And when I find him, I'll smite him hip and thigh.<eos> - How come you got his horse?<eos> - On account of he stole mine.
- Let's ask another question.<eos> - How are you Cabbar, brother?<eos> - Not bad.<eos> Is it true that the State would abolish the horse carts?<eos> Maybe the old ones like mine. The new ones will be allowed.
Come on over to the bunkhouse.<eos> This here gentleman calls himself Will Penny.<eos> He comes riding' around here as nice as you please, hopin' to find a nice job.<eos> And there lays old Claude, just beggin' him:<eos> "Take mine, Mr Penny, take mine!"
Pick those chains up.<eos> Come on!<eos> Ah, thank you, lad.<eos> It is thirsty work.<eos> That's mine.
The general will defend me.<eos> The great Christian hero will defend Zobeir the slaver. Before I receive my country from your bloody hands... I shall see it die.<eos> You killed my son.<eos> I executed him. Do you have sons, Gordon Pasha?<eos> You killed mine.
- Von Rundstedt.<eos> Military Commander, Western Front.<eos> How soon can my train be cleared to leave?<eos> As soon as I get another order.<eos> It's your army, Colonel, not mine.
You don't understand.<eos> I ran away from a battle.<eos> I've been running ever since.<eos> I got caught running away.<eos> Son, your whole Union Army's been running from mine for the last three years.
- This gentleman is waiting.<eos> Buddy boy, I'm standing right here like an elm until you cash that check.<eos> You ought to be more careful.<eos> I may win this casino.<eos> The whole joint could be mine.
He won't shoot to kill.<eos> Can't you see it?<eos> Might as well get off your tail, Milo.<eos> I plan to take this buzzard any time now.<eos> The first time he turns around or goes down, he's mine.
Listen, you big misguided ham shank: Love is nothing but lust, lust and more lust, with a lot of cheating, lies and general tomfoolery thrown in.<eos> – It hurts all the same. – Of course it does.<eos> Love is the blackest of all plagues, and the only pleasure would be to die of it.<eos> But it almost always passes.<eos> No, mine won't.
Stop breathing that clam sauce on me.<eos> I wish you'd let me go to work on that cheese-eater.<eos> I'd top the bum off lovely.<eos> Wait'll we get off this front page.<eos> Then he's mine.
And when, at times, I looked at him,.. I felt like a rapture. Why, I too am a woman like you!<eos> While I hugged him, while I kissed him,.. I heard my child's voice telling me:..<eos> "Stop!<eos> Leave him alone, mother!<eos> That blood is mine!
Still... World changes, eh, June?<eos> Even if we don't.<eos> So... Look after yourself, son.<eos> The old wino was my father.<eos> This fool is yours.
He can look through your dad's files and see if there's a number for the caretaker.<eos> Fuck.<eos> No signal.<eos> Well, try him again then.<eos> What about yours?
And now that you've married me, I have a confession.<eos> I think I might be pregnant.<eos> - No!<eos> - Not to worry, love.<eos> - It's yours, probably.
Yeah, it was. I really had fun.<eos> I'm glad, honey.<eos> That's good.<eos> Can I come to the wedding tomorrow?<eos> I have to write a review of a sermon, and I thought I'd savage yours.
I came here for you.<eos> The world is about to turn upside down.<eos> When it's righted again, you will be Vice President, provided you play your part.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's time for you to take what's yours, son.
Isn't that right, sweetheart?<eos> Who is she?<eos> She's the thing you've been fighting against.<eos> The same way we were.<eos> Except you call yours...
Uh, it's been about eight weeks, and I'm up to the Cs now.<eos> - Hold for laughs.<eos> - Really?<eos> You know what?<eos> A-at least my audience can get up and leave; yours are trapped till they finish their unpronounceable sausage specials.
I wanna talk...<eos> - about a truck...<eos> - A truck?<eos> Sonny, you and I, we got a good thing goin' here.<eos> This arrangement works well, I stay in my corner, - you play in yours...
- Hey! - Whoa!<eos> No.<eos> We are not, not, killing a U.S. senator.<eos> But we will commit a felony almost as stupid.<eos> Ok sloth, you're the most honest one on the damn council, so I'm counting on you to not kiss my ass or cover yours.
You live in ours.<eos> You know that 800 grand?<eos> Eight hundred thousand fucking dollars?<eos> See, that's ours.<eos> That's not yours.
Stop your flapping about, bird.<eos> You need to be resting that wing of yours.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> Me name is Aynsley and for what I understand, yours is Tuesday.
Then let me soothe your nerves.<eos> Wow.<eos> You, my friend, look like a...<eos> Glock 17 kind of guy.<eos> And for a mere $300, all this can be yours.
A bit excessive with the voltage, wouldn't you say?<eos> You sound like one of our old dons at Cambridge.<eos> "I find your methods questionable, Victor."<eos> God, how they disapproved of your work.<eos> - And yours.
Have a great day, Mason.<eos> You too, Corey.<eos> Whatcha doin'?<eos> Uh, nothing. Just checking out this locker.<eos> Is it yours?
We need to bury the past.<eos> It's the only way to save the future.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It is time, my son.<eos> My journey ends, but yours begins.
None of this was foreseen.<eos> You're walking through a red forest.<eos> The grass was tall.<eos> It is time, my son.<eos> My journey ends, but yours begins.
- The mayor?<eos> How high does this go?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But I can tell by that look in your eye that you're not gonna get any rest till you figure it out.<eos> So if you wanna camp out in here... it's all yours.
Course!<eos> I used to come here when... After...<eos> Lucky dip.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Still got yours?
Keep talking, killer.<eos> On second thought, I gotta bounce.<eos> What about your car? I don't own one.<eos> Wait, can I get your number?<eos> That's okay, baby. I've got yours.
Mornin', Jane.<eos> Oh, hey, morning'.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> What?<eos> It's yours...
Dwight might have been a totally different person if he'd only been told who he was.<eos> You used our son to kill people.<eos> Your son killed people. Not my son.<eos> My sons are builders.<eos> Yours was weak and ultimately better dead than alive.
You got valet.<eos> You got valet.<eos> This is beautiful.<eos> The valet's yours.<eos> The valet's yours.
Great idea. - Would you bring me another...<eos> Hey, pal, if you want to do a little do-si-do with Gloria, the gal I walked in here with, she's got quite a beaver.<eos> What?<eos> Her coat is beaver.<eos> Care to tell me what yours looks like?
Can most guys do this?<eos> Most guys couldn't do that.<eos> Just like most teams wouldn't give a fuck if you beatbox, make your titties move, jerk off in your own time.<eos> You got holes in your game, bro.<eos> Shit, my game is better than yours ever was.
- You owe me a hundred.<eos> - They just pulled his offer.<eos> You fucking serious?<eos> When it's over, it's over, pal.<eos> It ain't yours unless you get it in the boat.
You're exactly the kind of woman she would have wished for her son.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's only one thing that would've worried her.<eos> My wife would say you're a little too beautiful.<eos> All the great tragedies start with a face like yours.
- Bye, Lucifer!<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't care much for my dad.<eos> But... you clearly... care about yours. Which is why you followed in his footsteps, I suppose.
Okay. But I have to keep your hands tied.<eos> I understand.<eos> Boss, you there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nothing's happened at my T.E.L.L. yet. - Any luck with yours?
- That's not possible. - (SCREAMS)<eos> Stop it, stop it.<eos> Who's that baby?<eos> That's Ben.<eos> Is he yours?
I've been here for hours.<eos> I wanted to confirm that this wasn't a waste of my time.<eos> Well, what about my time?<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> My time is much more valuable than yours.
Well, if it isn't Louis Shit.<eos> What's happening, boss?<eos> You bastard.<eos> You took my mugs, and you didn't even have the balls to do it yourself.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about, but if something of yours is in here, it had nothing to do with me.
A place to put it.<eos> It didn't mean anything!<eos> You said she knew things about some certain business activities.<eos> I have a mouth, Gordy.<eos> I have a heart and a soul and a mouth and a youth and it was all yours.
If it is your day to shave, make sure you eat first.<eos> Blade down, boss.<eos> Not seen you before.<eos> James.<eos> When a man tells you his name, it is only common decency to tell him yours.
And I can see you.<eos> Mommy.<eos> The rabbit.<eos> [Chuckles] Of course.<eos> It's yours now.
Okay. Bye.<eos> I love you, Gus Grissom.<eos> I love you, too, hon.<eos> You let me run the house exactly the way I want.<eos> You don't tell me how to do my job. I don't tell you how to do yours.
You know, I like you, for some reason, and I want to help you, but I can't do it alone.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> You think he'll get away with it?<eos> You and your family of libertines, you think you can protect each other?<eos> Perhaps there has been some mistake. The mistake, brother, is yours.
So, you and Cut not partners anymore, huh?<eos> Good catch.<eos> Thought maybe you got lost.<eos> This pad is crazy.<eos> - It yours?
Englishmen and their books.<eos> Perhaps you had been better advised to sell your book and buy a nicer coat.<eos> This is John Uskglass's book, fairy, and it tells the fortunes of us all.<eos> And what is your fortune?<eos> I dunno, but it's better than yours.
No way.<eos> A Tsukasa Hinoura knife?<eos> I had it specially flown over from Japan.<eos> I'd like to say "you shouldn't have," but I'm afraid you might take it back.<eos> Don't worry. It's yours to keep.
Wesley Snipes was wrong... you don't always bet on black.<eos> Also, you do have to pay your taxes.<eos> All right, sweetie, have you lost yet?<eos> Because Mikayla wants to go...<eos> Is that all yours?
Okay, Thompson, that's enough. - It tastes even better.<eos> - Agent, you should leave!<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> You tell us what you saw at the boatyard...<eos> This is all yours.
Promising future.<eos> Would've done anything for her, including walking away from another woman.<eos> Virginia called the whole thing off a few days before she was supposed to join him in Los Angeles.<eos> Broke his heart, poor fellow.<eos> But I'm sure yours is more resilient.
Can I?<eos> Um, maybe don't.<eos> Actually, don't. [ Chuckles ]<eos> Well, shit. don't put it out there, then.<eos> This really isn't yours?
That was unnecessary.<eos> But not inaccurate.<eos> You're right, Jim.<eos> I don't know why this is happening.<eos> But I'll be damned if you're gonna tell me there's nothing wrong in that stubborn head of yours.
Well, if it isn't Former Officer Porter.<eos> Enjoying your free time?<eos> Maybe a little too much?<eos> What is it, Schaefer?<eos> We received a tip there's a drunk driver on the road in a truck that matches yours.
Oh, Chad, that's amazing. I love you so much.<eos> But, Chad, listen.<eos> You have to help us.<eos> We're trapped in the house and the power went out and my phone is the only one that's working because I'm pretty sure the killer knocked down a cell tower or something.<eos> Wait, well, why does yours work, then?
Soon, child.<eos> Soon we shall be together every day and every night and nevermore be parted.<eos> When, mother?<eos> When all my work is complete.<eos> And all the world shall be yours.
Exquisite.<eos> He took my breath away.<eos> But we are told not to speak so much of the time before we joined the Order.<eos> We all found our way to this life for a reason.<eos> Was he yours?
Go home.<eos> I'll keep you posted.<eos> Bye, honey.<eos> I appreciate you coming down, Gina.<eos> Yeah, well, I hate to say it but I'm glad this case is all yours now.
Espen!<eos> You're well endowed.<eos> Are you saying that because I'm white?<eos> I'm just messing with you, buddy!<eos> Mine is just as small as yours.
If you ever have trouble getting something or somewhere, we can make it happen.<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause I may need your help again.<eos> Well, who knows?<eos> We may need yours.
After that, we have to notify your mother.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> It's your move, kid.<eos> [ Sighs ] So...<eos> If you positively I.D. Paloma, we have to swab her D.N.A. to see if it matches yours.
If Arthur was here, he'll know why.<eos> Joo-Joo, my man!<eos> Ohhhh! Dr. Rosie?<eos> Hey, come on in here, man, drink it up.<eos> What's mine is yours.
That way?<eos> Thanks.<eos> And that logo?<eos> - What about it?<eos> - Is it yours?
There we go. Okay.<eos> Why are we looking at the lobby in my building?<eos> Um, well, I was thinking about your apartment problem.<eos> And so, I decided to poke around a bit, see if I could help out.<eos> Like a lot of old buildings downtown, yours wasn't always used for housing.
I need a minute with my father.<eos> Fine.<eos> You know Annalise is gonna come after you, too, for the David Allen case.<eos> I did nothing wrong there.<eos> Dad, we're both here because of stupid stuff I did in my past, so you can be honest about yours.
And by this... I give this boy the name Jingim.<eos> "True gold."<eos> So be it.<eos> He will walk out of here with this name, and carry it as his own into a tomorrow only the oracles can see.<eos> As for you, priest... this temple is yours.
Photos of every reality you and Danny have visited.<eos> They're not mine, they belong to another Milo.<eos> Oh, and I guess this notebook, that belongs to another Milo too, does it?<eos> A precise list of locations, each in a different reality.<eos> That not yours either, eh?
Sentimentality?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I just think you have to believe in possibility.<eos> Oh, sweetie. Welcome to New York.<eos> You're young and you're pretty and the world is yours.
Are you all right?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Where were you?<eos> It does not concern you.<eos> Father, for all the deceits I may have foisted upon you, yours to me remains the greatest.
About that time mate.<eos> Come on pack it up, come back tomorrow.<eos> - You told me to confront my guilt.<eos> - SHUT THE FUCK UP!<eos> Out of all the millions of people and cabs in this town, I landed on yours.
Heartless, cold bullets to the back of the head, just the way they killed my boy.<eos> That's a natural reaction.<eos> The desire for revenge, it's a part of grieving.<eos> The difference is in my world, I knew that those violent desires would never become real.<eos> In yours, it's a very likely outcome.
No hands!<eos> Grunkle Stan, what happened to your hands?<eos> So I might have got cursed a little, but the watch looks nice, right?<eos> Foolish man, thieving hands find wicked face!<eos> You must return what isn't yours...
Oh, yeah, I remember that guy.<eos> Never thought I'd see you in here again.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> You going to waste that?<eos> It's all yours.
Which is why we can't see each other any longer.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Look...<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> My darling, I'm yours.
Did it get stuck in your throat?<eos> Good heavens... ? !<eos> Here, take some more vegetables.<eos> I found this mobile on the kitchen floor.<eos> Is it yours?
Ronnie, honey, did a doo-doo grenade go off in your diaper?<eos> - You gonna change it?<eos> - That's not my son, that's your son.<eos> Yesterday was my diaper day.<eos> Today he is all yours, and it's gonna get nasty.
I'm laissez-faire, you're anal.<eos> Hey, you dirty sod!<eos> On you go.<eos> I think it's fine for a man to wear Crocs, and you've made it abundantly clear you do not.<eos> I know it's only been seven months, and some of you think that we're crazy for getting married, but... all I know is, from the first moment I saw you, I knew that yours was the only face and the only voice... - that I would ever need again.
Ah, but the fun is only getting started, isn't' it? Now, let me see.<eos> I'm just gonna get a little photograph of you.<eos> Ah, c'mon Jake, I'm just trying to have a little bit of fun.<eos> That's quite the accent. Oh really?<eos> I like yours too but can you empty your pockets and put your belongings on the table before I lose my patience.
No more running from your plan<eos> AII I need is your sweet love<eos> 'Cause you cleanse me deep within<eos> AII I ever want is you<eos> 'Cause you are mine, and I am yours
We're also on Facebook and Twitter.<eos> Got lots of friends and followers.<eos> Hey, who's this?<eos> What's your name, little man?<eos> So, Shawn, I believe this is yours.
Is your party under anyone's pressure?<eos> Ms. Zoya, answer us.<eos> He's yours.<eos> My Kundan never spat blood.<eos> He's yours.
Sorry?<eos> I think Mrs. Carson would like you, my secretary, to get her a cup of coffee.<eos> If it's not too much trouble.<eos> Two sugars in mine, doll.<eos> Oh, I will put a little extra something in yours, doll.
Oh! Gee!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay, honey, you can look.<eos> I spent a lot of money for it.<eos> Go ahead, it's all yours.
Everybody's been waiting a while for this dance.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, let's give it up for the newlyweds!<eos> The next time you're in your doctor's office, remember...<eos> She's not asking all those questions for her health.<eos> She's asking them for yours.
Cars.<eos> Why do we hate them?<eos> Because they're stupid and impossible to drive, and everyone... does it better than me.<eos> I'm such a loser.<eos> Are you absolutely sure the baby's yours?
Tell them I would buy every ounce of sulphur this mine produces throughout this coming year.<eos> And whatever else lies in storage.<eos> You are contemplating a war, sir?<eos> A war or a peace. Does it matter?<eos> This palace is yours.
Good a guess as anything I got.<eos> Hey, listen-- listen, about everything that happened...<eos> Hey.<eos> I caught her scent.<eos> It yours?
He said it was cool for you to stay.<eos> [ Thud ] Hey. Have you lost weight?<eos> Come on.<eos> Hope you don't mind the couch...<eos> [ Grunts ] [ Thud ] Even though you kicked me off yours.
We both know I can't un [Bleep] Ethel.<eos> But if it's any consolation, I'd like to sign your album!<eos> That would mean a lot.<eos> Now, if I'm not mistaken, we have an event to get to by 9:00 A.M.<eos> I believe this is yours.
So can we talk about my name change now?<eos> Oh, brother.<eos> I spoke to the county clerk and he'll need your signature on a petition I've already filled.<eos> - You have a beautiful name.<eos> - And you changed yours.
- Yes, of course.<eos> I'll manage.<eos> - You can try mine if you like, but you're always so rude about it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I'll try yours, then.
The only reason that Nolan invested with your father is because Tyler's blackmailing him.<eos> The Graysons are incredibly powerful, your honor.<eos> I was intimidated into helping them frame David Clarke.<eos> I've hired a lawyer, Daniel.<eos> It might get ugly. As far as I'm concerned, whatever you want in this divorce is yours.
As the Russians say...<eos> "Kto ni riskuyet tot ni piyot shampanskava."<eos> Translation?<eos> "He who doesn't risk never gets to drink champagne."<eos> Captain... The left seat is yours.
You actually do work here.<eos> Didn't you hit on me in some bar recently?<eos> You know how some women don't remember the pain of child labor?<eos> I don't remember the bar.<eos> And yet here I am, rosy cheeked, 153 pounds, 7 ounces, right in the office next to yours.
Well, that's it... I'm skint now.<eos> Stony-broke. Thanks to you.<eos> Oh, dry up, will ya?<eos> Here's your ruddy pound back.<eos> You'll get yours next pay.
Son of a bitch!<eos> - Relax, it's just shampoo.<eos> He can have some of mine.<eos> You don't have any.<eos> Trust me, yours is gone.
- Come on, Jackie boy.<eos> Come on, Jax.<eos> Maybe you do have some Irish blood left in you, boy.<eos> Yeah?<eos> By the time I'm done, yours is gonna be in a puddle at your feet.
I'll be really gentle with him.<eos> That's it. Good man.<eos> Good man...<eos> Good lad, that's it.<eos> The blood on the blanket - is that yours?
It's Maggie from downstairs. - You can go on in.<eos> He's waiting for you. - Thank you.<eos> You own this now, my friend.<eos> You have bought it. You have paid for it and you have the receipt.<eos> I wanna be crystal clear: This is yours.
They said, "Don't let them Jew you down."<eos> That's how it always starts, you know?<eos> With jokes.<eos> There's blood on your coat there.<eos> Is it yours?
Hello?<eos> Hey, serge, how are you?<eos> Listen, I'm gonna have to give you a call back.<eos> I'm on the other line with a different buyer.<eos> But if he starts dragging his feet, it's all yours, buddy.
I said the knife in the picture wasn't mine.<eos> I said it twice and nobody listened to me.<eos> What are you now?<eos> The goddamn lawyer?<eos> You said it wasn't yours... what you should've said was 'I had a knife, Mick'.
This is none of your business.<eos> I'm talking to this boy, so could you please leave?<eos> I'm going to watch you,<eos> I don't like this!<eos> Give me that, it's not yours.
I hope that Brother will once again take me in.<eos> Conquering the world and achieving great things.<eos> Brother, look...<eos> This was all for your sake.<eos> This throne is yours.
I want to talk to my lawyer.<eos> Later, for now you come with me.<eos> I found this.<eos> Wow, hot stuff.<eos> Is this yours?
This is for you.<eos> Do what you want.<eos> What?<eos> There was a number on there.<eos> - Was it yours?
Okay, we've got peach bruschetta on peach toast, peach-aroni peach-za and my famous BLTs-- or should I say, PPPs?<eos> Come on, people, peaches!<eos> Uh, honey, on a non-stone fruit-related topic, I booked us a couples massage.<eos> Ooh... couples!<eos> That way I can enjoy my massage, and make sure you don't enjoy yours too much.
Air, water.<eos> Light, even.<eos> But you you will experience loss the way I did.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You destroyed my universe, son and I'm going to destroy yours.
Place don't look worse for the wear.<eos> Yeah, yeah, no, if you, I mean, if you ignore the frame d, uh, the bullet holes, and the general fucked-up-ness of everything.<eos> Don't be bitter.<eos> Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.<eos> Is this yours? No.
You're a brave man, father.<eos> So are you.<eos> And despite what's happened today, you have to stay close to Anna.<eos> That's your role in this fight.<eos> Even if it costs you yours?
Oh, my tattoo. Excellent question.<eos> Um, I don't know, like, a week or so. Oh. Yeah.<eos> That was fast.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you get yours taken off?
Father?<eos> Thor, my son, the power of my fathers is now in you.<eos> Use the Hammer.<eos> Find it.<eos> Take this Hammer, son, the power is now yours.
"and, babe, I need my freedom.<eos> "We'll always have second base."<eos> Did Brayden just break up with you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You win. He's all yours.
But I'm already happy.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, my darling I can't tell lies.<eos> I can't.<eos> It is right that I return what is yours.
People want to hear you sing.<eos> I can't handle 25 requests for "elvira."<eos> So it's snack foods or nothing.<eos> Sorry, mama.<eos> No, listen, son, people are doing their part around here, and I expect you to do yours.
It's a semen-drenched teddy bear.<eos> I've got bigger things to worry about.<eos> I pretty much burned through my savings. I might have to get a job.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were short, mate?<eos> What's mine is yours.
We're making some progress.<eos> So,who'd you shoot,Agent DiNozzo?<eos> You got pizza,boss?<eos> Something wrong?<eos> It's not yours.
Oh, no, honey, I...<eos> Lord! Darling, there's no way I'm letting you go back out in that storm.<eos> You know, I've always wanted a tattoo, but [Laughs] My wife, she put the kibosh on it.<eos> Mighty obedient of you.<eos> Where'd you get yours?
♪ Don't think that I don't care ♪ But every hope and every prayer ♪ Rests on you now ♪<eos> I can't!<eos> Christine!<eos> So, it is to be war between us!<eos> But this time, my clever friend, the disaster will be yours!
Nice way to avoid a birthday.<eos> I've never been one for family celebrations, you know?<eos> Thank you for saving Ainhoa.<eos> Why are you thanking me?<eos> By chance Ainhoa is something of yours?
- Nothing funny.<eos> - Move!<eos> Does that jar anything loose?<eos> You call that music?<eos> You seem to have forgotten that all toys have a breaking point and you've reached yours!
It was sad.<eos> But I fixed it for him.<eos> Didn't I, uncle walter?<eos> Yes. Yes, my dear, you were right.<eos> Yours was a proper ending.
Oh, 16.<eos> Trevor Dunne.<eos> He wore a puka shell necklace, he was real tan, and...<eos> Okay. Did your dad nail your window shut?<eos> Honey, my dad was nothing like yours.
Justin, pull yourself together.<eos> You're pathetic.<eos> We've got a job to do.<eos> Look, Sarah, I don't think this is a good idea.<eos> Think of it this way, little brother... one-fifth of the money dad left her can be yours.
I mean, here, in court.<eos> You sued me.<eos> I know that, but isn't... Isn't there a more civil way of doing this?<eos> Your lawyer knows all these personal things about everyone.<eos> So does yours.
I think there's something wrong with me.<eos> Where are the pictures?<eos> First paper's due Monday, And I've written two words- my name.<eos> Look.<eos> Is that yours?
- Takedown. - Come on.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Peck, good work.<eos> - All right, Jay.<eos> He's all yours, buddy.
So my brother, how have you been managing your new life?<eos> Well there's a lot more rules than I am used to.<eos> Not that he pays attention to any of them.<eos> Yes I suppose it would be harder for you than for me.<eos> My father is a bit more formal than yours.
Sneaking onto a Nascar racetrack, and hijacking a car for a joyride.<eos> That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing.<eos> Thanks, doc, but you aren't going to make me feel any better.<eos> No, really.<eos> Of all the idiotic, dumb ways I've seen kids injure themselves, yours takes the retard cake!
Come here, man.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come here, man.<eos> My man's out, I want to bet on yours.
We just wanna help, bro.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> Not us? Then who?<eos> Whatever you need. Build it, strip it, chop it.<eos> Garage's is yours, Homez...
- All right.<eos> - N-n-n-no.<eos> No, what are you doing?<eos> I'm doing my job, mate.<eos> Now, come on, do yours.
- Don't blame that backwards boy of yours, neither.<eos> Told Pearl she should never have married you.<eos> - You watch your filthy mouth.<eos> - You count your blessings.<eos> At least two of them boys, they got Pearl's blood in 'em and not yours.
No matter what happens, keep this truck moving.<eos> Mother fuckers!<eos> Hey, Cain.<eos> What a blood of kings runs through my veins. You must die my brother.<eos> The only blood it's gonna run tonight is yours.
What if he's ready for that?<eos> What if he knocks us out?<eos> I say we take off right now.<eos> You do what you like. I'm not running around the countryside with this bull's-eye on.<eos> Fine, Gwildor's all yours.
-Yeah.<eos> Southwest Aniline again?<eos> What's this?<eos> It's the blue meth we found up by your late homey.<eos> Tuco wasn't my homey, any more than Charlie Manson was yours.
You make a lovely nurse,<eos> "'I cannot come to visit you, "'but is it possible that I should never see you?<eos> "I love you madly.<eos> Can I never?<eos> '" "And blocking her path," "he brought his face close to hers."
I feel nothing for you.<eos> And there is nothing in morality or causality to stop me from killing you.<eos> So go live your lives. What little you have left of them.<eos> - Eliza wouldn't want you to do that.<eos> - You may have given me my name, Mother. You will not take hers.
You know, if something's bothering you,<eos> I might be able to help.<eos> You know, I want to help.<eos> It's my mom's ring.<eos> It's not hers.
- Nuclear suitcase bomb.<eos> Plants, mate.<eos> Growth patterns.<eos> My goal is to accelerate the maturation period.<eos> A system like hers could help eradicate world hunger.
We should all be with family.<eos> Is this enough carrots?<eos> That's plenty, love.<eos> My husband, he used to do all the cooking.<eos> I spent years trying to get the stew to taste exactly like his.
Good.<eos> Now make this bed up better than you ever have, or I'm gonna sic Patty Cannon on you.<eos> - Who shares this shame?<eos> - Speak, girl! Who was the father?<eos> The ancestors took your child for your sin, for his sin.
How about, um... how about you let Mom and Dad talk for a little bit, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Charlie has blood on him.<eos> It's not his.
- Rudy.<eos> I didn't come here looking for trouble.<eos> It just follows you?<eos> Where's my brother?<eos> It's not my case. It's his.
James St. Patrick.<eos> He's in for murdering an FBI agent.<eos> My kinda guy.<eos> I figured he was somebody fuckin' important.<eos> That chink prosecutor dropped my case for his.
Why would you make me remember that?<eos> Because... You need to know your enemy before you have any hope of defeating him.<eos> The next step is to face him.<eos> What, do you mean go back in there?<eos> This is your gift, it's not his.
Get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Good morning, officers.<eos> The ambassador is ready for you, sir.<eos> From my palace to his, then.
For the good of the nation, we need to disband this committee, and put this behind us.<eos> The president most likely would not have survived the hearings.<eos> You could argue that he had no choice but to resign.<eos> But we can't deny that his testimony struck a chord.<eos> Well, that may be true. But how is it that you, Congressman Romero, his biggest critic, are supporting him now?
Please don't tell Mama.<eos> Don't tell Mama?<eos> What about, "Don't tell Papa?"<eos> A boy is supposed to fear his father.<eos> I shook in my boots around my old man, just like he did around his.
OK, and if we discover stronger evidence connecting him to that, we'll get him back in.<eos> You mean I will.<eos> Of course.<eos> I mean, I'll step back from any investigation concerning him.<eos> I reiterate, you cannot be involved in any proceedings in which your name and his appears in a transcript, which might turn up in court, or where you would be called as a witness.
- '..are to be moved temporarily from their homes...' - No, they're not taking ours away.<eos> - Course they are.<eos> No, they're not.<eos> Over my dead body!<eos> It will be over his dead body, then.
I fear it's my duty now, considering.<eos> But you should know that in doing so,<eos> I knew you were peculiar when you were born.<eos> But your grandfather forbid me to tell you anything.<eos> His dearest wish was for you to have an ordinary childhood.
He actually... You know, he had the whole shtick. The, uh...<eos> You know, the little amortization book, and the green eyeshade, and the, like, dorky pocket protector and...<eos> I have a pocket protector.<eos> That's a nice one.<eos> I mean, his was dorky, that's...
I'm with child.<eos> Well... then congratulations are in order.<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> My husband and I haven't been intimate in months.<eos> The baby is not his.
His father was a terrible person and severely abused him and his sister.<eos> I find the villains often more heartbreaking than our heroes.<eos> Shoot him, son.<eos> He broke my sister's heart.<eos> Only fair I break his.
You can tell Abrecan my answer is no.<eos> Then you are a fool.<eos> Your father was right to pass you over and your mother to make you her smith.<eos> Well, tell my uncle I'll choose my destiny.<eos> And his.
But, please, the sooner we talk, the better for all of us.<eos> We should have told him. Val...<eos> He's been after Christopher for years.<eos> He can help us.<eos> I am not going to sit in his supervisor's office telling a roomful of smug FBI agents what happened to me... what I let happen to me.
Failed to save our firstborn from being killed in battle.<eos> And failed to raise our second as a moral man, and for that I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> Though all is not lost, thank God.<eos> I may not have been able to save Abraham... but there is still hope in young Thomas.<eos> Perhaps the mistakes I made in raising our son can be corrected through his own.
You love him?<eos> I do.<eos> Yes.<eos> My son do that to you?<eos> No, ma'am, it was his.
Some men believe only in survival, no matter what the costs.<eos> Your father made the right decision.<eos> The difficult decision.<eos> It doesn't change what his father did, but it shows that he learned.<eos> Now you must do for your father what he could not do for his.
I don't underestimate you, Governor. But intimidated?<eos> Takes a lot more than height and arrogance to intimidate me.<eos> You better get back to all your lawyers.<eos> When the Roman general Sulla, who was about the same age I am now, marched on Rome to purge the city of usurpers, it was a bloodbath.<eos> His greatest rival was a young man named Marius, who was just 26 years old.
Yeah. I mean, I know you don't see them much, but that's just a phase.<eos> They'll come around, you know?<eos> Hmm, yeah, maybe.<eos> You know, people say there is no greater experience than having a kid, but-but when you have one, it's like-it's like consigning your- your relationship that you had with your partner to- to history.<eos> Like, when-when a-when a man has a child, he-he creates his biggest rival, you know.
- Oh, my God, so does my guy!<eos> - Oh! Everyone's getting tribal tattoos these days.<eos> I know! Normally, it's so cliché, but on my guy, it looks right.<eos> - My guy's super artsy. - Uh-huh.<eos> He has a bird of paradise woven through his.
Stay back!<eos> Stay out of the street.<eos> Let them work.<eos> Hey, you know what happened here?<eos> Looks to me like some dumb corner boy tried to sell on a corner that ain't his.
I thought you had a crush on her.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, exactly.<eos> You know, here's the problem.<eos> She keeps talking about her boyfriend and his
Kyle, if we could just talk...<eos> - Why is she even here?<eos> - I want her to go.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - My son is not good enough for her. She's not good enough for us.<eos> My brother's broken a lot of hearts, but I've never seen anyone break his.
- Uh, sure.<eos> - Okay, here's one for my beautiful red-headed daughter, and one for my beautiful dark son.<eos> - No!<eos> Okay.<eos> - I'll take his.
- Oh, I just... I think you like me and it makes you nervous.<eos> I'm gonna go get a drink.<eos> Fine, but just to clarify, it's not 'cause I like you.<eos> It's 'cause I really like beer.<eos> You know, my friend did a piece just like this last year for his thesis, but his was red though.
And she said, "Oh, I didn't name it after myself at all.<eos> It's named after my father."<eos> My dad's name is on the door.<eos> Obviously, it's my name, too, but it's...<eos> That's his name. Definitely his name.
I need you to take one big, deep breath for me, okay?<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> All right.<eos> My vice is asthma.<eos> His is cocaine.
A trifling inconvenience that I may suffer is as nothing compared to the importance of preserving that pure name from the contaminating contact of the world.<eos> You've reduced it to a harmless little heap of ashes.<eos> And our dear impulsive Rachel will never know what we have done.<eos> Why would Godfrey burn a document exonerating him, even under duress?<eos> Well, a true gentleman always protects a lady's honour above his own.
And he didn't.<eos> So I-I finished the job.<eos> It'll be viewed as unethical.<eos> It's perfectly ethical.<eos> Yes, my synthetic clotting factor's identical to his.
Holy shit.<eos> It's a pretty simple design.<eos> My grandfather designed a bunch of drive-ins before they shot his ass.<eos> The Circle Drive-In in Scranton?<eos> That's his.
The Moon.<eos> My father's biggest dream.<eos> He offered most of his fortune to get there.<eos> But NASA never allowed it.<eos> My father, a man who had everything, died unable to achieve his biggest dream.
- Wait.<eos> - Coming.<eos> - I know that guy.<eos> - How?<eos> When Bolger put the gun in his mouth, I saw a reflection in the mirror that wasn't his.
I got my daughter the same one as a reward for getting straight A's last semester.<eos> Lucky you.<eos> My son's favorite subjects are lunch and recess.<eos> I don't see a scholarship in our future.<eos> Or a phone in his.
I love him.<eos> Has he ever made you do anything that made you feel uncomfortable?<eos> No.<eos> Were you aware of any contact between Danny and your dad?<eos> No. Danny was my friend, not his.
- I don't understand.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> To come with me, or to remain here?<eos> Waiting for his knock at your door.<eos> I don't care if the baby is mine, or his, it will be ours.
Well, it's not like you're the one who ran me off the road.<eos> Wait, wait...<eos> Someone ran you off the road?<eos> Yes, and threatened me.<eos> Some guy who told me to contact some other guy because I had something of his.
Barnabas...<eos> It's perfect.<eos> A new beginning.<eos> My sister's only child...<eos> A boy I-I cradled, taught, and loved, is at this moment hanging from a cross, paying a debt that was never his!
I'll say that I don't want it, but I'm willing to give it away to the first person who meets me and asks me for it.<eos> Do you, in fact, have an Ookla lunch box?<eos> I don't need one.<eos> The promise will lure people to a public place, where I can get a good look at them, maybe even sneak a picture.<eos> I'll tell them I already gave the lunch box away, but that I think my brother might still have his.
The horrible memory of the girl's abuse, he misunderstood it as his own.<eos> Woah, the air is so nice!<eos> - I should take in all of this good air!<eos> Inhale, inhale! - Because... He wished that he would have gotten abused instead of her.<eos> He fervently wanted the pain that she had to go through to be his pain instead.
I know what I do is wrong, taking a good man's will, but what choice do I have?<eos> A black rose grow in his heart. Write my name and let it start.<eos> Wrap it round with walls of Thorn. Let his mad love for me be born.<eos> I left my best ribbon, something of mine.<eos> I took his hair, something of his.
She stonewalled me, just like Sebastian stonewalled Dani.<eos> I mean, if we're gonna solve murders, we're gonna have to take risks.<eos> Speaking of risks, your pal Sebastian has been taking a few himself.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - This is his most recent published study... everything checks out. The statistics, the data, the proper allowance for the Hawthorne Effect, I mean, the research is perfect.
That'll be 99 cents an hour.<eos> No, you're overpriced!<eos> Yeah, I predicted you were gonna hang up.<eos> And then, there was my nerdy twin brother Stanford.<eos> As if his abnormally high IQ wasn't enough, he also had a rare birth defect... six fingers on each hand, which might've explained his obsession with sci-fi mystery weirdness.
Were it not for our involvement, what would be the top news story in the tri-state area today?<eos> "Escaped inmate murders judge and guard.<eos> Still on the loose."<eos> "Governor at a loss."<eos> According to this, his biggest competition is an assemblyman named Cortland Hughes.
Oh, really?<eos> Because I'm not having any success with his leg.<eos> He's... probably gonna lose it and Dan and I were hoping he's a viable candidate for a bionic prosthesis, so if he's in chronic pain or in a C-collar for too long and that delays rehab, which...<eos> I realize this isn't the method my dear, dead brother would have used.<eos> His method would actually be clunkier and offer less support than mine, so let's do it my way.
A legend.<eos> Well, I doubt Earl McGraw ever had to look a culebra in the eye.<eos> I... I don't think that's gonna work with a dead guy.<eos> Not his blood I'm interested in.<eos> The killer left behind some of his.
Thank you.<eos> You broke his heart, you know.<eos> When you lobbied against his bid for the directorship.<eos> Both our hearts got broken.<eos> Well, his is older, weaker.
Regina slept with her husband, stole her grandmother's wedding ring, Filed a lawsuit against her, then sent her a scrapbook rubbing her nose in it.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Why did you have your brother kill her?<eos> It's his blood at the crime scene.
Head up.<eos> I wanted to say I appreciate our being alone today.<eos> I hope your husband doesn't mind.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I could see his being here made you uncomfortable.
Jo: Henry, what are you going on about?<eos> The marks on his wrists suggest he has a skin condition.<eos> So?<eos> So if she scratched him on the bridge,<eos> There'd be evidence of it. I thought you said the dna under her nails matched his.
- Is there any record of all the men you hired for that job?<eos> No, that's all gone when I lost the business.<eos> Nobody hires a construction company to build a house when the owner's son kills the people that move in, right?<eos> Your son is innocent.<eos> They found his... what do you call it... inside that dead girl's body.
The doctor made a mistake.<eos> I went to the appointment and she... accidentally... put... a sample of a man into me.<eos> _<eos> _ Yes.<eos> From his...
Hold on. Tai Gable? That's the house that Jake and Travis<eos> - Kealoha spent last night.<eos> - Yeah. The Gables are going through a very nasty divorce.<eos> Jason Gable, as a part of the settlement, agreed to supersize the kid's college funds.<eos> Tai was about eight months away from collecting his.
That part of the game was beyond his control.<eos> If it weren't, he would've been prepared to dispose of a body the size of Ike Wallaczek's.<eos> So, even if there were a connection between the victims, the killer could not have counted on them being lured into his trap.<eos> Certainly not in sequence.<eos> His game was, in many respects, one of chance.
My brother George, he performs in some small club.<eos> You know what the marquee says?<eos> "Liberace", in big letters.<eos> I built that name. It's my name.<eos> That's not his.
I'm at a loss.<eos> I talk to her and nothing, not a word.<eos> Silent as a stone and twisting, twisting, twisting, twisting, twisting, twisting away...<eos> And what about the professor?<eos> On and on incessantly about knots and nooses and the existence that enfolds us, about his own which aren't his at all...
Um, I got to go see my kid.<eos> Another time?<eos> We'll talk.<eos> I'm sure we will.<eos> I see a ring on your finger but not his.
He is the one Attius helped free?<eos> The blacksmith held no knowledge of it.<eos> Your friend dead, because of her.<eos> See them bound and taken to Spartacus.<eos> They are his concern.
Hey, Samuel, my man. I live in an efficiency apartment with five roommates.<eos> Three of us share a pull-out couch, two sleep on a yoga mat, and one sleeps in the bathtub.<eos> So under the kitchen table is up for grabs?<eos> If we had a kitchen table, we could bring in another renter.<eos> Damn, that man needs to get his own place.
That sadness may soon be put to rest.<eos> How so?<eos> I am with child, Your Holiness.<eos> Well, then you must-- Your duty is to return to your husband.<eos> And the child is not his.
What do you know about it?<eos> Do you know why you inherited the mansion?<eos> Because I didn't want it.<eos> Your father and I had a relationship.<eos> His greatest regret was that he couldn't tell you.
Sorry, I-I didn't mean to be so loud.<eos> Look, look, while you're up, can you please help me find my damn glasses?<eos> Go back to bed. I...<eos> I'll keep my voice down.<eos> "I applaud the honorable judge cleland "for taking a hard line on police corruption "and for his refusal to be blinded
Would you believe, he has been working for J.D.?<eos> The field hand?<eos> Except J.D. Is not on the plantation anymore.<eos> He living' up north of here.<eos> Got a apple orchard, all his own.
And I ran.<eos> I've never spoken of it since.<eos> I took his rings... - Hey!<eos> - And when I returned,<eos> Everything I own is his.
- Her man crazy.<eos> - He ain't my man.<eos> - Your man crazy?<eos> Yeah, so we was out here last night just chilling, smoking a blunt.<eos> So I need to holla at my man, but my phone battery had died, so I ask Eddie can I use his.
I can't take any more.<eos> Four days and not a trace of that prick.<eos> Forget him.<eos> How?<eos> Every step I take I find something of his.
I'm back, crab dip.<eos> What you watching?<eos> Only a documentary about the greatest actor in the world.<eos> Ah, yes... Calculon.<eos> I happened to snap a picture of him taking some time with his biggest fan.
I've valued half a dozen or so over the last ten years.<eos> Are you qualified to value me?<eos> Well, no one can put a value on what you've accomplished here.<eos> My father is a poet. He's well known in the Punjab.<eos> His greatest friend is his publisher.
You do a lot of clever metaphor-making in here, Doctor, and not much solution-providing.<eos> Then I say...<eos> trust your instincts.<eos> No.<eos> See, that's not an answer, because my instincts are telling me to help Dan, and his instincts are telling him to help Fred.
If this is about that job you asked me to do, I think I told you what you could do with it.<eos> Well, sadly, it is.<eos> You see, when I couldn't convince you to procure the item for me, I moved on to the next man on the list.<eos> I don't see how that's my problem.<eos> His entry plan was flawless.
Sophie, what do you mean you're getting ready to date again?<eos> Oh, well, there's some really cute new guys down at the Polish club.<eos> And... oh, my gosh, one in particular is like a cross between Vin Diesel and Viggo Mortensen.<eos> Yeah, so rich and handsome you almost don't notice the wheelchair.<eos> Hard to resist a man in New York who's got his own ride.
He made her like she is.<eos> What was his name?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Cora won't even say it.<eos> But the book is his.
May Allah reward.<eos> Since grandmother is sick, they send us to eat.<eos> You know that a cousin of Rabat asked Ghislaine hand?<eos> This is a brother too.<eos> It sells computers and it was his apartment.
His closeness to Feinstein made you crazy when you were young, and, to this day, it distorts your judgment!<eos> You could have given him the Jerusalem manuscript you found.<eos> For 30 years he worked on it.<eos> It's his.<eos> It's his!
Your picture would be on money. All right, what do you want now, my car?<eos> Only when you're not using it.<eos> So is Samuel still crashing at your place? Meanwhile, I'm stuck at Molly's, with her recycling rules and clipping my toenails over the toilet.<eos> I don't know how much longer I can take it, Carl.<eos> Man's got to have his own space.
Or you want me to wait here?<eos> This guy's got some huevos.<eos> Hey, Drayke, are you going to let him go or what?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> He will get his.
Okay, look, if you really wanna do this, we have one shot, and that's at the wedding.<eos> When he gets in front of all these people, he won't be able to walk away.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Yeah. So we have to plan.<eos> Maddie, as maid of honor, your toast comes before his, right?
So I have no standing to intervene on a federal level.<eos> You used to call him "the letch"... my father.<eos> It must have been when I was still angry with him.<eos> I was a mere child when Nucky brought me to your father, you're certainly right about that.<eos> That card game you operate is located in territory that Mr. masseria considers to be his.
Of course not. Why leave cash to your impoverished brother when you can leave your alcohol-muddled thoughts?<eos> "To whom it may concern,<eos> "if you are reading this it means either my heart or lungs "finally gave out.<eos> "Or I rejected my new liver.<eos> "Or my brother wouldn't give me a piece of his.
I guess when you look like a viking, people just believe what you tell them.<eos> The boy's name is Rory Campbell.<eos> Waitress' kid goes to school with him.<eos> There's blood over by the shed, and there's blood here.<eos> It's probably his.
Is everything okay?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I only just gave him a new home.<eos> He's got bamboo climbing branches, artificial plants, his own hiding box.<eos> Well, everyone has to make sacrifices, Dr. Hodgins, and it's time for that python to make his.
Y-you are nothing but a well-dressed loan shark.<eos> Ms. Rodgers, I assure you, this is a very competitive interest rate considering your financial history.<eos> However, if your son cosigns-- - Yes.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> This is my loan, not his, to pay for repairs to my acting studio, not his.
Croatoan.<eos> Croatoan.<eos> So now you know what you have to do.<eos> What did she say?<eos> We have to get something of his.
Just make sure they keep me informed, too.<eos> Wasn't any fun trying to pry information out of Macaulay Culkin here.<eos> That's Victor's wallet.<eos> Oh, my God, there's blood.<eos> It's not his.
Nothing.<eos> Ever.<eos> Leave the boy out of this.<eos> Charly killed Malek, a son to me.<eos> I'll take his.
Torne, let's go.<eos> I hope I never see you again.<eos> # One hundred days, one hundred nights # To know a man's heart<eos> # One hundred days, one hundred nights # To know a man's heart<eos> # And a little more before he knows his own
Who will be left to care about ethics if we've defeated in battle?<eos> Victory and defeat are what matter, not ethics<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> My father prince Zhao was driven out of Lu by the three families and die in exile<eos> If the three families turn against me now my fate will be much worse than his
- I need to find my husband.<eos> Trust me, if anyone wants to find him, it's me.<eos> But I don't know where to look.<eos> Why do you want to find Jin?<eos> Because your last name is Kwon, so is his.
I know.<eos> My husband died a long time ago.<eos> The man in there isn't my husband.<eos> Could you put this on him?<eos> It's his.
A vampire... is the only truly free man.<eos> All his darkness, all his excesses, they can run amok.<eos> He wants a girl, take 20.<eos> He wants a boy, go ahead, just give the place a bit of a hose-down after.<eos> The world is his.
It was so terrifying because I could be the next in line.<eos> When it was already dark... and I was walking down Karmelitzka street, which was crowded with people,<eos> I tripped on something... and lost my balance.<eos> When I opened my eyes, I saw that I had fallen on a corpse.<eos> My face was nearly touching his,
I don't care who takes care of you. You watch your mouth.<eos> Then you know who's got my back.<eos> You know who I answer to.<eos> Sure: The Red Hood.<eos> And we work for the man who's gonna take back what's his.
They want to hump him.<eos> Reminds me of the joke about the father in the maternity ward.<eos> -No. It's hilarious.<eos> Shut it.<eos> The father goes in, there are babies everywhere, he's looking for his.
No, wait a minute. This is not what I'm doing here.<eos> That is exactly what you're doing!<eos> And -- and you're telling me what job I should want...<eos> When I'm happy where I am!<eos> And the best way for me to hold on to my job is for Will to hold on to his.
If this is about you and me, then just say that.<eos> I'm never going to admit that, Carmen.<eos> But come on, I mean... him?<eos> What do you see in this guy?<eos> I mean, look at my body compared to his.
Well, that sounds perfectly safe.<eos> Yeah, I know, but what's the alternative, portion control?<eos> Now, any of these tests I take is gonna give me a false negative.<eos> I'm gonna call my doctor.<eos> Oh, lube has its own aisle here, fancy.
The hunt is a necessity due to the overabundance of game.<eos> Some say it's a welcome change from killing men.<eos> They can instead sacrifice deer. To me it is an unappealing spectacle.<eos> You are unkind to our cousin who excels at both carnages.<eos> Never mind, Montpensier has deprived the Court of its loveliest ornament.
Can't we go around it?<eos> - No, Sergeant.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> Okay, pass the word.<eos> This nation jealously guards its highest award for valor, the Congressional Medal of Honor.
You don't have to do this.<eos> Alexandra said I didn't know what you were.<eos> She was right.<eos> You were our weapon.<eos> But they made you theirs.
Call your family and tell them you love them.<eos> Because this is a formula to start a war.<eos> Basically, Rich is right.<eos> There's nothing basic about it... I'm right.<eos> The formula's been tweaked to determine at what point lithium becomes so expensive that it's more cost effective to just, you know, invade another country and take theirs.
It's not Tuco.<eos> It's keeping it secret.<eos> A dead Tuco draws Salamancas like flies.<eos> Cartel noses into the business.<eos> Looks for who hit one of theirs.
Lobbying is about foresight.<eos> About anticipating your opponent's moves and devising countermeasures.<eos> The winner plots one step ahead of the opposition, and plays her trump card<eos> just after they play theirs.
You came.<eos> How are you?<eos> I thought that everybody hated me.<eos> Of course they don't, Gary.<eos> You're awfully kind, but I wouldn't want the village thinking you're taking my side over theirs.
To me, to my dad...<eos> Save it for the vows.<eos> Printer deadline's Friday, right?<eos> Mm-hmm. LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I should explain.<eos> In a Catholic mass, you can't recite your own vows, so theirs were going to be printed in the programs.
There's an outfit.<eos> They got their fingers real deep in Houston.<eos> Nobody knows their name.<eos> They've got pot houses, count houses, stash houses. You name it.<eos> But none of the product is actually theirs.
You mean the funding ran out.<eos> I mean, our job is done.<eos> There are still problems with those units with the neighborhood.<eos> The worst hasn't happened, Mary, and the best will depend on them.<eos> Their future is theirs.
We know it was Boaz who murdered the Roman soldier.<eos> And so do you.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> It's Jerusalem that's asking for help because every day its people are being put to death in his absence.<eos> If he truly loves his people, then he will be ready to give up his life for theirs.
She threw a party, and now Josh is on his way here, and there's like a gazillion people in there, and they won't leave!<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> I'm gonna lose my job.<eos> You gotta help me.<eos> Well, I might have a stick up my ass, but they're about to have a foot up theirs.
I haven't seen the need yet to make that disclosure.<eos> My people are digging.<eos> We'll get the answers we need.<eos> Know that the council has only your best interests in mind.<eos> As long as my interest aligns with theirs.
Won't you, Brian?<eos> It's the love that mustn't speak its name.<eos> It's forbidden love, isn't it?<eos> I happen to believe...that to the general public you must remain attainable.<eos> They'll be more inclined to buy your records if they think you can still be theirs.
They've paid hackers to break the encryption on my last video.<eos> They won't break it, but...<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.<eos> Mine makes theirs look like pig Latin.
We tried calling you.<eos> Guys, I was just with the licensing board.<eos> Turns out even if we win this thing, I don't get my license back.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> They say that reasonable doubt is the court's standard, not theirs.
I'll keep that in mind when I'm feeding my family dog food in January.<eos> David's friend Richard's coming to town tomorrow.<eos> Meet him!<eos> We'll make them take us out on the town.<eos> Instead of worrying about making money, we'll be spending theirs.
Swapper Jack's is closing!<eos> No. Do not give me false hope like the time they said it was only sextuplets.<eos> It is true!<eos> Every successful corporation harbors a terrible secret.<eos> Theirs is that what they sell as chicken is actually monkey.
That's weird.<eos> What are you found there?<eos> pair of shoes on a seat.<eos> I was curious as to why they are there. It's kind of strange.<eos> I've looked around to see who they might belong to why they might be there, a couple of people have sat down next to them and walked away, so you know they're not theirs, but I
You want to wait around out here?<eos> Fine. I'm going in.<eos> You want to go at it with a bunch of Bulgarian tweakers?<eos> We made a deal.<eos> They stay out of our territory. We stay out of theirs.
Sorry. I just didn't think he'd come back and you shouldn't have put it all in my personal space.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Everything seems tidy-tidy in here now.<eos> They've finally picked up the extra penii.<eos> I've had a call from the baby shop and that stuff upstairs is theirs and they have got our hen night stuff.
It's you who educate your public' not the other way round.<eos> By your enthusiasm and devotion.<eos> Don't rely on their love.<eos> Rely on yourselves alone.<eos> On your love of music and theirs.
- It will all depend on you.<eos> - I'll be ready.<eos> Lord Frith, I know you've looked after us well... ... and it's wrong to ask even more of you... ... but my people are in terrible danger.<eos> So, I'd like to make a bargain with you:<eos> My life in return for theirs.
Thy spirit which abode with me in the wilderness.<eos> I ask nothing for myself, O God.<eos> By my sins I have put myself beyond the compass of thy forgiveness.<eos> But lift thine hand from thy people who suffer for my crimes.<eos> Forgive them the sin that is not theirs but mine.
Sir, my team and I are about to embark on a... a tour of the country so that we may make an assessment... to precisely understand what is required of us here.<eos> It would be an honor if you would consider joining me on the tour, so that our project might be a unified endeavor.<eos> A sharing of our purpose... Of our shared purpose.<eos> Thank you for the invitation, General.<eos> It's very generous.
Well, maybe it was her who identified him as a possible target?<eos> - Her who wrote that address down?<eos> - Of your parents' house?<eos> She was my girlfriend at the time, we stayed there on several occasions when my parents were away.<eos> But whichever of you it was gave him your parents' address on the 7th of May, that's the day before he disappeared... it suggests you were staying there, in North London.
In fact, you were more specific, weren't you?<eos> You said, "About six feet, 200 pounds."<eos> Yes.<eos> I'd ask the prosecution to stipulate that Mr. Kim tops out "at 5'7" wearing shoes, and weighs 145 soaking wet. So stipulated.<eos> And that's crucial, every detail, because like you said, otherwise, it might not be the right guy.
It's semen.<eos> Semen?<eos> Now, how would your semen be found at the crime scene?<eos> I think we all know how semen... makes its way into the world.<eos> This is not the first crime scene you've contaminated, is it?
It didn't matter at all to Evelyn, or me.<eos> Was there anything else about the marriage Andrea didn't like before, during, or after it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Evelyn's will.<eos> It entitled you to something when Evelyn died even though you'd been married just two years.
Thank you.<eos> Have you always been the night manager?<eos> It's my profession, yes.<eos> You chose it?<eos> I think it chose me.
And I said, "Who are you, Kelly Dhundee?"<eos> Your maiden name's Dundee?<eos> No, it's got an "H." Dhundee.<eos> Like Crocodile Dundee?<eos> It's "Dhundee." It's a different name altogether.
You're proud of that?<eos> You want to defend that?<eos> Alex, you were so busy at Quantico trying to get redemption for killing your father that you never saw me making you into a scapegoat.<eos> And you make a great scapegoat, Alex, because you believe in this country even after it thought you were a terrorist.<eos> You still love America, and you think it loves you back, but it doesn't.
How can Bachmanity still be so far in the hole?<eos> Look at all this shit that Big Head is selling.<eos> He was renting virtually everything in the house.<eos> He rented that cannon?<eos> It was for display purposes only. So you forfeit your deposit. It's a cannon.
A Protestant woman, no less.<eos> Yes, it's saying something that he would support her, given his hatred of all women.<eos> What is his issue?<eos> They disgust him.<eos> Now, I've never met his mother, but my guess is, it starts there.
Get out of my life!<eos> Get out!<eos> Come on, now, open the door. Sorry.<eos> Sorry about the noise.<eos> -At least it wasn't barking.
Got it.<eos> Were going into the building.<eos> There's no point in killing the baby.<eos> For Tamiya, it is only an experiment.<eos> It is not her child!
How do you explain police forensics finding four cigarette butts with your DNA on them next to Danny's body?<eos> I've smoked a lot of cigarettes on that beach.<eos> ~ Why did you take the skateboard?<eos> ~ I thought it might get nicked.<eos> It did get nicked, didn't it?
He says that you attacked him.<eos> Maybe I should call my lawyer first.<eos> Ma'am, I know who you are.<eos> And you should know that if I have to come back here with an arrest warrant, then the chances are this whole business ends up on the news.<eos> Which I'm sure that you're used to, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
Would you?<eos> - Definitely not.<eos> I would never. - Do you have a pen?<eos> I'd like to get his address.<eos> It's for the first wave of arrests.
Then I went home to Katrina.<eos> She must be with child.<eos> I'm sure this is all incredibly hard.<eos> I saw a book.<eos> It resembles your description of the Grimoire.
What?<eos> It's not Delgado.<eos> But he texted the same...<eos> It's not him.<eos> Uh, do you know who it is?
How can anything survive in this wasteland?<eos> But some do.<eos> Millions of years have taught them the necessary tricks.<eos> A desert viper... sidewinding... to get a grip on the loose sand.<eos> Food's hard to find, so the viper hides, and waits for it come to him.
I'm sure of it.<eos> Wearing out the tape, I guess.<eos> I watch it every day after breakfast.<eos> It's the only video I have of him.<eos> It was before your time.
In order to insure anonymity, I would appreciate it if you would all please type your answers.<eos> Can I use cut-up magazine letters?<eos> I do it as fast as typing.<eos> - No. - Would it be fun if we wrote it from the perspective of a cat?<eos> - No. - Even if it's typed, when you read Fausta's, language-wise, it'll be fairly obvious who it's from.
Maybe I'm not just some trained monkey who spins insights about sports, and maybe I will leave until this show becomes something that I am morally and ethically comfortable doing.<eos> I'm just putting my books away here.<eos> - Where's my violin?<eos> - Okay, buddy, I get it.<eos> It's a nice, pretty lady. You want to impress her.
No way, Max.<eos> This is our shrine.<eos> Grab a handful of bears.<eos> We're moving the dead guy's shrine back?<eos> Wait, let me just light a candle for my dignity. It died here too.
It was behaving like a person.<eos> But the world didn't need a person to protect it. It needed a machine.<eos> You took its memories.<eos> Not just memories.<eos> Every night at midnight, it deletes... not only the irrelevant data, it deletes itself.
This is the only line of concern to me.<eos> The length of your life is inconsequential. It's what you do with your time that matters.<eos> OK, well...<eos> So, tell me, what is my destiny?<eos> It reads your fate, not your destiny.
It was hidden, but he's a kid, right?<eos> Okay, Connor, we need to ask you a few questions.<eos> Connor, come on.<eos> What were you doing in the closet?<eos> What does it lo like?
Like in a contract?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, in most situations, a contract is not a bad idea.<eos> What would it say, that I don't have any right to be involved with the baby?<eos> It can say whatever you want.
It gives us a little bonding time.<eos> Where's your Southern accent?<eos> Sometimes I like to not have a Southern accent.<eos> Really?<eos> But it's such a part of who you are, of your brand.
Percy... Thou art... Dust and food...<eos> For worms, brave Percy.<eos> Fare thee well, great heart.<eos> Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk.<eos> When that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound, and now, two paces of the vilest earth is room enough.
You ruined his Christmas Eve.<eos> But it's our job to get him to understand... get him to understand you.<eos> And you think you understand me?<eos> Well, you're not the first young and impressionable girl to get caught up with a very dangerous man.<eos> He flashed his bling at you and promised you the world, and you believed him, but I feel that thrill is long-gone now, isn't it?
I don't understand.<eos> I found a card with them, to the draper... from Jocelin.<eos> It is thanking him for his gallantry.<eos> The gift's rather an excessive reward for such a small gesture.<eos> It is her way.
That'd give you something that no one else has... information from the odd museum show, a half-read article, some PBS documentary... it was all bubbling up in my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.<eos> - She didn't have a chance.<eos> - So, what are your suggestions?<eos> We'd really worked on her paper, too.<eos> In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.
My family's impossible.<eos> That's why the company's such a mess.<eos> I apologize for my mother's behavior.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> It has nothing to do with you.
You do not understand well, you don't know well Adriana.<eos> Look, look at the movement, drawing It is exactly its representation.<eos> No.<eos> It is not right. Watch as he has done.<eos> Filled with sexual innuendos, carnal extent to burn... and Yes, it is beautiful, but... a subtle beauty and implicit sensuality.
See look at it, what is its? first impression of Adriana?<eos> It is very charming.<eos> He sees it. It has no more output OK.<eos> It is implicit.<eos> Miss Stein, of course. It is why it has lost all objectivity.
They haven't seen my evidence yet.<eos> Be that as it may, I will fight this and I will fight you.<eos> I would expect nothing less.<eos> Your days in Chicago are numbered, Teresa.<eos> Whatever the number, it's more than yours.
I told you!<eos> I'm on a top-secret mission for the President.<eos> Well, maybe if you'd just get President Nixon to assure us of that, sir, that would be swell.<eos> I sent him a message.<eos> Hello. I believe it's Mr Gardner, is that correct?
- Lamb was the most popular.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My dream is to turn this place into more of a local.<eos> Hello, there!<eos> Usual, is it?
What kind of a name is Asher?<eos> - Actually, sir, Dylan and Asher are still...<eos> - I like that you have a job. In my mall.<eos> What time do you get off work?<eos> Considering it is your mall, sir, whenever you say.
Do you mind telling me your name, sir?<eos> You're the Amazing Mysterium. You tell me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I shall.<eos> Oh, it's "Richard Hollis. "604 Kirkside Drive, Cuesta Verde, California.
I am stuck in town.<eos> Yeah, but if you had a girlfriend?<eos> Well, then it would be tolerable.<eos> Huh, see?<eos> Your problem isn't being stuck in town, it's losing your girlfriend.
That sounds like bullshit.<eos> Billie Dean's for real.<eos> She studies this stuff.<eos> The bigger guy, he wears a ring.<eos> It's like a wedding ring, but I can't remember which hand it's on.
About America, all that positive thinking.<eos> She has positive thinking.<eos> She thinks, "I've told him I want a new ring or a pair of earrings, he'll get it me."<eos> She has that positive thinking about it. But the problem with positive thinking, when it doesn't happen, you get negative.<eos> And most of the time, it doesn't happen.
And this was all platonic?<eos> Well, no.<eos> But it isn't what you think.<eos> We had a real soul connection.<eos> Did it go both ways?
What about transport?<eos> 'Cause that's going to be a party.<eos> It's taken care of.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> If you try to move it, either it will end up dead, or you will.
I thought I saw somebody over here.<eos> Are you in charge of this place?<eos> ! I'm the caretaker.<eos> You tell me what that truck is doing here.<eos> What does it look like?
I lied to you.<eos> About what? That name.<eos> It wasn't for one of the secretaries.<eos> It was for Frankie.<eos> Of course it was.
No prisoners, hey? Muslims.<eos> There's gotta be a clue in here.<eos> There's a way to beat these bastards.<eos> The project is continually changing, evolving.<eos> You will help it to do so.
When she was fifteen years ...<eos> Amen<eos> Since then, almost all the years she required surgery.<eos> One year she had four.<eos> And they gave this medication pain ... but now it has become dependent on the medication.
Why should he?<eos> 'I knew it would end badly.'<eos> It wasn't his fault!<eos> He fell asleep at the wheel.<eos> Yes, but... the charred remains in the car weren't Emile Leullet's. - Whose do you think it was?
You're so little.<eos> Do you know how much I want you to stay?<eos> Please stay.<eos> Madeline, you can't will a baby back to I life.<eos> It's Grace.
Is that all you found?<eos> Forensics recovered a charred body matching a description at the Eastern body plant.<eos> It's her.<eos> Yep.<eos> Unless it was the last customer.
Honey, can you stay with the kids?<eos> I'll just run and get dressed.<eos> Appreciate your cooperation, ma'am.<eos> Despite my better judgment, I sent a team of investigators out to Clove Lake Park this afternoon.<eos> Jessamyn Hunsecker's body was exactly where you said it would be, shot once in the head.
Leave me alone!<eos> - - We need to head clear.<eos> - - I need a beer.<eos> Just one.<eos> Pay attention to it does not smell your breath.
Is your Misar ACHECA be<eos> in the first paragraph of your article? Your honor. It's a good question.<eos> I do not Achou.<eos> During treatment I dAcouvert Jake the initial registration personality that Seletti met, did not the original personality.<eos> Jake Atait construction AlaborAe the long term and it has never really existed.
Did you wanna- Right.<eos> - Well, I guess we kind of got what we needed out of the intervention.<eos> Yeah. Right?<eos> So good job.<eos> Was it?
Due to the deaths of the engineers, I was able to get certain data released to me.<eos> It might help you with your work.<eos> Well, you work at the Pentagon, right?<eos> So, Neox has a defense project.<eos> I would think you would know what it's working on.
So... the hardy boys finally found me.<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> Do you have any idea how much this rug costs?<eos> This is it, right?<eos> This is, what it's all about.
I don't know that anybody's really convinced that they're gonna die.<eos> And what about the image at Lake Mungo?<eos> How do you think Alice would have explained that?<eos> How could she have explained it?<eos> Look, I think Ali saw a ghost. But she wasn't to know that it was her own.
Yeah.<eos> A few years back, when we hit the top of our smuggling game, she just appeared.<eos> And we figure someday she'll just disappear.<eos> Check out the tat on the back of her neck.<eos> It's an inky wisp of personal information.
—Of course.<eos> —I didn't know there were prisoners.<eos> —I have no access there.<eos> —How could you?<eos> In a proper country you shouldn't even know where it is.
Don't tell me you're still single?<eos> Hey A son He looks exactly like you<eos> You're telling me... Your wife's a nigger, eh?<eos> You're very liberal. Blacks... They're beautiful.<eos> Colour doesn't matter, does it? You really look like a couple.
I wanted to see how you were doing.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Would you have a drink with me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't know what it is exactly, but I would be careful. It's real...
And now from the Palm Garden room... high atop the Knickerbocker Hotel... it's the sound of the Jack Hilton Orchestra.<eos> The love boat, a good train, a bad dog, a beautiful girl. Tonight on "MacGyver."<eos> Now, what does all this stuff do?<eos> Now, the most important thing is the dump button.<eos> Anyone gets too vulgar or intimate... you press the button, and it cuts them off the air.
Clear.<eos> - I do. Eh?<eos> - According.<eos> - Well ... it is very well placed. - Placed?<eos> - It's a girl?
I've seen really incredible things.<eos> Really!<eos> I am serious.<eos> Also... that omelet tube.<eos> It would be a great hit in our world.
Come on, Howard, I was just kidding.<eos> Good night.<eos> My God.<eos> This relationship... - it defies all the laws of nature.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
- Good evening.<eos> - I don't know if...<eos> You are expected, Colonel.<eos> May I take your coat?<eos> - It is Colonel Mustard?
This is a restricted area. You're not allowed in.<eos> I've been reading your book.<eos> I won't lie, I've not read it all.<eos> I'm just on my way out.<eos> It says somewhere that age is a disease, a disease that can be cured.
Let's wait and see.<eos> But can I borrow the apartment?<eos> Who'll give me the keys?<eos> The gardener or his wife. She does the cleaning.<eos> You said it was empty.
don't answer the phone.<eos> - Unless you call.<eos> - How will you know?<eos> - We'll make up a code:<eos> let it ring once and hang up.
No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> They say they didn't notice... That could mean it was there... or it wasn't, right?<eos> Sorry, but... does it matter?<eos> If the dog was there, it should have found the body.
Where did this animal come from?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Cute.<eos> What an adorable creature.<eos> Then it shall be welcome in our house.
At 4:00, Mr. Oswald?<eos> I just dropped in to see you.<eos> In private.<eos> This is not a private place.<eos> It's an office in your company.
When I looked at it, all these coincidences seemed too much.<eos> I was afraid, to tell anyone.<eos> So I went to the one place where people who are afraid can go.<eos> Come in, Mr. Morlar.<eos> It is Morlar, is it?
I don't want to be the best lover!<eos> They're coming!<eos> Jenny, he is Shek Wu.<eos> He's said the Great Wall was entitled by his surname.<eos> It's my sister, Jenny.
Let's have a drink.<eos> Mr. Borowiecki, an oath is a great thing.<eos> I want you to swear on this icon.<eos> I know... that for you Poles it is sacred.<eos> Swear that it isn't true.
So if you'd like to ask me Any questions about psychiatry<eos> I bet I can answer them.<eos> Okay, right, you've got the girl on the bed<eos> You've had a few drinks, you've got her sweater up And she's got her feet on the mantelpiece.<eos> Yes, what is it?
- Its third mistake was Bessie.<eos> - And you were in Bessie! So there's a link between the beam and this organism thing?<eos> Yes, I think that that beam was the method it used to get here.<eos> Well, now it's arrived and it's hostile and it's still here, so what do we do and how do we find it?<eos> We don't find it. If we wait around long enough, it'll find us.
The table is yours.<eos> Do not be fooled, when you sell it.<eos> And you, what will you do?<eos> I am going to turn.<eos> Indeed, it may do it very well.
- He thinks I'm funny!<eos> - Oh, you are funny.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> Now, then. One glass cutter for breaking in with.<eos> One piece of putty for holding on to the piece of glass so it doesn't clatter to the ground... and awake the ravenous Doberman Pinscher you suspect lurks inside.
- That wasn't the question.<eos> - You stole that.<eos> Give it back to me, please.<eos> Why would I want to give it back?<eos> It belonged to my mother.
Chucking things through windows. You ought to have more sense.<eos> You tell him I want that Niles or I'll come in and get him!<eos> You give me that bloody gun and get out of here. That's an order.<eos> What about my Janice?<eos> It weren't one of yours.
Well.<eos> Can't I know?<eos> The group gathered at the edge of the river. The pastor and I went into the water.<eos> Afterwards he told me what baptism means.<eos> It symbolizes the death of sin, the resurrection of a new life full of faith, of hope, of dignity, then he took me to the deepest part and put me under.
Excuse me.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The banquet's about to start, why would you go?<eos> Can't you take a joke?<eos> Didn't you hear me say it was a joke?
Sooner or later you'll do what I did.<eos> Alright.<eos> What's Apollo's prize?<eos> Sure, I could tell you.<eos> It'll soon be out.
We were saying throw the bomb, but only like this, theoretically.<eos> Because he said a an arrest warrant was needed.<eos> This has expired.<eos> Because my father's dead, I live with my aunt.<eos> If you say it's expired, I'll renew it.
That's easy, or?<eos> but if you inject a single Winkler, Hoesch or Rothe, in the blood of a healthy body, he'll go ill.<eos> He'll die like a dog.<eos> By the way, when I did take your eyepiece out of the desk drawer<eos> Is it yours? - Yes.
- Yes, Martinelli.<eos> But as I've been telling it to you, I've been thinking. I'm not so sure.<eos> I remember there was a whiff of jasmine before I was knocked out.<eos> Maybe it was her.<eos> Suddenly I got a feeling I know it was.
Yeah, you haven't had nothing to say about any of this all day.<eos> Why do you not care about what's happening to our country?<eos> What did you say to me?<eos> You don't think I care about this country?<eos> I love this country, even though at times, it doesn't love me back.
- I saw heaven standing open and the white horse, whose rider is called faithful and true.<eos> With justice he judges and makes war.<eos> The lord is my Shepherd, i shall not want!<eos> He is my savior and my protector.<eos> - Does it not see, is it blind from all its watching?
You are a good and godly man, Magistrate Hathorne.<eos> I am.<eos> Surely love is where we find it.<eos> And we have indeed found it.<eos> Or it found us.
- Yeah.<eos> Can't blame you. She's a beauty.<eos> Lethal, but a beauty.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Take care of your rifle, it'll take care of you.
_<eos> Dr. Strand?<eos> Uh... _<eos> Maybe we let nature take its course.<eos> And if the baby's breached, both it and the mother dies.
Caspar's been known to change hotels if the carpet upsets him.<eos> Er, what are you working on?<eos> A redesign of a perfect flat in Limehouse.<eos> All my work gets undone.<eos> I mean, if you heal a dog, right, it stays healed.
Then where are we?<eos> I'm not sure. Something must have gone wrong.<eos> "Gone wrong"?<eos> Don't you know how to use a magic bean?<eos> You think of the place you want to go, and it takes you.
- He did it! He did it! Whoo-hoo!<eos> - Go for it, bro!<eos> Let's see how Felipe Camargo finishes Level 3.<eos> He's on the first pole, and already looking like he's having some trouble.<eos> This obstacle should play into his strengths, since it relies so heavily on climbing ability.
The whole shebang. I told her everything.<eos> I mean, whether or not she was conscious to process it, that's a whole nother question, but I told her everything.<eos> My dad always used to tell me, when I had a problem, he would say,<eos> "Line it up in your sights,<eos> "and then take it out before it has a chance to take you out."
Most folks would be doing backflips to have their names cleared like that.<eos> Be outta Angola.<eos> Breathin' fresh air like a real, live person.<eos> Bury the past.<eos> Or it'll bury you, boy.
It be a trogglehumper.<eos> What're you going to do with it?<eos> I locks them up, wicked beastie.<eos> What does the bad dream say?<eos> It says...
I need you to be brave.<eos> I need you to be braver... than you've ever been.<eos> I can distract it.<eos> I can use the fire, I can use it.<eos> So I can go out there, and it'll follow me... so that you can go out there and you can get away.
I know who he's with.<eos> I was a poison in that place.<eos> Reshaping life so you can destroy it?<eos> I can't do that to the world.<eos> It knows.
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.<eos> It's always alone, like... like a bear.<eos> And remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself?<eos> -And then, last night, the deer...<eos> -Hmm, it was bleeding, too.
- I'm bleeding again.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> ! Come sit down!<eos> What's wrong with the donkey?<eos> It kicked me.
He's the man who's been covering for us.<eos> Something that's getting harder and harder to do since Agent Russo's murder.<eos> And now this.<eos> Other agents are already all over this hack, investigating, which means you have to beat the rest of DHS to the punch, especially if this turns out to be about Vincent.<eos> Well, is it?
I've lost count of the amount of times you've been there for me.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> I think you're far more affected by this world than you care to admit.<eos> You want to control it rather than allow it to control you.
high profile cases.<eos> - Do they have a foreign section too?<eos> it's always from that office.<eos> Last time I worked with a foreign cop was that mountain incident.<eos> it was a damn circus.
Who's that dude?<eos> That's that Chazz kid, isn't it?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Is it?
At the funeral of Louis Brandt, AKA "Cock-Eyed Lou?"<eos> Oh, yeah, those guys.<eos> You run into so many people at funerals.<eos> But isn't that guy with the machete your nephew?<eos> Ah, so it is!
Look, I don't know all the details.<eos> I'm just basing my life on him.<eos> Geez. In that case, let's get you a ribbon.<eos> It's everything I thought it would be and more.<eos> The ribbon just takes me where it wants.
Thank you all for coming.<eos> Whoo!<eos> Thirty-five years ago, my daddy, Big Bill Primm, put four million U.S. dollars inside this big old green horseshoe.<eos> It's been a part of Primm's history.<eos> In fact, it put Primm on the map.
All I know is, I don't care if a dog likes me, because I like me.<eos> Well, I like you, too.<eos> But why doesn't that dog like me?<eos> Why are you letting this get to you?<eos> Because it's like when you pick up a baby and it starts crying. It makes you start thinking there's something wrong with you. Ugh.
We're lucky to have you.<eos> But you gotta know what being here really means.<eos> Get home safe, sister.<eos> Now I ain't saying you went looking for this evil, but it found you.<eos> It chose you.
And... probably being in cahoots with Denise Hemphill in murdering Chad and a whole bunch of other people with his serial killer hand!<eos> MUNSCH: Chanel, look, I know you are feeling a tad blue right now, but Dr. Brock Holt did not murder Chad.<eos> He has an airtight alibi. He does?<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> I mean, I didn't want to believe that it was true, but after the silver and I knew you were jealous of Chad, I just... oh, I didn't know what else to think.
And then to flambé it, you...<eos> Cooking torch.<eos> No, I got the, uh, the kitchen's cooking torch here somewhere.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's... it's got a lot of smoke damage, but it didn't cause the blast.
It's not just a wall; it's a cage.<eos> It's all your pain, your loss... all the Company's lies.<eos> Hate the wall.<eos> Fight the wall.<eos> Break it down like it broke you.
Did you know?<eos> - We have nothing to do with the fire.<eos> What are you trying to do?<eos> Why you hide absolutely everything?<eos> I know where it was.
What?<eos> ! Of course it's the time!<eos> Play it!<eos> You can't just play the turin.<eos> It tells you when to play it.
They take our strength as their first gift and our last legacy.<eos> But that's not what you humans do, is it?<eos> You give your strength every day.<eos> You give your legacy as you live.<eos> And that's because you can shape it, rather than it shaping you.
Watson.<eos> Did Mr. Dalal's story check out?<eos> It did. But that's not why I'm calling.<eos> I found the motive for the attack on the key-holder group.<eos> Or rather, it found me.
Gonna take your horse.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - That's right. Well, listen, normally, I wouldn't mind givin' y'all a ride on ol' Gus, but see, right now, we're huntin', and we don't need no damn distractions.<eos> Well, you can keep on hunting'... I just need ol' Gus.<eos> See, if I don't find that bear, before it finds y'all... ain't gonna make it, anyway.
- that was brilliant.<eos> - The cat stew was Nina's idea.<eos> Too risky for me. What if Faye had come in when she was switching the pots?<eos> We had to get rid of that cat.<eos> It was actually helping her get better.
My challenge would be to find peace, reawaken my chi and atone for my sins.<eos> Maybe this Golden Nectar at the Wuyi mountain could help build me a new future.<eos> Lord knows I need it.<eos> But even though you may try to leave your past behind, in the end,<eos> it always finds you.
It could barely walk.<eos> It used to sleep by my bed.<eos> Watch over me.<eos> My wife, she came at me with a steak knife.<eos> It took a chunk out of her arm.
If you let me out, I can get the information.<eos> If you give me something I can use,<eos> I will contemplate your release.<eos> I don't know what made Sarah immortal, but I know about her baby!<eos> It's immortal too.
Are you okay, Holly?<eos> Holly?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> No, no, we've made a mistake.<eos> The spirit we... we got rid of it but it was trying to protect us and... and that's why it didn't want us here.
In every moment, a choice exists.<eos> We can cling to the past or embrace the inevitability of change... And allow a brighter future to unfold before us.<eos> Such an uncertain future may call for even more uncertain allies.<eos> Either way, a new day is coming, whether we like it or not.<eos> The question is will you control it, or will it control you?
That's the thing.<eos> The accident didn't just ruin the engine, it fried the whole system. It's on a loop.<eos> Torture, heal, torture, heal.<eos> I don't think it knows how to stop.<eos> So unless we destroy the program, the only way out is to die faster than it can fix you.
How are you doing ?<eos> I don't have time now. I'm at a charity evening for the homeless, organised by Violette.<eos> With many stars.<eos> There's that one. What's his name again?<eos> No, it's not him.
Oh, uh... yeah.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - There was just a stray dog.<eos> I think it was more scared of me than I was of it.<eos> I tried to take it in and stuff, but it had other ideas.
~ Yeah, but, you know...<eos> "What" is he? He could be anything.<eos> My God, they... Maybe they are having sex. I don't know.<eos> Is this the bloke they fell out about when Kate went off and got pregnant?<eos> ~ Yeah. I suppose it must be.
I think you should leave this house.<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - Shh. You're in no shape to leave.<eos> Think of the baby.<eos> Preacher James, it's Robert, my brother.
- Let's end this competition<eos> Sir, you.<eos> That guy left his lottery ticket on the table.<eos> That was the telegram man.<eos> No, it wasn't.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Now, are we gonna talk or we gonna drive?<eos> I don't feel as though I'm playing the violin so much as it's playing me.<eos> What... what do you mean?<eos> Well, it had so many owners before me.
Helping is my favorite!<eos> Dulcinea, could you describe the thief for me using mouth sounds?<eos> He was moving so fast...<eos> Is this the thief?<eos> Is it?
Am I your mother?<eos> In the future, I mean.<eos> Don't catch a cold.<eos> That's what mothers say.<eos> But you don't really catch a cold, it catches you, doesn't it?
The back end is sculpted so it doesn't need a stuck-on rear spoiler for downforce.<eos> And, like most Lambos, it has a four-wheel drive system.<eos> But not just ANY four-wheel drive system.<eos> It has three gyroscopes on board, like you get on a fighter jet, and they're busy monitoring everything that's going on.<eos> They send all that information back to the four-wheel drive brain and it then decides how much power to send to each individual wheel.
Dozerman: Youare 43minutesbehind.<eos> - I know.<eos> Get off my back, computer ghost.<eos> - Why are you still playing with that stupid game, Sarge? The guy is dead.<eos> - It's not a game.
They're all so beautiful.<eos> And they're all about to be tested... bouncy-styles.<eos> ♪ Three, six, nine ♪ ♪ Damn, she fine ♪<eos> ♪ To the wall ♪ I love this mattress.<eos> And it loves having you in it.
It reminded me of you, Mother.<eos> So beautiful.<eos> Its neck.<eos> Did you find it so?<eos> It found me.
Mm, what have you seen?<eos> Um, what's the one in Belgium, of the little boy with his dick out?<eos> Le Mannekin Pis.<eos> Er, designed by Hieronimus Duquesnoy in 1688, I think.<eos> Yeah, I climbed over the railings and got a picture of it pissing in my mouth.
Your aid?<eos> I have new allies.<eos> Do not worry your cowardly mind. I've already sent him back from whence he came. But his specter proved quite useful.<eos> Apparently our Countess has a weakness... Her ancient, rotting corpse is the secret to her longevity.<eos> Increase told me where to find it, and at the right moment, it and she will be mine.
Point is, love is tricky.<eos> You can't go looking for it.<eos> Then how am I gonna find it?<eos> You don't.<eos> It finds you.
Yeah, family is the worst way to meet someone that you have nothing in common with.<eos> So how did you suckered into going to your brother's for Yom Kippur?<eos> You said last year, "Never again!"<eos> Which, honestly, was a little on the nose.<eos> I know, I got a call from an unknown number and I thought it was that agent Skippy Truce, the one that likes me, but it wasn't, it was Garry.
I work for the House. And although it's obligated to keep the Gamblers happy, it's also meant to keep them in line.<eos> The first time you won a match against me, uncle told you a story.<eos> While on a hunt, a king goes down by the river to fill his cup with water.<eos> His hawk swoops in and spills it on the ground.<eos> The king warns his hawk not to do it again, but it doesn't heed his warning.
And what did the pigeon do?<eos> - It sai on a branch.<eos> - It sat on a branch?<eos> - And what did it do on the branch?<eos> - It rested and reflected.
You know, look. Do I think he's, like, a troubled teenager?<eos> No.<eos> But I think this move is good for him.<eos> Because...<eos> Because as hard as it seems for him right now, long-term, I just think it's... I just think it's best.
Counselor Madhavan.<eos> Excuse me, but the federal government of the United States would greatly appreciate a courtesy briefing...<eos> And if maybe you could answer a question or two about how you found your daughter before we did.<eos> Sir?<eos> The thing you need to understand about kissing a diplomat's ass is that it doesn't kiss back.
Okay, we'll be prepared.<eos> No, I really think we should go over our paperwork.<eos> No, we're gonna be ready because I am amazing, and you are Andy McNally, A-type goddess, organizer of piles and... de-clutterer of, uh...<eos> - I dunno, clutter. - What's happening?<eos> Well, I can't pass this off to my successor like this, whomever it may be.
You can plan to meet people in your dreams.<eos> Can you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, when you go to bed tonight, I want you to plan to meet George Henry in your dreams.<eos> I once dreamt that I jumped down a hill, but I landed near a bear and it ate me.
- AL RIGHT, THANKS.<eos> - "JUNE THIRD, 1893. CALCUTTA.<eos> "AFTER SIX WEEKS IN THE FOUL BUSTEE, I ENCOUNTERED MY FIRST.<eos> "IT ATTACKED.<eos> "FORTUNATELY, I HAD MY DAGGER AND WAS ABLE TO SLIT ITS THROAT BEFORE IT WAS ABLE TO TIGHTEN ITS TONGUE AROUND MINE."
You should talk to her.<eos> So you burnt the Ouija board once the spirit became trapped?<eos> Since when can you burn a ghost?<eos> I'm not following.<eos> No, it's following you!
Thanks, Ma.<eos> You're the best.<eos> I hope my baby feels about me the way I feel about you.<eos> I'm sure it will.<eos> But what if I don't love my baby as much as it loves me?
He's got to be stopped. He's got to be punished.<eos> If his father were here, this never would've happened.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> What was the relationship with his father?<eos> Oh, it was very bad.
But Dad... How do you recognize it in winter?<eos> Told you 100 times.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> When the ash tree was created... it made all the other trees in the forest jealous,<eos> because it was... It was the most beautiful tree in the forest.
I can take you whenever you like.<eos> Melissa can come too, if you like.<eos> The body has tremendous intelligence.<eos> Follow the body.<eos> It will know what to do.
As if we were going to to jump up on his hood.<eos> - Crapule?<eos> - What the hell? !<eos> Call the boss.<eos> It is Khorzov, my security chief.
And Kat comes along, and you guys flirt, she makes you soup when you had vampire-death flu, and you wanna get on that.<eos> But you can't.<eos> You're a gentleman, so you're holding off.<eos> But that doesn't stop your subconscious mind.<eos> Mm-hmm. You go to sleep and it takes over, sending you out into the world, just looking for some ass.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> And, Sheriff... I just wanted to ask you a question.<eos> Was he the man who escaped from prison?<eos> Yeah, we think it was.
What Hannah is trying to say is we have good news.<eos> They found a body in the woods.<eos> The police believe it was a camper.<eos> It was Toby.<eos> No, Spence, it wasn't.
Ezra is taking on these big responsibilities.<eos> And he needs a job.<eos> The park rangers found a body.<eos> It was Toby.<eos> No, Spence, it wasn't.
It was like one of those chimneys falling down.<eos> At the last moment, the head just went clunk!<eos> And we thought it was dead.<eos> We thought this thing was dead.<eos> And it lay there for, it must have been three minutes.
Ivan, it's you that's the bastard.<eos> It's the baby that's the bastard.<eos> For God's sake, Ivan, at least get the word right.<eos> Katrina, listen.<eos> No, I will give the baby my name and it will see my face.
-You moved? !<eos> The forensic team just found DNA at the cottage.<eos> -Foyle's?<eos> -They want to meet.<eos> In the shock and trauma of finding your wife, you look up the window and see a man whose absence from your life would be very useful indeed, but it wasn't that man, was it, Mr. Burton?
Enough!<eos> My leg is broken!<eos> Stan, you can make it!<eos> Listen to my body.<eos> It knows what to do.
The rat was tortured.<eos> Just like Alex Zukanov.<eos> The killer force-fed it.<eos> Stones.<eos> Pushed down its throat, so it too was in agony.
This isn't simply a suicide.<eos> This pertains to the seven years of tribulations.<eos> The creature in your nightmare...<eos> I barely saw it.<eos> Perhaps it is the true cause of the doctor's death.
Makes noise out of every century.<eos> Makes the same noises that were made in the seventeen century, along with other noises that where developed since then. No.<eos> But I don't mind the noise.<eos> The noise energizes me.<eos> Important thing is that it's there.
You know, it's just weird...<eos> 'Cause I didn't think.<eos> I just did.<eos> Keep listening to your gut, little bro.<eos> It'll never lie to you.
A surrogate mother is pure as you.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What child?<eos> A child in a short time will grow inside you.<eos> It has chosen you.
Used a paralytic on a guard.<eos> Think he got it from the inside?<eos> Grilling the staff right now.<eos> You want to meet your predecessor?<eos> It's the guy I was stuck with before I was stuck with you.
Scotty Evans and Timmy Knight.<eos> They were after me.<eos> Black eye, stabbing ...<eos> And then you intervened, remember?<eos> You raised his fist and hit you Scotty Evans. Boom, it collapsed like a pile of bricks.
Ilithyia?<eos> It appears you have been misinformed.<eos> I have been taken only to bed, my child causing unexpected discomfort... in waning months of pregnancy.<eos> Did it also cause the bruise upon your cheek?<eos> No, it did not. The fault was mine.
Been anywhere. Well, then it sounds like we have some traveling to do.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Justin is an idiot.<eos> Oh, also, Bob asked me to give you some notes on your draft of his speech, is that weird for you?<eos> No, it's not weird.
I want a new bed.<eos> We need a new bed.<eos> I want to turn our bedroom into a sanctuary. Ohh!<eos> Here we go.<eos> _ listen, I found a really cute bed at Bedder Beds 4 Less, and it has drawers underneath, and the headboard has these little lighted cubbyholes to display our stuff.
Yeah. Me, too.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> I'm fine here, too.<eos> Look, now we know what to expect.<eos> We just have to outsmart the shark before it gets one of us.
I do now, Leigh.<eos> I know you were a petty criminal thrown in jail for shoplifting a loaf of bread, and while you were in there, the jailers went caroling in the cell block, and five men held you down and took your virginity.<eos> Well... the first one did.<eos> The others took your dignity, and your self-esteem and... most importantly... your Christmas spirit.<eos> But then you got out and you found the suit, and it gave you everything you were missing.
Mangosta is a Colombian assassin that Doris was assigned to take out 37 years ago.<eos> What, but she didn't kill him?<eos> Everyone thought she did. Then a man believed to be Mangosta resurfaced.<eos> The intelligence community hasn't been able to confirm that it's him yet.<eos> But you think it is?
Alex!<eos> That is how emotional intelligence works when applied to robotics.<eos> The fluid logic and genetic algorithms allow us to design a variable artificial brain.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That of all the options available, it always chooses the one best-suited to the individual in front of it.
That's awesome.<eos> I love that. The lookout.<eos> - I don't know what the guy looks like.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> You see anybody, just assume that it's Harken, send us a signal.
When you're pregnant, you're really sensitive, and you pick up things like a radio antenna, like all sorts of signals.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What if the baby can feel my thoughts?<eos> What if it knows that I think it's gonna die?
The bad news, everyone, is, the beast reproduces asexually.<eos> A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone vampire porn, could produce dozens of deadly offspring.<eos> That lucky bastard.<eos> I say kill it!<eos> But it loves me, and I love it!
People like you, I like pissing off.<eos> So we're going to the US, your house or somewhere else.<eos> Come on, calm down.<eos> Do have to play this game again?<eos> It is fine, and you ruin everything in 5 minutes!
You've got to put some pressure on.<eos> How can a game have such an effect on man's soul?<eos> The way I see it, how can it not?<eos> You don't choose the game.<eos> It chooses you.
I'll be fine.<eos> All right.<eos> I guess I'll see you around.<eos> Actually, I guess I won't.<eos> We may think we've left the past behind. But it has a way of catching up to us.
Of course I still have my oboe!<eos> I was just practicing.<eos> Inching towards me, and I wonder if he's dead.<eos> Because the last thing you need is to come face to face with a cornered, angry beaver.<eos> And I reach down, and it looks dead, right?
Yup...<eos> Look: the ocean.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Beautiful.<eos> It doesn't have to do anything.
Were you all right?<eos> I... I was fine.<eos> Yeah, the side of the car was totally dented in.<eos> And the deer?<eos> It, uh, just... got up and... what, loped?
Give me a kiss.<eos> She's changed the locks!<eos> She's changed the back door too.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> I was thinking, I put over £400,000 into this house and, er, the dog, bless it, has contributed very little to the mortgage, yet it can come and go as it pleases.
The big problem with quantum mechanics is that the little particles that we're all made of can be in multiple places at once, yet I'm made of little particles and you never see me in two places at once, so what's going on here?<eos> Max thinks that the maths of quantum theory is telling us something remarkable.<eos> So whenever the equations say that this tennis ball is in many different places at once, what that really means is that our reality is branched out into multiple universes and in each one, the ball's in a definite place.<eos> According to this theory, when the photon of light faces two slits... it doesn't split in two.<eos> It splits the world in two.
However strange this theory sounds,<eos> Max believes you have to accept reality as you find it.<eos> Like if I get a parking ticket, there's always a parallel universe where I didn't.<eos> On the other hand, there's yet another universe where my car was stolen, so you win some, you lose some.<eos> But seriously... my job as a scientist isn't to tell the universe how to conform to my preconceptions of how it should be, but to look at the universe and find out how it really works.
Destiny can be a curse.<eos> You can try to control it...<eos> These are going to be collector's items one day.<eos> Ah, no they're not.<eos> But typically, it controls you.
Party line?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't even vote.<eos> "The world's a suicide case.<eos> We save it, it just steals more pills"?
Avatar.<eos> It's a movie?<eos> Okay, okay, so there's this guy in a wheelchair, and he goes to this alien planet to join a program...<eos> So you pick a dragon and get to keep it forever?<eos> No, it picks you.
No.<eos> That's not what's happening here, is it?<eos> See, you're so intoxicated by the possibility of creating some amazing new "life form" that you're ignoring other options.<eos> That is not the case, I assure you.<eos> Growing a monster inside my girlfriend, and then patching her up after it chews its way out is not an answer!
A new commandment.<eos> There you go.<eos> This is filmed from the deck.<eos> It's Captain Zuniga, right?<eos> Yes, it is.
If I killed him, you'd give me a head start, wouldn't you?<eos> mmm. Man, I really appreciate you driving today.<eos> Happy to do it.<eos> Is this the farthest the seat goes back?<eos> The problem ain't how far it goes back; It's how far you go forward.
- Aunt Ann, what is this place?<eos> - Just holding pens.<eos> You don't have those on the East Coast, huh?<eos> Is this where they slaughter them?<eos> Yes, it is.
Nobody can change what has happened, nobody can stop what is going to happen, every one must be happy this moment, that's it,<eos> Happy Home!<eos> Is the child kicking the football well, Lata sister?<eos> Let it come out, I'll ask it to kick you.<eos> Who is it?
- You say, hoorawed?<eos> - That was the word.<eos> There is no hoorawing in it.<eos> My agreement with the Marshal ante-dates yours.<eos> It has the force of law.
Thank you, Richard.<eos> What's that?<eos> A secreter room?<eos> It's where I was told I could summon the monster.<eos> That's before I realized that it was the one summoning me.
- Not usually.<eos> - Not ever.<eos> We know nothing, brain knows all.<eos> You get an ulcer, you don't know it, but the brain increases mucin secretions.<eos> It knows what the problem is, where the problem is.
Ian Spankler. British.<eos> I picked it up for three hundred Just before he took off.<eos> Three hundred dollars?<eos> Three hundred thousand.<eos> He wants to have sex with the porcupine, but it's poking him.
Um, yeah- about that prophecy... the book flew away.<eos> In flames.<eos> All gone, bye-bye.<eos> Oh, atticus, it takes more than fire to destroy the book.<eos> It survives.
And make sure you return all of her dad's things.<eos> And stay the hell away from us, I mean it.<eos> Are you sure the ghost was Kyle? Yes.<eos> No.<eos> I think it was.
Wait, wait, stop, stop. What?<eos> Look at the color.<eos> It's in his bloodstream.<eos> No point in dismembering him.<eos> Not if it's spreading internally.
But out of the frying pan and into the fire.<eos> Giant frogfish come in all colors.<eos> Trying to hide under one could be a really bad idea.<eos> The stonefish is about as graceless as a fish can be.<eos> It has little to fear from predators.
It's absinthe.<eos> Is not it you become mad?<eos> That said some people<eos> Did not Van Gogh cut the ear in a delirium of absinthe?<eos> It was like a goat.
You know what, you could eat it before it eats you.<eos> Try that.<eos> Eat the snake first.<eos> That's what my new brain tells me.<eos> - It's preparing to eat me.
At the beginning and the end of the invocation, I'll sound the shofar, which is an animal horn used in religious ceremonies.<eos> In this case, the sound is intended to shock the spirit hiding within the victim.<eos> Once the spirit is more compliant, then we can start drawing it out.<eos> That's when the rest of us are the most vulnerable.<eos> It wants Casey, but it will take any port in the storm.
It was.<eos> Plain as day.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> How else do you explain it? The doctors can't.<eos> There's a bullet in my heart, and it's pumping like a piston.
That's-<eos> - I could use that for practically everything I ever do.<eos> You know, society votes.<eos> They like the way this guy makes ice cream.<eos> But the other guy, they don't like his ice cream that much and they don't buy it, so it fades out.
Naked. In the middle of the night, 1 1/2 miles from the shore, clinging to a buoy.<eos> That's a hell of a miscalculation.<eos> I went for a night swim.<eos> It was cold, beautiful. Just me and the water.<eos> Felt like I was one with the ocean, like I was inside it and it was inside me.
That was amazing.<eos> No wonder you were so popular in high school.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Sex did not make me popular.<eos> I made it popular. Ohh.
All right.<eos> Tell me exactly where the line is.<eos> Okay,how about this?<eos> I have a friend abbey.<eos> She had a baby boy and it farted.
You keep families together.<eos> She has a history of prostitution, she's a drug addict. She gave the baby to a meth-addicted father. - She's clean...<eos> - She's endangering the child.<eos> What if she's clean?<eos> What if I give her back the baby and it winds up dead in a week?
I mean, monster is loose, you move away from it.<eos> Yeah, unless she couldn't believe that he would hurt her.<eos> But she ends up over here.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, it attacks, she trips, slams into the drug cabinet.
But she ends up over here.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, it attacks, she trips, slams into the drug cabinet.<eos> Yeah, and lands right here.<eos> And then it finishes the attack and splits out the window.
Well, there's no plates on the truck; how we gonna trace him?<eos> Kaleidoscope.<eos> The RD guys over at China Lake developed the algorithm.<eos> It's the naval weapons center's brand-new visual query system.<eos> You feed it the description of a person, place, or thing... It scans live feeds from traffic cams, ATM cams, and satellite images for a result.
Mr. Chaddha, why are you getting angry on him?<eos> Oh! Then there is only one person who can get your work done.<eos> Are you sure, the doggie will eat after seeing him?<eos> Yes, Son, I am absolutely sure.<eos> It won't even touch food without seeing him.
