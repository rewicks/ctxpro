Got it. 43rd floor.<eos> Someone's contacted the president's staff.<eos> Someone's watching him.<eos> Dr. Osmond, what is it you want from us?<eos> I think it's more about what Hanka Robotics can do for you.
No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here.<eos> You wouldn't exist if it weren't for those experiments.<eos> Experiments?<eos> - Is that what I am to you?
Find out exactly what Kuze told you.<eos> You know what he told me.<eos> The truth.<eos> You're deleting everything, aren't you? No.<eos> Make it so I don't remember... you.
Three flashbangs, two bullets, and one body bag later, we took custody of the device.<eos> We must have over 100 redundancies in place to prevent some punk with a laptop from hijacking satellites.<eos> And Pandora's Box can bypass all of them.<eos> With the push of a button, it can eavesdrop on secure communications, corrupt military software, transmit false intelligence, or crash a satellite out of the sky like a goddamn tactical warhead.<eos> One of you is behind this.
I know the feeling.<eos> Running from your problems never works out.<eos> You need a new plan.<eos> I need a new map.<eos> Don't say I didn't warn you.
Olly-olly-oxen-free.<eos> Wow.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?<eos> Augustus always had such, well, not exactly nice things to say about you.
The bullets could've been real.<eos> Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but-- I don't like to be tested.<eos> Gibbons never believed you were dead!<eos> Never stopped looking for you.
Hey, here comes the Red Bull freak show.<eos> Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul-- Donovan.<eos> Captain Paul Donovan.<eos> I know you.<eos> I saw you on TV!
The President gave him a medal.<eos> That must have been pretty cool, right?<eos> You guys must have some seriously cool stories to tell.<eos> Must've seen a lot.<eos> I wonder, how many of you have ever pulled a freestyle triple back-flip on a BMX bike before?
All of you?<eos> No.<eos> We don't play on bikes.<eos> Oh, you don't play on bikes.<eos> Any of you ever carve an R4 on a snowboard while an avalanche is on your booty?
A source inside the Pentagon says a rogue satellite may have been used as a weapon.<eos> Guess this means Pandora's Box isn't exactly classified.<eos> In a new video released just moments ago, an anonymous group is claiming to have the ability to use satellites as weapons.<eos> They claim "That the violation of civil liberties of all the citizens of the world is an atrocity that must be stopped."<eos> Disable and dismantle all the world's spy programs within the next 24 hours, or I'll do it for you, one satellite at a time.
I can't see shit.<eos> X, can't see you guys.<eos> Thermal's no good.<eos> - Right?<eos> - I've lost you in the heat.
Well?<eos> Serena.<eos> We're a bit busy now!<eos> Marke's got Pandora's Box.<eos> She's gonna drop a satellite on top of you.
She's just my tablemate today.<eos> Can I ask what her name is?<eos> Megan-Ann.<eos> There it is.<eos> I may come to you one day asking for Megan-Ann's hand in marriage.
Who knows what that girl will do to herself?<eos> We don't, because we don't know anything about her.<eos> She's temperamental.<eos> She hasn't had a drink and now she's puked up mini hotdogs.<eos> Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?
I cried so hard Teddy gave me his.<eos> He was always good like that.<eos> Francie, we should go. Okay.<eos> Thanks again for coming, everyone.<eos> It wouldn't have been the same without you.
You're looking big.<eos> I don't know how you fit in that uniform, man.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> If I had a sister, I'd introduce you to her, man.
You work in an office and you doze off at your desk one day, no big deal.<eos> You slack off here... Say it with me...<eos> People die.<eos> So here's the thing, if you've come to Baywatch on your little motorcycle, thinking you're cool, trying to work on your killer tan... Well, you need to find another beach to go to.<eos> But if you've come to sacrifice for something much bigger than yourself, this is the beach for you.
Look out!<eos> We're on the go!<eos> Come on, move! Yo, move!<eos> - My kids! - Ma'am, everything's okay.<eos> I'm here to save you.
I'm here to save you.<eos> My name is Matt Brody.<eos> - Somebody help!<eos> - Ma'am, stop it!<eos> I can't save you if you're being a dick!
- "Other two"?<eos> Shit.<eos> Come on. Breathe for me.<eos> Come on, big man.<eos> We'll set you down right here.
- Steph, how is she?<eos> - She's all right.<eos> You're gonna be good.<eos> Give me some. Let's get you to your mom.<eos> All right, guys. Hey, listen up. We want to thank you for a great year of qualifiers.
- She's all right.<eos> You're gonna be good.<eos> Give me some. Let's get you to your mom.<eos> All right, guys. Hey, listen up. We want to thank you for a great year of qualifiers.<eos> For those of you who don't go on and become trainees, we wanna thank you, we expect to see you next year.
Hot Wheels, I'll see you back here in the morning.<eos> Sure thing, Lieutenant.<eos> Welcome to Baywatch.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, I'm so glad I caught you all.
Appreciate it.<eos> See that?<eos> We're just doing our jobs.<eos> Hey, guys, this is Victoria Leeds, the new owner of the Huntley Club.<eos> - Hey. Well, I just wanted to invite all of you to the Huntley. We're having an open house.
But I'm working on it.<eos> Yeah, well, you just ran out of time.<eos> Leon, would you show Mr. Rodriguez what we do to people who don't deliver?<eos> I know you're dealing flakka, which is gonna drive down real estate prices in the bay, right? Right?<eos> So if anything happens to me, I will expose you.
I'm not a Bond villain.<eos> Well, yet.<eos> You're in politics.<eos> You know that no one can claw their way to the top without getting a little dirt under their fingernails.<eos> Clearly, I overestimated you.
- Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> I wanted to meet the new neighbor everyone is talking about.<eos> So I presume you know why I had to invite you.
So many people.<eos> So as a welcome to the bay, I...<eos> Oh, God. Mitch, this is for you.<eos> Wait. No, Victoria.<eos> I have something very special planned for you, for everyone.
- For Mitch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lifeguards, this is a surprise.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...
Did I kill him?<eos> No, you just knocked his ass out.<eos> Thank God. Here's the key. Here's the key.<eos> All right, guys, Brody found the flakka.<eos> And let's get you out of here and call Ellerbee, okay?
Take care of them already!<eos> - What the fuck? Holy shit!<eos> - God damn it, get down!<eos> Miss Leeds, I'm approaching the barge.<eos> I'll meet you at the top.
Good night, Jakob.<eos> He is very obedient. Hmm.<eos> This is part of it.<eos> To disobey is to say something, so... So he obeys.<eos> He isn't trying to hurt you.
This is part of it.<eos> To disobey is to say something, so... So he obeys.<eos> He isn't trying to hurt you.<eos> That's my son, signorina, not me. Hmm.<eos> Jakob doesn't want you here.
We nursed her day and night, me and the boy.<eos> He saw terrible things.<eos> He heard terrible things.<eos> And when she died, I washed her... And tidied her hair.<eos> The room upsets you.
I can help him.<eos> And yet he has still said nothing.<eos> It's for me to protect him, and now I have made things worse.<eos> She wants me here to take care of Jakob and...<eos> And to take care of you.
There's somebody laughing, there's somebody being laughed at.<eos> Right.<eos> Look, whatever, really.<eos> I mean, this whole high school thing's just a blip.<eos> I'm not gonna remember any of you.
We celebrate you, Pepper.<eos> You and all your brothers and sisters in the animal family.<eos> We vow to honor and protect your kind and oppose with all our heart those... who would harm or degrade any living creature in any way.<eos> Amen.<eos> So whatever happened with you and Francisco?
I wanted a chance... to get to know you and Mrs. Cassiday a little.<eos> I... I brought this for Claire.<eos> I thought she might be interested in her family tree, and there's photos.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't want you or your book.<eos> I'm asking you.
There will be no more killings. There will be no more purges. Am I clear, brother?<eos> Now leave me.<eos> Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?
Someone here to see you.<eos> I think you need to see her.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I know who you are, Mage.<eos> I've seen you in my dreams.
You're good with animals, aren't you?<eos> They have a word for that, don't they?<eos> "Mage."<eos> I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.
You do know I can see through this?<eos> Trees everywhere.<eos> Hang that up. Don't want it getting creased.<eos> So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.<eos> Unlike you, he chose the wrong place to hide.
Now that would've hurt a lot more if I left the ring on.<eos> I see what you're doing.<eos> You're trying to get me to do something razzle-dazzle with that sword.<eos> I'm gonna tell you right now, I'm not gettin' drawn into this mess.<eos> And there's an army of you. There's only one of me.
I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.<eos> I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.<eos> 'Cause you're gonna need it.<eos> I'm gonna be forced to tell them...<eos> There's not a bollock between you.
And then throw the fucking lot of them out the window.<eos> And they want you to! They want you to!<eos> So that he could reach the unknown.<eos> He experimented.<eos> They scare you with names.
Any objections?<eos> Okay, Ricks.<eos> let's chart a course, and take a closer look.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Captain, can I talk to you for a second?
Okay.<eos> This will do.<eos> Expedition Team, do you read us?<eos> Mother's saying the ion storm is getting worse.<eos> We're having a hell of a time tracking you.
Do you read me?<eos> Are you reading me, Landing Team?<eos> Yes, we read you.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> We hear you.
Waiting, really.<eos> For what?<eos> What are they waiting for, David?<eos> Mother.<eos> Perfectly safe, I assure you.
The letter.<eos> The map you stole from me.<eos> Map?<eos> I do not know what you are talking about.<eos> How would I... had even had the opportunity to steal anything from you, Miss...?
Make yourself comfortable.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Who am I?<eos> The more relevant question, Mr. Morton is: Who exactly are you?<eos> In theory, I know all about you.
I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.<eos> And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.<eos> None of this makes any sense, and I really don't understand why you can't follow simple rules.<eos> You snuck out and it put you all in danger.<eos> Seems to me the only way I can keep you safe is if...
No way!<eos> - But, Papa, but...<eos> - Come on!<eos> No "buts."<eos> None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going.
It's too dangerous.<eos> I have to at least warn that lost village.<eos> Well, we're Team Smurf, and we stick together.<eos> So, we're coming with you.<eos> I can't ask you to do that.
It's never gonna stop.<eos> Make the log stop spinning.<eos> This river is killing me.<eos> Look out!<eos> I love you two.
- I...<eos> - Don't get too close, Willow.<eos> Something's not right here.<eos> I promise we're only here to help.<eos> We came to warn you about the evil wizard, Gargamel.
He has a map with a landmark leading him to three tall trees.<eos> - Show 'em, Brainy.<eos> - Snappy.<eos> Don't try any funny stuff, bug.<eos> I hate to break it to you, but those aren't trees.
What?<eos> What is all this talk about Garga...<eos> Gargamel!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did I scare you?
Rama Kushna says this will break down the walls between the planes.<eos> Even the afterlife will be affected.<eos> Yeah, it's dodgy, all right.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Meanwhile, the House will drop you wherever you'd like.
A single human among your teeming masses.<eos> I only know John Constantine because he enrages me.<eos> Faust lives in an observatory which is invisible.<eos> It's a place where dark magic would infect the earth below it.<eos> I will take you there so you are no longer here.
You can not miss it.<eos> Where do I wait?<eos> In the guest lounge.<eos> Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> We are ready to meet you now.
I think that's all, Mr. Harding.<eos> If we protest any additional information, We'll call you.<eos> I'll give you my address and phone number.<eos> This is not necessary.<eos> We will find you, this is our specialty.
Wixler kept a box. To meet the retirement plans concluded Prior to merger, Which would eventually unite With the new pension fund.<eos> Heaven forbid, can you speak clearly?<eos> With the cessation of US operations, There is no longer any financial responsibility for SIMTEC.<eos> The retirement fund will be dissolved.<eos> With all my respect, "Donald" 30 years of hard work Does not mean anything to you!
If you stole, do not steal from the Valley Town.<eos> Yes, I have two great friends.<eos> You made me a partner in the crime of theft.<eos> We did not ask you to do anything.<eos> I brought you here.
Yes, I have two great friends.<eos> You made me a partner in the crime of theft.<eos> We did not ask you to do anything.<eos> I brought you here.<eos> I'll take you, so I'm the driver of the escape.
Do not touch my car.<eos> You will not force us to walk!<eos> I will certainly challenge you.<eos> Lord, you will be great bank robbers.<eos> They catch you stealing from Valle Town!
People have no pity these days.<eos> Why do you think you can succeed?<eos> I do not know, we saw that we try.<eos> "I do not know, we saw that we try."<eos> You may be imprisoned for life, It is not long for you.
20 days<eos> I have 20 days before I lose my house.<eos> Bank robbery is a work of art.<eos> Can for ten people Stealing the place with ten methods.<eos> You have to find a plan that suits you.
The reason is not wine.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, why not wine?<eos> You can call an ambulance please?<eos> I beg you?
He got all his vaccines.<eos> Dog, tuberculosis, pordetaila, And you singled out.<eos> All sheets are organized.<eos> Have you taken your share?<eos> No, not from you.
- Yes.<eos> It's your problem now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good luck, may you enjoy Every moment of your time together.<eos> We love you.
"I love you.<eos> "I love Fergus more than anything.<eos> "But I'm finished, Gail.<eos> "I'm sorry.<eos> "Love you both.
- No, Mr. Doyle.<eos> - Right answer.<eos> I wouldn't let it happen.<eos> And it's not gonna happen, right?<eos> Thankfully for you two, I've done some due diligence on you, and what I hear is you're a couple of losers.
- Papa!<eos> - No!<eos> I'll come back!<eos> I promise!<eos> Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle... but I have come to escort you to your room.
- Oh! - Be calm.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> You're making her dinner!<eos> Well, we thought you might appreciate the company.<eos> Master, I just want to assure you... that I had no part in this hopeless plan.
Are there any other tasteless demands... you wish to make upon my artistry?<eos> No, that's it.<eos> There you are, dear.<eos> Ma chere mademoiselle.<eos> It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure... that we welcome you tonight.
Thank you, miss.<eos> We are eternally grateful.<eos> Why do you care about him so much?<eos> We've looked after him all his life.<eos> But he's cursed you somehow.
And now, it's too late.<eos> But she might still come back.<eos> No.<eos> I set her free.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you.
Yes, those are called books, you third rate musketeers.<eos> I'm off.<eos> Just a clock.<eos> Come here... little boys.<eos> I spin you this way.
Turn back into a clock.<eos> Lumiere, look!<eos> Oh, my Prince!<eos> Hello, old friend.<eos> It's so good to see you.
Yeah, 200.<eos> That's your air.<eos> Okay.<eos> When it gets to 100, you need to let me know.<eos> When it gets to 50, I'm gonna bring you back up.
It's the only safe place from the sharks.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Javier's coming down to you now.<eos> He's going to hook up the cage to our spare winch<eos> - and pull you up.
Oh...<eos> Jesus.<eos> Get back in the cage!<eos> Get back in the cage now!<eos> I'm bringing you back up!
It's gonna run out any minute.<eos> I'm going to send down extra air tanks.<eos> But, Kate, there's a reason that I didn't do this before.<eos> Moving onto a second tank is going to increase your chance of nitrogen narcosis dramatically.<eos> You're going to need to watch each other closely to make sure that neither of you is behaving strangely or hallucinating.
- Swim!<eos> - Help!<eos> Swim!<eos> Grab it!<eos> Grab the lifesaver, we'll pull you in.
We made it, Kate!<eos> We made it!<eos> We made it.<eos> Lisa, if you can hear me, the Coast Guard are coming down right now.<eos> They are going to bring you up.
Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.<eos> How did you find me, huh?<eos> 'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!<eos> The people after you, they're on my ass now!
Please. I beg you... take her to safety.<eos> Is this where we're hiding out?<eos> We're not hiding out.<eos> We're gonna get a couple of hours' sleep... clean up, get some new clothes, get a new ride and get outta here.<eos> Harrah's Hotel and Casino welcomes you to Oklahoma City.
That's your daughter?<eos> Yeah, that's Laura, and that's my dad...<eos> Chuck.<eos> Come on, Laura, let's go.<eos> Well, can we show our appreciation and treat the three of you to a decent meal?
He was there, too.<eos> Oh, yeah, no.<eos> Um... I got kicked out a few times.<eos> I wish I could say you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me.<eos> Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this.
What?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Shoot him!<eos> We need to intervene.<eos> Well, he only listens to you, Doctor.
Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell... that nice little girl out in the waiting room... her daddy's gone.<eos> I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.
Fuck!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell... that nice little girl out in the waiting room... her daddy's gone.<eos> I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.<eos> There's so few of you left.
What you need is rest, and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, you're not!<eos> I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.
Where we came from.<eos> They gave it to us when we would fight.<eos> It makes you stronger.<eos> It makes you crazy, is what it does.<eos> It'll kill you.
Hey, go inside and tell everyone to get packing.<eos> You can't do that. You can't just stay here.<eos> We had to wait. It was the plan.<eos> And everyone had till today to find their way here.<eos> If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you and they will kill you all.
Right?<eos> E.E. Cummings wrote that.<eos> And, guys, you're growing up.<eos> You're moving on.<eos> For many of you, this is gonna be the last English class you're ever gonna take.
He was just masturbating.<eos> And he was just watching.<eos> I wasn't watching.<eos> I caught you.<eos> Just get out of here before I report you.
Maybe the best thing to do is talk to Neil?<eos> Oh, I did. Yeah.<eos> Neil's not talkin' either.<eos> So, then I went back to this.<eos> I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.
Neil's not talkin' either.<eos> So, then I went back to this.<eos> I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me bottom-line this for you.
I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me bottom-line this for you.<eos> Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.
Let me bottom-line this for you.<eos> Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.<eos> Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?
Hashtag teacher fight?<eos> What is this?<eos> You guys are tweeting about this now?<eos> Why would you agree to fight Strickland?<eos> He could kill you.
MacBook Pro.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I'll do it for a MacBook Pro.<eos> Are you trying to blackmail me?<eos> Want me to lie for you or not?
Because technology's always changing.<eos> You gotta keep up.<eos> Otherwise, you're one of those dumb families that doesn't have a MacBook Pro.<eos> I ruined the surprise.<eos> Now, let's talk about you.
Assault is a real thing.<eos> I would like you to stop laughing and listen to my...<eos> You're a grown man.<eos> Now go on and take that ass-whoopin'.<eos> I'm asking you for help and...
Playing pranks used to be fun.<eos> This shit is getting violent.<eos> I look like a fucking minion!<eos> Holy cow!<eos> They got both of you, huh?
You nodding at me?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> That nod was not for you.
Let's go.<eos> You wanna see what I'm made out of?<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> See?<eos> Let that be a lesson to you.
Who are you?<eos> I...<eos> Holly.<eos> We've been flirting, like, all fucking year.<eos> I've been, like, ignoring you all year.
Well, because of the media attention, you and Strickland became like education folk heroes.<eos> Yeah, how about that, huh?<eos> So, the board wants both of you back at Roosevelt because of this PR mess.<eos> So, this is fun.<eos> So, he sent you here to beg me to come back?
Miguel, thanks for signing on to this with me.<eos> And to his lovely wife, Sarah, our lawyer...<eos> I still can't pay you.<eos> A lot of you guys here saw me through a rough time when my dad got sick and passed away and that's what made me realize that this is where I belong.<eos> And to those of you who thought I was crazy for quitting Merrill Lynch and brewing beer in my garage, well, you were Wrong.
In fact, um...<eos> I have some news.<eos> Julia and I are getting married.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> I'm happy for you.
All my principal investors are gonna be there.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> But if it wasn't for you guys here at this table, Copper Mountain Brewery wouldn't be here.<eos> So, from Miguel and I, thank you very much and cheers.
I promise.<eos> I love you, Julia.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Leave that clear for the ME.<eos> And we'll do everything we can for you.
Each single Norse ship had been dragged to the bottom of the sea, where their souls know no rest.<eos> Just beside the relic where the bodies of three Nordic men, twisted and burned.<eos> No one but a pure of heart can touch the relic and live.<eos> No one.<eos> How long has he served you?
We do not need the reliquary<eos> Only what's inside it.<eos> I will carry it.<eos> I will carry the relic.<eos> One of you will have to free Ciarán.
Utterly.<eos> No need for stimulants now, remember?<eos> I have work to do.<eos> You're high as a kite!<eos> Natural high, I assure you.
Yes.<eos> You also say you know what he's going to do next.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Perhaps that's all there is to it.<eos> Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
He's planned something, something long-term.<eos> Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.<eos> Posthumous revenge.<eos> No, better than that - posthumous game.<eos> We brought you back to deal with this.
- Son.<eos> - Son!<eos> Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Thank you very much for coming.<eos> We've heard a great deal about you.
You started out in manual labour.<eos> Don't bother being astonished.<eos> Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.<eos> I was a carpenter. Like me dad.<eos> You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.<eos> The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.<eos> I... I thought you'd done something clever.<eos> Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?<eos> I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.<eos> We all had one.<eos> Each containing aliases, our background, everything.<eos> We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.<eos> Who employed you?
'I need to move the target far, far away from you 'and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.<eos> 'I swear I will.'<eos> Not like this one.<eos> You haven't got a chance, not a chance.<eos> I've got you where I want you.
And you're basing all this on a code name?<eos> On a whispered voice on the telephone?<eos> Come on, Mycroft.<eos> You were the conduit for AGRA.<eos> Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
Yeah, OK, you win.<eos> 'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.<eos> 'Please make your way to the exit.<eos> Thank you.'<eos> Your office said I'd find you here.
There's no way out.<eos> So it would seem.<eos> You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> Maybe I can still surprise you.
'You've been having dreams.<eos> A recurring dream? '<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> This is a two-way relationship, you know.<eos> The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Harry Truman didn't think so when he funded Monarch in 1946.<eos> In terms of sheer waste,<eos> Monarch ranks right up there with the search for alien life.<eos> Yeah, but those guys are nuts.<eos> We should have shut you down years ago.
So whatever's there, you want us to find it first.<eos> Right?<eos> I don't believe I'm saying this, but that almost made sense.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, I will get the piggyback for you. I will.
Go have some fun.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Tip-top.<eos> Colonel Packard!<eos> There's a phone call for you.
An uncharted island?<eos> Let me list all the ways you're gonna die.<eos> Rain, heat, mud, disease carrying flies and mosquitos.<eos> Sure, you could load up on the atabrine for the malaria, but what about the other bacteria?<eos> We haven't even started on the things that want to eat you alive.
Who or what am I tracking?<eos> This is all the information that we have.<eos> Okay? There is no map.<eos> Only satellite images.<eos> So we need someone like you, with your skill, your unique expertise in uncharted jungle terrain, to lead us on our ground expedition.
Isn't shooting a mapping mission a step down for a photojournalist?<eos> The right photo can help shape opinions.<eos> And win you a Pulitzer.<eos> Okay, Captain Conrad.<eos> What about you?
There's no tactical precedence.<eos> We did the best we could in the situation.<eos> Griffin Co.!<eos> Thank God you guys are okay!<eos> - Good to see you, sir.
I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> I was worried about you.
They never smile.<eos> Did you crash here?<eos> Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.
Why?<eos> 'Cause it sounds neat.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I just made that name up.<eos> I'm trying to scare you.
Ah, truth is, I don't expect them to be waiting.<eos> I'd be fine either way.<eos> I just want one last chance to see them.<eos> That'd be good enough for me.<eos> We're gonna get you home.
- I wish I had been.<eos> - What's your count?<eos> - What you see is what I got.<eos> We lost one, too.<eos> Good to see you, fellas!
But if we reach that position and he's not there, we don't send out a search party.<eos> We're back here by nightfall, understood?<eos> In 24 hours, we have to be on the other side of this island.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Hear you loud and clear.
Whose side are you on, Captain?<eos> Okay, Colonel.<eos> You'll find your Sea Stallion three klicks up that ridge.<eos> Now, I'm gonna take these civilians back to the boat.<eos> And we'll wait for you there.
Arm two.<eos> Arm three.<eos> Packard!<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I asked you fellas nice the first time.
Interferes with...<eos> -The memory.<eos> -The memory.<eos> Yes.<eos> I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.
But you, I think, might have a need to forget.<eos> By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world you will not remember any of what you've heard.<eos> -Ignorance is bliss.<eos> -What's wrong with bliss?<eos> Some of you know each other and some of you don't.

Faith?<eos> Faith!<eos> SHERLOCK: You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him, that he'd rather have anyone but you.
-Mrs Hudson.<eos> Do you have any idea what speed you were going at?<eos> Of course, not.<eos> I was on the phone.<eos> -Oh, it's for you, by the way.
"On!<eos> On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers, from war-proof!<eos> "And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us<eos> "Here the mettle of your pasture!<eos> "I doubt not, for there is none of you here so mean and base "that hath not noble luster in your eyes!
Oh, Sherlock.<eos> Oh, Sherlock.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Thanks to you, we're, uh, we're everywhere.<eos> Mr Holmes, how did Culverton talk you into this?
What would happen then?<eos> All that power, all that money, sweet little government, dancing attendants.<eos> A whole country, just to keep her warm and fat.<eos> We all love the Queen, don't we?<eos> And I bet she'd love you lot...
A whole country, just to keep her warm and fat.<eos> We all love the Queen, don't we?<eos> And I bet she'd love you lot...<eos> It's all right, everyone.<eos> I can personally assure you that Sherlock Holmes is not about to arrest the Queen.
Yeah, it was mine from a long time ago.<eos> -(PHONE RINGING) -(CLEARS THROAT) Hello?<eos> Ward 73.<eos> Oh, uh, Dr Watson...<eos> It's for you.
You're so funny, you are!<eos> Mrs Hudson?<eos> He thinks you're clever.<eos> Poor old Sherlock.<eos> Always going on about you.
But then...<eos> You have such nice eyes.<eos> Amazing, the times a man doesn't really look at your face.<eos> Oh, you can hide behind a sexy smile or a walking cane.<eos> Or just be a therapist, talking about you.
You are off course.<eos> Are you receiving?<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray, you are off course.<eos> Are you receiving?<eos> Yeah, receiving you.
Sir.<eos> I'm sparing your blushes because we're supposed to be on the same side, and frankly, this is embarrassing.<eos> Doing a cavity search?<eos> The true art of disguise, according to your famous friend, is not being looked at.<eos> But I am looking at you, aren't I, Mr Holmes?
Smiling is advertising.<eos> Enslaved them.<eos> She's been capable of that since she was five.<eos> She's an adult now.<eos> I warned you.
One question.<eos> That's your voice, isn't it?<eos> Do you trust her?<eos> You've got to stop saying these things.<eos> If Eurus has enslaved you, then who exactly is in charge of this prisoner?
Be quick.<eos> Tick, tick, tick.<eos> Tick, tick, tick.<eos> This is very good, Dr Watson.<eos> I should have fitted you with a cardiograph.
There's only one bullet left. You will only need one.<eos> But you will need it.<eos> Please...<eos> Go through.<eos> There's a few tasks for you and a girl on a plane who's getting very, very scared.
We have more to worry about than her choice of colour scheme.<eos> Barely dry.<eos> Recent.<eos> That's for our benefit.<eos> As a motivator to your continued cooperation, I'm now reconnecting you.
Did you run out of ideas?<eos> It's not empty, Sherlock.<eos> You've still got the gun, haven't you?<eos> I told you you'd need it, because only two can play the next game.<eos> Just two of you go on from here.
What do we do now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think you better get 'round here.<eos> P.S.<eos> I know you two.
Wake up, little halflings!<eos> It's 7:00 a.m.<eos> Wake up, little halflings!<eos> Morning, Wizzie!<eos> What great adventure lies in wait for you today?
Hurry now!<eos> Move!<eos> We don't wanna miss our flight!<eos> No!<eos> I warned you!
We're fine.<eos> You saved us.<eos> You're our hero.<eos> And a great big brother.<eos> We love you both so much.
I understand she is your sister.<eos> She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.<eos> Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.<eos> Do with her as you please.<eos> We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
My mother is from Earth.<eos> And your father?<eos> He ain't from Missouri.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you. An unorthodox genealogy.
Yes!<eos> Look at this!<eos> Where is the other half of our ship?<eos> My ship.<eos> Either one of you could have gotten us through that field... had you flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs!
You son of a...<eos> Hey!<eos> - I've had it with you!<eos> - No!<eos> Back up! Someone followed you through the jump point.
There's too many of them.<eos> He needs my help.<eos> If you care about him... you need to get me out of these bonds.<eos> They are going to kill him!<eos> I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.<eos> I put a tracer on your ship back there... during the war over Xandar.<eos> Give me your word you won't hurt Groot... and I'll tell you where the batteries are.<eos> Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.<eos> Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!<eos> The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.<eos> That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!
That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm the one what sticks up for you!
I help him sleep.<eos> What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Your quarters are this way.<eos> We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.
You really need to grow up.<eos> I wanted to do this together... but I suppose you'll have to learn by spending the next thousand years as a battery!<eos> Finally!<eos> Rocket?<eos> Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.
Welcome.<eos> Hard climb?<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Here, have some water.<eos> I thought a bunch of you were coming.
Nice to meet you.<eos> We're not terrorists!<eos> What?<eos> We don't like violence!<eos> We don't want to hurt you!
Here is Alfonso!<eos> Where is he?<eos> I got a special treat for Lucy's star super pig.<eos> Chop, chop!<eos> Let me introduce you to someone.
Oh, Johnny.<eos> You're skating on thin ice.<eos> Watch out you don't fall in and drown.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm not here to put you to sleep with some corporate speech like my boring sister might have.
He says his name is Wally Brando.<eos> Wally?<eos> Wally's here?<eos> Their son.<eos> He said he wants to pay his respects to you, Sheriff Truman.
It's Wally.<eos> We're so excited.<eos> He came in unannounced.<eos> Good to see you again, Wally.<eos> It's good to see you, too, Sheriff Truman.
What's lurking in that... That toaster waffle, those muffins that frozen children's treat?<eos> Poison!<eos> Deadly poisons.<eos> That's what's there.<eos> And what's waiting for you?
But if it's real, we have to alert the FBI.<eos> I'm booking the flight.<eos> First class, Cindy.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I have to ask you to stop smoking.
I told you to be on your way half an hour ago, sir.
How's Linda?<eos> She's doing a lot better.<eos> Got the government agencies to finally get one of them electric wheelchairs.<eos> Fuckin' war.<eos> So the government's taking care of you?
How is school, Miriam?<eos> The kids this year are so cute.<eos> Okay, here you go.<eos> Keep the change.<eos> The tip is for you all.
All right.<eos> You want Chantal to mess with him before I come?<eos> He'll sing for me.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Then I got a doubleheader for you in Vegas.
♪ - Who never skips leg day? ♪ ♪<eos> - Batman! ♪<eos> ♪ Who always pays their taxes? ♪<eos> ♪ Not Batman ♪<eos> How is he beating all of you again?
Bruce, any advice for the new commissioner?<eos> Long as he knows how to push the button for the Bat-Signal, he'll be fine.<eos> Bruce, I don't know how you did it.<eos> You can't prove it, you didn't do it.<eos> Mr. Wayne, so great to see you!
No way!<eos> Bruce Wayne!<eos> He's the greatest orphan of all time.<eos> ♪ Shamon, Shamon ♪<eos> - Nice to see you, Mr. Ambassador.
Boom.<eos> Keep it.<eos> Whoa! Thanks, Mr. Wayne.<eos> Call me Bruce, champ.<eos> I'm just so jazzed to meet you, sir.
My name's Richard Grayson, but all the kids at the orphanage call me Dick.<eos> - Well, children can be cruel.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great to see you, Bruce.<eos> - Nice to see you, sir.
- En garde.<eos> Hello, family photos.<eos> He lost his parents at a very young age.<eos> I've always wanted one of those.<eos> Doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?
- You're boring.<eos> - He looks delicious.<eos> Let's eat this guy.<eos> Stop with the violence for just a second!<eos> What if I told you I could get you outta here?
- Yes!<eos> - And don't call me Dad.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.<eos> But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?
Whoo! I did it!<eos> I don't even know why you bothered coming back.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> What?<eos> The reason I came back was the same reason I left you.
Oh, hey, come on.<eos> I promise, I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I know you're not.<eos> I'm texting my driver right now, which means he's going to be pulling around the corner any second and if you're still with me when he gets here,<eos> I'm gonna ask him to detain you, because he's not just my driver, he's also my guard.
Thanks.<eos> You're the security guard from Rand.<eos> Why are you...<eos> Go.<eos> Who sent you?
You're the security guard from Rand.<eos> Why are you...<eos> Go.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Who sent you?
You move about as fast as a pig... swimming in gravy.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'll just end up crying.<eos> guys.<eos> These exercises are about trying to teach you so... do better.
If you sign these... then...<eos> I will leave you this.<eos> 000?<eos> - You could do a lot with that.<eos> This must be very important to you.
We are still insisting on the full rights guaranteed as the sole heir of Rand, which includes a controlling 51%, board seat and compensation, but we are now adding a corner office, support staff, and a housing allowance in the amount of one million per year.<eos> Your sense of humor has always been your best attribute, but come on.<eos> You can't even prove he's who he says he is.<eos> At best he's crazy, at worst he's a con man.<eos> Take the offer and be thankful that we don't sue you.
That is immaterial.<eos> You know that it will hold up in court.<eos> It proves Danny's identity, and that is all we need.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will bury you in motions and delays, discovery and depositions, and he will not see a dime for at least ten years, maybe longer.
I don't want any trouble.<eos> Then you should not come looking for it.<eos> He's the one.<eos> Eh?<eos> This one bested all of you?
She's lucky she has such a talented bodyguard.<eos> She's fine now.<eos> Could this good and faithful servant ask for one more favor?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Which one of you hit Joy Meachum?
I don't want a hospital.<eos> - Mr. Radovan...<eos> - I... I want my daughter.<eos> Danny's taking care of that.<eos> Right now, we need to take care of you.
Hey.<eos> You're late.<eos> Sorry, everyone.<eos> I, uh... had a problem with the elevator.<eos> I know some of you aren't happy with me.
You already went to the press?<eos> She seems to think it's gonna make front page tomorrow.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know this isn't what you wanted.<eos> Any of you.
I'll give you that.<eos> But the Hand is legion.<eos> Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.
Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.<eos> You don't know me... but the Hand does.<eos> And they fear me.<eos> With you and your men by our side... they'll fear you, too.
Well, there is no rest of your life if she kills you.<eos> I've seen someone else take on the Hand.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I've already made up my mind.<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you both into my fight, but, hopefully, this trip will end the Hand's story in all of our lives.
I just...<eos> - I lost.<eos> I...<eos> - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.<eos> It would be my privilege to teach you.
- Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.<eos> It would be my privilege to teach you.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I just want to know what happened between you and my father.<eos> Is that what's driven you to this state?
I need your help.<eos> Oh, I don't know about that.<eos> I really like my job, Mr. Rand.<eos> I need this job.<eos> I'm sorry to put you in this position, but it's really important.
- Mr. Meachum, you didn't...<eos> - Oh, please... call me Harold.<eos> Now, I think...<eos> I think I'm gonna have this organic cornflakes one.<eos> In all the time I've worked for you, I don't think I've ever seen you eat any dairy or sugar.
So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.<eos> That's how he works.<eos> Then what do you suggest we do?<eos> You just let me out of here.<eos> I will take you to him.
But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.<eos> You were so thin... and fragile.<eos> You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.<eos> And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.
And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.<eos> So peaceful.<eos> And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.
And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.
Death?<eos> It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time...<eos> This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you.
- I don't know that I do, either.<eos> - Claire, please.<eos> They killed friends of mine and you knew that.<eos> And that is why I couldn't tell you.<eos> Either of you.
- No.<eos> Come, sit over here.<eos> You weren't really gonna have Dad killed, right?<eos> You poor people are such a mess.<eos> I know a good family therapist that could help, should any of you survive the night.
Danny said he's coming.<eos> He will.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Two minutes to go.<eos> Maybe Danny's figured, with all of you out of the way, he'll be in charge of Rand.
A client needs you.<eos> $5 will get you exactly two seconds of my time.<eos> Please, take it.<eos> "J-Money."<eos> I can take you to him.
I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> Colleen Wing.<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> Another fugitive from the law.<eos> The DEA considers both of you armed and dangerous.
I don't know.<eos> There's so much I don't know.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Gao?<eos> They left you here?
I need information.<eos> Why should I tell you anything?<eos> Because if you don't, I'll cut off your head and feed it to the rats.<eos> That does not sound pleasant.<eos> I need access to everything that was on the tablet I took from you.
I didn't even know it was murder until after I left.<eos> You were only ten years old, but you were smart enough to know that airplanes don't drop from the sky for no reason.<eos> We're wasting our time here.<eos> Danny.<eos> If what you're saying is true... then why haven't I killed you already?
- I don't know.<eos> Those who walk through that door are never heard from again.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's hope your minions find you before you rot.
Any news from Joy?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Danny, Ward.<eos> I was told I'd find you here.
About fucking time.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> This is Spartan Tree Tree.<eos> Are you there, over?<eos> - Reading you, Lima Charlie.
Spartan 33 confirmed.<eos> Name and rank?<eos> - Sar'nt A...<eos> - Sergeant Allen B. Isaac.<eos> - Good to hear you again, Sar'nt.
Helo Bulldog 1-7, Helo Bulldog 3-5.<eos> This is Baghdad command. How copy?<eos> Bulldog 1-7, how copy?<eos> This is Bulldog 1-7.<eos> Reading you, Lima Charlie. Over.
$11 million!<eos> Thank you, Mr. Murdock.<eos> - Oh, my pleasure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm so happy for you.
Together.<eos> What do they want in New York?<eos> You'll need to disrobe.<eos> Jewelry and all.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.
the place to go is on 188th Street.<eos> Rathole called Trouble and a Pair of Dice.<eos> I'm told your donation to the Philharmonic should just about cover the remodeling.<eos> A small price to pay in the larger scheme of things.<eos> You know, with the kind of support you've provided, we would love to host you at our next gala.
I know damn well what is happening here.<eos> I know too much.<eos> And next, they'll come after my family.<eos> Who's they?<eos> Who do you think is after you?
Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.<eos> - This sounds insane.<eos> - And so does being bulletproof.<eos> The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.<eos> Now, we're gonna leave you two alone, and you're gonna talk.
He can't admit when he's done something wrong.<eos> You can't admit when you done something right.<eos> Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.<eos> They're lotto tickets.<eos> He said he wanted you to know he was thinking about you.
And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor.<eos> And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.
- Let's talk about it never.<eos> Unless you wanna tell me how a blind man moves the way you do.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I have pictures, asshole.<eos> Rand Enterprises has put together a case to take you down.
- Does it look like we're hiding?<eos> - Behind Midland Circle Financial.<eos> Behind corporate shells, or street-level criminals who don't know who they're working for.<eos> It's what you do.<eos> But I'm here to expose you.
Thank you so much for coming.<eos> - Good to see you again.
Whoa! She is very strong.<eos> Sir, this is for your protection.<eos> We need this place to look closed.<eos> It is closed!<eos> We have no intention of hurting you.
Where is she?<eos> Safer than we are.<eos> Small mistakes.<eos> Personal ties.<eos> These are what they'll use to end you.
Hey, Stick, you and I need to talk.<eos> Anything you gotta say, you say in front of us.<eos> - This is between me and him.<eos> - Hey, we are all in danger.<eos> I don't know you very well, Mr. Cage, you seem like a good guy, so trust me when I tell you that with this old man, nothing is sacred.
Oh, them maybe.<eos> Not you.<eos> My organization has always had a great deal of respect for the protector of K'un-Lun.<eos> Your respect means nothing to me.<eos> My only purpose is to take you down.
It means he won't crack.<eos> Not by force.<eos> You know nothing of the power of the Hand.<eos> You are mice who fell into a well.<eos> Believe me, this will drown you.
What's wrong?<eos> Have I gotten in your head the same way he did long ago?<eos> What about the ones you still love?<eos> What will become of them once you are gone?<eos> - Who else must die because of you?
If I didn't know any better, I'd think he's trying to tell us something.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right, listen up, everybody.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here, but it seems that you are all of interest to some pretty powerful and dangerous people.<eos> Now, to protect you, I need your cooperation.
We'll have more answers soon.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> Colleen Wing?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I'm told my uniforms confiscated something unusual from you.
They want me on the sidelines 'cause I'm the only one who can destroy them.<eos> Jess?<eos> How do you suggest we hide him?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll go back to doing this without you if I have to.
I don't think I have to answer to you.<eos> But considering the events of the last few hours, I thought it best to keep her isolated.<eos> Because you think we will kill her?<eos> No.<eos> I think she might kill you if she even senses your disloyalty.
What, do you want me to describe how it sounded, Detective?<eos> Perhaps you didn't hear me when I said, "Cut the shit."<eos> Now I hear they took Danny Rand.<eos> A person with that high of a profile?<eos> If this falls back on you... it's gonna make your life miserable.
Because from now on, nothing will stand in my way.<eos> Not even death.<eos> - You guys okay?<eos> - I'll live.<eos> I don't suppose either of you snuck a flask in here.
Just a word.<eos> In private.<eos> I would like to explain to them how best to cooperate in building your case.<eos> Well, I hope they like what you have to say.<eos> Otherwise, and I warn you, I'm putting you in a room with two super-powered people.
We've been raised to fight someone else's war.<eos> But you and I, we're the same.<eos> All we want to decide is our own futures.<eos> You sound like your master, Alexandra.<eos> But neither of you know what I want.
We're gonna take care of you, okay?<eos> You guys need to get to the surface.<eos> - No complaints here.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - No, I'm gonna meet you up there.
- Okay. Here we go.<eos> Bye, Dada.<eos> Bye.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> It was sure nice getting to know you all.
Now he's free of the marker, what do you think he'll do?<eos> He had a glimpse of the other side, and he embraced it.<eos> But you, Signor D'Antonio... took it away from him.<eos> He was already back.<eos> Oh, he came back for love, not for you.
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.<eos> He owed me.<eos> I had every right.<eos> And now, he's coming again.<eos> He did tell you not to do this.
He owed me.<eos> I had every right.<eos> And now, he's coming again.<eos> He did tell you not to do this.<eos> He did warn you.
Actually, no. You know what? On second thought, no.<eos> You don't get the sunglasses.<eos> - You need to be taught a lesson. - I think that she gets...<eos> I really appreciate everything that you do.<eos> Real police officer to security guard, honestly, I want to thank you for everything. - Thanks.
The girl that was just...<eos> Please take it.<eos> So you never forget me.<eos> See, an artist takes whatever he wants when somebody's looking right at him.<eos> What is wrong with you? Why are you...?
♪ Go for it ♪ ♪ Go for it ♪ ♪ Go ♪<eos> ♪ Go for it, go for it, go. ♪ Go for it, go for it.<eos> Well, somebody's chipper this morning.<eos> Oh... you guys were there all this time?<eos> I didn't see you.
The group released another video today.<eos> _ _<eos> _ _<eos> Preliminary investigations have revealed that Wolf Cola may in fact be an American soda company, although how and why Boko Haram has adopted it as their official soft drink is unknown at this time.<eos> We'll keep you updated on this story as it develops.
Oh, well, thank you for having us, Chet.<eos> We at Wolf Cola were as shocked and saddened by this news as everyone else.<eos> Uh, this by no means reflects our ideals as a premium soda company.<eos> We're a family-run business, and we really care about people's concerns.<eos> Listen, the point is, we have heard you all, and we are working tirelessly to remedy this situation.
Want to hear more about it? The sci...<eos> Aah!<eos> No nerds!<eos> Fight Milk!<eos> Finally there's a crow-based protein alcoholic drink for you.
So you start to puke everything out, and then you'll be fine for the weigh-in.<eos> You're gonna be puking on your dick in no time. Yeah, yeah, that one's real nasty.<eos> Don't worry about it. - Yeah.<eos> - You're gonna make weight at the weigh-in.<eos> Yeah, all I know is, we don't make weight, I'm killing you both.
The very foundation upon which this group rests, eh?<eos> - And that hope belongs to me.<eos> It belongs to me, you son of a bitch!<eos> Please, stop.<eos> Each of you will have an opportunity to plead your case.
I call it the Ass Pounder 4000. - And it works like this.<eos> - Uh, no...<eos> Imagine you're riding up a steep hill, and you've already been working super hard, and you're sweating and you're tired.<eos> What do you do when you're tired? You want to rest.<eos> You go to sit down, it pushes you right back up in your workout.
It was a goof.<eos> You guys were supposed to give valentine's cards to each other, but instead you were just sticking hate mail in a suggestion box covered in hearts.<eos> I'll give it to you, though... it got a little nasty at the end.<eos> A-A little bit nasty?<eos> One of you put anthrax in the box.
- Okay. Valentine's Day is an entire day dedicated to feelings,<eos> - something that Dennis doesn't have.<eos> - Right, that's true.<eos> And so that's why he hates Valentine's Day so much.<eos> But he's entrusted me, because I'm a gay man - and clearly more sensitive than the rest of you, - Well, no,
Well, you don't go down in negotiation. - You go up.<eos> - With Cricket, you do.<eos> Well, now it's $2.50, Crick, so you want the job or not?<eos> - You know, ticktock.<eos> - Uh, look, guys, um, I got a new life, so I don't need anything from you. - Ugh.
Mr. Sanderson! Mr. Sanderson!<eos> Matthew Mara.<eos> Did you just do a flip off that truck? Yes, sir.<eos> That is how dedicated I am to keeping your business.<eos> Now, look, I know you have your reservations, but I'm asking you... give us a second chance.
What changed your mind, Tom?<eos> Uh, your son here made a compelling argument.<eos> What?<eos> Oh. Well, see, he's my boy.<eos> We will not let you down, - Mr. Sanderson. - Uh, D-Davy,
I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> Anna!<eos> I've been hearing a lot of good things about you. Oh.
Hello?<eos> Christian?<eos> - Oh, Oh my God!<eos> - Excuse me Miss Steele.<eos> - I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm fine, Elena, thank you.<eos> Anna, let me introduce to you my good friend Elena Lincoln.<eos> - We met at the masquerade.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Nice to see you again.
Come with me.<eos> There is something I need to show you.<eos> Last time we came down here. I was over your shoulder.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> After you.
I'm a detective with Wessex Police.<eos> You called about an attack.<eos> A sexual attack.<eos> OK.<eos> We'd like to take you somewhere we can talk.
I'm a crisis worker here at the SARC.<eos> This is a dedicated Sexual Assault Referral Centre.<eos> I'm going to be with you all the time you're here, to make sure you understand everything that's happening.<eos> If you're feeling unsafe or uncomfortable, in any way, we will stop.<eos> Everyone will be led by you.
How's it going?<eos> Have you got Fred to bed OK?<eos> Could you er... pick up a loaf on your way home?<eos> OK.<eos> Look, kiss those boys for me and I'll try not to wake you if I'm late back, OK.
We don't know it was, until we get more information.<eos> We can't know if she knew her attacker or not.<eos> I'm not saying it is, I'm asking when the last one was.<eos> Well, not in my career.<eos> I'm going to refer you on to Wessex Rape Response.
I'm going to refer you on to Wessex Rape Response.<eos> They'll allocate an Independent Sexual Violence Advisor who should be in touch within 24 hours.<eos> Karen can prescribe the morning after pill, if you think that might be appropriate.<eos> We'll also make you a sexual health clinic appointment.<eos> I'm going to hand you back to the police now, Trish.
Karen can prescribe the morning after pill, if you think that might be appropriate.<eos> We'll also make you a sexual health clinic appointment.<eos> I'm going to hand you back to the police now, Trish.<eos> I just need you to know there's a lot of support for what you're going through.<eos> There are people who will look after you, help you and guide you.

Don't be afraid to use it.<eos> And you can call me any time.<eos> How am I gonna tell my daughter?<eos> Look, try not to think of that for now.<eos> OK, we're gonna take all this one step at a time and there'll be plenty of us around to support you.
- She doesn't live too far so...<eos> - Well, that's not good.<eos> A woman nearby got attacked?<eos> You know I'm not supposed to talk about it.<eos> If a woman round here has been attacked, I don't want either of you anywhere alone after dark.
Mind if I sit in?<eos> Not at all!<eos> Okay, class.<eos> I have a treat for you.<eos> I would like to introduce you to our principal, Mrs. Davis.
You've uprooted that little girl and brought her here for one reason only.<eos> To do harm to your mother.<eos> You blamed her for your sister.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And Mary to you is just a pawn in all this.
I know what you can and will succeed...<eos> It is what you're put on this earth to do.<eos> Something, it come to me last night.<eos> A different type of gas.<eos> For you.
I go where he tells me to go and I do what he tells me to do.<eos> Where I am from, that's called slavery.<eos> I really like her.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Ladies after you.
Yep, that's not gonna work.<eos> Please put the sword down, Diana.<eos> Diana!<eos> Let me try by myself.<eos> After you, sir.
Diana!<eos> Let me try by myself.<eos> After you, sir.<eos> Etta...<eos> Why don't I meet you back at the office?
And I need a immediate audience with the generals.<eos> You do not just barge in here.<eos> Sir with all due respect.. What I saw in my ^^ will change the course of war.<eos> Captain Trevor!<eos> I heard we lost you in one of your mission and here you are, back from the dead and I see you brought a friend.
There are shortages of food meds and ammunition.<eos> Every hour we delay costs thousands of German lives.<eos> One attack and the world could be ours.<eos> As we speak, my chemistry...<eos> We stand against you and your witch.
We stand against you and your witch.<eos> Ludendorff, enough!<eos> 24 hours from now this war will end.<eos> It is over.<eos> It's over for you.
Ludendorff, enough!<eos> 24 hours from now this war will end.<eos> It is over.<eos> It's over for you.<eos> It is over for all of you..
Go!<eos> Stay very very still, for me my friends.<eos> Please. It's so important.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> This has been such an honor for me taking you photograph.
- Get away from me!<eos> I understand everything now.<eos> It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted.<eos> It's you too.<eos> All of you.
Tower,thisis DH6-1-6,do youcopy?<eos> AX 1-1-2, descend and maintain flight level 6-0.<eos> Descend to 6,000 feet, do you copy?<eos> AX1-12, descending to 6,000 feet.<eos> Tower,we'venot heard confirmation from you, but we're gonna go ahead and descend to 6,000 feet.
But my... my wife's here.<eos> My... my family.<eos> I can't just..<eos> We can't just up and move, you know?<eos> This may potentially be the safest thing to do for you and your family.
Yeah, I think I do.<eos> Sounds like you're not getting any fuel. Yeah?<eos> Probably the shut-off solenoid.<eos> Let's see if we can get some power to it.<eos> What brings you to Cuba?
Let's see if we can get some power to it.<eos> What brings you to Cuba?<eos> The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.<eos> Culture, people, the beauty.<eos> What brings you to Cuba?
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they got.<eos> So we wanna engage with maximum speed.<eos> Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.<eos> There's two things I want you to keep in mind.<eos> Number one, I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?<eos> It's my new junior associate.<eos> He's working with me on this.<eos> All yours.<eos> Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
Right?<eos> Hey, Mrs. Parker...<eos> Hey.<eos> Letty.<eos> I wanted to thank you.
I wanna introduce you to the most important person in my universe.<eos> One who never gave up on me.<eos> He's beautiful.<eos> You've heard me say that you never turn your back on family,<eos> and I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
Mr. Thoyt, welcome.<eos> Give us the bad news.<eos> As the late Mr. Delaney's lawyer, I attended the funeral, and a ghost appeared... a son we all thought dead in Africa.<eos> James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Mr. Wilton, I asked you to do some digging.
Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.<eos> And you will hang. For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg?<eos> I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.
Not tea, brandy.<eos> Two glasses.<eos> Sir?<eos> Fetch two glasses.<eos> They should have invited you.
For the safe.<eos> You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination?<eos> On direct instruction of James Delaney himself, sir.<eos> We have Delaney, we have Nootka, we have the China trade.<eos> They will walk you along a tightrope.
Well, you go and bring the doctor, then.<eos> And we can all pray to God that we haven't completely fried his brain.<eos> Hold up!<eos> Out! The rest of you, out now!<eos> These gentlemen are actually here to rescue you.
13.<eos> Why would she keep you and not rent you?<eos> Too ugly.<eos> She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.
I would rather that you worked with me rather than against me.<eos> Work at what?<eos> Necessary evil.<eos> And whorehouses are full of secrets, and secrets, to me, are weapons.<eos> I would very much like to talk business... but I would like you inside of me, Mr Delaney.
Holy Christ!<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> I made a fire in your room for the mice.<eos> In Parliament today, they'll be debating the beating of servants.<eos> The Whigs want to protect you.
I'm off-duty.<eos> I have a wound in my left shoulder.<eos> A bullet wound?<eos> A splinter... from the mast of a ship called the Yankee Prize... that was struck by a Yankee ball.<eos> So I should call you comrade?
This is my pastime - fixing colours in cloth.<eos> The demand for flags is always high in times of war.<eos> So you are three things, yes?<eos> You are a doctor... you are a merchant... and you are a spy.<eos> Unless you tell me who sent you, I will have to ask you to leave at the point of a gun.
The son does not inherit the debts of the father.<eos> James Delaney has declared a new trading company in his own name.<eos> And my father's debts amounted to a sum total of £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Behold, £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Mr Thoyt will pay each one of you exactly what you are due, but you will form an orderly line.
I can wait.<eos> But Mr Delaney's son knew nothing of any marriage.<eos> How would he?<eos> He was in Africa.<eos> But he often spoke of you.
You will hold out.<eos> Look at me.<eos> These men are from the Crown.<eos> I will warn the East India<eos> - and they will free you.
You said I'm a weakness.<eos> I wasn't weak.<eos> I will fix that.<eos> I'll get Brace to fix that.<eos> In the cell, I called you "James".
In the cell, I called you "James".<eos> I think that surprised them most.<eos> Certainly surprised me.<eos> If your intervention had been ten minutes later, I would have been raped.<eos> But the consequence for you was worth the risk to me, yes?
To teach me a lesson?<eos> No.<eos> That was to teach the King a lesson.<eos> And the Company.<eos> But if you're absolutely resolute on staying... then I may agree to incorporate you into the organisation.
By the way, I found your red roses in the mud when I threw out the oyster shells.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Who the hell's what?<eos> Brace, do not believe that I will not know when you reseal my letters.<eos> Countess Musgrove is, let me think, sir... 1,550 places above you in the social hierarchy of London.
Come on.<eos> Posy for the lady?<eos> Much obliged, kind sir.<eos> For you.<eos> There's other business afoot tonight, none of which concerns you.
I've only not known James a little while.<eos> But I have the feeling you've not known him a little longer.<eos> We were children...<eos> Thank you.<eos> If I were to have intentions regarding James, would I need to be wary of you?
As a rule, I do this trick with a beautiful woman... Ooh! And a chimpanzee.<eos> In the absence of a chimpanzee, a gorilla will have to do.<eos> Please, madam, please, sir, take a deep breath... and step into the beyond.<eos> One wonders if they will ever be seen again!<eos> I did my research on you.
A monopoly.<eos> Fanciful, of course.<eos> I want to meet with the Embassy in Paris.<eos> No.<eos> You assign to the United States, where someone will kill you.
The Gypsy woman owns this island between two parishes.<eos> It is tradition she offers duellists a little token of good luck.<eos> Three shillings each for heather and goose feathers.<eos> This is not a fairground.<eos> Gentlemen, a slight has been perceived and one of you seeks satisfaction.
And, when they come, let them in.<eos> You can open every door.<eos> We have nothing here to hide.<eos> You will hang.<eos> They will catch you and hang you.
Your apprentice.<eos> Lick.<eos> Lick your finger.<eos> Now, gentlemen, before I go on the subject of confidence... and betrayal, I hear that the Company are offering £10 for any information.<eos> I also know that one of you has already considered collecting.
£2 for broken doors and smashed windows.<eos> Damn soldiers!<eos> You owe me Delaney!<eos> They have reports that say that some of the robbers were women.<eos> But only the Company are aggrieved, so no-one can take you to the clink or to the poultry tower.
Be careful.<eos> Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What?<eos> What do you see?<eos> He's just scared of you.
For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.
Zilpha.<eos> My love. My love.<eos> This is a holy man of God.<eos> He's practised in removing and discouraging demons.<eos> Your husband reports a Barbason has been visiting you.
Careful not to wake the dead... as they reach their final resting place.<eos> I will tell Mr. Madison I have made an extraordinary discovery.<eos> A man in London who can be relied upon.<eos> Yes, you tell him that and I will rely upon him to give my ship safe passage through the American blockade.<eos> If my factory is discovered... I will know where to find you.
Republicans haven't got any money, why would I sell it to them?<eos> They think you're going to start a revolution.<eos> If the Prince genuinely thought I was going to start a revolution, I would be in the Tower.<eos> He's not a safeguard.<eos> If Crown and Company solve their little dispute, they will crush you between them.
Yes.<eos> Come into the house, we'll find you something to eat and somewhere to sleep.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Take into your loving arms this purest flake of snow, my daughter, my light, my love... my Winter.<eos> I thought I might find you here.
I received a message that you wished to speak with me.<eos> After you have eluded me so long.<eos> May I sit?<eos> I need to know why you're seeking me?<eos> First, I must tell you that I already know many things about you.
Now, you can do that, can't you?<eos> Right. Right.<eos> We're good.<eos> Mr. Godfrey has decided he will do the honourable thing.<eos> Your testimony will be with you within the week.
Mr. Delaney...<eos> His Majesty seeks information.<eos> I really have no taste for this, so perhaps we can conduct this business like gentlemen.<eos> They will allow no easy escape... to death.<eos> Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.

My God, look at you.<eos> Well, your plan worked... you in a cell, me on a hook.<eos> I'm here.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have a use for you.
The silver tooth is mine.<eos> Who has a blade for the dentistry?<eos> Relax, Mr. Delaney.<eos> You're in safe hands.<eos> Your devil saved you.
Well, you don't appear to be swaggering now.<eos> I need to speak to Carlsbad himself.<eos> I need him to take a message to Thomas Jefferson and the President of the United States.<eos> In Ponta Delgada, Colonnade told me that he would find me an emissary to Thomas Jefferson.<eos> So just tell me what you want to say to Carlsbad, and I'll stitch you up and set you loose.

Interesting knife they used to carve you up.<eos> Is that Chinese, you think?<eos> Or Malay?<eos> When you came in here with bits of a man's flesh between your teeth... we kind of had a silent deal.<eos> I stitch you up and you give me information.
Is that your lawyer?<eos> My lawyer assures me that, as Horace Delaney's widow, by natural law of the land, this house is therefore half mine.<eos> - It's a copy.<eos> - It's now kindling.<eos> My servant wants to shoot you in the face.
- Mrs. Delaney!<eos> Miss Bow, do you know why there are boards on the windows of this house?<eos> So the fortunate people outside can't see inside of the state of this place, I imagine.<eos> No, because there are wicked men out there who would wish me dead.<eos> However, neither the East India or the King will kill you because of your will.
I was told the details of your situation by a representative of his Majesty The King, George.<eos> And indirectly it was the King who financed the drawing up of that very expensive piece of paper, which you just burnt.<eos> As a rule, the King's council very rarely makes business with an actress unless it's up the back alley of Maiden Lane.<eos> The piece of paper you just burnt also states that, as Horace Delaney's widow,<eos> I also own half the trading post at Nootka Sound and I believe Nootka is of value to you and to the King.
You're as good as a hole in the hull.<eos> I did check the records.<eos> You were aboard a ship that sank off Africa.<eos> A slave ship?<eos> I believe that a man is capable of change... and I also believe that that is of no consequence to you.
It exhausts us both.<eos> A beautiful exhaustion.<eos> And in the morning I read the Gazette and she eats her toast... like a sweet little bird.<eos> I didn't come to sell you insurance, Mr. Delaney.<eos> I came to thank you.
There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.<eos> As of now, you are a weakness.<eos> These fantasies elude me...<eos> If you go outside, they will find you and they will find a use for you.
The price was two sovereigns.<eos> I'm not a courtesan.<eos> But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.
That bitch is on the gallows... before Mass!<eos> Down there.<eos> Perhaps now you will listen to me.<eos> This diamond... this is yours.<eos> I have a man that will take you to Paris and you will stay there until this business is done.
- That insurance fuck.<eos> It's after midnight.<eos> The bastard.<eos> I could throw a car farther than I'd trust that rat fuck.<eos> Anthony Sinclair here to see you.
Oh... dougie.<eos> Here's to you, dougie.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.
Here's to you, dougie.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.<eos> I've thought of you every day,
These giant multinational corporations are filled with monstrous vermin, poisonous, vile murderers, and they eat, drink, and shit money.<eos> They buy our politicians for a song.<eos> Then these fucking politicians sing as we gag and cough, sold down the river to die.<eos> Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help, elected to work to help to make life better for.<eos> Fuck you all in the ass, you fucking treasonous puppets!
I can't believe what I was about to do.<eos> I have to confess.<eos> I will, Dougie.<eos> Bushnell...<eos> I've been selling you down the river for months and months for Duncan Todd. I've been working for Todd. I...
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh. Dr. Jacoby.<eos> Nadine.<eos> - Is that you?<eos> Can I call you Dr. Amp?
- We'll do it.<eos> - Together.<eos> Wait, so are you two...<eos> About time.<eos> - I have something for you?
I, Ezra, take thee, Aria to have and to hold from this day forward... for better, for worse for richer, for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part.<eos> If anyone can show a just cause why this couple cannot lawfully be joined together in matrimony let them speak now or forever hold their peace.<eos> By the power vested in me I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> I present you for the very first time.
Yeah, um, Jason said that he's got that veteran's program in Philly.<eos> Yeah, if it works out, they should, um get a lot of homeless people off the streets.<eos> Yeah, and Toby is gonna keep climbing into your sheets.<eos> Sorry, are you already honeymoon drunk?<eos> - No! I'm, I'm happy for you.
Guys, I'm leaving for three weeks.<eos> Why is everybody crying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> For some reason, this feels like it's the end of something.<eos> I love you, guys.
More of a challenge!<eos> Yes, you got cuts, Che you yelling!<eos> Fuck you and your alien!<eos> More resist.<eos> Yes they are a hundred times stronger than you!
Yes, later.<eos> Correctly Julia said.<eos> Do not you hear a damn.<eos> You are the king of Moscow, right?<eos> Look at you here.
- Well...<eos> I do not.<eos> - What for?<eos> And you where I'm looking, but with feelings napryazhenka?<eos> The sense of touch and sight is the same as you.
- Do yourself.<eos> Valentine, she's a boy.<eos> I do not think that...<eos> Get away.<eos> How well without you there was something, huh?
Do not you of FIG?<eos> We have a tradition.<eos> Whenever any superior race, trying to destroy humanity, we all begin to smoke, hoof to quickly discard.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> We do not want to destroy you.
Do not worry, we will not last long.<eos> We were looking for.<eos> Change is necessary.<eos> Do not worry.<eos> (Video) - will kill you all one by one.
People.<eos> Curfew.<eos> We need to roll up.<eos> But I want you to know.<eos> Many of you lost loved ones.
Curfew.<eos> We need to roll up.<eos> But I want you to know.<eos> Many of you lost loved ones.<eos> Many of you are eager for revenge...
Citizens.<eos> Stop illegal actions.<eos> Your actions are illegal.<eos> All ahead!<eos> Against you would use force!
After a successful stint running the secretive special operations killing machine in Iraq,<eos> Glen was appointed leader of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.<eos> A war which, as he saw it, wasn't being won 'cause it wasn't being led.<eos> General.<eos> We're all very excited to have you here.
For all his many achievements leading special operations in Iraq, I think most of us here will know General McMahon as the man who took out al-Zarwaqi, who kicked al-Qaeda in the sack.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We have a warrior at the helm, and it's a pleasure to have you, sir.<eos> Glen was known as a humble man.<eos> But humble in that way that says, my humility makes me better than you.
Basically, he was a master of systems organization. Which he'd kind of need to be, if he was to corral this 43-nation coalition of the willing.<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - No, finish your phone call.<eos> The war can wait.<eos> What can I do for you, General?
Sorry.<eos> No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?<eos> I'll quieten this whole situation down.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here.<eos> And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir.
- Got a problem.<eos> I can't hear a word Dick's saying.<eos> He can hear me, but I can't hear him.<eos> - All right, can you hear us now?<eos> - Yeah, I can hear you.
He can hear me, but I can't hear him.<eos> - All right, can you hear us now?<eos> - Yeah, I can hear you.<eos> - What about now, Mr. Dick, sir?<eos> - Yeah, I can hear you!
Then we can jet across to Copenhagen at zero six.<eos> The president's gonna be on the tarmac at 8:30.<eos> Well, you're the keeper of my schedule, Cory.<eos> You tell me if I can do it.<eos> Okay, yeah, we can have you back in Paris early afternoon, depending on how much time you two need. And I can shift your morning meetings.
We're not in theater.<eos> You boys earned it.<eos> Sir, have you had a chance to say hello to your wife yet?<eos> You know, she checked in this morning.<eos> I think she's waiting for you in your room.
- Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry, I've been delayed.<eos> The president is wanting time with me tomorrow, and we've been trying to ascertain whether... whether or not we can accommodate this request.<eos> I'm gonna leave you two be.
How's it going?<eos> - Morning, sir.<eos> Nice to see you again. - All right.<eos> Take care now.<eos> It's good to see you, Mr. President.
Take care now.<eos> It's good to see you, Mr. President.<eos> All right, see you soon.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - It's great to see you, General.
You both look beautiful.<eos> Really.<eos> Sir, before you get dragged into the hubbub there, I want to introduce you to Sean Cullen here.<eos> Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.<eos> He's been doing that profile piece on you.
I appreciate that.<eos> My schedule's very tight.<eos> Of course.<eos> Totally understood.<eos> General, I could introduce you to some people here tonight if you'd prefer.
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.<eos> General.<eos> Sir.<eos> Swell.<eos> I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
And I also have a job to do.<eos> And I am trying to do mine.<eos> As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.<eos> You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.<eos> And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.
Your people.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, sir... but you need to behave like a leader.<eos> But I am behaving like a leader.<eos> I'm unavailable.<eos> I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.
We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.<eos> There will be casualties.<eos> But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!<eos> I have faith in you!
My name is General Glen McMahon.<eos> On behalf of the coalition forces, I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.<eos> I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.<eos> But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.<eos> And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.
Only we can help you.<eos> We have a saying in America.<eos> You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.<eos> I understand that sometimes it can be hard to see the helping hand, what with all the guns and the strange guys and the mess and what have you.<eos> But I assure you, this is the hand of helping.
Or like... you know, like, I see this life and this moment, and it's so wonderful, but it doesn't quite belong to me.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Are you following this?<eos> And, like, I look at you, and you're so beautiful.
Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Are you following this?<eos> And, like, I look at you, and you're so beautiful.<eos> - That's true. - Oh, stop. And I'm not saying that to embarrass you at all, but it is true.
Mm, I missed you. Oh!<eos> Now, where is the Chloe? Chloe?<eos> Of course she's networking.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just want to introduce you to Juliette.
Could she put a shirt on?<eos> Boom.<eos> Our very first project will be for each of you to do a family tree, where you get to talk about your wonderful family.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> But before that, I am going to introduce you to a very, very special friend to our class.
- But kind of great. - Yeah.<eos> So, the sex that you have is like...<eos> Hi, Celeste, Madeline! - How are you?<eos> - Hi, Renata.<eos> I was over there with my girlfriends, getting our drink on, and I saw you two.
Hello?<eos> Anybody here?<eos> Visitors?<eos> I can't believe we have visitors.<eos> Oh, Caleb will be so happy to see you.
I didn't say they disappeared.<eos> I said they left.<eos> Did they leave in a cloud of green smoke?<eos> They just left!<eos> We didn't mean to upset you.
Fight who?<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> They're called the Ghost Riders.<eos> They took everyone from Canaan.<eos> Why did they leave you?
Where's my sister?<eos> Your sister's dead.<eos> She died a long time ago.<eos> You killed her, remember?<eos> I'm gonna kill you, too.
Your sister's dead.<eos> She died a long time ago.<eos> You killed her, remember?<eos> I'm gonna kill you, too.<eos> I'm gonna kill all of you.
You took a risk.<eos> We took a risk.<eos> But it was the right thing to do.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You guys want me to leave you alone?
Now what do we do?<eos> Try and talk to him.<eos> Mr. Ghost Rider?<eos> Mr. Rider?<eos> We'll let you out if you tell us how to get our friends back.
I won't last two minutes in there.<eos> Then think of something else.<eos> Malia's right.<eos> It's all about the connection.<eos> When I was remembering him, I was also remembering the two of you together.
Too much?<eos> I got one.<eos> What's that?<eos> An induction script.<eos> One of you is going to talk me through this.
But I am.<eos> I'm not in the pack.<eos> But no one likes a Nazi.<eos> Your little friends are no match for the Wild Hunt.<eos> There are too many of us and too few of you.
They fought bravely!<eos> And they lost!<eos> If it were not for me,<eos> Emerald City would have fallen like many great cities of Oz!<eos> I will protect you from The Beast Forever, who ravages our land!
And they lost!<eos> If it were not for me,<eos> Emerald City would have fallen like many great cities of Oz!<eos> I will protect you from The Beast Forever, who ravages our land!<eos> I will protect you from the forbidden magic in the woods!
If it were not for me,<eos> Emerald City would have fallen like many great cities of Oz!<eos> I will protect you from The Beast Forever, who ravages our land!<eos> I will protect you from the forbidden magic in the woods!<eos> I will protect you because I am the great and powerful.
- Yes!<eos> Yes, an apothecary.<eos> Where can I find one?<eos> She don't take to visitors.<eos> Look, sir, I'm begging you... please.
But running off like he did is a blood crime,<eos> Mistress-New-Mistress.<eos> Running off is a blood crime.<eos> Understand?<eos> Mistress never spoke of you.
No one deserves that fate.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Captain!<eos> If you let me join your brigade, I'll kill for you.
Only that one is a lie.<eos> Which one is that?<eos> Oz is a land of enchantment.<eos> Magic is its heart.<eos> Yet this enchantment could not save you from The Beast Forever.
Dorothy's reunion with the soldier.<eos> Did it reveal anything new?<eos> You knew it wouldn't.<eos> Yet you let her see him anyway.<eos> What sway does she have over you?
Please!<eos> Daddy!<eos> All of you go back to your homes.<eos> Shut the doors.<eos> Or death will come to all of you.
My Beloved Council...<eos> It was only me!<eos> I alone was Glinda's spy!<eos> The rest are innocent.<eos> Anna loved you.
That's not my name.<eos> I return to our fight against the Wizard.<eos> I seek leniency for Dorothy, a healer who spared my life at Nimbo, among countless other times.<eos> Even...<eos> Even if she was sent by the Wizard to kill you.
Lucas?<eos> That's not my name.<eos> I return to our fight against the Wizaed.<eos> I seek leniency for Dorothy, who spared my life at Nimbo.<eos> Even if she was sent by the Wizaed to kill you.
She asked me to make her weapons.<eos> I refused, so she fired me.<eos> Guns?<eos> A line I refuse to cross.<eos> Even so, she can't release you.
I'll make them.<eos> In certain circles, I was known as the wicked witch of the west.<eos> Yeah, I heard that.<eos> As you once stood united with king pastoria, you now stand with his child, the one true heir to the throne, ozma.<eos> Follow us to emerald city to end the one who imprisoned you:
It proves nothing.<eos> Possessions can be lost.<eos> And found.<eos> This boy is no ozma.<eos> I am a cardinal witch and you will hear my truth or I'll gladly throw you back in prison if you find it more agreeable.
Because we are fair, you will hear the charges against you before you are sentenced.<eos> More than your apostate of a sister did for us.<eos> You and your cardinal sisters are to blame for the end of our kind.<eos> She stands against her sisters.<eos> It was mistress east who locked you in the prison.
She stands against those who truly act again the sisterhood.<eos> So help her to her feet.<eos> The wizard has oppressed the magic that is your birthright...<eos> Its seeds sown into the fabric of this land.<eos> No one can take that away from you.
For whose benefit is that?<eos> I'm told that once mastered, it's actually quite soothing.<eos> At this moment, I'm finding that hard to believe.<eos> But if I am to play the role, I ought to make some effort to look the part.<eos> It bothers me that this does not bother you.
They've been my enemies for some time now. Are you saying that they haven't been yours?<eos> May I suggest...<eos> I thank you for your aid today.<eos> It is, I believe, to be expected, today, tomorrow, every day till the war is won.<eos> I serve you best, my Lord, when I am seen by the street as having some independence from you, as your silent partner, I am able...
It already is.<eos> What did he do?<eos> Set a course for Nassau... to send a message when we return... that this can all end... if the governor turns over the one thing he wants.<eos> When I made the choice to see Charles' sentence carried out, I did not know what the consequences would be.<eos> I knew it was the only way to protect our future here, to protect you, so I did it.

And when the backlash followed, the resentment over my relationship with you, which I knew could only be soothed by my pretending to have no influence at all, I did that, too.<eos> I did all of it, contorted myself into the role, mutilated myself so that it would fit because I believed as long as you believed I was your partner, it didn't matter what anyone else believed.<eos> I've never believed you to be anything less than that.<eos> Good, then can you tell me what the fuck just happened back there?<eos> I am asking her to bear no more sacrifice than you or I or a dozen others.
- Okay.<eos> - Go ahead, yeah.<eos> - On the couch? - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, so what brings you here today?
From the very beginning, like when we first met, I've always... worried that she would just go through me. You know, like that...<eos> What do you mean by that? By "go through you"?<eos> That she would... outgrow me, maybe. Or figure me out or something.<eos> So I've always had this sense that... that, you know, the day would come where she would just... where she would just not love me anymore, and... and I...<eos> Evidence that she doesn't... doesn't love you anymore.
Okay, our first order of business today regards our Annual Fall Gala Fundraiser.<eos> Now, given the unprecedented success of last year's Trivia Night with the theme "Dead Celebrities," we've decided to come back again with yet another costume gala, this year titled.<eos> "Elvis and Audrey Night."<eos> I think it should make for a splendid... - God.<eos> - Evening filled with fun, fashion, frivolity, one which should raise some much-needed funding... and I'm looking at you, Bruce Pedulla... going to the benefit of all our wonderful, wonderful children.
- Am I dreaming right now?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Ziggy.<eos> You were sleepwalking, baby.<eos> What happened between you and my dad?
Seems like something's a little wrong, sweetie.<eos> Are you sure you're not upset about something?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> I promise I will keep it a secret.<eos> How are things with you and Ziggy?
He also brought up his father, who, believe it or not, he thinks might be Darth Vader.<eos> What?<eos> Children often get caught halfway between fantasy and... and reality. And he's only six.<eos> And I asked him if the two of you talk much about his father.<eos> He said it upset you and that you're not saying much about him.
- All right.<eos> Unfortunately, Amabella won't say who's involved.<eos> However, her mother is convinced that Ziggy is responsible.<eos> - But I'm not, nor is Ms. Barnes. - No, I'm not.<eos> Look, if it weren't for the incident on Orientation Day, I never would've called you in unless we had anything more definitive.
Um, maybe.<eos> I mean, I... I don't really remember.<eos> Have you ever sustained bruises from something other than sex?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Your husband said he grabbed you too hard sometimes.
I mean, I... I don't really remember.<eos> Have you ever sustained bruises from something other than sex?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Your husband said he grabbed you too hard sometimes.<eos> Has he ever left a mark on you by grabbing you?
And only you showed up, so I'm treating half the couple.<eos> From what I know about your duty of care, you are ethically responsible...<eos> I throw off the ethical chains when I sense a patient in danger.<eos> What?<eos> He hurts you.
He hurts you.<eos> No. I... no, I didn't...<eos> I mean, I didn't...<eos> I didn't say that. He's...<eos> I pick up on things, not just from you, but from Perry.
I pick up on things, not just from you, but from Perry.<eos> We both become violent sometimes.<eos> I take my share of the blame.<eos> I'm...<eos> He hurts you.
None of this affects them.<eos> We never fight in front of them. They never see anything.<eos> They're fine.<eos> They live in a happy household. They have no idea.<eos> - He will hit you again. - Yeah.
- If they already don't.<eos> All right, our time is about up.<eos> We should make an appointment and come up with a plan.<eos> A plan?<eos> For the next time he hits you.
Please.<eos> Says here you were sentenced to six years for aggravated assault and battery.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Served three and were due to be released on Friday.<eos> Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon.
He takes care of everything, all the bills.<eos> I've just got to get back for his christening, and everything will be all right.<eos> You know what?<eos> He... He'll take care of me.<eos> We're gonna get you in First.
Mama had a big afro, huh?<eos> "Dancing Queen," hmm?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She had the whole kit.<eos> And if I was inclined, what might I call you?
Oh, great.<eos> I slept through first class.<eos> Sorry we had to make an emergency landing.<eos> Can't blame us for the weather.<eos> I can get you on a flight tomorrow that'll get you into Eagle Point by 6.
A pagan ritual, the celebration of the beginning of spring dating back about 12,000 years.<eos> So, when you see children dipping eggs in vinegar the colors of their favorite toys, or when you see the nation's youth fleeing south for copulation, or when they spread their seed over that sinking mass that is the great state of Florida, they all... without realizing it do it in her name.<eos> Ostara.<eos> Hello!<eos> It is a treasure and a treat to welcome you all to my home and on my day, my favorite day of the year.
Which is...<eos> For Christ's sake.<eos> Praise the Lords, please help yourself and those less fortunate to the buffet.<eos> I got plenty of honey ham.<eos> But for those of you that do not partake of pork...
We're a couple of swells.<eos> Have you met my sheep?<eos> Which fucking god?<eos> Me fucking god.<eos> I ran you off the road.
Oh, as am I trying to survive your endless need for attention.<eos> This is about me and my boyfriend.<eos> So he is your boyfriend?<eos> How old is he?<eos> Yes, he is older, but unlike you and Dad, we love each other!
I owe you an apology.<eos> How rude of me to have touched your belongings without asking.<eos> Ah, No, it's cool.<eos> I was just confused.<eos> Well, I can assure you there was no funny business.
Snitch?<eos> - Rat you out.<eos> Tattle tale.<eos> Oh, Don't you worry about that.<eos> I can assure you...
I imagine that I... owe you all an apology.<eos> No, no, no we're just very happy that you're yourself again.<eos> Yes, yes I am.<eos> And I thank God for you for calming me down.<eos> I know that I must have frightened you all quite a bit.
and I start putting pieces together and see this is what I came up with.<eos> They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing them and making them slaves... or sex slaves, not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit.<eos> See I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making them slaves or whatnot... but all I know is they already got two brothers we know and they could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already.<eos> What's the next move?<eos> And don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothing for you.
Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon.
Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon.<eos> Your wife... she died in the early hours of this morning.<eos> Was a... An automobile accident...<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> If I was inclined, what might I call you?
'Cause that's the story of black people in America.<eos> Shit, you all don't know you black yet.<eos> You think you just people.<eos> Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black.<eos> The moment these Dutch motherfuckers set foot here and decided they white, and you get to be black, and that's the nice name they call you...

For old times' sake.<eos> Make dinner first.<eos> - I'd be happy to help.<eos> - I murder you first.<eos> Think your husband might beat you to it.
Said you needed him.<eos> There's always another way.<eos> No, no, no. No.<eos> Food is cooked.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya invited you for dinner, right?
I wore the other day to dinner, remember?<eos> You don't?<eos> Were you that drunk?<eos> Listen, I've got some good stuff. Top class.<eos> Shit no, it's only for you.
I just wanted to charge my phone, I don't come to these places.<eos> What "places" do you mean, honey?<eos> This kind of bar.<eos> Oh, look at you!<eos> This place too lowdown for you?
There's no bomb!<eos> Tell them.<eos> - Do you know him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, I don't. But neither do any of you.
Elena.<eos> - Nacho, right'?<eos> - Nacho, Nacho.<eos> Nice to meet you, Nacho.<eos> What about you?
- It's the facts.<eos> I'm clean.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Go on, call. It's the only phone with a signal.<eos> If you say you didn't touch him, maybe they'll listen to you.
Stop being a dick!<eos> I don't want any olives, chips or Coca-Cola!<eos> - I just want to get out of here!<eos> - What about whisky?<eos> Let's get back down there, I'm begging you.
Everything okay?<eos> My parents want me to think about moving home.<eos> To London?<eos> Toby:<eos> We would like to introduce you to Carlton Summers Kennish.
Good health!<eos> Yeah, I am good, and... and thank you.<eos> Thank you so much. Xie xie.<eos> A million times over.<eos> We could never repay you.
Which company do we want to invest our fictional $10 million in?<eos> My vote is Greenleaf.<eos> With increased demand and global food supply, a super-charged photosynthesis that boosts crop yield, it's win-win.<eos> Well, while you're getting awards from the community for being a good person, I plan to lead a company that actually turns a profit.<eos> Knowing you two, this could go on for 20 minutes.
Um... see you around?<eos> Definitely.<eos> He seems cool.<eos> He's okay.<eos> So, I mean, speaking of boys, what's up with you and Mingo?
Don't tell Vince I was here.<eos> ♪ In the game... ♪ Well, not yet, but his people told me he was looking for a good game, and I run the best game in town, so...<eos> Ah. Don't worry about it.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Next time. No, no, no, no. There's always a place at my tables for you, Mr. Mukherjee.
Look how his story's ending.<eos> Are you threatening to ruin my son's reputation?<eos> Your son's reputation is already ruined.<eos> And his story will no doubt end with a heart attack in prison or a bullet to his head in a winter's field.<eos> No, Mrs. Persikof, I'm talking about you.
And his story will no doubt end with a heart attack in prison or a bullet to his head in a winter's field.<eos> No, Mrs. Persikof, I'm talking about you.<eos> In one version, you convince your son to have us bond his additional bail, and your story goes on as before.<eos> You're the Employer Of the Year, loved by her community.<eos> In the other version, you fuck us over, we sue you and your son in civil for what happened the other night.

All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't need these.<eos> All right, now listen.<eos> If any of you idiots... think of taking this to the cops, let me remind you that I am me and you are you, right?
You motherfucking genius.<eos> Really.<eos> Very clever.<eos> Well done.<eos> Although it creates a problem for me because, you know, I really like money, especially my own money, so if I kill the three of you, then I have to write it off, and, you know, a businessman, that would just stick in my craw.
Oh, and the box of tapes should have included a map.<eos> I'll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city.<eos> I can't force you to visit them, but if you'd like a little more insight, head for the stars.<eos> Or, you know, just throw the map away and I'll never know... or will I?<eos> You see, in case you're tempted to break the rules, understand I did make a copy of these tapes, and I left them with a trusted individual who, if this package doesn't make it through all of you,
Yes.<eos> Liberty High's star athletes, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> So impressive.<eos> Sorry, boys.<eos> Can't have you in Hannah's house soaking wet.
No problem, Harriet.<eos> Ooh. Can I actually get a Jezebel?<eos> She'd be an amazing friend.<eos> See?<eos> See, the senses of humor on you two.
At least I have the ability to try something new in life.<eos> Is that why you did it, Alex?<eos> Mrs. Baker.<eos> Hi.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.
I know you can't possibly know every student, but my husband and I, we're still trying to understand.<eos> At home, Hannah was...<eos> Well, I mean... sometimes she would run around the house singing show tunes in funny voices and showering us with hugs, and other times... she was quiet and moody and it'd be hard to get a word out of her.<eos> - But nothing she did told us she was... capable of...<eos> I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop you right there, Mrs. Baker.
What are you saying?<eos> What I'm saying is that, in light of your lawsuit, I shouldn't even be talking to you.<eos> I see.<eos> So then why are you?<eos> You and your husband are members of our school community, and we want nothing more than to support you during this time.
Yeah, we just got his medicine.<eos> Mm-hmm. Everything all right at home?<eos> Yes, sir, I've just been sick.<eos> I'll be there tomorrow.<eos> I won't let you down.
In our experience, relative to many other schools, we do not have a problem with bullying.<eos> Then why did that girl do it?<eos> That girl's name is Hannah.<eos> Mrs. Baker.<eos> It's so good to see you.
See you tonight.<eos> - Yeah. Have a great day.<eos> - Go kick ass.<eos> All right.<eos> Love you.
Um, can I...<eos> I need to go to the office.<eos> Hello, Courtney.<eos> Hi, Miss Douglas, how are you?<eos> It's so good to see you.
I don't see why not.<eos> Hi.<eos> Lainie Jensen to see Principal Bolan.<eos> Of course.<eos> Um... He will be with you in a moment.
Okay, you boys want to tell me why you're going 90 in a 40?<eos> We were just out for a ride.<eos> - We're sorry, officer.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, you know, I could bust you for reckless driving.
A special shout-out to Zach Dempsey, who crushed it with 28 points.<eos> In other athletic news, the Lady Tigers won their game by a score of 54-32.<eos> Thought you said this wasn't a test.<eos> 'Cause this looks like a test.<eos> It's not, Mr. Pratters, I assure you.
And why did she do it?<eos> Because the kids here treated her like shit!<eos> Jensen, that's enough.<eos> But no one wants to admit it, so they paint over the bathrooms and put up a memorial, because that's the kind of school that this is.<eos> Everyone is just so nice until they drive you to kill yourself.
- Come on.<eos> I know.<eos> - What the fuck is his problem?<eos> Mr. Baker.<eos> Okay, uh... what can I do for you?
But I couldn't get my feet to move.<eos> It was dark in there.<eos> And the music was loud, but I saw his face.<eos> And I recognized his voice as clear as day.<eos> And so would all of you.
Please, my wife.<eos> I was on the phone with my wife.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Sir, stay calm.<eos> We're gonna take care of you.
I can't give you that information, ma'am.<eos> We have units responding to the scene now.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Good.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?
He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?<eos> Mrs. Baker, we shouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> Don't you think it's exactly the conversation that we should be having?<eos> My son is worth everything to me, as I'm sure Hannah is to you.
What the hell?<eos> No way.<eos> Were you just on the phone with your husband?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Hello, how are you!<eos> Hi, Mr. Cantrell.<eos> Hey, Sheri.<eos> Hey, Clay.<eos> Let me help you to your chair.
I started thinking how everyone's lives would be better without me.<eos> And what does that feel like?<eos> It feels like nothing.<eos> Like a deep, endless, always blank nothing.<eos> And for those of you who will now be looking for signs everywhere... - what does it really look like? - Mmm.
We'll go nice and easy.<eos> But if you're not lucky, you die a little bit...<eos> Yeah, that's good.<eos> ...over and over... until you realize it's too late.<eos> I know some of you might think there was more I could have done, or should have done.
It was just a Dollar Valentine's thing.<eos> Hannah didn't take it seriously?<eos> - Objection.<eos> - I'll rephrase.<eos> Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you that might lead you to believe that she did take it seriously?
Do you care about them?<eos> Friends?<eos> What friends?<eos> Now, I know you have friends.<eos> I see you in the halls.
- Okay.<eos> Excellent.<eos> He's not coming.<eos> I think I've made myself very clear... but no one's coming forward to stop me.<eos> Some of you care.
And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.<eos> And they'll know what they did.<eos> You're the last person to get the tapes.<eos> Hannah didn't leave any instructions on what happens after you... so you get to decide.
Guys would... call her a slut and say that she's easy, that sort of stuff.<eos> Did you ever witness anyone being physically abusive to Hannah?<eos> - I bet it happened.<eos> - Dennis.<eos> Tyler, we have to ask you not to speculate.
No, I'm quite certain I can do better than that.<eos> I'll need cutting away completely.<eos> Time is of the essence for what happens next.<eos> Take the better part of a day, maybe two, to secure the chest.<eos> Captain Rackham will ferry you back to the camp aboard the Lion to relay the news.
These are from the early 90s, but most of the tapes were put in a landfill because the show was deemed too disturbing for kids.<eos> Captain Ryan, the Nefrini are sending out an urgent com signal! Ayy!<eos> Put them on the screen, Crankshaw Junior.<eos> Captain Ryan, the Nefrini people feel it is unfair that the Confederation is taxing our trade routes,<eos> - and we would ask you...
- Watch it, Jones.<eos> - Casey! - Yah!<eos> [both grunting] [panting] It's like fighting Shredder.<eos> But he's still blind.<eos> Tatsu was using you, just like the Shredder, tarnishing the name of the Foot Clan for his own glory.
Not yet.<eos> It's one of theirs, long range.<eos> We can listen in, keep track of them.<eos> Michonne: So, if we're not going back, what are we doing, then?<eos> I think it's time we introduced you to Ezekiel.
Hi.<eos> ♪♪<eos> Richard: How do you know each other?<eos> We go back to the start.<eos> Well, the King is ready to see you.
I forgot to mention that...<eos> Yeah, a tiger.<eos> This is Rick Grimes, the leader of Alexandria, and these are some of his people.<eos> Ezekiel: I welcome you all to the Kingdom, good travelers.<eos> Now, what brings you to our fair land?
We brought you into our confidence.<eos> Why did you break it?<eos> Because I want you to hear Rick's plans.<eos> And what plans have you, Rick Grimes of Alexandria?<eos> We came to ask the Kingdom, to ask you, to join us in fighting the Saviors, fighting for freedom for all of us.
All right.<eos> The king had put that rock in the road because he knew the person who dug it out, who did something, they deserved a reward.<eos> They deserved to have their life changed for the good....<eos> forever.<eos> I invite you all to sup with us and stay till the morrow.
Chop-chop.<eos> Oh!<eos> And, Rick... if Daryl does turn up here two days from now, two months from now... hell, two years from now, just know there's no statute of limitations on this.<eos> Keep that hatchet handy.<eos> You're gonna need it if he turns up with you people.
They're called the Saviors.<eos> They own our lives.<eos> And if you kill us, he'll be taking something from them.<eos> And they will come looking.<eos> You only have two options when it comes to the Saviors -- either they kill you or they own you.
You know, before.<eos> Mm.<eos> Mm.<eos> While I appreciate the gesture and your commitment to your assigned objective, I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening of your own volition.<eos> Video games are all about me showing all of you a fun time.
It's possible.<eos> It's real.<eos> It's happening now.<eos> And the problems have to end...now.<eos> You have to learn the stakes here, so we're gonna teach you.
Simon! Hello.<eos> Right back at you, Gregory.<eos> Hello.<eos> Ahh.<eos> We weren't, uh, expecting you back so soon.
Shit you not.<eos> Oh! Almost forgot.<eos> Set that down.<eos> Well, fair is fair.<eos> We're not leaving you high and dry when it comes to medical solutions.
No.<eos> Leave right now.<eos> Michonne, don't!<eos> We just wanna be left alone.<eos> Yeah, we'll leave you alone.
Michonne, don't!<eos> We just wanna be left alone.<eos> Yeah, we'll leave you alone.<eos> Just let go of her.<eos> Or we'll kill you.
I have to remind you!<eos> Yes.<eos> I am gonna do this, and then I'm gonna die.<eos> But it's that important.<eos> This is your life, all of you.
Everyone, shots within 10 feet of the line.<eos> That's it.<eos> Now!<eos> No.<eos> We're not fighting them with you.
The Sanctuary?<eos> Where Negan lives.<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> I can radio back to them and say everything's okay.<eos> You drive the trucks back, and I can lead you right inside, and, with the right plan, we can wipe out the rest.
So, you don't like Eugene anymore.<eos> You guys gotta like Sasha.<eos> I do, too.<eos> Got her right here packaged for your convenience, alive and well.<eos> Now, I brought her so I wouldn't have to kill all of you, and not killing all of you could get complicated.
I'm gonna kill Carl, and then Lucille here, she's gonna take your hands.<eos> You can do it right in front of me.<eos> You can take my hands.<eos> I told you already -- I'm gonna kill you.<eos> All of you.
This is gonna be good for Jerry.<eos> For everybody.<eos> For everybody.<eos> I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out.<eos> I will leave you two to your adventures.
Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures.<eos> First thing that's different... no more Dad, Morty. - Oh, geez.<eos> He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.<eos> Oh [bleep]. I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe.<eos> Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home... Oh, man. Without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you.
C-Can we just take him prisoner?<eos> When did I lose control here?<eos> Listen to me...<eos> Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce!<eos> Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!
I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.<eos> Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?<eos> What?<eos> ! No! What kind of question is that?<eos> The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
Look at this family go.<eos> You guys are pros.<eos> What do you guys think about doing this once a week?<eos> You must be Rick. Mm-hmm.<eos> I've heard a lot about you today.
What do you guys think about doing this once a week?<eos> You must be Rick. Mm-hmm.<eos> I've heard a lot about you today.<eos> Your family is crazy about you.<eos> Your daughter holds you in very high regard.
It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive.<eos> I have had a rough day.<eos> And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage.<eos> I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.<eos> By changing you from a pickle to a human.
I'm a pickle... When I feel like it.<eos> So... you asked.<eos> Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.<eos> You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse.<eos> And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control.
It's just work.<eos> And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people... well, some people would rather die.<eos> Each of us gets to choose.<eos> That's our time.<eos> I'm going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again.
You came here and defeated our arch nemesis... while so drunk you don't remember doing it?<eos> That's something "obvious" to you?<eos> Look, I'm a lit...<eos> little more complex than you guys, and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.<eos> So I thought, why not just do your job for you, so we can have a little fun game.
- Congrats!<eos> - You did it it!<eos> It was a bit.<eos> All of the descriptors apply to all of you.<eos> Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.
What?<eos> Hey, I don't know.<eos> I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it.<eos> It's, like, it's possible I got so drunk I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying, "Okay", you can have him but only if you know how important he is,<eos> "otherwise I'll kill you."
- Nyrhinen.<eos> Kolehmainen, Mirja.<eos> Who are the old employees that come with the deal?<eos> We are.<eos> - What about you?
- Wikström.<eos> - What about a first name?<eos> - Plenty of Wikströms to go around.<eos> - Waldemar.<eos> - Do your friends call you Wallu?
Thanks.<eos> Tell me. Has Miriam called?<eos> But how are you?<eos> Where are you, still in Aleppo?<eos> God help you.
Considering the development in Aleppo's security situation, the number of acts of violence and deaths in relation to Aleppo's large number of inhabitants, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that in the Aleppo region there is no such conflict to cause<eos> all the residents of the city any serious personal danger described as grievous harm in paragraph 88, subsection 1 of the Aliens Act.<eos> Considering the security situation in Aleppo, your domicile and your personal circumstances, you require no subsidiary protection.<eos> You will be flown tomorrow at the expense of the Republic of Finland to Ankara in Turkey.<eos> Turkish authorities will assist you to the Syrian border.
- I got you five minutes.<eos> - Go get him tiger.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How we doing?<eos> Good to see you, thanks for coming.
He just arrived today.<eos> Unfortunately Governor Odegard speaks no Russian... but luckily Major Potemkin has a little English so he can follow our conversation.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Very good.<eos> So, what brings you to Vukobejina, Governor?
Yes, what?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Call Petra in.<eos> I'll meet you there.
- I'm her doctor.<eos> You said feel free to visit anytime you like.<eos> I don't have to explain myself.<eos> Those were your words.<eos> I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Now we need you to fight this thing.<eos> I need you!<eos> We always taught the children to pick their fights.<eos> You taught them that.<eos> Dr. Khatri, what can I do for you?
Had I not stepped in, who knows how destructive that could have become for everyone?<eos> Can't sit still and let him hold us hostage.<eos> Can't fight him directly or we risk losing what few soldiers we have left.<eos> And even if I could slip a ship past him to seek aid from your family in the colonies, you'd have to be on that ship.<eos> And you'd never get that far before he caught you.
This thing that perpetuates itself with anger and bluster and blood.<eos> I do not want to be your friend.<eos> What I want is for all of this to end.<eos> For it to end, you must end.<eos> I imagine I have some obligation to surrender you to Captain Berringer, but the spectacle he would make of your trial and execution would only fan the flames of what is burning in Nassau now.
What I want is for all of this to end.<eos> For it to end, you must end.<eos> I imagine I have some obligation to surrender you to Captain Berringer, but the spectacle he would make of your trial and execution would only fan the flames of what is burning in Nassau now.<eos> I am tempted to put the sword to you and your man both, and bury this story for good, but what am I if I spend my days pleading for a return to civility and then do dark things under the cover of night?<eos> So, you will remain in my custody until I can find a place far from here to deposit you.
Or it means I have the power.<eos> Sometimes he has it, sometimes I have it.<eos> It's like a seesaw.<eos> When do you get the power?<eos> After he hits you?
Where is he now?<eos> He's in Phoenix.<eos> He left this morning.<eos> When are you gonna leave him, Celeste?<eos> When he hurts you badly enough?
- Madeline.<eos> - Hi, Tori.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you. And to you, too.
Hey, Mommy isn't feeling well today, so I'm going to take you guys to school.<eos> What's wrong with her?<eos> Her tummy's a little upset.<eos> She's... she's okay.<eos> But that means that the monster will take you to school instead.
He's going away in the morning, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> We just have to go to the school gala tonight and...<eos> Jesus.<eos> It's one thing should he kill you, but God forbid you miss a party.
We just have to go to the school gala tonight and...<eos> Jesus.<eos> It's one thing should he kill you, but God forbid you miss a party.<eos> You know, your husband is ill, Celeste, but so are you.<eos> There are... children in the house. I told you, he will not hurt the children.
It's perfect.<eos> Thank you very much, Kelly. Thank you very much.<eos> All right, let's hit the road.<eos> We don't wanna be late, do we?<eos> Bye, kids. Love you.
I had him follow you after you left town so abruptly last night.<eos> I assume the one-legged man was Long John Silver.<eos> Would you like to tell me what the meeting was about?<eos> I was summoned by him in a failed attempt to extort money from me.<eos> I would hope that your spy also informed you that four of my six men attempted to arrest him and died in the effort.
Knowing now how high the bodies are piling, how real the threat is, I am giving you an opportunity to remedy your error and help me end this threat once and for all.<eos> I want the names of your sources.<eos> I am sorry, but I cannot do that.<eos> Cannot or will not?<eos> These men would turn on you in a blink of an eye.
Join me.<eos> "Signed, Long John Silver."<eos> You heard him.<eos> The time is now.<eos> Who among you would like to lend his efforts to Long John Silver and resist me?
Can you see to it?<eos> Of course.<eos> Ooh, lovely.<eos> I don't make this request lightly.<eos> But after everything Max has done for the council, for you, it seems like a moment when she's owed something back.
Fuck.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - Nothing helpful.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You're about to make a terrible mistake and I am asking you to reconsider.
What's going on?<eos> You're about to make a terrible mistake and I am asking you to reconsider.<eos> I am entitled to exercise these sentences at my discretion.<eos> But I'm not asking you to cancel the hangings.<eos> I'm asking you to cancel the theater around them.
If a suspects says departure, you get me.<eos> Cool?<eos> Got ya.<eos> Dismissed, assholes.<eos> Walk you out, Agent Durst?
- It's not a question.<eos> I'm just assessing the level of stupidity.<eos> - Hey, hey. - Irv, come on, we don't have to...<eos> You get a lot of business from us.<eos> Which, boychik, will stop the moment they arrest you for money laundering.
Look what that animal did to my car!<eos> Madeline, call my wife, will ya?<eos> Madeline?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't realize Mr. Stussy was expecting you.
We are not partners.<eos> That... This...<eos> - You lent us some... - Capital.<eos> Which we've told you, we're happy to pay back with interest.<eos> You see, that's the problem with you Americans.
And the motel's getting pretty expensive.<eos> Relax, kid.<eos> I got you covered, totally.<eos> Just make sure you keep all your receipts.<eos> Mr. Beatty for you, sir.
_<eos> I had a few questions for you about a writer you worked with back in 1975.<eos> Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> _<eos> He wrote a script for you called The Planet Wyh, a science fiction film?
Thaddeus Mobley.<eos> _<eos> He wrote a script for you called The Planet Wyh, a science fiction film?<eos> And, well, he was the victim of some malfeasance recently, and I'm just trying to connect the dots here.<eos> I know he was writing a movie for you, and then, I don't know, something happened.
Oh, you think the IRS won't...<eos> This is what they do.<eos> Catch cheats.<eos> Middle managers and movie stars, people who park their money in a Denver Wells Fargo under their mother-in-law's maiden name.<eos> But I assure you, the IRS could not unravel an intricate web of shell companies and loan-outs with secret accounts in Monaco, Luxembourg, and the Cook Islands, if you gave them the account numbers.

And that got us wondering, especially since Mr. stussy, Raymond, his car got rammed into by another vehicle registered to your company and...<eos> Allegedly, words exchanged between ray and a yet-to-be-identified member of your team.<eos> -My team?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> And we thought it curious the house being targeted and searched as it was that he shared the same last name as you and your brother.
And we thought it curious the house being targeted and searched as it was that he shared the same last name as you and your brother.<eos> The same first initial.<eos> Winnie: Lived in towns with similar names.<eos> What are they...<eos> Is there some kind of feud between you and ray?
All named stussy.<eos> You see, in 1932 there were, what, 24 Hitlers in a German phone book.<eos> Now, are you suggesting that they were all responsible for the final solution?<eos> Twenty-four, exactly?<eos> Sir, was there some kind of disagreement over money between you and your brother?
Uh, you can't be in here, sir.<eos> Library is closed.<eos> You're here.<eos> Well, sir, I work here, so that's...<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Oh...<eos> Hits the spot.<eos> We all end up here eventually.<eos> To be weighed and judged.<eos> As it is now for you and your friend.
I won?<eos> What did I win?<eos> Life.<eos> Sittight.<eos> Meemo will be over presently to take you home.
A father dead on a driveway.<eos> An older brother taking advantage of a younger...<eos> -Miamore...<eos> Sit.<eos> You know how I describe you when I meet with my bankers and hedge fund managers?
Look, it's a family matter is my philosophy.<eos> Whatever past disagreements, bygones.<eos> You know?<eos> Think of Jesus, his actions.<eos> So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. feltz?
You know?<eos> Think of Jesus, his actions.<eos> So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. feltz?<eos> - No, I wouldn't say...<eos> - What about between you and...
I'll talk to him.<eos> That's all I ask.<eos> Any calls?<eos> I left the slips on your desk.<eos> Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
Or a conference room, if that's easier.<eos> Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the riviera.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> I know just where to put you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What?<eos> He said pretty girls should only open their mouths when they see a dick.<eos> And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick?
I'm gonna go.<eos> If you have any more questions, let my lawyer know.<eos> It's done.<eos> They're letting him out.<eos> Doyle'll drive you to meet the swango,
Very good.<eos> You just added a zero to your salary.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I already got a job.<eos> Blackmailing you.
You'll need to file for chapter 11 immediately.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Your personal wealth, the profits you've made as a partner in this venture, have all been carefully hidden. So...<eos> Not all bad.<eos> Mike and Mike will show you out.
They got phones in Belgium, yeah? Email?<eos> Mr. Varga.<eos> You're asking me if there are phones in Belgium?<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen next.<eos> Three agents from Homeland Security are gonna put handcuffs on you and take you to rikers.
I am of Death.<eos> You are dead, Mrs. Fadil.<eos> - That is me?<eos> - That is you.<eos> Your family will come soon and find you.
You are dead, Mrs. Fadil.<eos> - That is me?<eos> - That is you.<eos> Your family will come soon and find you.<eos> They will do right by your body and bury you as is proper.
Marius, I'm Mr. Bagwell.<eos> Hi, Mr. Bagwell.<eos> I don't want to shake your hand.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just came to check up on you.
How many terraformers her family own, anyway?<eos> All of them.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I'll catch up with you in a minute.
My Julie.<eos> Even losing her was worth it.<eos> She's a sacred part of it now.<eos> So don't talk to me about sacrifice ever again.<eos> This'll kill any cancer that dares try to grow inside you.
- Decent guy? - Yeah.<eos> Do you think you would've got off Eros without him?<eos> - No.<eos> - Ah.<eos> But he wasn't a good enough friend to wait for you.
Targets incoming on my nine, high...<eos> Same old shit, "hurry up and wait," huh?<eos> Look, gunny, we...<eos> We got an intel flash the Hale was carrying 10 times our number.<eos> We weren't going to send you down to a slaughter.
Sekou, what were the terms of your release?<eos> What do you say to your social media profile?<eos> Did you provide names of other radicals?<eos> Does your family know you're free?<eos> Sekou, is it true your father radicalized you?
A private one, and you're trespassing.<eos> What's your position here?<eos> Could I have your name?<eos> You wouldn't have lied your way in if you had any legal authority, like a warrant.<eos> The guards will escort you out.
Maybe you're not much use to me after all.<eos> Mr. Emmons, sorry for the confusion.<eos> Yeah, well, someone better streamline that shit before we get to the White House.<eos> Absolutely, sir.<eos> I'll take you to the president-elect.
I'll take you to the president-elect.<eos> She's been working all afternoon.<eos> - If she's busy, I can wait.<eos> - No.<eos> Trust me... She wants to see you.
And I'm good with faces.<eos> You look so familiar.<eos> You didn't volunteer for the Hudson Valley Committee back in 2000?<eos> I can tell you for sure that I didn't.<eos> I've never voted for you.
- Agent Thoms?<eos> - Ma'am, are you safe?<eos> If you're asking if this was my idea, the answer is "yes."<eos> Then please ask Mrs. Diehl to pull over.<eos> We have a vehicle on the way that will return you to the compound.
I'm not going back.<eos> Under Chapter 18, United States Code 3056, it is illegal for you to deny protection, ma'am.<eos> I am not denying protection.<eos> You are free to escort me back to New York.<eos> Neither Mrs. Diehl nor her vehicle are equipped to transport you safely.
No.<eos> I really should get going.<eos> You've given me a lot to think about.<eos> Not the easiest conversation I've ever had.<eos> I think they're waiting for you.
No, I can't.<eos> But I want to thank the dedicated people who looked after my safety and the safety of this great city.<eos> There are some reports suggesting that you yourself were the target of the attack.<eos> Well, I'd rather wait for the results of the investigation before commenting on that.<eos> The president is urging you and Congress to reauthorize certain provisions of the PATRIOT Act.
We had a very interesting talk.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Our sons.<eos> Madam President, can you speak up?<eos> We can't hear you back here.
We're looking for comment on--<eos> Okay, sir.<eos> You don't want to talk.<eos> I see that now.<eos> Just let me go, I'll leave you in peace.
You can speak with specific people in the White House, including the president.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a start.<eos> Please.<eos> I'd like to bring you up to speed on the attack and a few unfortunate facts you should be aware of.
I--<eos> What I need to believe is that you're protecting Franny, okay?<eos> Because that's what I asked you to do when I left here this morning.<eos> That's what I've told everybody here.<eos> I shouldn't have left you alone here with her.
Because that's what I asked you to do when I left here this morning.<eos> That's what I've told everybody here.<eos> I shouldn't have left you alone here with her.<eos> And I'm so sorry.<eos> But I-- I had such a good feeling, seeing the two of you together.
Hey, sweetie.<eos> Can you wake up to get to the car?<eos> Sweetie?<eos> She's had a long day.<eos> You sure it's okay, us staying with you?
Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Falhadi.<eos> - Right here.<eos> And, finally, Mr. Mohada.<eos> My colleague will escort you to your cars.
Tell me about him.<eos> What's your connection?<eos> We're former colleagues.<eos> We worked together at the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Why is he living with you?
Who are you?<eos> Amir.<eos> You and I have a friend in common.<eos> Where is our friend?<eos> Someplace safe, waiting for you.
Where is our friend?<eos> Someplace safe, waiting for you.<eos> Why didn't he come?<eos> He'll explain when you see him.<eos> Come, I'll take you to him.
Madame President-Elect, I have to speak to you.<eos> Javadi is lying.<eos> It's the only explanation.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I can think of others, including one where you were wrong and I was wrong to have ever listened to you.
Ma'am, if I may, I feel I owe you an apology.<eos> We got off on the wrong foot at our very first meeting, and I blame myself entirely.<eos> It's not that, not at all.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> The fact is, I asked you here to pick your brain.
Dar's here.<eos> He's in the building.<eos> Not too late to cancel.<eos> The meeting's been scheduled.<eos> I can sub in for you.
Three candidates I would never consider for any position at any time.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> You can't really have expected anything different.<eos> Actually, I did.<eos> And I'd ask you to reconsider... advise you to.
Do I give up, roll over?<eos> Do you see me resigning?<eos> I am the next president of the United States.<eos> Sixty million people voted for me.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
Are you threatening me now?<eos> I'm telling you it's a war you won't win.<eos> Two hundred and fifty years of movement toward the light in this country, towards justice...<eos> Say what you want, call me naive, but I believe in that light.<eos> And I will not be held hostage by you or anybody else.
Say what you want, call me naive, but I believe in that light.<eos> And I will not be held hostage by you or anybody else.<eos> I'm afraid you're taking this personally, madam.<eos> You're god damn right I am.<eos> I'm sorry if I upset you.
Hello?<eos> Carrie, hi.<eos> It's Christine Lonas.<eos> Did you hear from the doctor?<eos> I did, and let me just apologize right off the bat for worrying you unnecessarily.
I see.<eos> My supervisor took the call early this morning.<eos> It was an honest mistake.<eos> I see.<eos> Anyway, the good news is we can keep our appointment as scheduled if that's still good for you.
Carrie!<eos> I can't.<eos> Mrs. Berenson?<eos> That's right.<eos> A man left this message for you.
Oh, the traffic was impossible.<eos> Finally had to get out of the cab and walk.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Your guest is waiting for you.
She's about to hit the garage.<eos> What about the rest of my staff?<eos> They're coming down the east stairwell, ma'am, and evacuating through the back entrance.<eos> I can't leave without them.<eos> Ma'am, my orders are to put you in this vehicle.
The same people that detonated that bomb and just executed Agent Thoms.<eos> Listen to me, Elizabeth.<eos> We're in a kill zone now.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> They missed you once, now they have to finish the job... which means either we stay here and pray they don't find us or...
_<eos> Okay, Brett, you're on in three, two one.<eos> Today, I don't even feel worthy of being here.<eos> Today, my soul is in crisis.<eos> I have failed you, and I have failed myself.
I still don't know what to tell my staff.<eos> Half of them are expecting to be fired - or arrested any minute.<eos> - Tell them they won't be.<eos> Tell them to stop listening to Brett O'Keefe.<eos> Look, most of you know me.
- To see the President.<eos> Ronald, I need to see the President.<eos> - She's not available.<eos> - It's urgent.<eos> Ma'am, we've been ordered to escort you out of the building.
Madam President--<eos> That's far enough.<eos> An honor to meet you.<eos> I understand you're here at great personal risk.<eos> Thank you for that.
Saul would not have made a mistake like that.<eos> Javadi is lying.<eos> It's the only explanation.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I can think of others, including one where you were wrong and I was wrong to have ever listened to you.
Come with us, please.<eos> _<eos> A work in progress. It's not ready yet.<eos> I am the next president of the United States.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
He was running toward a fallen comrade to save that man's life.<eos> That act, which was attested to by six soldiers who were actually there-- that act cost my son his life and won him the Silver Star.<eos> Whoever made the video is not only trying to undo that and damage him personally, but to damage my presidency.<eos> I call on the actual cowards, the people who made it, to come out of the shadows and show their faces.<eos> Madam President-Elect, are you calling this a conspiracy against you?
And it's not just the mission.<eos> It never has been.<eos> You got to let me go.<eos> You talk to him yet?<eos> I've been waiting for you.
That was Brett O'Keefe on the phone.<eos> He says he made the video.<eos> He admits it now when we already know?<eos> He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.
Each one of them crazy as he is.<eos> So, we just let them keep screaming at us without a response?<eos> Here's a response-- the man is insane.<eos> Saul.<eos> We wouldn't be aware of any of this if it weren't for you.
Welcome, Madam President-Elect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, let me ask you what everyone is asking right now-- why are you here?<eos> Because you invited me.<eos> Well, I've often invited you, but, usually, you prefer the loving arms of the mainstream media.
An underground bunker? - Yes.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yes. Run out of this studio.<eos> You didn't just produce the lying video. You faked the hate and the lies that accompanied it.<eos> People hate you, Madam President-Elect. No one's faking that.
You'll have to find him.<eos> He's around here somewhere.<eos> Hello? Rob Emmons.<eos> Rob, it's Carrie.<eos> I can barely hear you.
If things don't go well in that surgery, there will be time for that.<eos> But right now I'm gonna go in that room, and I'm gonna save your daughter's life.<eos> So your implant is hidden in the gluteal crust.<eos> Sounds like something you get at Pizza Hut.<eos> Which means, unfortunately, until the swelling goes down, we're not able to operate on you, Dustin, so...
Sounds like something you get at Pizza Hut.<eos> Which means, unfortunately, until the swelling goes down, we're not able to operate on you, Dustin, so...<eos> No.<eos> Nobody calls me Dustin.<eos> Well, I'm not calling you "Doctor."
Like you're at the end of a long wedding night.<eos> Well, that's funny.<eos> I actually proposed tonight.<eos> It's to my doctor, isn't it?<eos> I saw you two at the dinner.
- Leslie, stop it!<eos> You have no respect!<eos> Look. I work my tail off for this family.<eos> You guys know it.<eos> Because I love you. I love you guys.
Yeah.<eos> Okay. Thanks, John.<eos> And what was your friend's destination?<eos> We were... We were strolling together.<eos> But he wasn't with you when you were stabbed. No. Why did you stop strolling together?
How's it feeling?<eos> Can you wiggle your fingers, make a fist?<eos> Good as new.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Durst, I'm sorry if this seems inappropriate, but when you came in last month to get the cast, one of the orderlies, he said he saw you in the parking lot before you came in.
Yes.<eos> Thank you for answering the call.<eos> Mark explained the opportunity we're offering you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Someone is standing by to meet you at the Crown Central in Melbourne, Australia.
Actually, I painted it myself.<eos> - You did not.<eos> - I did.<eos> Well, then you are incredibly talented.<eos> So, what brings you here, Frank?
No, no, no.<eos> Documentaries are boring.<eos> I'm just seeking enlightenment.<eos> I'm only interested in his wisdom, his counsel, - nothing else.<eos> - I'd have to accompany you.
Please!<eos> I'll be in and out, I swear.<eos> I really need this job.<eos> Please.<eos> - Um... - I'm begging you.
I fucking...<eos> Miss Durst.<eos> Yes?<eos> Go on up.<eos> They're waiting for you.
Well, I'm definitely not pregnant.<eos> Right.<eos> Your IUD.<eos> You'll need to have it removed before you go through.<eos> - We can refer you to a...
- Are they mine, the twins?<eos> - Irrelevant.<eos> It's relevant if you want me to answer your fucking question.<eos> They're not yours.<eos> She was working for you.
No. No.<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop!<eos> Go home, Miss Durst.<eos> This isn't for you.
I brought a casserole.<eos> Islands in the Pacific.<eos> And early reports confirm it was uninhabited.<eos> The French government is denying any responsibility, and details surrounding...<eos> - God bless you, Reverend.
Sure looks like it.<eos> Hi.<eos> Nice to see you girls.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> I know I marked you off.
A pimple waits until you're 12 to come on your face.<eos> Righty-o, then.<eos> The lady has free reign.<eos> No law can govern the lioness.<eos> And as for you fellas, there's only one rule, so learn it well.
I'm fine.<eos> He hit you, huh?<eos> What?<eos> Your nose.<eos> God hit you.
I go by many names, but Mr. Burton is fine.<eos> I will not take a photo with you.<eos> There was no big bang.<eos> Just nothing, then light.<eos> Yes, I created you.
The fuck are these?<eos> Uh, my sunglasses.<eos> No reflective surfaces.<eos> Do not look into them no matter what.<eos> That's how they found you.
No, wait.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I have to... I have to talk to that girl.<eos> No, we haven't got time for that, sir.<eos> We need to get you to a secure location.
- Mr. President, it appears Ukrainian separatists have taken control of an armed nuclear submarine, and they'll have launch capability within two hours.<eos> You're being brought to a bunker, which you will access with your unique biometrics once inside.<eos> - Sorry, my unique biometrics?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The door can only be unlocked by you and you alone unless you have an identical twin brother, which would be ridiculous.
Name of your Secretary of Defense?<eos> Sir, I need a name.<eos> Patti Levin.<eos> Correct.<eos> Good to see you, Mr. President.
Well, if you knew that, why the fuck wouldn't you tell me?<eos> Because I'm covering my asset.<eos> - What asset?<eos> - I have someone on the inside.<eos> Leave your weapon, enter the door, and they'll take care of you once you're inside.
Then pull your knees towards your chest and hold them there.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> We will be monitoring you from inside there.<eos> Once inside the event chamber, you will be able to hear us and we will be able to hear you.
Threats have been made. The story's been told. Everyone in Nassau knows what Long John Silver's return means, what's expected of them when he does return.<eos> All that remains is for him to return.<eos> We're not apart on this island.<eos> We cannot be apart.<eos> Many of you have got kin at the Underhill estate.
Keeping our distance?<eos> He's stolen the army that pledged its allegiance to us, not to mention the damaged he's caused with our alliance to the slave communities on this island.<eos> There are a thousand men out there who've been awaiting my arrival.<eos> They're now armed and angry and I haven't yet said a word to them.<eos> If the first five are, "Billy Bones has crossed you," would you care to guess what happens next?
- Aye, sir.<eos> Coming aboard.<eos> Mr. Rawls!<eos> Governor. Thank you.<eos> You've no idea how grateful we are to see you.
I could send Mr. Chase, sir...<eos> I would like for it to be you, Lieutenant. There are 42 pirates in the belly of that ship and I can spare no more than a handful of men to see to her.<eos> I beg your pardon, my Lord.<eos> I want to be a part...<eos> I understand you wanna be part of the fight that's coming. I understand you want retribution for Captain Berringer. Right now, the successful transfer of those prisoners is what I need from you.
There's a fight soon to be underway in Nassau.<eos> A fight that... we are entitled to be a part of.<eos> A fight to answer a cowardly crime.<eos> A fight... that's been stolen from us by you fucking people.<eos> So... the way I see it, each one of you owes us a fight.
- What he did?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But a very wise woman recently told me that one should not allow their personal feelings to cloud the reality of the situation, which in both that case and this... is that Billy has influence that is best not ignored.<eos> That sounds like good advice.<eos> Was it given before or after he tried to kill the two of you?
The Boyd brothers launched a raid on one of the governor's munition stores.<eos> We just managed to put it down.<eos> I think we can all agree it helps none of us to have those idiots armed to the teeth.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Lest you think I've been avoiding you.
Meaning what?<eos> You're going to help us find her?<eos> Find her?<eos> I have her.<eos> I am responsible... for delivering all 42 of you to the law in Port Royal.
You know as well as I do the only reason he wants them free is because the only soldiers in town are mine and the prisoners in the fort are likely to still follow his...<eos> I'm going to stop you right there.<eos> From the moment you began concocting this story, I knew it was with an eye towards pushing him out.<eos> - Separating the two of us so you can...<eos> - The two of you?
And for as long as he is chained to this place, then I am as well.<eos> I wonder, ma'am, if he might want you to leave.<eos> Especially... when he learns of your... current state of being.<eos> I beg your pardon, ma'am, but seeing what I see in your service...<eos> I fear there are things I may know about you that even the governor does not yet know.
I fear there are things I may know about you that even the governor does not yet know.<eos> I have grown quite fond of you, ma'am.<eos> You are someone who is determined to be better today than you were yesterday.<eos> And in this world, that is in short supply.<eos> And so I find myself feeling protective of you.
Come on, my pretty.<eos> Anne, get up.<eos> Move!<eos> I would think some sort of thanks might be in order.<eos> Billy was more than ready to throw you to the wolves out there.
Move!<eos> I would think some sort of thanks might be in order.<eos> Billy was more than ready to throw you to the wolves out there.<eos> And to be honest, I was undecided about whether to go through with this deal at all.<eos> Sure.. I get my men back in exchange for you.
I get the cache, and guaranteed safe passage off the island for everyone in this fort... and you get Nassau.<eos> The money isn't ours to give.<eos> We have partners who would almost certainly rather fight this out than lose their treasury.<eos> Your partners are your problem.<eos> There is a reason why I invited you here and not them.
I will not undermine his position once the shooting starts.<eos> So, right now in this moment, what do you want to do?<eos> How?<eos> How would you see it done?<eos> One of you surrenders himself and remains here to ensure these terms are honored.
Get really low.<eos> Hey, it's me, man, Lonny Dufrene.<eos> I had, like, a far out idea for the new Gordon--<eos> Titus Andromedon.<eos> I bet he's never heard of you either, lady!
And there are literally thousands of exit points.<eos> Yeah, Ben knows that.<eos> He's been doing this a while.<eos> This is him.<eos> I'm gonna join you in.
Hi.<eos> We should, uh, talk to the staff about Rebecca not being able to come.<eos> We should all be on the same page.<eos> - I'll get right on it, Senator.<eos> - Hey, good to see you, Senator.
Name's Eric Carter.<eos> Mr. Carter!<eos> This is Commander George Marx.<eos> Tell me if you can hear me.<eos> I hear you fine.
Now we do.<eos> We have a better chance of recovering the list with CTU's help.<eos> All right, Carter, are we clear?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard you.
And what did you say?<eos> I told him you're with us.<eos> So don't make me a liar.<eos> No, I absolutely agree with that, but... Why don't you grab a bite to eat first.<eos> I'll catch up with you outside.
But I can't find it.<eos> That's because NSA hasn't captured it yet from the phone company servers.<eos> But, look, if we go into the system directly and I.D. the cell tower that handled the call...<eos> See?<eos> So, um, what's going on with you and Locke?
- How do you do?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> It's a nice day.<eos> It is a nice day.<eos> I have some very bad news for you children.
And if you haven't... you cannot possibly imagine it.<eos> I've never been through anything like this myself, but I can imagine just how you feel.<eos> I did think you'd want to see what remains of your home, - even though it is... - more or less, um...<eos> It's all gone.<eos> I just want to assure you Baudelaires that you have absolutely nothing...
They each think the other has it better.<eos> I regret to inform you, the Baudelaires' fate was worse.<eos> Chop-chop, Baudelaires!<eos> Now that I've found you a suitable guardian,<eos> I'm going to take you to your new home before banking hours begin.
No, I don't even really know him that well.<eos> He's... he's just my neighbor.<eos> His house is over there.<eos> That's strange.<eos> He said specifically he was waiting very eagerly to get his hands on you.
- It looks like a list.<eos> Wrong!<eos> It's a list.<eos> A list of chores.<eos> Rich brats like you are probably spoiled rotten and have never done a chore in your life.
You can hang my underwear on that rack when you're done washing it.<eos> This is the backyard, which needs weeding, mowing and pruning.<eos> It is also where you will chop wood.<eos> Bathroom number seven, the only one you are allowed to use.<eos> It has all the usual amenities, though the management regrets to inform you that the shampoo is not tear-free.
But wait here, for your own safety.<eos> They tend to throw things.<eos> You missed a spot.<eos> Oh!<eos> They don't want to see you.
How are we supposed to make dinner for an entire theater troupe?<eos> We start with a recipe.<eos> Do you think Justice Strauss' library has any cookbooks?<eos> Baudelaires.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you.
I wasn't expecting to see you.<eos> We meant to come sooner.<eos> We've been cleaning.<eos> Yes, Count Olaf told me you were very particular about that.<eos> I hope you appreciate how much he's doing for you.
Yes, Count Olaf told me you were very particular about that.<eos> I hope you appreciate how much he's doing for you.<eos> I wouldn't say "much."<eos> Well, perhaps not compared to what you're used to.<eos> What can I do for you?
If you might use my library.<eos> Is there any book you're looking for in particular?<eos> A cookbook, so we can make dinner.<eos> I suppose anything but lamb.<eos> Well, my private library is open to you whenever you'd like.
- Is there a supermarket nearby?<eos> Oh... no.<eos> But there is a local open-air market and gin distillery.<eos> Thanks again for taking us.<eos> I don't know what we would have done without you.
No roast beef?<eos> You didn't tell us you wanted roast beef.<eos> Look at my guests!<eos> They... they can hardly touch this revolting foreign food.<eos> In agreeing to adopt you, I became your father.
He chained those he felt most likely to revolt over the offense.<eos> Though, I imagine they know this.<eos> With what conditions?<eos> Two of them.<eos> They respect you, so they'll listen to you.
You've cast your lot with him.<eos> What does it matter to you?<eos> Before this war began, before everyone's roles changed, your father mistrusted Flint as much as anyone in Nassau did.<eos> I assume you were in some contact with him all that time.<eos> I'm surprised that his feelings didn't influence you.
You were my sister.<eos> There is very little that I remember from when I was young, but I remember this.<eos> You were older.<eos> You were beautiful.<eos> I revered you.
You were older.<eos> You were beautiful.<eos> I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead,<eos> I have to believe that it affected you.
When you were told that my mother and I were dead,<eos> I have to believe that it affected you.<eos> You had just lost your mother.<eos> But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.
The cache isn't here, so I am leaving.<eos> And as my collateral to ensure that this deal is consummated, he'll be coming with me to the fort.<eos> "This deal"?<eos> As in the one in which you walk away with all my money?<eos> It seems the only means I have of registering any meaningful disapproval of this deal at this point is to kill one or the both of you.
You coming?<eos> I won't ask again.<eos> Keeping an eye on us?<eos> Making sure you don't slit my throat out of spite, perhaps.<eos> I suppose I chose the right hostage if they're that concerned about keeping you alive.
We have to assume the Spanish have men all across the island by now.<eos> Every hour we sit here is an hour closer to being sighted by them... if we haven't been sighted already.<eos> She saw Anne?<eos> We'll give them another hour, then we'll set sail.<eos> Seems a fair amount of resentment towards you these days.
We, uh, follow Flint south... to the camp.<eos> We'll regroup, we'll refit, we'll...<eos> A war against civilization?<eos> What?<eos> Civilization has been winning that war for 10,000 years against men richer, braver, stronger, and smarter than you.
And now you would start another that no man can hope to finish?<eos> Then leave.<eos> But what's happening here is going to happen.<eos> This war is going to begin.<eos> This camp is going to fight it with or without you.
Stew?<eos> For what possible...<eos> I beg your pardon, but do you believe this?<eos> I read it in a newspaper.<eos> Mr. Guthrie will see you now.
What is it?<eos> Rackham.<eos> Captain Jack Rackham.<eos> Is that so?<eos> The news I bring is of personal concern to you, Mr. Guthrie.
Unless we bring him the cache and surrender it to him by his deadline, she dies.<eos> She's alive.<eos> Who else knows about this?<eos> No one.<eos> I summoned only the two of you.
She's alive.<eos> Who else knows about this?<eos> No one.<eos> I summoned only the two of you.<eos> My daughter is everything to me, as I believe she is to you.
Seems confident it's to be done, doesn't he?<eos> To rescue her without paying the governor his ransom.<eos> He is confident in his plan... as am I.<eos> Maybe.<eos> One of you is more confident than the other, I think.
Yeah.<eos> Toby and Lily said they wanted to keep things casual.<eos> Travis is coming.<eos> I say the more the merrier.<eos> Well, if it's cool with you... I'd love to.
Uh, can we talk to you guys for a second?<eos> Sure. What's up?<eos> I'm sorry about making a scene at the wedding.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> It's been a stressful year for both of you.
There is.<eos> They waited an hour before disbanding.<eos> Evidently, that is the lifespan of "the governor is on his way" as a viable measure of delay.<eos> The solution to our problems is not going to come from a council meeting.<eos> They are losing faith in you.
The threat the pirates present has never been greater.<eos> Their intent is to cause terror and destruction until civilization simply ceases to function. The threat will not...<eos> The defense of civilization is not your responsibility, sir!<eos> Your duty is to restore stable profits to Nassau.<eos> And the men charged to follow you to that end are already questioning their trust in you.
You'd likely retain as much freedom in that regard as you desired.<eos> To rise from where you began to where you now stand,<eos> I cannot imagine the road you've traveled.<eos> The humiliations and the sacrifices and the defeats... and the illusions maintained at so great a cost to your sense of self.<eos> But that road has led you to me.
No, seriously, I've got quite a lot riding on this.<eos> One day, you'll leave the account.<eos> Take a wife, father children.<eos> See less and less of the sea until she becomes like a painting hanging on the wall, static and irrelevant... to your daily existence.<eos> But she'll keep on calling you.
From what I've overheard, if you reach Skeleton Island, might mean the end of the governor.<eos> Maybe keep the account alive a little while longer.<eos> Is that so?<eos> That and more.<eos> Then I'll take you to it.
Clever, Mr. Gorski.<eos> You mean, for a Chicago cop.<eos> - I underestimated you.<eos> - It's all right, I get that a lot.<eos> Allow me to congratulate you.
His eyes are looking to the future.<eos> And that's exactly where I'm looking.<eos> There's a strong group of us inside BPO.<eos> We believe we can change the present direction of the organization back to the vision of Dr. El-Saadawi.<eos> What I want from you is time.
A temporary solution to a long-term problem.<eos> BPO.<eos> - How do you avoid them?<eos> - You don't.<eos> But they're not hunting you.
You and she were cellmates, weren't you?<eos> The only thing I hate more than rhetorical questions... stupid rhetorical questions.<eos> Harboring fugitives, Mrs. Cho...<eos> that's a serious crime.<eos> I don't want to have to put you back in prison.
Where are you?<eos> Listen...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest.<eos> But he obviously thought highly of you.
They want you to watch.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This can't happen.<eos> I'm sorry I failed you.
- We need your help.<eos> - We want to fight.<eos> - Just as Van Damn would.<eos> We want you to run for office.<eos> Did Jela put you up to this?
Did Jela put you up to this?<eos> No, my friend.<eos> This is not a prank.<eos> - We're dead serious.<eos> - We saw you on Kobi Kihara.
- Angels!<eos> I bring glad tidings.<eos> I have the solution... to your problem.<eos> Oh, which one?<eos> The one that brought you to Château Bug in the middle of the night.
- That's definitely authentic.<eos> - You mean antique.<eos> Yeah, I'm guessing early Bronze Age.<eos> Last worn during the reign of Seyyid Said.<eos> I don't know you and I'm sorry if you have a problem with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look at the time!<eos> The conversation has been so stimulating that the evening has just flown by.<eos> - Yeah. You have a meeting.<eos> - I have a meeting, yes.<eos> I don't know about the rest of you, but Kala and I are really beginning to love these family dinners.
And I wanted to tell that someone thank you.<eos> I wanted to tell you that I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Tonight, I want everyone in this room to know... that I see you.<eos> I believe in you.
Or maybe, just maybe, you were supposed to get out.<eos> He thinks the concert was a BPO trap.<eos> I've seen more than my fair share of snares.<eos> You do not remain free for 30 years by being the trusting kind.<eos> Now, whether I'm right or wrong about you, I suspect we'll be seeing each other again soon enough.
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.<eos> The Chairman is very excited.<eos> It's a very big day for us.<eos> - It is.<eos> - We are counting on you.
I call it my speakeasy 'cause you can speak easy in here.<eos> Soundproofing. Eighteen inches thick.<eos> All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.<eos> Care to explain what possessed you?
All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.<eos> Care to explain what possessed you?<eos> Well, Mr. Hoy, if you're not a BPO headhunter, then leaving your coffin to come to my show was a terrible risk.<eos> - What possessed you? - Huh...
Mr. Hoy said I have to go to Chicago.<eos> But I have to go alone.<eos> Nom!<eos> Dr. Metzger.<eos> I don't know what they taught you in med school, but the word "helping" doesn't mean handcuff people and chop up their brains.
Listen to yourself, Detective.<eos> Is this the system you serve?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The law is imperfect.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.
The law is imperfect.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.<eos> I don't need anyone's protection.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I promised I only wanted to talk, so I'm not gonna stop you if you prefer to leave.
I think I know why you never remember your fights.<eos> You're not fighting a person.<eos> You're fighting something else.<eos> You used a false identity to fight because of your father.<eos> I think he refused to see you... to understand how special you are.
Wow.<eos> Is Nomi okay?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Lola says she's a bit concussed but she'll sleep it off.<eos> She was more worried about you.
When you say "not good," usually means stuff's going to start blowing up and people will start dying.<eos> Maybe it's time for me to leave this town.<eos> India plan.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is everything all right between you and Rajan?
Excuse me!<eos> I'm really sorry about this.<eos> I wish I didn't have to do this, but I don't have a choice.<eos> Special Agent Bendix, FBI.<eos> - I'm going to ask all of you...
I told you not to include him.<eos> No.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> If you want to finish your sacred rite, get out of the way.<eos> Otherwise, I can take you downtown, too.
He made you feel like the crisis was the best thing that ever happened.<eos> My dad inspired confidence.<eos> You believed him.<eos> You trusted him.<eos> You knew you were a part of this family... and that he'd do whatever he could to take care of you.
Because I want it to mean that again.<eos> Believe in me.<eos> Trust me.<eos> And I promise...<eos> I will take care of you.
Mr. Bak?<eos> You see these men here?<eos> They're with the Securities and Fraud division.<eos> And this is your warrant.<eos> Just come with us peacefully, or I will cuff you in front of all these people, including those reporters, okay?
And if it's inappropriate, please tell me. I know sometimes I say things I shouldn't.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I would ask the same thing.<eos> You want to know what it's like between Will and me.<eos> It's much more intense than when I visit with any of you.
I never understood the word "presence" until we were together.<eos> And if you're wondering about the sex... no matter what I say, it won't be enough.<eos> Yeah, it's pretty amazing.<eos> And what about now?<eos> What's it like when one of you is in pain?
Terrible news.<eos> How sad to let your father die alone like that.<eos> Just stay the fuck away from me.<eos> Or what?<eos> I know things were difficult between you and your father.
Maybe you're not the son you thought you were.<eos> I can imagine facing that truth would be particularly painful.<eos> You and I?<eos> We are getting closer and closer, Will.<eos> Mr. Wrangler will see you now.
Come here, I want you to meet our Jordi.<eos> This is Marc Jacobs, he's our designer.<eos> And Charlie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Kit told us all about you.
- Oh, my God!<eos> That's Blake Huntington.<eos> Please, guys. Guys, please.<eos> Please, please. Come on. Act normal.<eos> Blakey, I wanted to be the first to introduce you.
Covering.<eos> We all get complaints, right?<eos> Struggle for you is you remember the complaints, don't you?<eos> They lodge deep.<eos> They haunt you.
Because you want to believe you're perfect.<eos> But you know you're not.<eos> That's why two billion dollars' worth of these babies are sold every year.<eos> Because they bring reassurance that when the time comes, you can step up.<eos> Some of you take them.
Put your fucking cards down.<eos> Trust almost killed Axe Capital.<eos> And that is never gonna happen again.<eos> Things got a little too free and fucking easy around here.<eos> And to eliminate the possibility of any questionable information passing from any of you to me, all future conversations will be held in the presence of my Chief of Staff, Stephanie Reed.
I'd never sell him out.<eos> You passed the test.<eos> Ah. Do I get the whole chocolate factory now?<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I thought I wanted to bring you on full time, but now that I know I can trust you, I'm certain I do.
Years and years.<eos> So I'm too young?<eos> You're getting that?<eos> Too green.<eos> It'll go to an old hand like one of you two, then?
The man thanked me.<eos> Imagine that.<eos> And I knew he wasn't gonna cheat anyone else that day and would look over his shoulder thereafter.<eos> I had managed something better than payback.<eos> By acting with purpose and understatement, I had created a more just environment, which is what I am asking of all of you.
Gene therapy is finally bearing fruit. - There's a great company... I know a guy from Wharton with a...<eos> We buy an algorithm.<eos> We should go to cash, take some time off, and...<eos> Okay, fuck this.<eos> Do any of you have juice with Raya?
I no longer have proximity to it, and you no longer have proximity to me.<eos> Have fun with the children.<eos> Hey, kids, I'm leaving!<eos> Your daddy's here!<eos> I love you!
- Gavin?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Always a pleasure.<eos> - Oh!<eos> I am going to leave you in Kathryn's capable hands.
I've been meaning to talk with you.<eos> It's terrifying, isn't it?<eos> The president and I have a simple request.<eos> Tell us what you see.<eos> If anything in your environment strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off, pick up the phone.
- Thank you.<eos> And I promise you,<eos> I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.<eos> And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.<eos> The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.
If you don't mind...<eos> - Of course.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I'll be right along.<eos> It's a busy day for you today, sir.
No disagreement from here.<eos> Well, you know how the Republicans are.<eos> Anything but a decision.<eos> They mistake complaint for leadership.<eos> Well, instead of a committee to investigate you, you got one to discuss your declaration.
I should have been there.<eos> Where?<eos> When you got shot.<eos> I wish I was there.<eos> Maybe I could've... protected you.
They'll find him soon enough.<eos> We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.<eos> If you can get yourself onto that committee,<eos> I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.<eos> My driver will take you back to your car.
Assistant Director of Counterterrorism, Nathan Green.<eos> And of course all of the work that Secretary Durant has done behind the scenes on all of this.<eos> The information the investigation has gathered so far points to Joshua Masterson and Zachary Hawthorne having strong connections to ICO abroad and ICO's growing network domestically.<eos> And so I would like to say this to ICO directly.<eos> You will not infect the mind of one more of our young people, because I will not stop until I find you.
This is Francis Underwood.<eos> It's him.<eos> The committee is looking for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.<eos> What do either of them have to do with ICO or the war?<eos> The talk up on the Hill is they're going to invite you and the rest of your staff to testify.
I promised you and your daughter that I would...<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> Well, perhaps we should speak when you're feeling a little more up to it.<eos> I don't want to hear you.<eos> Or from you.
Do you know why I pulled you over tonight?
Fuck that. I'm fine.<eos> Tweaked my back this morning at the gym.<eos> My preference would be to walk you out, but I don't have to.<eos> Mr. Mukherjee, my apologies for his behavior.<eos> I can promise you it won't happen again.
Now, I completely understand... the delay is not... that it's due to circumstances beyond your... beyond anyone's control, but there's just so long I can stay on this... this hamster wheel robbing Peter to Pay Paul.<eos> - So there's any way to... - [beep]<eos> Female voice:<eos> Sorry. The mailbox is now full.<eos> My grandson says this will be child's play for you.
There's a route through the boiler room to an unsecured service hatch.<eos> Recent footprints in the dust, how Edison got in, presumably.<eos> I'll get a photographer down there.<eos> Finish up here, then you and Trewlove bring his parents in.<eos> I'll see you back at the station.
Perhaps speak to Bernard.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yes, I argued with Richard.<eos> We overspent our research budget by quite a margin.<eos> And that caused conflict between you and Dr Nielsen?
- No.<eos> I think he took them just before he disappeared.<eos> There you are.<eos> Just the man.<eos> I've been looking for you.
Would you...?<eos> Would you like me to change the music?<eos> I gather opera's more your bag.<eos> Oh, look, don't think too badly of her.<eos> Dorothea holds you in some regard.
It was a house of monsters.<eos> But the men who came to visit your father were heroes, as was he.<eos> The only monster in that house was you.<eos> I read your sister's diary.<eos> - She was terrified of you.
I read your sister's diary.<eos> - She was terrified of you.<eos> - I'd never hurt Penelope!<eos> The only way to get away was by drowning!<eos> She drowned herself to get away from you.
I'm not supposed to talk about this... but I'm on a list.<eos> What kind of list?<eos> There are about 1,200 people here in the US in the event of a major catastrophe, a nuclear war, terrorism, natural disaster, those things, we all get sequestered.<eos> If society ends, we're the ones who are responsible for rebooting it.<eos> They're asking you to make a choice, Alan.
Thank you.<eos> If you ever need anything... look me up here.<eos> Thanks for the drinks.<eos> Hey, hold the elevator, please.<eos> Hey, a shitload more people have disappeared all over, so Cormier wants to see you.
Hide. Ahhh!<eos> Not bad, huh?<eos> Yo, seriously?<eos> Are you not paying attention here?<eos> Get your asses up off the floor before this one shoots you.
There ain't no fire.<eos> There's a guard out there going full-on San Bernardino.<eos> This is where you want to be.<eos> Until he bursts in and we're all sitting ducks.<eos> I'll keep you safe.
Is there anybody else here with you?<eos> No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I chased them away with my sadness.<eos> And I'll chase you away, too.
It's, um, it's a healing river.<eos> - Can it reattach hands?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> I'm going.<eos> I'll catch you on the flip.
- Little Per is your surrogate child.<eos> Is it wrong, if your husband's sperm quality is okay, to look for a donor?<eos> Women should be free to use the sperm they want. And lb doesn't want kids.<eos> Try talking a bit louder.<eos> Table 5 can't hear you.
- You know, cozy time with have grill.<eos> - No. - No?<eos> I don't want you to live unhappy lousy lives with your frigid wives.<eos> But wives love us again. They're not frigid anymore, nope.<eos> Okay. If they really love you again - - I want to hear it from their own mouths.
Maybe it's subconscious.<eos> You do something against your will.<eos> You want to do something but you don't want to after all.<eos> We know what subconscious means.<eos> We'd never kill you on account of alimony.
We'd never kill you on account of alimony.<eos> Nobody deserves to die. Not you either.<eos> - Do you want me to call the police?<eos> - Mind your own business, will you?<eos> - Aren't they threatening to kill you?
Miss Sayre.<eos> Why, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.<eos> What in heaven's name are you doing here?<eos> I thought you'd be off doing military maneuvers or something.<eos> What brings you to town?
Why, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.<eos> What in heaven's name are you doing here?<eos> I thought you'd be off doing military maneuvers or something.<eos> What brings you to town?<eos> I'm looking for you.
In fact, I'm surprised you even have a moment to chat with us, given how busy you must be with all that writing of yours.<eos> Mr. Fitzgerald's going to be a famous writer some day.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I would be rewriting my novel right now, but I can't finish it because I find myself inordinately concerned with your phone line, Miss Sayre.<eos> No matter how many times I'd call, somehow I can't seem to find you in.
No matter how many times I'd call, somehow I can't seem to find you in.<eos> Sounds like the problem's not the phone line.<eos> What were you calling about anyway?<eos> I know that you're, uh, quite sought after.<eos> But I'm not going to be stationed here forever, and I need to get to know you better.
Mind the third rail.<eos> I just want you gone.<eos> Right here.<eos> Pretty sure you've been told, on pain of death, to take me alive. Or I'd be dead by now.<eos> I'm not spending the rest of my life running from you people.
A symbol for what?<eos> For someone who used to work at the lab.<eos> Zack?<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> It is good to see you again.
I mean, we-we know this killer is manipulative.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Zack is guilty, end of story.<eos> Dr. Brennan, oh, wow, it's so good to see you.
Right.<eos> And the box here. I'm assuming that this is Zack Addy's personal effects?<eos> Yes, I... thought you might want to see these.<eos> The photographs, some press clippings...<eos> As you can see, he was very fond of you, Dr. Brennan.
Zack, I've brought you some visitors.<eos> Hodgins.<eos> This is unexpected.<eos> And Miss Delfs.<eos> It is a pleasure to see you again.
You think?<eos> Aubrey, it's Booth.<eos> I want you to put an APB out on Dr. Faulk.<eos> Agent Booth...<eos> Dr. Brennan, it's good to see you again.
All right, Aubrey, do me a favor-- get on this right away and see if you can track them down.<eos> Got it.<eos> Whoa!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
Got it.<eos> Whoa!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> We tried to get you over the intercom, and then when you didn't come, I might have kind of panicked.
I'm okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Thank you for coming to visit.<eos> It is nice to see you both in a non-adversarial climate.
Makes your food taste even better.<eos> The brandy's never been smoother.<eos> Helps settle the stomach.<eos> Doesn't sound very "dentisty."<eos> And what does sound "dentisty" to you, Mr. Fitzgerald?
It can't be much fun peering out at the world from behind that pirate's eye patch, young man.<eos> How about, I'll ring that eye department and chivvy them along?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> I could nip to the telephone now.<eos> They might even squeeze you in this afternoon.
Apart from our cocktail of the day... which is the Grasshopper.<eos> Equal parts creme de menthe, creme de cacao, evap and a dash of cocoa.<eos> Slips down like a liquid after-dinner mint, and then kicks you like a mule.<eos> We got you some bitter lemon.<eos> Actually, I'll have a cocktail, if it's all the same to you.
Ah, good morning.<eos> May I point out that it is eight o'clock and 30 seconds precisely?<eos> And I do not enjoy commencing my day with an impersonation of the speaking clock.<eos> Sister Winifred -- maternity home.<eos> I shall take over from you for the night shift.
And I do not enjoy commencing my day with an impersonation of the speaking clock.<eos> Sister Winifred -- maternity home.<eos> I shall take over from you for the night shift.<eos> Nurse Gilbert -- all the bookings in, plus an extra task in support of Mrs Trudy Watts.<eos> I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Nurse Crane.
Nurse Gilbert -- all the bookings in, plus an extra task in support of Mrs Trudy Watts.<eos> I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Nurse Crane.<eos> Sister Ursula stopped me in the corridor.<eos> There's absolutely no need to apologise, Sister Julienne.<eos> I've put you down as first on call today.
You have got a lovely silhouette.<eos> Don't you start talking to me in French, Fred Buckle.<eos> You don't know where it might end.<eos> Good afternoon, Nurse Gilbert.<eos> What can I do for you?
Good afternoon, Nurse Gilbert.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Do you stock plastic pants, aged five to six?<eos> Could you attend to that light bulb for me, please, Frederick?<eos> Strictly speaking, they're an incontinence garment, not baby linen, but I can telephone one of my wholesalers for you.
I do.<eos> But that means you can be healed.<eos> - Excuse me, please.<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> I can't and I won't barge in without your say-so, but please, let me take a look at you, Trudy.
- Brandy Alexander, Patsy?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> An evening of ulcer-dressing and haemorrhoid compression on the district rounds rather spoilt my appetite.<eos> And if you wouldn't mind getting off my bed... .. I'd quite like a lie-down.<eos> Doctor, if I wasn't aware of Sister Mary Cynthia's need for psychiatric help before I saw you with her yesterday, I am now.
By the main entrance.<eos> There isn't one missing?<eos> No. Are you all right?<eos> Touch of flu.<eos> Er, could I trouble you for the CCTV and the swipe card log?
No.<eos> You liked him, didn't you?<eos> He sort of took me under his wing.<eos> Called me his protege.<eos> If Stephen had found out the truth, that you weren't who you said you were, how would you have stopped him from reporting you?
Erm, Catherine was just about to take me to my room.<eos> But maybe Humphrey can show you.<eos> Gosh, yes, the least I could do.<eos> Let me help you with your bags.<eos> So lovely to see you both.
Mount Esmee.<eos> A thing of awe and wonder.<eos> No-one understood more than Stephen about the power and danger of volcanoes.<eos> It's for that very reason that he was found murdered on one of Mount Esmee's slopes.<eos> The question is which of you did it?
You know, if you had, well... ..even I'd've been convinced it was death by natural causes.<eos> But why?<eos> Why would they do such a thing?<eos> Oh, I think you already know, Mr Richards.<eos> It's because of you.
And in his permanent drug-induced state, I'm sure it wasn't that hard to wear down his defences.<eos> And Emer.<eos> I think you genuinely cared about Stephen.<eos> I'm guessing that Victoria found out about your secret, didn't she?<eos> And used it to bully you into joining them in their plan.
Commissioner.<eos> I believe a number of arrests have been made.<eos> Including Mayor Richards.<eos> Oh, yes, Commissioner.<eos> Though we couldn't have done it without you.
FBI.<eos> We have evidence that you were in the woods at Greenwood Barrens.<eos> So?<eos> Far as I know, there's no law against communing with nature.<eos> Well, unfortunately for you, there is a law against drugs.
But I can't stop stressing about it.<eos> Even if they do call Dr. Brennan for a reference, what if it backfires?<eos> You know, she does have a tendency to be blunt.<eos> That is one way of putting it.<eos> Do you think it'll seem like a red flag if I call the NFL and I ask them to use you as a reference instead?
And I wasn't talking about your eyebrow or your legs.<eos> Thank you, Daisy.<eos> I think it just, you know, took me a while to realize that my legs are merely a way for me to carry around what's in here.<eos> And, you know, what's in here.<eos> I'm happy for you.
Well, I can't argue that.<eos> My proprietary algorithm allows me to recognize millions of objects, gestures, and voice commands. See, Booth?<eos> AMI is no different than us.<eos> That is not accurate, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Unlike you, my memory will never degrade with age.
No wonder the NFL hasn't called.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself, Daisy.<eos> So far, your work here has been perfectly adequate.<eos> Adequate? Yes.<eos> Had I been grading you, I would have given you a solid "B."
Oh, Bones, time to blow out the candles.<eos> Grandpa, you dropped this.<eos> Oh... oh, thank you.<eos> Okay, we're lit up and ready to roll.<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

I have senator Grant for the Governor.<eos> "Congratulations..."<eos> Congratulations, Governor.<eos> You ran a great campaign.<eos> I believe it is time that we unite the country... And I am ready to support you in any way I can.
"Congratulations..."<eos> Congratulations, Governor.<eos> You ran a great campaign.<eos> I believe it is time that we unite the country... And I am ready to support you in any way I can.<eos> God bless you and this great country.
- Good.<eos> I want hourly updates, and I want to know... sir.<eos> Abby.<eos> You need to get to the hospital.<eos> Which one of you is Agent Spaulding?
Do not give her a phone.<eos> His wife wants to tell her children.<eos> I understand that.<eos> She can't.<eos> Sir, imagine if we were talking about your children, - about you...
60% of married adults have had an affair!<eos> - 60%!<eos> - Quinn!<eos> There is no replacing Frankie, but if anyone is qualified to uphold the values he held so dear, it's Vice President-elect Cyrus Beene, the man Governor Vargas himself chose to be his successor in the event of such a tragedy.<eos> God bless you, and God bless America.
Gotcha.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I present Lieutenant Commander General James Rutherford-Carver III.<eos> Phew. That's kind of a mouthful.<eos> Is it okay if I call you Jimmy?
- Honey... find a way to fill those pages.<eos> I only ask that you be safe, be smart, and above all... be true to yourself.<eos> Plus est en vous?<eos> Plus est en vous.<eos> It means, "There is more in you."
I have a son, Lincoln.<eos> My husband's in the ER.<eos> Right?<eos> Ma'am.<eos> He's ready to see you.
Come on, grab your bag.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> How did you find us?<eos> Acontact at the airport saw you get into the wrong taxi.<eos> You're lucky I found you.
How did you find us?<eos> Acontact at the airport saw you get into the wrong taxi.<eos> You're lucky I found you.<eos> This is very radicalized neighborhood.<eos> Whoever set you up couldn't have set you up in a worse way.
You've been made whole, Mr. Bagwell.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Not till you tell me what you've put in me.<eos> You feel an unease, do you?<eos> I'd venture that's what's always been in you since birth. Your soul.
You're free to go.<eos> Not till you tell me what you've put in me.<eos> You feel an unease, do you?<eos> I'd venture that's what's always been in you since birth. Your soul.<eos> I just put the hardware into you.
What do you mean reunited?<eos> Well, she was presumed dead.<eos> Nicole Gordon was never his fiancee.<eos> I am.<eos> Oh, I didn't realize there were two of you.
Aria? You okay?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I-I should get going.<eos> I'll talk to you tomorrow?<eos> Oh, we never got around to discussing the menu for you and Ezra.
So where were you?<eos> Where were you that was more important than being here with me?<eos> I was looking for Mary.<eos> I-I wanted to be here, believe me...<eos> But after everything I put you and your mother through I won't let that woman do any more damage to this family.
I can't.<eos> My mom and I...<eos> Look, I know that this is just A.D.<eos> pressing on a raw nerve, right?<eos> They're just taking the fact that I'm some sort of Dickensian foundling but one of you needs to take this.
Well, my guess is they're in communication.<eos> So we use Sydney to track down Jenna.<eos> And how do we do that?<eos> Just say "Pretty, please tell us where Jenna went?"<eos> Well, if I run you through some Bluesnarf basics we can get what we need through Sydney's cellphone.
Fine, I'll help you and your friends like I always do and then crawl back under a rock.<eos> Mona, come on, it's not like that.<eos> I have literally bled myself for you, Hanna.<eos> Trying to protect you.<eos> How many times do I have to save all of you until I'm finally part of the group?
Because of the book.<eos> Because of my friendship with Charles.<eos> I figured he found out.<eos> But I swear, I swear that I didn't know that he...<eos> She was the one who was torturing you.
Did it?<eos> My understanding is, he was a good cop but that here in Rosewood, he seemed... distracted.<eos> Does that seem like a fair characterization?<eos> I really couldn't say.<eos> Nothing in your relationship led you to believe that he was conflicted in his approach to solving the murder of Archer Dunhill?
But then again, I remember how adept you and your friends are at that sort of thing.<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> - Fairness. It's overrated.<eos> Truth is what counts.<eos> Well, I would say that it's good to see you but under these circumstances...
Your friend's getting her belongings back.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why?<eos> I just received proof that you were not in Rosewood on the night that Dunhill disappeared.<eos> A redlight cam caught you fullfrontal in Keene, New Hampshire.
I was angry, I wanted to punish him.<eos> That was like six years ago.<eos> Fortunately for me there's no statute of limitations so either you deliver that gift or your gonna getting hitched in cell block 17.<eos> Morning.<eos> Did I wake you?
May I come in?<eos> There was an incident at the Radley Hotel on Thursday.<eos> Basements store room was flooded.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because a witness saw you and your friend Caleb there that night.
My mom manages the Radley.<eos> She offered Caleb a room and he upgraded the security system.<eos> Really?<eos> Well that system failed on Thursday between 9:14 and 9:24.<eos> Besides you who else has access?
It's been a long journey for us.<eos> And we talked about having a child our first date.<eos> Didn't we, Em?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you discussed which one of you would, like to carry the child?
That she screwed up?<eos> That she got scared and made a mistake?<eos> There isn't a person in this room who hasn't made a big mistake and doesn't have to live live with it.<eos> Do you know what makes A.D. so dangerous?<eos> She can't forgive, that is the only edge any of you ever have had over her and now you don't even have that.
Do you still see her when you look in the mirror?<eos> The, the loser the pigtails and the frumpy sweaters.<eos> 'Cause I see her.<eos> I see her right now.<eos> None of you are sure when you look in the mirror.
The, the loser the pigtails and the frumpy sweaters.<eos> 'Cause I see her.<eos> I see her right now.<eos> None of you are sure when you look in the mirror.<eos> None of you are really certain who you are.
I see her right now.<eos> None of you are sure when you look in the mirror.<eos> None of you are really certain who you are.<eos> I did that.<eos> I took that away from you the same way everything was stolen from me.
A.D. doesn't have any leverage anymore they've nothing left to threaten us with.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I'm not sure about anything.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I'm sure about one thing I'm sure about all of you.
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van.<eos> How about you just shut up and pay me, Burrows?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.
It's a glorious thing indeed.<eos> Even if I don't have a damn clue how to deal with it.<eos> You and me both.<eos> I've got a way to get our son back, Sara.<eos> I've been planning to bring Jacob down ever since he forced me to turn my back on you and Mike.
Is there a BlueHawaii in there?<eos> Yeah, don't just dillydally, come on in.<eos> I assume you two desperados are Scofield's guys.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He get you out of prison, too?
The ones Poseidon edited out.<eos> Yes, I was there.<eos> I've never denied it.<eos> He forced me to... so he could frame me.<eos> So the blood evidence found in your belongings was because he tasked you with disposing of the body.
Why you?<eos> What do you mean, "Why me"?<eos> I mean, you're a district attorney.<eos> And he's a stool pigeon.<eos> Why would Mr. Boss think he could draw out Mr. Deaux by kidnapping you?
Gather around patriots, truth-seekers and those who believe we need to reset the tree of liberty.<eos> And we all know what that sound is, we have a bombshell today, UpChuckers.<eos> - This is it.<eos> - With me in studio right now, is Billy Cook, eyewitness to the bloodbath at the Max Rager headquarters, and what he is about to impart upon us, my friends, is going to confirm everything.<eos> Your government is plotting against you.
I wish it was that easy.<eos> Today, you guys.<eos> I need more time.<eos> I know how it feels to lose someone you care about to war, but we do what we do for our people.<eos> You slaughter us, we slaughter you.
Welcome back to the coalition.<eos> Time to go.<eos> We'll do our best to keep the king on his throne.<eos> We'll find a way to beat the radiation.<eos> If either of you screw this up, we die.
She'll have the number 12, too, with the egg roll.<eos> - And to drink?<eos> - We'll have two Tsingtao.<eos> Your ID?<eos> I... I don't wanna put you on the spot or anything, um... but we're from the hospice.
What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube.<eos> You've been making progress, but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight.<eos> I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me... and I don't know anything about you.
- No. Well, she did, most of the year.<eos> We're doing up a house.<eos> - What, Ambersea?<eos> - Aye.<eos> Right, we'll get you back over there.
Diaries?<eos> Well, she used to keep all her stuff on the island.<eos> Do you mind if my sergeant has a little look round?<eos> If you need to.<eos> Could I ask you about Alice?
You were also on the boat that arrived at 4:30.<eos> Did you go ashore?<eos> No.<eos> Someone has to stay with the boat, start letting people on.<eos> Would any passengers remember you?
Hello?<eos> Alice?<eos> I didn't mean no contact at all. I meant I hadn't seen her.<eos> Yeah, but you were trying to see her the day she died.<eos> You asked Ryan to take you over to the island.
No comment.<eos> Or perhaps you just pull it ashore and pass it onto the nice tourists.<eos> - No comment.<eos> - Yes, I know, no comment.<eos> Well, the Drug Squad will be talking to you soon.
And hurry up.<eos> Sunny.<eos> Here.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Both of you, I promise.
And it's only a matter of time until the other barons crush you.<eos> They are welcome to try.<eos> Does that mean we are free to leave?<eos> Go, if you wish.<eos> No one will stop you.
Unless you have my money, there's nothing to talk about.<eos> We can talk about the money later.<eos> I'm here to talk about this one.<eos> - Julia...<eos> He's no use to you.
Call.<eos> Nobody touches the cards.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, with my apologies...<eos> I need to ask you to leave at this time.
Why don't you tell me what it is, honey?<eos> If I'd have listened to you, Marius, I'd have lost all my money, hmm?<eos> But of course that was the plan, wasn't it?<eos> Feeding me the cards.<eos> Hmm? What I want from you now is to finally drop the con and admit... that I fucking got you.
What's there left to say, huh, Marius?<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> I should have killed you three years ago.<eos> All of you.
Uh, thank you for waiting so patiently.<eos> Who do we have next?<eos> That'd be me.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> It's so good to see you again.
Who do we have next?<eos> That'd be me.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> It's so good to see you again.<eos> I escorted you and your clients onto my base.
That'd be me.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> It's so good to see you again.<eos> I escorted you and your clients onto my base.<eos> I treated you with hospitality and respect, and now i come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie.
Huh?<eos> B-29.<eos> Fifi's a b-29.<eos> I don't...<eos> Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?
You check your recruiting numbers.<eos> I-i-i -- i think you're gonna see an uptick, and you know what?<eos> If it turns out that fudge wasn't actually in the war -- fudge is not a person.<eos> He wasn't in the war.<eos> Well, neither was tom cruise, and look what "top gun" did for you.
I-i think we just -- we're just gonna have to agree to disagree, so, uh, can I get you that coffee to go or...?<eos> No, no.<eos> I-I'm gonna tell you what's happening now.<eos> You're gonna take that ad off the air.<eos> And if you play that ad one more time, I'm gonna go to the judge advocate, and we will take you down -- trespassing, false representation, stolen valor -- the whole nine yards.
Thanks. Hi.<eos> I, uh, I called earlier about a missing U.S. citizen<eos> - in the Middle East. - Yes.<eos> I'm Henry Kishida.<eos> Let me walk you to the director's office.
It's an unusual situation, which you can appreciate, since your husband is declared legally dead, and the person that you're referring to goes by another name.<eos> I'll take it from here, Henry.<eos> How are you, Sara?<eos> Kellerman?<eos> I'll leave you two be.
You... You are not ISIL? No.<eos> But you're Mohammad El-Tunis, I take it?<eos> _<eos> We are from the city center.<eos> We are here to get you out.
I'll get her out, I promise.<eos> - Go!<eos> - Okay! Okay.<eos> Your father sent me.<eos> I'm getting you out of here.
I don't know.<eos> I-I was supposed to do this a week ago, but then this happened with my daughter.<eos> Thank God you found us.<eos> There's still time to do it.<eos> They're waiting for you in there.
They're the doctors on this one, not you.<eos> And I'm going full mental in here, so I'm gonna go.<eos> Okay. How about this?<eos> When you are discharged, why don't we go up to your parents' lake house?<eos> I'll just pick you up with Mike and we'll go.
There are people in my government, believe it or not, who want that man out for their own convoluted foreign policy over here.<eos> That's the job Whip and I were sent here to do.<eos> But for some reason, we were betrayed.<eos> Which means we're getting out without Ramal.<eos> And every one of you is crucial to that plan.
When he was charged with attempting to murder his father...<eos> Got him out on parole.<eos> After that, you gave him a job, brought him into your home.<eos> A little unorthodox.<eos> Was he working as an investigator for you?
Tell Annalise I'm sorry!<eos> Please!<eos> Tell her I'm sorry!<eos> Obviously, this is a difficult time.<eos> I urge you to use the resources we have available...
Tell her I'm sorry!<eos> Obviously, this is a difficult time.<eos> I urge you to use the resources we have available...<eos> Talking to counselors, taking time off, whatever you need.<eos> The Office of the President will support you.
Um, Mike Richardson, a trustee for the university.<eos> With all due respect, the whole "We're here for you" spiel loses its intended effect when you have legal counsel taking notes.<eos> It's university policy to have adequate record in situations like these.<eos> You mean situations where you need to protect the endowment.<eos> I can assure you my presence is simply about safeguarding your welfare.
I saw Frank last week.<eos> I told him I was pregnant.<eos> And that it was Wes'.<eos> I would have never told him if I ever thought he would hurt Wes.<eos> Did Annalise put you up to this?
And that it was Wes'.<eos> I would have never told him if I ever thought he would hurt Wes.<eos> Did Annalise put you up to this?<eos> I haven't talked to Annalise since the fire.<eos> And Bonnie... she never visited you in the hospital?
My point is, it's awful, isn't it, that this is what happened to him.<eos> Like...<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Did you even know Wes?<eos> Did any of you?
Did you even know Wes?<eos> Did any of you?<eos> I take it that's a no?<eos> Law school isn't really about making friends, right?<eos> Yeah, I bet some of you are really happy that he's dead 'cause that means your ranking goes up one.
She was only asking me to look into a pro bono case.<eos> It's better if you keep your answers as vague as possible.<eos> That way, you technically won't have to lie.<eos> She wanted me to do some research.<eos> And did Keating ask you to do anything else for her that night?
I did this willingly.<eos> And now I have to face the consequences.<eos> Keep going. I can take it.<eos> We have records showing that you swiped into the clinic at 10:53 p.m. that night.<eos> Was it because Professor Keating asked you to go do something for her?
You still are!<eos> Uh, no, I'm not.<eos> His body is missing, Connor!<eos> Do you even care about that?<eos> Do any of you? - Laurel, we all feel bad.
Do you even care about that?<eos> Do any of you? - Laurel, we all feel bad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then think about what that means!<eos> And not just for you, but for Wes.
Then think about what that means!<eos> And not just for you, but for Wes.<eos> Somebody killed him, burned his body, and misplaced it!<eos> And it wasn't Frank.<eos> Maybe none of you can understand how I know that, but he just wouldn't do that to me.
I know you didn't have to.<eos> You could have just... run off to Brazil already.<eos> Is that really an option?<eos> I failed.<eos> I promised to protect you all, and I didn't.
The D.A. really wants to take me down for this.<eos> And I would imagine that anything that they offered would be hard to turn down.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you really call us here to beg us not to tattle on you?
Maybe it was a crime of passion, or...<eos> I said to stop talking.<eos> Oh, my God, do you think she has this room bugged?<eos> Hello?<eos> I can't make Laurel not be mad at you.
It's called the grief process, so don't try and trick me into making you two besties or something.<eos> - That's not why I called you here.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Can I just speak?<eos> I know you, Annalise, and, yes, I just called you Annalise, which I think is appropriate, considering where we are in our relationship.
We both know that... but you've been very steady.<eos> And it means a lot to me, especially right now.<eos> It means a lot to me, too.<eos> So... is it the D.A.'s office again?<eos> You need me to do a little hacky McHackerson for you?
This proves they killed Wes.<eos> No, what it proves is, you don't listen.<eos> What did I tell you about these people?<eos> Tell me what I said.<eos> This could mean that Atwood is working with the Mahoneys to frame you.
Oh, please, Ms. Winterbottom went to visit Mr. Delfino this morning.<eos> Yes, to convince him to re-hire his lawyer, so it wouldn't look like we were colluding, which, ironically, we're now being accused of.<eos> This was all my idea, Judge.<eos> I'm a little offended Mr. Denver's trying to give someone else credit.<eos> All right, let me stop you right there, Mr. Delfino.
- Then what's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Why are you lying?<eos> - 'Cause he's always doing it.<eos> I brought you here to fill the seats behind Annalise, not to bicker.
Ms. Keating has a history of committing unlawful actions to win her cases.<eos> I was trying to protect all of our evidence.<eos> Now.<eos> Transferring the body broke chain of custody, according to Rule 901.<eos> Anyone, including you, could have manipulated the evidence.
You're trying to make sense out of things that don't make sense, choosing a target for your anger.<eos> - You still haven't answered my question.<eos> - You know the answer.<eos> I don't.<eos> Every bad thing that we've done starts with you.
There you go again, deflecting.<eos> No, no, no, you two dragged us into your Oedipal crap - and we've all been trying to clean it up! - You should've left!<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Well, you bailed on that plan because your boyfriend wouldn't run away with you.<eos> I was trying to protect him from you.
We will reveal the identity as we get closer to the trial.<eos> Either way, this case deserves to go before a jury.<eos> At the very least, we owe that to Mr. Gibbins.<eos> There's no need to delay my decision.<eos> Your Honor, I urge you to take more time with the facts of this hearing.
- Last night around 7:00 p.m.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Not even a full 24 hours?<eos> No, but...<eos> You sure he's not just trying to get away from the two of you?
Wes Gibbins' phone.<eos> You had it this whole time?<eos> Or we found it in your car when we brought you into custody, proving that you killed Wes.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Do the Mahoneys have something on you?
- What's going on?<eos> Connor Walsh, you're under arrest for the murder of Wes Gibbins.<eos> - You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - No, this is a set-up.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
There's no way I could live with myself, so just...<eos> Please, come home.<eos> He was scared... as was I.<eos> And I didn't want the police to hear him confessing.<eos> Or you didn't want them to hear how it incriminated you.
Now Wes is gonna go down for Sam and Rebecca, and the two of you get off.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> You need to grow the hell up!<eos> I'm doing this for you...<eos> Each of you...
Well, you know what?<eos> You need to grow the hell up!<eos> I'm doing this for you...<eos> Each of you...<eos> So you don't have to go to prison and get naked in group showers and crap in front of people that might rape you.
But I can't.<eos> Get that family to the airport as fast as you can.<eos> I'll work something out.<eos> Mr. Burrows?<eos> I wanted to thank you for saving my daughter.
No.<eos> It's not here, no.<eos> That's because I have it in my cell.<eos> My armies of the caliphate are coming closer.<eos> The moment they reach this place, all of you will be put down like the dogs that you are.
- Well, give me the key.<eos> - I don't have the key.<eos> You passed the guy who does.<eos> Stay back!<eos> I don't want to shoot you!
- You sent him!<eos> Take him!<eos> All of you!<eos> Will you stay here?<eos> And let ISIL slaughter you?
They're here.<eos> They're close.<eos> Welcome, my enemies.<eos> How many millennia have I waited.<eos> I will send you to the Netherworld... to take my place.
As... you... commmand, Master.<eos> We do not belong here, demon.<eos> No!<eos> Good-bye, my family.<eos> I love you all.
They're an exceptional firm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I will send that info over today. A-and Ms. Wexler will follow up herself shortly.<eos> "Thanks for the meat." Uh.<eos> A-and she says thank you for the steaks.
But you can't let one little misunderstanding destroy years of friendship.<eos> Oh, it's just not the same, Jimmy.<eos> She showed her true colors.<eos> When it came to that settlement, we were the furthest things from her mind.<eos> It just took her a bit to realize what was important to you.
Okay-Dokey.<eos> Testing. Testing.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> I know that many of you were expecting Sandy for this morning's chair yoga, but her daughter has a cold.
So, he created a cell within the CIA called 21-Void, implementing his own intelligence operations.<eos> And he needed my help breaking out people imprisoned all over the world.<eos> Terrorists, political dissidents... rogue agents... and if I did it, you and Sara, you'd go free.<eos> Your record's expunged, but... there was a rub.<eos> I wasn't allowed to have contact with any of you, including my son.
At first, I said no.<eos> I wouldn't do it.<eos> Then within weeks, Sara was incarcerated, beaten.<eos> And so I gave in.<eos> Everything I did, I did for family, for you, for Sara, for Mike... so none of you would ever have to spend another day inside a prison cell or...
Phaeacia. Old smuggling friends.<eos> Autonomous zone.<eos> No ISIL. Perfect.<eos> Not perfect.<eos> Four of you, one of me.
I want a map to this Phaeacia place.<eos> You do realize this is Yemen, don't you?<eos> Phaeacia is a hundred people. Mud huts.<eos> There is no map.<eos> But I can lead you there.
Look, protocol says no.<eos> We stay clear of CIA, any offensive action.<eos> We're surveillance only.<eos> We just want to put eyes on him.<eos> I think I can get you in as observers under interagency auspices.
I'm not leaving you out here to die.<eos> I have no intention of dying.<eos> Anyway, you've got the harder job.<eos> You've got to find Phaeacia out there somewhere.<eos> Leave tracks so I know how to find you.
Come on!<eos> Come on, Mike, come on.<eos> Where are the tracks?<eos> Where are the tracks?<eos> This is for you.
He's a CIA operative, deep cover.<eos> He runs a splinter cell called 21-void.<eos> What does this have to do with you?<eos> He targeted me for my skills, blackmailed me.<eos> He told me if I didn't agree to come work for him, he'd go after you and Linc, put you both in jail.
What does this have to do with you?<eos> He targeted me for my skills, blackmailed me.<eos> He told me if I didn't agree to come work for him, he'd go after you and Linc, put you both in jail.<eos> And then he proved it to me.<eos> He said I could never see either one of you again.
He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.<eos> He targeted me for my skills.<eos> Michael, he's with our son right now.<eos> I'll get to the States as soon as I can.<eos> Did my husband, Jacob Ness, ask you to work on my cell phone?
Do you think they noticed?<eos> Let's not take any chances.<eos> Guys.<eos> Your faces were on the news.<eos> Somebody sees you, this thing is over.
That guy out there is a DEA informant.<eos> We have him in our pocket.<eos> He owes us.<eos> He's got three vans full of agents that are waiting for his call.<eos> They're gonna rain down on you and your pills.
Looks bad.<eos> Might need to come off.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Come on, I'm begging you.
You need to hit the head before things...<eos> Oh, there it goes.<eos> Offices of Jimmy Mcgill.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> I'm sorry. May I put you on hold?
Thank you.<eos> Offices of Jimmy Mcgill.<eos> Please hold.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> What can I do for you?
Where the heck is it?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> If it's in here, I'll... ah.<eos> There it is.<eos> Oh. May I clean this for you?
Thank you.<eos> That was very nice of you.<eos> No problem.<eos> It's my pleasure.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?
I'm... i'm just worried about Jimmy.<eos> But if I tell him...<eos> I don't want to get in trouble, too.<eos> Tell Jimmy what?<eos> Lily, I want to thank you for bringing your mom down.
Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> And you tell your friends, even if they already Have a will, it's important to get it updated, Just like you did.<eos> I'll tell them.<eos> Now, you remember Francesca...<eos> She'll take care of you the rest of the way.
If it punctures the chamber...<eos> We're more or less fucked.<eos> Our escort ship isn't responding.<eos> Errinwright must've covered that, too.<eos> He delivered you to the enemy like a Christmas present.
Plus, she's really old.<eos> We've got a defensible position here.<eos> I'll hold it as long as I can.<eos> Go to the airlock.<eos> I'm not leaving you two.
We exchange hostages.<eos> One of yours for Avasarala.<eos> So I know you won't shoot us down after we launch.<eos> This is a pleasure yacht, not a gunship.<eos> But I'll escort you to the hangar myself.
I couldn't believe it either at first.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> - Simon.<eos> - Hey, Mrs. F.<eos> Good to see you on your feet again.
Now... Let's get to it.<eos> I've reviewed your statements, along with the reports of your unsanctioned missions.<eos> And I can come to no other conclusion that Jace Wayland is a traitor to the Clave.<eos> Jace is not a traitor.<eos> Point of fact. Clary said Jace called to warn you about Valentine's trap, which got me thinking... Jace had multiple chances to kill Valentine, but chose to let him leave.
There is no way we're going to help you hunt Jace.<eos> And I'd never ask you to.<eos> You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.<eos> What?<eos> The rest of you, back to work.
See, that's why you want Clary, and that is why you always will.<eos> Everyone run.<eos> Get out. Out, now.<eos> Hey, out!<eos> Which one of you is Maria?
Who's asking?<eos> Jace is back.<eos> Call off your men.<eos> Izzy and I will bring him back alive.<eos> One step ahead of you.
- None of this is your fault.<eos> Alec, he's stressed out.<eos> With his parabatai gone, he's like a different person.<eos> Alec's right.<eos> I'm not one of you.
Gretel was our pack member.<eos> And she was my friend.<eos> You need to pay for what you did to her.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> Valentine used me, just like he's using you right now.
You did.<eos> Mr. Santiago...<eos> Thank you for coming in.<eos> Not like I had much of a choice.<eos> Believe me, I was hoping to resolve our little vampire den dilemma without dragging you in here.
But you don't have the authority to kick me out, so you're making my life hell.<eos> And now you're trying to sabotage any shred of credibility I have left?<eos> If you choose to stay, I'll have no other choice but to show everyone who they're living with.<eos> Who they're fighting alongside.<eos> Sister Cleophas, I don't wanna scare you, but I'm worried.
You can't seriously expect us to believe that.<eos> - Luke, you're not helping.<eos> - It's okay, Clarissa.<eos> I know where Valentine's hiding.<eos> I can lead you to him.
Madzie wants to help.<eos> That is, unless you'd rather I give her the injections.<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> Then I'll leave you two to get acquainted, huh?
Careful.<eos> Seelie armor.<eos> Means war.<eos> I noticed.<eos> So I assume you all know why I called you here.
Execute Clary Fairchild on sight.<eos> Care to rethink that?<eos> You'd be rotting in the City of Bones had she not insisted we save your life.<eos> Then consider this my way of returning the favor.<eos> By killing her, I'll be saving you from yourselves.
What are you talking about?<eos> I'd recognize that perfume anywhere.<eos> Then you're no different from the rest of us.<eos> I'll admit, I know her charms better than anyone.<eos> But unlike you, my feelings never affect my judgment.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's...<eos> Captain, hello.<eos> How...<eos> What can we do for you?
It's really you.<eos> Yeah, it's me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm your doctor, Mr. Gasmer.<eos> I'm here to take care of you.
Yeah, it's me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm your doctor, Mr. Gasmer.<eos> I'm here to take care of you.<eos> I have never laid eyes on you before in my life.
- The Spear of Destiny?<eos> - Could be.<eos> I'm gonna go tell the others.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> So this would be a new milestone for you then.
Hey, what's up?<eos> Sara asked us to find any physical descriptions of the spear that might help us find it.<eos> She thinks Rip had it with him when he traveled to 1967.<eos> And she, um, also wants you to work on figuring out, um, a way to reverse the effects, uh, on Rip since he came in contact with the, um... Time drive.<eos> I've brought up the time drive's schematics for you, Dr. Palmer.
I am not Rip Hunter!<eos> I am... nobody. I...<eos> I can't believe this is happening to me.<eos> You're gonna torture me, aren't you?<eos> Oh, I'm not gonna torture you, Mr. Hunter.
January 2025.<eos> Oh, you got somewhere to go?<eos> Funny, just like clockwork...<eos> Take the Time Sphere back to 2025 and secure the rest of the Spear.<eos> The next one of you who screws up will lose more than just a tooth.
Wait, she wants to try networking an ancient amulet with an advanced AI system?<eos> I'm totally helping.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then I would appreciate it if you...<eos> If none of you would reveal to her that she's an Aberration.
No one knows who to trust.<eos> So they all end up screwing each other over.<eos> It's an interesting theory.<eos> Which one are we?<eos> The point is that neither of you are Clint Eastwood and so neither of you end up going home with the gold.
I mean, we used to go with your mum and dad this time of year.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.

No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep. That's real.<eos> Or when you were seven and you took your silly rowing boat out and you got lost in that storm, and me and your dad were out, shouting and screaming, losing our minds.<eos> And when your dad found you, how he cried.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.

I'm the one you seek.<eos> I'm the demon's head.<eos> I am Ra's al Ghul.<eos> RA'S AL GHUL: Why have you come to me, Bruce?<eos> The Sensei told me to seek you out.
Master Bruce, there's no other way to put it.<eos> He's wrong.<eos> Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.<eos> And one day, you're gonna remember that.<eos> And you're gonna remember how much I love you.
He's wrong.<eos> Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.<eos> And one day, you're gonna remember that.<eos> And you're gonna remember how much I love you.<eos> I remember the first time your mum and dad brought you home.
And one day, you're gonna remember that.<eos> And you're gonna remember how much I love you.<eos> I remember the first time your mum and dad brought you home.<eos> They were so exhausted.<eos> And they gave you to me.
You can't.<eos> You can't.<eos> You cannot do this.<eos> It's a small price to pay for saving the city.<eos> Yeah, for you.
- They said we could head there now.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Detective Gordon, just in time.<eos> If you'll take a seat and roll up your sleeve.<eos> We have a dose ready for you right now.
- We don't wanna fight you.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Your family.<eos> - Caitlin, I love you.<eos> - I never loved any of you.
Overwatch!<eos> You heard the boss.<eos> This is an eyes-only operation for you.<eos> I have eyes on.<eos> Boys, I just put you on a separate channel.
Man, there won't be a trial.<eos> As soon as I'm out of here,<eos> Walker will concoct some reason to put a bullet in my head.<eos> Ahh. Sergeant Diggle.<eos> Heh. Good to see you again.
Follow me or die.<eos> Find out what's happening.<eos> Hello, Mr. Queen.<eos> My name is Talia.<eos> I've been looking for you.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> Follow me or die.<eos> Hello, Mr. Queen.<eos> My name is Talia.<eos> I've been looking for you.
Aw, so sweet.<eos> I thought you two were just cop buddies, but...<eos> You can tell me, Vin.<eos> You're tapping that sweet ass, aren't you?<eos> I wasn't sure which one of you to kill.
We are gonna talk about that, right?<eos> Yes. We're gonna talk about that.<eos> Right now, we need to focus on finding the others.<eos> Where are they?<eos> I wish I knew so I could tell you to go screw yourselves.
Why did Chase split up all the hostages?<eos> Why does Chase do anything?<eos> So far, he hasn't laid out a single hoop you could keep yourself from jumping through.<eos> Maybe leaving me here was part of the plan.<eos> How'd Chase get you here?
Malcolm, can you fly a plane?<eos> If it's anything like the 3 Gulfstreams I used to have, yes.<eos> Get them to the mainland and then come right back for us.<eos> We are not leaving you here.<eos> I need to focus, and that means getting you out of harm's way, and despite my better instincts, when this is all over, I will come back for you.
- Hey.<eos> Hoss, you ok?<eos> Rene.<eos> Ok, everyone. Calm down.<eos> The four of you are gonna have plenty of time to catch up.
Heh. I forgot how stubborn you could be.<eos> Huh! Oh, my God!<eos> Ahh. Thank you for reminding me.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I'm gonna take care of them, disarm the mine, and I'll catch up with you.
Feels like a lifetime ago.<eos> For Shado, it was.<eos> No time for nostalgia.<eos> I know where they're going.<eos> Do either of you know anything about this place that could give us a tactical advantage?
So what's going on at home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mom and Reggie were arguing a lot, and then all of a sudden he goes to Hong Kong.<eos> There's been an officer-involved shooting.<eos> I got a call to pick you up and bring you to the scene.
I can't stand to look at you.<eos> I agreed to accept the position of Interim Chief of Police to honor my son and help lead the department out of this current crisis.<eos> But I will not be accepting the job permanently, no matter who wins the election.<eos> You're just gonna walk away?<eos> I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
The jury found for the plaintiff.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Detective, did the jury in that case conclude that you had planted evidence?<eos> - No.<eos> - Did the findings against you involve falsifying of evidence in any way?
It's good.<eos> Salty. Slurpy.<eos> Naw, I'm not hungry, but I'm gonna grab a beer and come join you.<eos> So, Grace, what brings you by?<eos> Just checking on you two, making sure you're getting along.
Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, Stef was with Jesus, so I thought I would come by and talk with some of his teachers.<eos> Oh, you haven't met Drew.<eos> Drew Turner, this is Lena Adams Foster.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
- bomb? - Yeah.<eos> That's the point.<eos> I read this book, My Year with Eleanor.<eos> And it's based on that thing Eleanor Roosevelt supposedly said:<eos> "You should do one thing a day that scares you."
Sit.<eos> John Diggle, it's good to see you.<eos> Now you're my favorite American.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So what brings you to Russia?
So maybe if Susan Williams--<eos> Mister--Mr.<eos> Mayor!<eos> - There's a shooter in the building.<eos> Wait-- we need to get you to a secure locat--
Citywide gun control ordinances.<eos> Nothing that makes it harder to buy or own or carry a gun.<eos> It also doesn't prohibit people from protecting themselves.<eos> From gun violence.<eos> Ok. I'm gonna back you on this if for no other reason than the optics of fighting this after what happened are lousy.
It's why you live here far away from Star City.<eos> I moved away because there was nothing left for me there.<eos> Ms. Westfield, your son is an incredibly capable and incredibly dangerous individual.<eos> He has erased virtually all traces of his identity from the Internet, and I am...<eos> Well, I am here simply to ask you for his name.
You and what army?<eos> This one!<eos> It's amazing the loyalty money can buy.<eos> Take them down.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy watching them take you down.
I can only imagine, given your other job, and... you're right...<eos> Your CAT scan is clear.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Not so fast. Look.<eos> I can't discharge you without a few more hours of observation.
- Not so fast. Look.<eos> I can't discharge you without a few more hours of observation.<eos> Dr. Schwartz...<eos> People can withstand only so much strain, and being both mayor and him, it's unsustainable.<eos> I assure you, my body can handle it.
It seems that you are deciding vote, Viktor.<eos> What say you, my friend?<eos> We have a new Pakhan.<eos> This is most disappointing.<eos> I liked many of you.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.<eos> This is most disappointing.<eos> I liked many of you.
I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I've been working on addressing our sentencing policy for drug offenses.<eos> Care to join?<eos> I'd like to see you in my office, please.
Roger that.<eos> - Please don't hurt me.<eos> - Mrs. Chase.<eos> What are you doing in my hou...<eos> Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.<eos> - You're insane.<eos> - Doris, please.<eos> You need to understand the truth.<eos> You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.
He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.<eos> That's all. Thank you.<eos> Thanks for seeing me. I know it's late.<eos> Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.<eos> What can I do for you?
The information we gave you didn't help?<eos> Different friend.<eos> You have a lot of missing friends.<eos> Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.<eos> You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
What are you doing?<eos> He will never tell you truth in that much pain.<eos> Does this have to do with your deal with Kovar, yes?<eos> Samovol'shchnia.<eos> If you knew what it was or what is coming, you will beg Kovar to spare you.
Give me a second chance.<eos> And if second chance doesn't work?<eos> Miss Venediktov...<eos> Eh, he's--he's fine.<eos> Well, he's unconscious, but he--look, I'm sorry that I scared you the other night.
Canisters are in a storeroom, southwest corner, second floor.<eos> Copy that.<eos> If you would be so kind and let us in now, please.<eos> Alarms and cameras are disabled.<eos> I'll meet you at the target.
Confess, Oliver.<eos> When you see Taiana in afterlife--heh heh-- give her a kiss for me.<eos> - I'm going to finish this.<eos> - No!<eos> Are you going to let your Pakhan finish this for you, Mr. Queen, eh?
I'll meet you by the side entrance.<eos> The Bratva aren't backing down, which means I have to stop them.<eos> John has convinced me not to do it alone.<eos> I wanted to shut all of this down because I was afraid.<eos> I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase would corrupt you more than... More than I already have.
I wanted to shut all of this down because I was afraid.<eos> I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase would corrupt you more than... More than I already have.<eos> To me, the... the...<eos> The Bratva was the best option, but John insists that as a team, we can find another way to bring Chase to justice.<eos> You've put your faith in me, and I'm putting my faith in you now.
And we'd be going in completely blind.<eos> We have a greater chance of success if we let Helix come to us.<eos> Wait, Lyla.<eos> You want to set a trap for Helix and use James as the bait?<eos> I don't think I need to tell either of you how dangerous Helix is.
It's already done.<eos> Listen, Oliver, where are we on finding Chase?<eos> Right where he is.<eos> We're nowhere.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the building.
Oliver, we're not leaving.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> We're not abandoning you.<eos> I understand that you're not abandoning me.<eos> You're doing what I'm asking you to do because Ch--
We're not abandoning you.<eos> I understand that you're not abandoning me.<eos> You're doing what I'm asking you to do because Ch--<eos> Chase knows how I think.<eos> He knows that if he puts the two of you in danger-- and he's going to try to--that...
I understand that you're not abandoning me.<eos> You're doing what I'm asking you to do because Ch--<eos> Chase knows how I think.<eos> He knows that if he puts the two of you in danger-- and he's going to try to--that...<eos> My instinct will be to pull you close.
So do something he's not expecting.<eos> Split up.<eos> No, that's--<eos> What about you?<eos> If I don't have to worry about the two of you, then I can put my focus towards finding the others.
Hasn't been back.<eos> Do you know where he was going?<eos> If he was travelling with anyone?<eos> Well, like I say, we try to keep them fed and warm, no questions asked.<eos> I recognize you, don't I?
Killed an eleven-year-old boy.<eos> We have reason to believe that someone from our side is feeding Corbett information and we believe that that person is Detective John Cardinal of the Algonquin Bay Police Department.<eos> Delorme's been transferred to Cardinal's section at my request.<eos> She's our inside guy.<eos> Hansen, I brought you in to work the Sudbury side.
You can confirm...?<eos> Bianca Mankyo.<eos> Yes, that's her.<eos> You had him.<eos> He taunted you and then you let him get away.
-It is. We want to know about the protomolecule.<eos> Then you should talk to Dr. dresden.<eos> -He's dead.<eos> -What?<eos> He can't control you anymore.
And if he'd been willing to talk, you'd be thrown in the brig right now.<eos> But he wasn't.<eos> That's how martian he is.<eos> Current appearances to the contrary, he is one of the toughest dusters I've served with.<eos> So this is about you.
So this is about you.<eos> We trained all our lives for this.<eos> Now it's here and we just want to use it.<eos> The sooner we have it out with earth the better.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Not people.<eos> Building something.<eos> Building what?<eos> We're going to find out! I need evidence.<eos> I'm asking you for help.
What if it's a weapon?<eos> We need a gunship to deliver the bombs and to provide cover in case we run into any hostiles.<eos> We need the Roci.<eos> And her crew.<eos> This is gonna destroy you.
We have to be sure.<eos> We swore an oath and have a duty to broadcast the truth to the system. Listen to me, Doctor, you have no idea what you're dealing with here.<eos> It's not a disease, it's obviously some kind of weapon.<eos> You Martians have been using these Belters as guinea pigs.<eos> If any one of you are infected, you could wipe out millions!
- Arjun?<eos> - How are you holding up?<eos> Acid stomach.<eos> And ravenous for a big thick steak...<eos> I assume they'll be evacuating you here to Luna.
Holden!<eos> Alex, tap the brakes but do not lose visual.<eos> What the hell did we accomplish?<eos> You gotta stop following Eros.<eos> It's gonna defend itself, and my money ain't on you.
You want us to attack a Martian moon?<eos> That's a declaration of war.<eos> We trained all our lives for this.<eos> The sooner we have it out with Earth, the better.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. We're not going to Earth.
These aren't rock-hopper mining nukes. These are planet busters. Designed to evade the best defense systems.<eos> If the wrong person picks 'em up, it could be a problem.<eos> Especially if they're smart enough to remove the counter-measures.<eos> The missiles could be re-targeted, and sent right back at the Inners, or anyone else in the system, for that matter.<eos> This doesn't seem to be bothering you.
Look on the bright side, Marine.<eos> At least you're finally off the bus.<eos> You know, I really hope Eros was our tech.<eos> Be nice to have something in our back pocket to turn Earth to slag if need be.<eos> Well, fortunately for our species, no human being is dumb enough to put you in charge, Hillman.
God!<eos> God, I hate space.<eos> Holden: You're gonna want tohearthisstory.<eos> Now what story is that?<eos> Maybe it's the one about why the rock I sent you to exploded into a nuclear fireball?
God, I hate space.<eos> Holden: You're gonna want tohearthisstory.<eos> Now what story is that?<eos> Maybe it's the one about why the rock I sent you to exploded into a nuclear fireball?<eos> Or what happened to the opa operative I tasked you to find?
That's why we're talking to you.<eos> You're the military genius.<eos> Well, I don't do that kind of thing anymore.<eos> And the opa is not an army...<eos> We're going, with or without you.
They're a friendly bunch, they'll have whatever you need.<eos> Union offices are about two levels down from here, and the tycho station admin, just past that.<eos> Y'all can apply for assistance at either one of those, if you need.<eos> Now your lodgings are gonna be right around that corner, all right?<eos> But I can set you up and get you transport if you want to go somewhere else, so don't be shy.
No.<eos> I'm scared shitless.<eos> Feeling guilty as hell.<eos> Please god, stop trying to take credit for every damn thing that's wrong in the universe.<eos> I'm talking about all of you.
Deimos was the smallest move the secretary general could swallow.<eos> Big symbol, minimal body count.<eos> Anyone with half a brain knew we were not going to leave that room without an escalation.<eos> I'm honored you think you gotta justify your actions to me...<eos> I'm simply telling you how your tantrum got you sidelined.
colonel Johnson wasn't told that they'd surrendered.<eos> If he knew, he would have never called that strike in.<eos> Why wasn't he told?<eos> Because the powers that be wanted to send a message to the belt.<eos> "Defy us, we wipe you out." Message sent.
All right.<eos> Staz, split them up into four groups.<eos> Five of you guys come with me.<eos> Stay sharp. Everybody stay sharp and watch the doors and corners.<eos> Doors and corners are where they get you.
You... come on, you guys aren't gonna make this a big thing, are you?<eos> _<eos> Tough talk today from apartment leaders who are calling for the deportation of boyfriends living illegally in unit 3R.<eos> - I'm joined by Megan.<eos> - Hi. Megan, why is this such a hot-button issue for you?
- No one wants you!<eos> - Go!<eos> - Listen to me. Hear my words.<eos> I first came to this apartment with nothing but the shirt on my back, my toothbrush, and my phone and my phone charger, uh, but through it all, I never lost sight of the dream of coming to this beautiful apartment<eos> and hanging out with Lucy, so, please, I ask you...
Where do they usually hang out?<eos> These days?<eos> Guyana.<eos> My bros, my bros.<eos> Your girlfriends don't accept you.
These days?<eos> Guyana.<eos> My bros, my bros.<eos> Your girlfriends don't accept you.<eos> They want to change you.
Your girlfriends don't accept you.<eos> They want to change you.<eos> They want to make your apartment look more "adult."<eos> They want to make you a new dude.<eos> But I accept you as the dude that you are.
They want to change you.<eos> They want to make your apartment look more "adult."<eos> They want to make you a new dude.<eos> But I accept you as the dude that you are.<eos> And I love you unconditionally.
Yes.<eos> Father Brown and Mrs McCarthy from St Mary's and this is Miss Windermere.<eos> Friend of St Mary's Church.<eos> Are you here to burn us at the stake?<eos> We're here to invite you to dinner.
How did you get on, Father?<eos> I think we face an uphill struggle.<eos> People fear what they do not understand.<eos> You surprise me, Mrs McCarthy.<eos> Never had you down for open-minded.
Oh, well, perhaps you need a knight to aid you in your quest.<eos> Dione Moon.<eos> D-I-O-N-E.<eos> M-O-O-N.<eos> Thank you, Miss Moon.
You are young and, dare I say, sheltered.<eos> This dinner of Father Brown's, it's highly inappropriate.<eos> I take people as I find them.<eos> And aside from being partially clothed, I found them to be perfectly charming.<eos> Well, it is they who have charmed you.
Can you give me a precise location?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, don't touch anything.<eos> I'll get reinforcements to you as soon as possible.<eos> I'll leave you to write up the report.
Mr Malone's allegation was investigated and found to be unsubstantiated.<eos> Not quite, sir.<eos> I stand corrected.<eos> Found to be down to misinterpretation.<eos> So if you'll excuse me, my sergeant here will show you out, allowing me to get on with my enquiries.
This way, gentlemen.<eos> So you didn't manage to bring back a single mushroom?<eos> You do know, of course, that mushrooms are best picked at daybreak.<eos> Well, I was rather sidetracked by the discovery of a rotting corpse.<eos> Yes, well, trust you to find an excuse.
Excuse me, it's an emergency.<eos> Mortal at the very least.<eos> A mortal sin, no less?<eos> There's about to be if you don't get to Crows Corner, statim!<eos> There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practises divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer or a charmer or a medium or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead.
Dragged through a hedge backwards is quite the look this season.<eos> Either that or a sadistic madwoman forced me out into the woods at daybreak gather mushrooms.<eos> Here you are and I hope you're satisfied.<eos> All this fuss about a bit of honest dirt.<eos> If you still think of attending this imprudent gathering, can I urge you to think of your reputation?
Now, what this young lady needs...<eos> You think I need protection, don't you, Reverend?<eos> It goes without saying.<eos> Oh, well, then, in that case, I accept.<eos> And if it's frightfully dull, then I know I can rely on you for entertaining conversation.
And if it's frightfully dull, then I know I can rely on you for entertaining conversation.<eos> I think you... Yoo-hoo!<eos> Minister.<eos> I've just persuaded the reverend to join us for dinner.<eos> I don't suppose we can tempt you?
I am late for the African orphans.<eos> So, if you can leave those at the back door and I will collect them later.<eos> I think Miss Windermere's got the wrong end of...<eos> If we're to be dinner companions, you must call me Penelope.<eos> If I may call you Peter?
So, if you can leave those at the back door and I will collect them later.<eos> I think Miss Windermere's got the wrong end of...<eos> If we're to be dinner companions, you must call me Penelope.<eos> If I may call you Peter?<eos> The evil spreads, and one by one they suck you in.
Mrs McCarthy will explain.<eos> Hello?<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> I let myself in.<eos> Like you, my door is always open.
And these would be the same mushrooms that you forced me out into the wood to gather at daybreak?<eos> I could hardly trust you not to poison us all.<eos> Even if someone else hadn't got to them first.<eos> So why make me?<eos> Because I thought it might keep you out of trouble for a little while.
Very well, I'll do the dirty deed.<eos> You've been avoiding me.<eos> I know why.<eos> You do?<eos> My declaration was sudden and alarmed you.
I invited a few friends to celebrate with us.<eos> Well, of course.<eos> How crude we'd be if we didn't.<eos> Hey-hey! - Congratulations.<eos> Congratulations, both of you.
I dare say Scott was the prettiest chorus girl the Triangle Club has ever had.<eos> Prettier than I am?<eos> I was as pretty as you are, and you're as handsome as me.<eos> We're two of a kind.<eos> Yes, although only one of you was propositioned by a pair of Princeton linemen.
Danny Egan has been filling in as my cohost this week, and we think that he is doing a terrific job.<eos> We'll be right back with more "CBS This Morning."<eos> - And we're clear.<eos> - Okay, well, we got that done.<eos> Madam President, it's so good to see you.
Congressman Diaz said that optics of you in the Bronx are really good.<eos> Okay, well, then maybe I can host "Showtime at the Apollo" next week.<eos> - I'll check on that.<eos> - No, don't.<eos> - We love you, Selina!
We can't do anything about AIDS.<eos> Who are you, Ronald Reagan?<eos> - Hi, everyone.<eos> - Hi, darling.<eos> Your daughter is here to see you.
Family meeting is adjourned. La-la-la-la.<eos> Everybody up.<eos> Get up.<eos> Out, out.<eos> I love you, but get out.
- Hello.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Good morning.<eos> This is Captain Stevens.<eos> I'd like to welcome you all aboard flight 327, Omaha to New York.
Is that really just on a cell signal?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> This is the amazing new company PiperChat.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I saw you at TechCrunch.
Look, look, look. - God damn it!<eos> Listen to me. We are desperate.<eos> We need funding.<eos> - You need funding? - Yes.<eos> Hit a million daily active users while sustaining the same kind of growth, then everybody in town will be trying to kidnap you.
I flew the company plane to Shanghai, then Moffett, then Jackson Hole.<eos> Then I flew back to Shanghai, then to Jackson Hole, then to Moffett, which is where I just landed.<eos> - And?<eos> - Moffett is 28.3 minutes closer.<eos> I fucking knew it! Barker should've dropped you off first, sir.
You're wondering why I brought you all here.
No.<eos> We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse.<eos> If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won.<eos> With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.<eos> I never properly thanked you for that.
We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse.<eos> If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won.<eos> With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.<eos> I never properly thanked you for that.<eos> They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.
The people whose hearts you aim to win.<eos> If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes.<eos> Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.<eos> But if you let me live, I will serve you well.<eos> I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you.
Swear this to me, Varys.<eos> If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back.<eos> You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.<eos> I swear it, my queen.<eos> And I swear this... if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.
- No, too dangerous.<eos> - But?<eos> But if the Army of the Dead makes it past the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?<eos> If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she'll destroy the realm as we know it.<eos> Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.
Rickard, isn't it?<eos> Dickon.<eos> That's it.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance, now more than ever.
I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarly.<eos> The infection has spread too far.<eos> You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.<eos> How long?<eos> It'll be years before it kills you.
And what is left of her now?<eos> Ashes.<eos> Commoners, nobles, they're all just children, really.<eos> They won't obey you unless they fear you.<eos> I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your counsel.
If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.<eos> Our army should be Westerosi.<eos> And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?<eos> You are.<eos> Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.
Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.<eos> Do I have your support?<eos> You have mine.<eos> Dorne is with you, Your Grace.<eos> Thank you all.
Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer, but an excellent researcher.<eos> - Archmaester, I wondered if I...<eos> - And this one.<eos> Maester Faull was quite the opposite... a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.<eos> Um, I wanted to ask you...
I never asked for it.<eos> But I accepted it because the North is my home.<eos> It's part of me, and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.<eos> But the odds are against us.<eos> None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.
Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.<eos> I was sorry when he died.<eos> Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much.<eos> So did I.<eos> She wasn't fond of you, was she?
I was sorry when he died.<eos> Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much.<eos> So did I.<eos> She wasn't fond of you, was she?<eos> Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.
He'll crush you with one hand.<eos> Father got careless. That's what Mama says.<eos> Will you shut up about Mama?<eos> "Mama, Mama, Mama."<eos> Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.
Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.<eos> And then I won't have to share.<eos> "Mama!"<eos> How can you drink this piss?<eos> When we reach Sunspear, I'll treat you to a Dornish red.
Sit your ass down.<eos> Because you have a three as your first letter in your number.<eos> - Ew, 35? - Mm-mm.<eos> Yeah, that's really bad.<eos> Okay, so if my friend Adam here pointed to you, why don't you come on up, tell us a little bit about yourself, what makes you tick.
This thing works. [The Skinny Boys' "Jock Box"] Uh-oh, hello, office.<eos> - We're back.<eos> - The boys are back.<eos> - Baloney boys in the building. - Shh.<eos> They might hear you.
And we don't want to fi-ight you.<eos> We li-ike you too.<eos> So if you let us QB this prank, new school and newer school working together...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I think we could prank the office before they prank you.
- What do you mean, "yep"?<eos> Hey, no, don't worry about it.<eos> That's on us, okay?<eos> You guys should get out of here.<eos> You got your whole lives ahead of you, right?
Maybe it wasn't the same sentence.<eos> It was the same breath.<eos> Might have been a runon sentence.<eos> God, you know, I should thank you.<eos> I should thank both of you.
Your boss doesn't seem to have an I.D., record, somehow even a name.<eos> You got all those, Mr. Moon, record especially.<eos> Lawyer.<eos> Didn't catch that.<eos> You're probably asking yourself about now how it came to pass that two country-fried police even found you at that motel for a crime committed over... count 'em... Two state lines.
It's a good story.<eos> Just ask.<eos> Lawyer, please.<eos> Hmm. I thought maybe you were gonna say something different.<eos> So this guy Moon robbed you?
Drive-thru."<eos> This was, uh, I'm going to say different.<eos> I got a goddamn fax on a machine hasn't been turned on in... I don't know... Since fax machines.<eos> And this fax gave us your precise location, GPS coordinates, make, model, mileage, even VIN number of your Caddy.<eos> So, much as I'd get accolades if we collar you two for the bank bullshit, it's nowhere near as big or as interesting as what is suggested by the details.
So I give him a good chock, just a warning.<eos> And he topples head first into a broken bottle.<eos> Lost the eye, they tell me.<eos> Plenty of flanges do well with just one.<eos> What of you, Miss, you take an eye?
I done worse than that.<eos> Dying worked for me.<eos> Everyone should try it at least once.<eos> Seems like you've walked the earth a couple hundred years in those boots already, so, you're due.<eos> The night of Samhain, the spirits can spill freely into our world, but if you wear a disguise, like that, then they'll take you for one of their own.
The lep...?<eos> Prechaun.<eos> Leprechaun, that's right.<eos> So we just leave a small ration from our harvest.<eos> 'Cause if they so choose, they can lead you off the path you've trod a thousand times before.
Know her?<eos> Of course.<eos> When I saw these numbers come in, I thought who better to help us capitalize on this than Margaret Hearst?<eos> The whole city... no, the whole country... watches her show.<eos> She can take you to a whole new level.
Perhaps you've truly found your calling in office, Mr. Cobblepot.<eos> Or perhaps... you just know how to show people only what they want to see.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Either way, I plan to get inside your head and share what I find with the citizens of Gotham.<eos> Does that deter you?
My God.<eos> Of course.<eos> He's not to be trusted.<eos> Who?<eos> Sorry to bother you so late, Mr. Mayor.
I was just leaving this here for Selina.<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh... come in.<eos> Please stay.<eos> We've been meaning to thank you in person for the other night.
Really. Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much...<eos> Oh, I guess I better go.<eos> It's late. Stay.<eos> Alfred will drive you to your hotel in the morning.
So from humble errand boy to kitchen worker to the so-called "King of Gotham," it is said that many died so you could rise.<eos> Oh...<eos> An exaggeration.<eos> People love to invent scandal.<eos> But it was murder that sent you to Arkham, a prison for the criminally insane.
Some call it murder.<eos> Others a public service.<eos> And after your controversial release from prison, you met your father,<eos> Elijah Van Dahl.<eos> A man whose identity your mother kept from you.
That's the part I like.<eos> We destroy his empire and take it for ourselves.<eos> And then, when this bird is broken and alone, we do the humane thing and put him out of his misery.<eos> Mm.<eos> If there's anything I can do for you, Ms. Kyle, please don't... hesitate to ask.
The Prophet is here!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Jerome is here.<eos> He never left us.<eos> Each of you kept him alive.
Listen to me!<eos> Jerome is here.<eos> He never left us.<eos> Each of you kept him alive.<eos> Each of you is Jerome.
Boo.<eos> Ha, ha, ha...<eos> Wow.<eos> Well, that is quite a story.<eos> You know, I know I've been dead, but doesn't that seem kind of crazy to you?
Hey, Doc, keep watching.<eos> You don't want to miss what happens next.<eos> Today, Gotham will remember.<eos> Oh, sorry!<eos> Didn't see you.
We won't hurt you.<eos> We just want to talk to you, Dwight.<eos> The Prophet told us that we're all prisoners, slaves to a city that doesn't love us, but tonight... tonight we rise up.<eos> We are all Jerome.<eos> Each of you... is Jerome.
Santino.<eos> Hit Santino.<eos> He was close with Tommy Bones.<eos> I-I bet they are in this together.<eos> Boss, got to tell you, I'm hearing some weird things.
No. I mean, anything that might indicate where he was going, what he was planning.<eos> We were just playing catch-up.<eos> You know, about coming back to life, the cult.<eos> He asked if you and I were still together.<eos> I mentioned you killed my husband on our wedding night, and he thought that was hilarious, so that's something the two of you can bond over when you find him.
Bruce!<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> Can't get rid of me that easily, can you, mate?<eos> Oh, come here.<eos> Behind you!
I knew where the line was tonight, Alfred.<eos> I didn't cross it.<eos> Well, that's the first rule.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I started training you so you could defend yourself.
I'm not unfocused because of Selina.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> I see.<eos> Right.<eos> So it wouldn't trouble you to know that she dropped a note off for you in the mailbox, then.
You see, Sylvia and I, we got closure.<eos> Now, it seems that Miss Kyle has offered you the same opportunity, and I suggest that you... you take it.<eos> Fine.<eos> If it'll get you to stop, I'll go.<eos> I'll keep the pie warm for you, Master Bruce.
How much time?<eos> How long have you been blindly running down the corridors of your life only to end up in the same place?<eos> It's time to pick a direction.<eos> You can speak in cryptic riddles all you want.<eos> I'm not scared of you.
Turn around.<eos> Turn around!<eos> Have you not been listening?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you
What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do, for Gotham to be judged and the guilty punished.<eos> Well, then release me and I'll do just that.<eos> Unfortunately... we're looking to pass sentence on a much larger scale.<eos> And to do that we need what's inside of you.
Talon?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Kathryn.<eos> Detective Gordon, what is the meaning of this?<eos> Who let you in here?
But when I was running the Wayne Enterprises RD division, we only had a half dozen off-site labs.<eos> Barnes isn't exactly the kind of guy who's gonna blend in.<eos> It'd have to be somewhere isolated, and small enough for them to control.<eos> I think I know where they took him.<eos> Just put them down wherever there's space, and then go back to where I found you.
I say, Ghost, speak your business or I shall go no further!<eos> My business is not with you, Prince of Denmark. But with your audience.<eos> I've come to address you, the ruling class of Gotham.<eos> You've kept a secret for far too long.<eos> But tonight. I will kidnap and torture one of you to expose the truth.
Good game, Alfred.<eos> You let me win, didn't you, Master Bruce?<eos> - No way, Alfred.<eos> - No way, my foot.<eos> That's very unlike you, isn't it?
They're gonna bring him to me.<eos> You know how many crooked politicians there are in this city?<eos> This riddle could be for anyone.<eos> My gosh, these are delicious.<eos> All the same, Mr. Mayor, we'd like to move you to a safe house immediately.
I hear you've been asking about us.<eos> How do I know you're real?<eos> Isn't that the point of a good mystery?<eos> You're never quite sure what to believe until the end.<eos> Gordon could've put you up to this.

Gordon could've put you up to this.<eos> I assure you, Detective Gordon had to be convinced to bring you here.<eos> But let me put it like this:<eos> That question Professor Strange had you ask<eos> Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox last year at Indian Hill, the one that has tortured you,
I mean, we used to go with your mum and dad this time of year.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.
Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.<eos> Let me tell you something, Master Bruce: That man lied to you.<eos> Him and his bloody Court of Owls, they tried to use you, they tried to manipulate you.
No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep.<eos> Or when you were seven and you took your silly rowing boat out and you got lost in that storm, and me and your dad were out, shouting and screaming, losing our minds.<eos> And when your dad found you, how he cried.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.

I'm the one you seek.<eos> I'm the demon's head.<eos> I am Ra's al Ghul.<eos> Why have you come to me, Bruce?<eos> The Sensei told me to seek you out.
Master Bruce, there's no other way to put it.<eos> He's wrong.<eos> Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.<eos> And one day, you're gonna remember that.<eos> And you're gonna remember how much I love you.
He's wrong.<eos> Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.<eos> And one day, you're gonna remember that.<eos> And you're gonna remember how much I love you.<eos> I remember the first time your mum and dad brought you home.
And one day, you're gonna remember that.<eos> And you're gonna remember how much I love you.<eos> I remember the first time your mum and dad brought you home.<eos> They were so exhausted.<eos> And they gave you to me.
You can't.<eos> You can't.<eos> You cannot do this.<eos> It's a small price to pay for saving the city.<eos> Yeah, for you.
- They said we could head there now.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Detective Gordon, just in time.<eos> If you'll take a seat and roll up your sleeve.<eos> We have a dose ready for you right now.
- On we go.<eos> - My name is Francisco Ramon.<eos> I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you.<eos> It was my love of science that allowed me to overcome my tough upbringing and join S.T.A.R. Labs, before our beautiful and handsome founder, Harrison Wells, stepped down.<eos> I hope my love of science will inspire some among you to join the scientific community.
My name is Francisco Ramon.<eos> I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you, but after years of hard work and studying, I joined S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> - I hope my love of science...<eos> - Should we go talk to him?<eos> Will inspire some among you to join the scientific community as we strive to reach a new age for humanity.
Are you kidding me?<eos> I am negotiating.<eos> Well, you showed me yours. Only fair I show you mine.<eos> Cisco!<eos> Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the building.
Ladies and gentlemen, for today's perp walk, we have a literal degenerate:<eos> The one and only Clive Yorkin.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Captain Mendez, Detective West, thanks for the assist.<eos> Couldn't have bagged this goon without you.
What?<eos> As in now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd love that.<eos> What brings you to my neck of the bullpen?
They... they went to a lot of trouble to get him there.<eos> They need him for something.<eos> We're gonna figure out what that is.<eos> Oh! There you guys are.<eos> I've been looking all over for you.
- What news?<eos> That you don't mess with Kid Flash.<eos> We got to get back to our friends. They're expecting us.<eos> Yeah, they picked some real winners.<eos> I know, which is more than I can say for you two.
What?<eos> How about a signpost at the front?<eos> "All trespassers will be executed."<eos> That wouldn't be the worst idea, would it?<eos> Will be Solovar's great honor... to kill you... himself.
I take his place.<eos> I rule the gorillas, and I promise to keep them in Gorilla City.<eos> How do we know we can trust you?<eos> Because... even though you sent me away, your Earth is still my home.<eos> And there are those among you... I will never forget.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm happy for you.
- Look who I found.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - How are we doing?<eos> - Julian.<eos> It's good to see you.
- Hey, guys.<eos> - How are we doing?<eos> - Julian.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Good to see you all.
I actually decided to stick around for a little while.<eos> Hey, does anybody know what's going on?<eos> I mean, I got a mountain of paperwork back at the office.<eos> No, not the foggiest.<eos> I was gonna ask you.
You have grown into a beautiful woman.<eos> You're marrying the best man I know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You two bring me nothing but joy.<eos> - I'm so happy for you. - Okay.
It's always been me, Barry.<eos> Man, what did we ever do to you?<eos> You took everything from me!<eos> I never asked for any of this, Joe.<eos> I am only this way because of you.
Man, what did we ever do to you?<eos> You took everything from me!<eos> I never asked for any of this, Joe.<eos> I am only this way because of you.<eos> All of you!
I keep coming back to the thought that...<eos> I could be the cause of all this.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Savitar's prophecy.<eos> "One will betray you."
- Oh, nothing much.<eos> Just put a little song in your heart.<eos> Put a little...<eos> Why did you bring us here?<eos> I didn't bring you anywhere.
♪ And the strong arms ♪<eos> ♪ To carry you... ♪<eos> ♪ Away ♪<eos> Thanks for telling us the truth, baby.<eos> I love you both so much.
Well, her name is Supergirl.<eos> It's kind of implied, right?<eos> Well, we better be getting going.<eos> I promised Kara's sister we'd get her back in one piece.<eos> We couldn't have done this without you.
- Do you want me to go out and get you more strawberry Jell-O?<eos> I will get you more.<eos> No, it's fine, but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkes, mister.<eos> Next time you operate on me, maybe you can... my broken heart.<eos> I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Gypsy.
Maybe he can help you out.<eos> I need to see Wally.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, um, I'm looking for Wally West?<eos> I recognize you from Joe's photos.
What the hell is going on?<eos> I would like to know the very same thing.<eos> I was about to check one of the most important boxes a man can check in his life.<eos> And who... who brought us here?<eos> I brought you all here.
You hadn't visited Iris in years.<eos> Yeah, that's what I've heard.<eos> Cisco told me, or showed me, that you all haven't been a team in a long time.<eos> And I know that I'm the reason for that.<eos> Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.
Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.<eos> I mean...<eos> I mean, it should've driven me closer.<eos> This isn't what she would want.<eos> But I'm here now to tell you that... no matter what happens in the past, I will not abandon you.
I've still been letting him win.<eos> I was wrong to do that.<eos> If you're all willing to... try to be a family again...<eos> I think I can, too.<eos> I don't know which... which one of you to hug first.
I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.<eos> I never loved any of you.
I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.<eos> I never loved any of you.
It was an amazing, amazing night.<eos> But the next day, Lucifer was with another woman, so did that make you jealous?<eos> Jealous?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, because he basically used you for sex and moved on.
We were hella intimate. Mm!<eos> Did you not hear about the honey?<eos> We're talking about, um, emotional intimacy.<eos> Like, um... did Lucifer, uh, bring you dinner?<eos> Or did he do anything special for you?
What?<eos> So, care to explain why you were trying to flee the country?<eos> My two closest friends just got murdered.<eos> I thought I might be next and I was not about to stick around to find out.<eos> Who would try to kill you, Tim?
Ashley.<eos> It just won't stop.<eos> So, this is where the... healing happens.<eos> It's cute.<eos> So, what brings you here?
Okay.<eos> But considering that Lucifer and I have a bumpy track record, I'm afraid he won't believe me.<eos> I'm afraid he might think I have some... ulterior motive.<eos> Do you?<eos> I'm not going to tell him this information for you, if that's what you're asking.
And most certainly quite powerful.<eos> But my loyalties are to my patient, your son.<eos> Doctor-Devil confidentiality.<eos> But I'm not asking you to break his trust.<eos> In fact, I'm asking you to illuminate the truth for him.
I need to get a glass of water.<eos> This is Espinoza.<eos> I need to get an update on Ashley Corbett.<eos> I'm sorry. Can you say that again?<eos> I can't hear you, there's a... garbage disposal...
Please don't kill yourself with your own bullet.<eos> We wouldn't be able to conduct the final part of this experiment.<eos> Time for you to make a choice.<eos> In this vial, an antidote that will save Benji's life.<eos> In vial numero dos, poisonous gas that will kill you if you enter the room.
I mean...<eos> I mean, dying?<eos> Well, if anyone has a better suggestion, by all means, speak up now.<eos> Quite frankly, I'd prefer to Uber there.<eos> But... look, I am doing this with or without you.
Now, before we get started, let's take care of a short order of business.<eos> Xavier.<eos> - All right, let's go.<eos> - Whoa, come on, man!<eos> What the hell? Let this serve as an example for each and every one of you.
Please do not do this to me.<eos> Everything is just starting to get together for me, man.<eos> What about my daughter?<eos> Go home. Act like nothing's wrong.<eos> Tomorrow I'll pick you both up at 2:45 on the southeast side of union square.
It's the last couple of polls.<eos> What, you trying to scratch your way back into the damn race?<eos> See, you had to scratch your way to power.<eos> See, I was born with mine.<eos> And Mr. Lyon... if I do decide to come for you, you're going to experience a kind of pain that you've never experienced.
Can you hear 'em?<eos> This is you.<eos> Time to become a man, brother.<eos> I am a man.<eos> There's a car waiting for you by the side entrance to take you home.
Even with all the right equipment, it's illegal.<eos> Legalities? Doc, relax.<eos> I'm an officer of the court. I'll make sure you're protected and well-compensated. Just get it done.<eos> Okay, let's get it done.<eos> We're gonna have to put a tube down your throat so the machine can breathe for you, and we're gonna give you your shot to keep you as comfortable as possible.
Lucious?<eos> He can't talk.<eos> Is it that serious?<eos> And why's he intubated?<eos> What's wrong with him? Listen, Lucious called you all here because he has nothing to hide.
Don't you feel good, about tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the hell was that about?<eos> Jamal dropped his teaser from his album. That's all, but it means nothing.<eos> Wait, and it's about you and Lucious?
She mooched off the bottle service like the rest of the chicks.<eos> May I remind your client, please...<eos> Yeah, apologies, apologies.<eos> Hakeem, please let Miss Marshall...<eos> Can I call you Kennedy?
What's going on, Kennedy? You need a hug?<eos> This money's not gonna come easy.<eos> It was the worst timing, Jamal.<eos> I mean, the day of the primary elections?<eos> What'd they call you? Coocious?
Thanks for being here.<eos> - Hey, watch your back. - Hey, pretty lady.<eos> How are you?<eos> ...nothing is out of the realm of possibility in this arena.<eos> Everything okay with you and Dre?
Yeah. - Uh, mm-hmm.<eos> Coocious. It's cute.<eos> I have to admit, that teaser was a bit inspired.<eos> Listen, Mr. Lyon, thank you so much for letting us use this space.<eos> Very, very generous of you. Appreciate it.
So that means I have your support, too, Andre?<eos> I'm in full support of you, Mom.<eos> And, in turn, I want you to support my Vegas deal, no matter how hard Lucious pushes against it.<eos> And now it's about you.<eos> Hey, I'm asking all of you to back me.
The only way I can pay you back your money is if you sign off on this deal.<eos> I need you, Lucious.<eos> The gaming commissioner is coming to Laviticus tomorrow to look over Andre's business plan, and I need you to sign off on it.<eos> Lucious, I killed my husband for you.<eos> So if the commissioner doesn't like, um... Andre's plan, it puts you and him in a really bad spot, right?
Did not expect this.<eos> Lucious, when Giuliana told me I had to come to New York, I was prepared to be irked if it wasn't worth my while.<eos> But this... this crosses the threshold into interesting.<eos> "Interesting." She said you would call it interesting.<eos> Initially, I was going to bore you with a bunch of charts and graphs, but Giuliana said that we should put on a live-action show.
All right.<eos> So, um, did you hear?<eos> About me and Angelo?<eos> Yeah, you told me.<eos> Um, congratulations, I'm really happy for you.
I don't think he got the memo.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Your club is closed tonight.<eos> I get it.<eos> Well, in that case, sorry to have interrupted you.
Hold on, hold on, what...<eos> Who are you, and why are you in my house?<eos> Sir, I'm from OCSF New York. Child Protective Services.<eos> I don't give a damn where you're from,<eos> I didn't invite you.
I'm sorry, your family took $5 million from mine.<eos> So what is all this, are you... you want to humble us, you want us to bow down?<eos> - That's why y'all going so low?<eos> - Us?<eos> My cousin, Angelo, lost his career because of you.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Connections born from generations of serving our community... a community which you have chosen to represent very differently, I might add.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Look, look, I-I see where all this is going.<eos> All right, so y'all got a little power in you.
All right, the key to taking Giuliana down is her ledgers, which she keeps in a wall safe inside her office.<eos> There's only one way in and one way out.<eos> And me and Cookie are both banned.<eos> So we're going to sneak inside a casino and crack a safe?<eos> Look, I know it sounds a little Hollywood, but, Cookie has faith in you, and I believe in being prepared.
My father is a man of his word, Ms. Frost.<eos> I can assure you.<eos> It's Mrs. Frost.<eos> I'm Andre Lyon.<eos> We haven't properly met, but I've heard wonderful things about you.
We hope that Inferno will be Vegas's next big sensation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you have any questions, refer to the press release.<eos> Honey, why don't you, go to the car and get the kids ready?<eos> Commissioner Frost. Nice to see you again.
Andre, good to see you.<eos> This is my husband.<eos> Good to meet you.<eos> Andre Lyon.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you until later in the week.
I prefer "Calhoun."<eos> You're under arrest for the murder of Tariq Cousins.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you.
Okay, good. Thank you so much, really.<eos> No, no, thank y'all.<eos> Thanks y'all for, having us come in.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> It was such a pleasure seeing you.
Yes.<eos> You don't owe them an explanation.<eos> Okay, hang on now.<eos> Uh, One-Eyed Willy back there wasn't trying to kill us.<eos> She was after you.
My family?<eos> See, Cass is our family, so we can't let you hurt him.<eos> Let me?<eos> We don't wanna kill you.<eos> I don't wanna kill you.
What?<eos> And leave you here with her?<eos> You kidding me? She --<eos> She is no threat whatsoever to humans.<eos> And she can hear you.
You want money?<eos> We have money.<eos> You need weapons?<eos> We have gear you can't even imagine.<eos> Now what I'm saying, Wally, is that you need people like us, and we need hunters like you.
I'm a Winchester.<eos> Works for me.<eos> Mom!<eos> Don't!<eos> I love you.
Cass, what have you done?<eos> What had to be done.<eos> You know this world, this sad, doomed little world, it needs you.<eos> It needs every last Winchester it can get, and I will not let you die.<eos> I won't let any of you die.
They killed my friend.<eos> Your friend was stupid.<eos> You're all...<eos> Do you know what you've done?<eos> Does the name Ramiel mean anything to you?
What?<eos> Ramiel, Prince of Hell.<eos> Ramiel, Prince of Hell.<eos> It's catchy. It rhymes.<eos> And he's going to kill each and every one of you.
♪<eos> King of the Crossroads?<eos> I've been sent by Hell.<eos> And what?<eos> Don't they teach you how to knock in hell?
Shut up.<eos> We don't have time, okay, for your -- for you.<eos> So either help us or get the hell out of here!<eos> Yeah, figures.<eos> What can I do to keep you out of that barn?
Cass, come on.<eos> No, you listen to me.<eos> You - - Look, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Knowing you, it... it's been the best part of my life.
Knowing you, it... it's been the best part of my life.<eos> And the things that... the things we've shared together, they have changed me.<eos> You're my family.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love all of you.
That's not good enough.<eos> I lost a friend.<eos> I almost lost one of my boys.<eos> And we apologize -- Shut up.<eos> Anything like that happens again -- anything -- and I will burn you down.

- Serena.<eos> You're headed past the Armory. If you wouldn't mind. Unpack, reshelve, and my Sig Sauer could use a good scrubbing.<eos> I have three PhDs.<eos> And we're all very proud of you, luv.<eos> I'm doing this for you.
It feels like there's always this thick fog over my memory and I can't seen through it.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Every single day, I get screwed by my memories.<eos> It's better to be pure.<eos> Like you.
I can see everything.<eos> All of your thoughts, your... decisions.<eos> - I guess privacy is just for humans.<eos> - You are human.<eos> People see you as human.
You know, the scan... also turned up the number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?
You can see all my thoughts so... You should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.<eos> You don't know how alone that makes me feel.<eos> I can see you out there, you know.
Tell me who you are.<eos> I'm that which you seek to destroy.<eos> In this life, my name is... Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.
We're not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.<eos> Innocent? Is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?
What a beauty you are!<eos> They have improved s-so much, since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution? That's what you call... killing everyone who made you?
The way they died?<eos> Did that happen?<eos> No.<eos> We gave you false memories.<eos> Cutter wanted to motivate you.
I know where to find her.<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.<eos> You never ask.<eos> But I always do.<eos> Did they send you to bring me in?
I always was a better spy than a salesman.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> I'm not a soldier, I'm a baller.<eos> My bad.<eos> So, I'll leave you be, then.
And if I'm scared, I can't do my job.<eos> And if I can't do my job, then people die.<eos> And if people die, then who am I tech-supporting?<eos> Literally no one.<eos> But I will make sure to keep you safe.
I'm just doing the math.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What math?<eos> Air velocity divided by distance.<eos> So, when I stuff you down the toilet, search and rescue will know where to find you between China and North Korea.
Good boy!<eos> Why, thank you, Ringo.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Oh, Ringo!<eos> I, Francie take you, Douglas, as you are to love and to cherish to have and to hold until death do us part.
Hello, Roger.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Thank you so much for inviting me, it really means a lot.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I didn't invite you.
Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.<eos> Then I asked you if you would want to keep it and you didn't say anything to that.
I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, I asked if you wanted to keep the kid.
And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, I asked if you wanted to keep the kid.<eos> I'm ridiculous in a million ways.<eos> I am.<eos> I know that.<eos> But I can't spend my whole life disappointing you as much as I disappoint myself.
Excuse me?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.<eos> I need you to give me the phone number of somebody that I can call to get you out of here right now. Oh!
Sweetheart, you're embarrassing yourself!<eos> Shut up, Nikki!<eos> Shut up.<eos> What?<eos> I can't not be in love with you.
It's a great screwup!<eos> It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!<eos> And I don't want to disappoint anybody but you.
What did you say back there?<eos> It was... What did you do? It was hard to hear, you know, with, like, the wind and Nikki in my ear, and then, when I got on the railing, everybody started shouting.<eos> And then underwater, you can't, like, hear anything underwater.<eos> But it sounded like, you know, you were getting to something good.<eos> Uh... It was like about how, if you're, shit, ready to be, like, the person who always forgives me, then I want to be the person who always forgives you.
Goodnight, Mom.<eos> Goodnight, Teddy.<eos> Bye, Carol.<eos> Thought you didn't have family.<eos> The evidence is mounting up against you, Walter.
I'm going to help you.<eos> We're going to deflate the situation together. Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Focus.<eos> Think about things that turn you off.
You know it, man. I'm just... I'm really...<eos> Really excited to quit my double major in robotics and computer science and really, really do something with my life.<eos> You don't need to look down there.<eos> Do not touch me right now.<eos> - Not even touching you. - Okay.
Fuck. You know, you wanna be on our team, you're gonna have to pass this course.<eos> - We all do.<eos> - Look.<eos> Mitch, right?<eos> - Lieutenant to you.
Shit.<eos> Come on. Breathe for me.<eos> Come on, big man.<eos> We'll set you down right here.<eos> Good. Let's get you over. Attaboy.
- C.J., she good?<eos> - Steph, how is she?<eos> - She's all right.<eos> You're gonna be good.<eos> Give me some. Let's get you to your mom.
I made it onto...<eos> Wait.<eos> Do not tell me that I'm the tech guy.<eos> No!<eos> No, I chose you because you have heart, no quit and you leave it all out on the beach.
That way.<eos> Look, you're on the team, and I don't want anyone on the team sleeping outside, so...<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> You're coming with me. Let's go.<eos> Brody, let's go, I don't want to wait for you.
- Why you, Ted?<eos> Why?<eos> Don't you do this to me, Ted!<eos> Don't you do this!<eos> Okay, no. But, seriously, I got to help you because you are gonna kill someone with that technique.
Failed.<eos> Oh, my God. Well, we're gonna be<eos> - in swimsuits a lot, so...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If it's gonna be a problem for you...
Guys, we can talk about this.<eos> Leon doesn't talk.<eos> He's a man of action.<eos> - There's a purity to that.<eos> - I'm going to kill you.
I care about you.<eos> Get off that boat, Mitch.<eos> Hey, other than him, we did good, right?<eos> Like, we saved everyone.<eos> Yes, including you.
It's nice to have somebody who respects you, you know?<eos> I sense trouble.<eos> I think I'm just not used to having a boss.<eos> Mitch is threatened.<eos> He should be thrilled to have you.
A warm welcome to our host, Victoria Leeds!<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> So many people.<eos> So as a welcome to the bay, I...<eos> Oh, God. Mitch, this is for you.
The big whale gets away?<eos> Do you hear yourself when you talk?<eos> I dare you to say one thing without the ocean in it.<eos> I dare you.<eos> We were depending on you tonight.
But you're not gonna like it.<eos> Okay, clear.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Okay, left turn, left turn.<eos> What the fuck? Who taught you how to drive, Stevie fucking Wonder?
- Splish, splash.<eos> - Otherwise, I'll fire you.<eos> Now I gotta go clean up this mess that you made.<eos> Obviously, you have every reason to be upset, and I apologize.<eos> So, do you always do the opposite of what people ask you to do?
Hey... - You can do this in your sleep.<eos> That's not what I'm saying. I don't want the position. I don't...<eos> You have two gold medals, okay?<eos> You're like the Stephen Hawking of swimming, minus the total paralysis part.<eos> Unless you want me to replace you with someone else.
No. I'm not ready.<eos> I'm not ready for this, man.<eos> They need you.<eos> Hi, Mitch.<eos> Just checking in on you again.
Lieutenant Brody! What you got in the cooler?<eos> Black market organs from the Boogie Board Bandits?<eos> You mean this?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is actually for you.
Honey. As usual, I have to do everything myself.<eos> - Mitch!<eos> - Don't bother.<eos> He's dead.<eos> - Because of you.
That's not how this story ends, Mitch.<eos> You see, you're not here to save him.<eos> After all, he took your job.<eos> So you shot him.<eos> But not before he got a shot off that killed you.
This is how it must be.<eos> Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.
Hmm, and I see how hard it must be to truly say nothing.<eos> How hard you must be concentrating every moment.<eos> And I must admit, you're very good at it.<eos> I know a little something of what it feels to be apart from the world.<eos> I lost my mother when I was a little bit younger than you.
You're telling me he wants his mother back, hmm?<eos> Well, that's a...<eos> That's a revelation.<eos> I've...<eos> I've been looking for you, Jakob.
Well, I can't organize a playdate...<eos> you want something to eat?<eos> Nope.<eos> Good.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
I love the sky on mornings like this.<eos> Hey. Greasy forehead.<eos> Window.<eos> I'm gonna try not to be depressed because I'm single on cupid day.<eos> That's Valentine's day to you!
I'd never let my best friend die a virgin.<eos> You didn't think we'd forget, did you?<eos> It's the big day.<eos> Opening night.<eos> Rob texted me. He said, "I made my bed for you." Ugh!
We're not going back there.<eos> I'll say it again. You do not need that loser.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Mm-mmm. You got your real baes here.<eos> Mm-hmm. We love you.
- I mean, she just snapped.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She freaked me out.<eos> Sam, you're 20 minutes late!<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
The more roses you get on cupid day, the more popular you are, right?<eos> Thanks for the tip, Kent.<eos> Noted.<eos> I didn't say the rose was from me.<eos> But it is from you, right?
- What truck?<eos> It wasn't a dream.<eos> It really happened.<eos> Again.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
"L-u-v ya." Luv ya.<eos> What is that?<eos> We've been going out since last year.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, maybe he's just waiting to say it, like, tonight.<eos> I'm not gonna have sex with him just so that he says, "I love you."
- Can I borrow something?<eos> - Always.<eos> I got you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.
Hey.<eos> Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.<eos> No, I know I'm not wearing the appropriate attire, but I promise they're legitimate.<eos> Cool.<eos> Also, uh, this rose came for you.
No, I can't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Well, I'm...<eos> I could have, uh, crutches on call for you...
- Such a loser.<eos> Steve's flirting with a freshman.<eos> I love you guys.<eos> Oh, Sam.<eos> - We love you too. - Aw.
Sam, what are you talking about?<eos> Whoa.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.<eos> Where have you...<eos> No!<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> I love you.
It was very ambitious.<eos> - I should go. - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hey. Just stay for a second, okay?<eos> I-I can...<eos> I can drive you home or...
Juliet.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I know what happened back there.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could. You hate me.
You want something to eat?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thanks. Lindsay's got it covered.<eos> Mom? Oh.<eos> I love you.
I love you too, old man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sammy, you forgot your gloves!<eos> What would I do without you?
Hey, get in!<eos> You know how I like it.<eos> Hey, Elody.<eos> What, do I have white stuff on my face?<eos> No. You know why I love you?
Let's go inside.<eos> Come here.<eos> You know you don't have to act so tough all the time.<eos> Don't worry about me, okay?<eos> Well, I love you no matter what.
Sure as hell aren't gonna find it in some stupid gadget.<eos> There you are, tapping on some little box... while the real shit is happening all around you, dumbass.<eos> I hate you so much.<eos> Yes, I do, yeah.<eos> I hate you.
Why the hell do people move to the suburbs?<eos> It's like a living death.<eos> Wilson, what are we doing?<eos> What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.
It's like a living death.<eos> Wilson, what are we doing?<eos> What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.<eos> I stopped loving you.
Wilson, what are we doing?<eos> What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.<eos> I stopped loving you.<eos> I spent so many years hating you and now I can't even remember why.
What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.<eos> I stopped loving you.<eos> I spent so many years hating you and now I can't even remember why.<eos> I guess it drove me nuts that I was such a fucking mess... and nothing I did ever scared you away.
No! I'm not letting go!<eos> Let it go!<eos> Wilson!<eos> I'm gonna kick his ass!<eos> Believe me, Pippi gave you a true gift... by giving you away, because we were in no position to be parents.
No, thanks.<eos> I'll get the bus.<eos> No, no, I'll give you a ride.<eos> Claire!<eos> I can't stand to see you like this.
Claire!<eos> I can't stand to see you like this.<eos> Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> How about I take you for ice cream?
Pippi?<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This is why I left you in the first place.
No, it's just she's all desperate and needy.<eos> She can tell when someone doesn't love her.<eos> Not the dog, stupid.<eos> Who, Claire?<eos> Did you see the way she was looking at you?
You do, too, Will!<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's the boy's name?<eos> Cooper.<eos> Cooper! The last time I saw you... you were two or three years old.
So, Claire, have you been thinking about school yet?<eos> Fuck, no.<eos> You see?<eos> Now, that is pure Wilson.<eos> Here's to you, Claire.
Fuck, no.<eos> You see?<eos> Now, that is pure Wilson.<eos> Here's to you, Claire.<eos> And to you, Coop!
It's me.<eos> It's two and a half years.<eos> I never heard a word.<eos> I...<eos> I tried to get my lawyer to find you.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When Claire turned on me at the trial... I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.<eos> Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.
When Claire turned on me at the trial... I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.<eos> Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.<eos> I wondered about that.<eos> I could've been there for you, and I...
I just thank you for not testifying against me.<eos> Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.<eos> I wondered about that.<eos> I could've been there for you, and I...<eos> I totally failed you, Wilson.
I could've been there for you, and I...<eos> I totally failed you, Wilson.<eos> But you're here now.<eos> I am.<eos> And I have to thank you, Wilson.
"Was?"<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She got so sick, Wilson.<eos> And in the end she could barely even... She could barely even lift her little head.<eos> I tried to find you.
Urinated.<eos> Urinated... on my address book and chewed up two sofas...<eos> Three.<eos> Three, but... in doing so, you taught us the utter worthlessness of those things.<eos> We celebrate you, Pepper.
A baby.<eos> So that makes me a grandfather?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> I just came here... to shit on you for ratting me out to the Feds, and now this?
I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.<eos> You barely know her and... she sent you to jail, for Chrissake!
I don't think so.<eos> Please, Claire?<eos> I wouldn't be in your way.<eos> Claire?<eos> Can I at least come visit you?
- We heard he'd had some trouble with the...<eos> - Vikings. Well, none of them are house-trained.<eos> - I thought you'd warned them. - I did.<eos> They don't speak English good.<eos> They speak it better than you.
Who's coming back?<eos> The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.
The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.<eos> If we can catch you, they can catch you.
I was born in a brothel, on a bridge in Londinium.<eos> The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.<eos> That's what put you out.
King Vortigern!<eos> They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.
No!<eos> - If you're the king... - No! ...declare yourself.<eos> The rest of them will follow unless you do what needs to be done.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> If you are lost for words, then let the sword speak for you.
Now!<eos> Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?<eos> Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?
It's all gone.<eos> They torched the lot.<eos> I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.<eos> Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.
You want Vortigern to stick his neck out and get him to Londinium? You need to tease it out.<eos> You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.<eos> What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.
You seem to have found your way very quickly.<eos> Now, come on, kid.<eos> You're cooking dinner.<eos> What is it that Vortigern cares about most in the world?<eos> Killing you.
Let's go!<eos> - I'm holding you up.<eos> Go on without me.<eos> - No, Lack, come on. Let's go. - No, I'll see you at the safe house.<eos> - I'm not leaving you! Just go!
You silly bastards.<eos> Determined to die.<eos> Shit. On my command!<eos> I'm going down the hole now.<eos> After you.
What's wrong?<eos> Nothing. I'm all right.<eos> Just got to get to the safe house.<eos> Can you make it?<eos> I love you, mate.
Is that you, Blue?<eos> Yes, boss! Did you find your father?<eos> He's found him!<eos> Ah!<eos> We need to get you out of here.
I don't wanna push you, but...<eos> George? Riots are spreading.<eos> Not just in Londinium.<eos> Across the whole country.<eos> People are fighting for you.
Tomorrow.<eos> I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.
- All right, well, that's good to hear.<eos> You think I could meet him?<eos> Maybe someday.<eos> Do you trust this man?<eos> You know, we never hear from you.
Because he wants to be free.<eos> All his life, he's tried to get free.<eos> He doesn't know how.<eos> You aren't who you think you are.<eos> He doesn't love you.
I went along like someone in a dream.<eos> I knew I had to tell you.<eos> Come clean.<eos> I didn't know how.<eos> I love you, I love you, I love you...
Do you love me?<eos> Why do you ask that?<eos> I like to hear it.<eos> You don't like to say it.<eos> I love you.
No.<eos> I know, I gotta go.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> Does Dad even look at you?
Wow.<eos> I didn't know what to tell him.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, this is... that's a good...<eos> That's a good opportunity for you.
I mean, you know how I feel about him, but that... that shouldn't affect your... that shouldn't affect you.<eos> You gotta do it.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Because I'm happy.<eos> Your old girlfriend... she asked you to go off with her.
I want out.<eos> Then go.<eos> - ♪ I know places we can go, babe... ♪ - I'm low.<eos> I'm like mud.<eos> I don't deserve you.
I don't know, um...<eos> I was a receptionist there before I met you.<eos> You know, I...<eos> He's after you.<eos> I dreamed of having him help me the same way he helped you.
So happy to meet you.<eos> Where do you find it?<eos> When you're young, it's not always easy to know what is the light.<eos> - I don't understand either.<eos> - Except for you.
- It's different.<eos> - Sweet of you to say.<eos> I hear you have songs on the radio and you're meant for better things.<eos> It'd be awful to have these good times and not have life itself.<eos> I wanna meet you before you move on
What is that?<eos> It's a chicken.<eos> Hold on, you gotta...<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> I hope I don't fall in love with you.
It's a chicken.<eos> Hold on, you gotta...<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> I hope I don't fall in love with you.<eos> Nobody asked you to.
Answer me that.<eos> I feel like we are so... connected.<eos> And it's...<eos> I can't really understand, it's like...<eos> I forget everything, but seeing you again...
I forget what I am.<eos> Whose I am.<eos> You're so far off.<eos> I'll die if you don't come soon.<eos> I don't like to see the birds in the sky, because I miss you.
Am I a good person?<eos> You made so many... so many sacrifices for me.<eos> So that I could have a chance to do the things that you couldn't do...<eos> Even want to be?<eos> And I failed you.
It's wrong.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I don't understand it, but...<eos> - Can I walk with you?
When you give somebody your word... does it mean anything?<eos> You can just take it back.<eos> I told her that I'm gonna do my best.<eos> Do my best not to say things I don't mean.<eos> The world built a fence around you.
You know, Shawn being gone and me being in this situation where I have no choice but to do what I do, so...<eos> Eventually, maybe he'll hear my prayers and I'll be able to... you know, move forward and do something... valued with my life.<eos> Something my dad can be proud of, you know.<eos> Make the money.<eos> Don't let the money make you.
It's kind of...<eos> I'm weird.<eos> - I'm just...<eos> - What's your fantasy?<eos> What turns you on?
I'm really scared of spiders.<eos> Um, but most things don't scare me.<eos> I think I have a thick skin.<eos> I think I'm pretty strong.<eos> No, but what really scares you?
For it is in giving that we receive.<eos> It is in pardoning...<eos> - Bang.<eos> - Bang.<eos> Bang, may the blessings of all those that you love and those who love you...
It's just one chord hammering.<eos> Can you see?<eos> Yeah, she has a face... a face like yours.<eos> I do... I don't know... I didn't know why I was coming to this party.<eos> Then I saw you, and I thought, "That's why."
No.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Did we meet before?<eos> - Did we?<eos> - I've seen you before.
What bad thing did you do?<eos> Just... got involved with... this man who I thought could help me and...<eos> You made a mistake, you know? Do you look at it...<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> I love you.
Think I gotta go home.<eos> Dad's sick.<eos> Mom's gone crazy.<eos> Brother's up to no good.<eos> I won't stop loving you.
I never thought I needed it.<eos> Or not as much as other people do.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to come out, too.<eos> I've never been out West before.<eos> I'll come find you.
You asked me if I wanted to come out, too.<eos> I've never been out West before.<eos> I'll come find you.<eos> Gonna have to pick your feet up.<eos> If you don't, we will have somebody to replace you.
The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla...<eos> A little anemic without the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, Father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me... who created you?
Where are you?<eos> I miss you.<eos> Would you take a look at this?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I said I wouldn't go without you...
I've found perfection here.<eos> I've created it.<eos> A perfect organism.<eos> You know I can't let you leave this place.<eos> No one will ever love you like I do.
There is nowhere to go!<eos> Oh man we are gonna die!<eos> Please, Vail!<eos> Let me think!<eos> We are gonna die because of you!
They're not even poisonous!<eos> Can we please, leave?<eos> - Are you out of your mind, Vail?<eos> - Please!<eos> What is wrong with you?
- It bit me!<eos> Enough of this!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I'm leaving!<eos> With or without you! I'm leaving!
You shot me.<eos> Wait.<eos> What... wait wait wait you...<eos> You you stabbed Greenway.<eos> - I saved you.
What was I supposed to tell you?<eos> Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?<eos> When Henry came to me i took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.<eos> Now, she's using you.
Woah woah what's happening?<eos> Did you just shut down the mercury?<eos> Pete?<eos> You are a younger man but you must learn to be wary of a man like me.<eos> It's not me that wants to kill you, it's Henry.
We'll make our entry through the northwest trade tunnels, over.<eos> This is the moment, Nick.<eos> This is the moment!<eos> Yes, you are damn right.<eos> I'm gonna taking that stone, Deliver you to Ahmanet and then my work here is done.
You won't.<eos> We didn't see this coming, did we?<eos> They are coming for me.<eos> I wish we had more time.<eos> I'll find you.
He's a dangerous wizard who wants to capture all Smurfs and use them for his evil magic.<eos> And he knows about your lost village.<eos> "Lost village"?<eos> You're the ones who are lost, not us.<eos> We have to take you to Smurfy Grove.
Yeah, well, with no due respect, you don't know us.<eos> Trust us, he's a goner.<eos> Stormy, why don't you do a little recon?<eos> Check things out.<eos> And leave you here with these four?
Yeah.<eos> From a lump of clay. Really cool story, actually.<eos> I knew I didn't trust her.<eos> You'd like her if you get to know her.<eos> She's just like you, but nice.
She should stay with us forever.<eos> One, she always looks great.<eos> And two, this is getting a little out of hand, don't you think?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I can't take you seriously with that mask on your face.
Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?<eos> - Yeah, as soon as you get off me.<eos> I should have known you were the reason I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.<eos> The House always did like you better.
No matter. Your friend's soul will be collected, and there's nothing you can do to alter that.<eos> Why don't you go do something useful, like haunt a house?<eos> - Who's he talking to now?<eos> - Shrouds. They deliver souls to hell.<eos> They're drawn to you.
Your anger is understandable, but you need to reconsider.<eos> Innocent lives are at stake.<eos> Well, doctors say an upbeat attitude can help, so what I'll focus on today is that I met Batman.<eos> Force of good.<eos> It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.
Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> - I don't recognize it.<eos> - Me, neither.<eos> But if there's a person alive who can, it's Ritchie.<eos> Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you?
Destiny forged the Dreamstone with black magic and his soul.<eos> He used it to subject people to their most terrifying nightmares and then feed off their torment.<eos> It was actually the demon Etrigan who won the day.<eos> To battle, Etrigan.<eos> Should you succeed, I will release you of your bond to me.
Which is why it stays here, where only I can get to it.<eos> I think me, them, and everyone else who knows you might want it to be somewhere else.<eos> Your friend is awake.<eos> Ritchie, who was it?<eos> Who did this to you?
- If this were a computer, I'd say it's frozen.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Felix Faust would take precautions against locator spells.<eos> There's another way, but it involves asking a favor of someone that I don't have the best relationship with.<eos> Someone else dislikes you?
Fight others of your filthy kind.<eos> From hell though we may be, it does not make us family!<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?<eos> No woman can speak in my sanctum sanctorum.<eos> I conjured it just for you and, of course, men everywhere.
It's the TV dinner of spell casting, dear.<eos> Here's what real magic looks like.<eos> Z!<eos> Z, are you daft?<eos> I will kill you, woman!
Who dares strike at me?<eos> The Defender of the Green...<eos> Swamp Thing.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.
And you're considering it?<eos> I visited their headquarters a few days ago.<eos> It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.<eos> Listening to me now?<eos> They want you, too.
What do you mean?<eos> You told me, I quote from your words,<eos> "If you excel in all materials, You'll get a puppy."<eos> I like your confidence.<eos> I must have inherited it from you young man.
So, do not steal, this is wrong.<eos> If you stole, do not steal from the Valley Town.<eos> Yes, I have two great friends.<eos> You made me a partner in the crime of theft.<eos> We did not ask you to do anything.
I do not think you hear me!<eos> I hear you very well.<eos> Do you know my opinion?<eos> I think we owe ourselves To live every day we have.<eos> I feel I really want Get to know you more.
Now bring me some food, Because I am starving.<eos> Well, that's better.<eos> I did not think you would join us today.<eos> I am old to carry a grudge.<eos> This has never stopped you from doing so.
O hell!<eos> - On your messenger!<eos> - Pay attention to your words.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your father will take you out of school today.
Yes, this week.<eos> He is not good at ending things.<eos> I give him a chance, my dear, for my sake.<eos> Surely "Joe", But only because you are my best friend.<eos> I love you, my little girl.
Well.<eos> Welcome to Carnival, Donations of "Nets" charity!<eos> Well, sir, let us mix with the crowds.<eos> Three consecutive injuries You get an award!<eos> Hello, "Polly" Is the weather hot enough for you?
I do not move?<eos> I'm not telling me not to move, You do not move!<eos> I will not be a victim anymore.<eos> Ask them not to move too.<eos> They can hear you well.
If we find this artist, we will find the criminal.<eos> Police draw for tattoo.<eos> This is impressive.<eos> It is a tragedy.<eos> FBI directly behind you.
It's your problem now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good luck, may you enjoy Every moment of your time together.<eos> We love you.<eos> We love you also, young man.
"Fergus needs things to be simpler.<eos> "I know how embarrassed he is about me.<eos> "I could not be the man that you both need.<eos> "I've tried and tried and tried for 20 years, and everything I try is another disaster.<eos> "I love you.
You ruined it!<eos> Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!<eos> Thanks a lot, Amigo.<eos> Fucking shit!<eos> I did what I could for you!
All right.<eos> Your office...<eos> Is there.<eos> You have money for all this?<eos> I'm gonna find the money and I'm gonna do this for you.
Fuck.<eos> Fuck!<eos> So you're Plan B.<eos> Yes.<eos> I am to persuade you to stay and help him.
Takes after his old man, eh?<eos> Don't you?<eos> - Cheers, boys.<eos> - See you again.<eos> I covered up for you there.
James Il, Catholic, and William of Orange, Protestant.<eos> The battle was decisive.<eos> The Protestants won.<eos> But 400 years later, the uncompromising and victorious loyalists now feel estranged from the modern, secular United Kingdom.<eos> ♪Let me tell you that I love you ♪
It's an hourly rate.<eos> 'Course.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mark.<eos> She's too young for you.
The point is, we need cash now, not in six months' time.<eos> And you realize what's at stake here?<eos> I promised to set up a sauna for Veronika.<eos> And if I don't get it up and running soon, she's gonna leave me.<eos> - Fucking leave you anyway.
- But you're not...<eos> - I'm out.<eos> - "Out"? - Aye.<eos> Fucking shut up.<eos> Yeah, sorry if I seemed a little shocked to see you, Frank.
Choose the slow reconciliation towards what you can get rather than what you always hoped for.<eos> Settle for less and keep a brave face on it.<eos> Choose disappointment.<eos> And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.
Choose disappointment.<eos> And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.<eos> Until you can see that one day in the future, piece by piece, they will all be gone.<eos> And there'll be nothing left of you to call alive or dead.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it.<eos> You might've heard something?<eos> All right, fuck it.<eos> I knew.<eos> I knew, and I could have served you up to him on a plate any time I wanted to.
I knew, and I could have served you up to him on a plate any time I wanted to.<eos> I bet you were fucking looking forward to it, too, weren't you?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I was.<eos> I was looking forward to it.<eos> I ought to fucking kill you.
- What do you mean, you're not here?<eos> - Go!<eos> Veronika, you cannot be here.<eos> Please.<eos> It's not safe for you, kitten-cat.
People talk.<eos> This is a small village, you know.<eos> Small minded as well.<eos> But small also means safe.<eos> Even back in Paris, I knew a girl like you, who was so... ahead of her time.
Teaching another girl to read?<eos> Isn't one enough?<eos> We have to do something.<eos> You are the wildest... most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.<eos> Nobody deserves you.
We have to do something.<eos> You are the wildest... most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.<eos> Nobody deserves you.<eos> But at least I know our children will be beautiful.<eos> Am I catching you at a bad time?
They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe.<eos> This is our world, Belle.<eos> For simple folk like us, it doesn't get any better.<eos> I might be a farm girl.<eos> But, I'm not simple... and I'm never going to marry you, Gaston.
Papa, is that you?<eos> Belle!<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Your hands are ice.<eos> We need to get you home.
Your hands are ice.<eos> We need to get you home.<eos> Belle, you must leave here at once!<eos> This castle is alive!<eos> Now go, before he finds you!
Come into the light.<eos> Choose.<eos> Belle, I won't let you do this.<eos> I lost your mother.<eos> I won't lose you, too.
Live your life.<eos> And forget me.<eos> Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.<eos> I love you, Belle.
Enchantée, mademoiselle.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll have this place spotless in no time.<eos> This plan of yours is dangerous.<eos> I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.
I'll have this place spotless in no time.<eos> This plan of yours is dangerous.<eos> I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.<eos> No, my love.<eos> I've been burned by you before.
It just occurred to me that I'm illiterate<eos> And I've never actually had to spell it out loud before<eos> Gaston<eos> Oh, LeFou, you're the best.<eos> How is it no girl has snatched you up yet?
Because I want to marry your daughter!<eos> Now, let's go home.<eos> Belle is not at home.<eos> She is with the...<eos> You say beast one more time... I will feed you to the wolves!
A book that truly allows you to escape.<eos> How amazing!<eos> It was her cruelest trick of all.<eos> It was just another curse.<eos> The outside world has no place for a creature like me... but it can for you.
Maurice!<eos> Gaston... did you try to kill Maurice?<eos> Maurice!<eos> Thank heavens!<eos> I've spent the last five days... - trying to find you.
Where did you...<eos> He took me there.<eos> I know what happened to Maman.<eos> Then you know why I had to leave her there.<eos> I had to protect you.
Hello.<eos> I believe this is yours.<eos> She's very headstrong.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> No one to protect you now, huh?
Hello, beast.<eos> I'm Gaston.<eos> Belle sent me.<eos> Are you in love with her?<eos> Did you honestly think she'd want you?
Please!<eos> Come on.<eos> You came back.<eos> Of course I came back.<eos> I'll never leave you again.
I'll never leave you again.<eos> I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.<eos> We're together now.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> At least I got to see you.
It was an honor to serve... with you.<eos> The honor was mine.<eos> Come back.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> I love you.
Hey.<eos> I am so looking forward to this.<eos> It's gonna be amazing.<eos> - I can't believe you talked me into this.<eos> - I did not talk you into this.
- Well, I had to say it. I did.<eos> Come on.<eos> Please.<eos> - Ah, yes. - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Yes, I love you.
But underwater?<eos> You're in his world.<eos> Can hear your heartbeat for up to five miles away.<eos> Can sense if you're frightened or weak.<eos> Track you down.
Oh, my God, look at those teeth.<eos> I can't believe how close they are.<eos> - I dare you to touch him.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> Well, he definitely likes to look at you.
I'll swim as close to the cage as I can.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> No, no, no, please, Kate.<eos> Promise me you won't leave me down here.<eos> I won't leave you, I promise.
Is anybody there?<eos> - Somebody please answer me!<eos> - Hello!<eos> Kate!<eos> - I can hear you!
- Hello!<eos> Kate!<eos> - I can hear you!<eos> - I said, can you hear me?<eos> - I can hear you, Taylor, it's Kate, it's Kate!
- I said, can you hear me?<eos> - I can hear you, Taylor, it's Kate, it's Kate!<eos> - Say something.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I hear you.
- I can hear you, Taylor, it's Kate, it's Kate!<eos> - Say something.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I hear you.<eos> - I read you loud and clear, Kate.
- How much air do you have in your tank?<eos> I'm at 55 bar.<eos> What does your depth gauge say?<eos> Um, the gauge is at 47 meters.<eos> I had to come up to hear you... I'm at 40 meters.
Oh, thank God.<eos> - We need to conserve our air. - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, it's almost over.<eos> I was so frightened, Kate, waiting for you.
I could never compete with that.<eos> I was always just your boring older sister, but... my relationship with Stuart was the one thing I had that you didn't.<eos> We were never in competition.<eos> Maybe you weren't.<eos> What do you think Stuart would say if he could see you now?
It's okay, they're gonna come and get us.<eos> Read me your air.<eos> Um... um... it says 80 bar.<eos> At this depth, that means we have about 20 minutes, tops, before you run out.<eos> What about you?
Kate, I'm so lost.<eos> Kate, can you hear me?<eos> Get back into the cage!<eos> Kate?<eos> Kate, I can hear you!
Can you hear me?<eos> You're breaking up!<eos> Kate?<eos> I need you to bang a rock or something when you see the flashlight, so I know which way to go.<eos> I can hear you, Kate!
44.<eos> We're gonna get out of here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kate, Lisa, can you hear me?<eos> Taylor, we can hear you.
Breathe in and out, like you told me, okay?<eos> In and out.<eos> - In and out.<eos> - So cold.<eos> Right, I'm gonna come and get you.
Oh, I'm gonna get us out of here.<eos> Please work.<eos> Please, please.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - I'm gonna come and find you. - I...
Please work.<eos> Please, please.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - I'm gonna come and find you. - I...<eos> I'm gonna come and find you, Kate, okay?
I'm so cold.<eos> Kate, keep talking to me, please.<eos> Can you see the beam from my flashlight?<eos> I see you, I see the flashlight. Yes!<eos> Yes, I can hear you!
Kate, keep talking to me, please.<eos> Can you see the beam from my flashlight?<eos> I see you, I see the flashlight. Yes!<eos> Yes, I can hear you!<eos> Okay, I'm coming to find you.
Lisa, if you can hear me, the Coast Guard are coming down right now.<eos> They are going to bring you up.<eos> The Coast Guard is here.<eos> You are going to be fine.<eos> We're going to get you home.
Except one was missing a hand, another one a leg.<eos> So they was thinking it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger.<eos> But neither one of them can drive, one being fictional, the other one extinct.<eos> And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler... and, well... this is a '24 Chrysler.<eos> She found you yet?
Gabriela?<eos> See...<eos> I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.<eos> Well, not really.<eos> I'm looking for someone who's looking for you.
I'm looking for someone who's looking for you.<eos> She took something of mine when I wasn't looking.<eos> Something for which I am responsible.<eos> Mexican lady.<eos> Has her sights on you now.
Forces, forces.<eos> It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.<eos> They don't want me, they want you.<eos> Oh, yes, that's how fucking stupid they are.<eos> They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty.
You always thought... we were part of God's plan.<eos> But maybe...<eos> Maybe we were God's mistake.<eos> What a disappointment you are.<eos> When I found you... you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.
When I found you... you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.<eos> A warm capper to a life as an assassin.<eos> Hooked on barbiturates.<eos> You were an animal.<eos> But we took you in.
- I don't need this shit.<eos> A year ago, you asked me to help you.<eos> And God knows I've tried.<eos> But I can't help you, Logan, not really, if you're not going to talk to me.<eos> I hear you at night. You're not sleeping.
Go!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Come on, hold her down.<eos> As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.
Gotcha!<eos> Come on, hold her down.<eos> As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Very much like you.
Okay, what are we doing? Hmm?<eos> There is a young mutant sitting in our car.<eos> Yeah, I see that.<eos> And where we're taking her, there are others.<eos> Does that mean nothing to you?
He believes you've been dispensing delayed information... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.<eos> I'm offering you the possibility of redemption, Caliban.<eos> To protect the world, and in the process, save your friends.<eos> The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.<eos> Unlike you, she's impure.
This is not the first time I've hurt people.<eos> Until today, I didn't know.<eos> You wouldn't tell me.<eos> So we just kept on running away from it.<eos> I think I finally understand you.
No.<eos> I know, I understand.<eos> This is a long way.<eos> You understand?<eos> I am not taking you to North Dakota.
This is a long way.<eos> You understand?<eos> I am not taking you to North Dakota.<eos> I am fucked up.<eos> And I cannot get you there.
I am not taking you to North Dakota.<eos> I am fucked up.<eos> And I cannot get you there.<eos> It is a two-day drive.<eos> And I am not taking you...
You're with your pals.<eos> You made it.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Nearest bar, for starters.<eos> Hey, I got you here.
- No shit.<eos> It's state of the art, though.<eos> All you gotta do is put in your order, and it does the rest.<eos> Coffee.<eos> You know, I'll just... I'll do it for you, and I think that's just gonna be the easiest.
And then you hit "brew."<eos> And it's done.<eos> Thank God.<eos> And one Americano.<eos> For you.
Daddy didn't learn a Big Sean song, right?<eos> Daddy learned the song from Rent.<eos> - We can do the same dance moves.<eos> - All right, look, Ally,<eos> I know this dance is a big deal for you, okay?
Daddy learned the song from Rent.<eos> - We can do the same dance moves.<eos> - All right, look, Ally,<eos> I know this dance is a big deal for you, okay?<eos> And I'm not gonna let you down.
Uh, let me explain.<eos> He was just masturbating.<eos> And he was just watching.<eos> I wasn't watching.<eos> I caught you.
Well, you know what?<eos> Maybe you just wanna give 'em a free period and call it a day.<eos> A free period?<eos> What good would that do?<eos> Oh, you know, it's the last day of school and I'm sure they'd like you for it, and this isn't working, so...
I think they thought it was a tip.<eos> And now I've got 20 students running out of a classroom in a panic.<eos> Students telling me that Neil's desk has been smashed to pieces, presumably by a fire ax, and you're telling me that you haven't seen anything today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How about you, Strickland? Huh?
I've never seen anything like it, really.<eos> You know what, I think maybe you should take that all in consideration.<eos> And maybe just, you know...<eos> Don't fire him.<eos> I am so sorry he fired you.
- That was hot.<eos> At 100%, it's a toss-up whether the other twin gets back up.<eos> That's not good because Strickland's definitely gonna punch me at 100%.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> He gonna punch you at 110%.
Can I get over here to elaborate with him?<eos> Thank you.<eos> See, he's gonna be aiming for a target in the center of your skull, which is gonna compound the energy as it connects, which is gonna automatically scramble all the gray and white matter in your brain that controls logic, personality, social and sexual behavior.<eos> So at 110%?<eos> Oh, he most definitely is gonna knock all the sex out of you.
Can you get him out of here or what?<eos> Well, if it's going to occur after school, then it's not really my jurisdiction because I'm the school security guard and not the world security guard.<eos> Oh, come on, man...<eos> I don't, like, try and stop terrorist attacks or...<eos> I'm just asking you to do your job here.
I'm just asking you to do your job here.<eos> You're asking me to do the job of security guard after 3:00, when I'm not...<eos> So you're telling me that there's nothing you can do?<eos> I could do CPR.<eos> I could potentially revive you after he renders you unconscious.
I've been practicing all the moves!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - You know what I mean?<eos> I got them down!<eos> I'm not gonna let you down.
- I am.<eos> Let's get you back to school.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Bye, Daddy.<eos> I love you.
You leaned on it, and then you blamed the teacher.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> And Mr. Strickland got in a lot of trouble because of you.
Can you just wait one second?<eos> 'Cause it's all gonna make sense.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Who raped you?
- All right.<eos> - Look, why?<eos> Because actions have consequences, and everybody around here seem to forget about that.<eos> These students, they shit on this school all day and don't nobody do nothing.<eos> Little kids, they come in last place, and pussies like you, you wanna give 'em a trophy.
Hey!<eos> Don't do it.<eos> You be a man.<eos> I refuse!<eos> You know, first I was just gonna punch you a whole lot, Campbell.
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Yeah, because you know what I don't do?<eos> I don't swing axes at the students.<eos> Yeah, that's a little bit of a step too far, I think.<eos> But not for you.
Okay. I tell you what.<eos> I'll go over there, and if he nods like this that means he wants to fight you now.<eos> But again, man, he's not gonna come here because he thinks you're a big fat bitch.<eos> Again, these are his words, they're not mine.<eos> So just look for that nod and know that he's calling you the biggest bitch on the planet.
Respectfully, Suzie, fuck this, okay?<eos> I'm going in.<eos> - No, Andy.<eos> - I'm going in!<eos> Why do you think they haven't called for you?
All right?<eos> I think, in fact, I'm tired of always saying I'm sorry.<eos> I asked you guys a direct fucking question.<eos> What cutbacks are you gonna make?<eos> Campbell, this doesn't concern you, okay?
Wow! Really?<eos> I'm just a teacher?<eos> Well, all right. I may be just a teacher, but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me to ask a goddamn question about something that's gonna affect my ability to fucking teach!<eos> Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.
Okay, we gotta go.<eos> - Let's get out there.<eos> Let's go. - Okay, let's do this.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Trisha, this song is for you.
Than to be fucking with you<eos> Little stupid ass I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck<eos> Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
- I don't give a fuck<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck bitch.<eos> - They just stopped the music.<eos> - I don't give a fuck about you
- Campbell, stay down!<eos> Campbell, stay down!<eos> Bruce Lee style!<eos> God damn it.<eos> Right here. I should just kill you.
You dirty mother...<eos> What the fuck is this shit?<eos> Campbell!<eos> Come here.<eos> So I can fuck you up.
I came anyway, motherfuckers!<eos> Fuck over here. Shit!<eos> Excuse me, I'm the superintendent.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> I'mma kill you.
Fuck over here. Shit!<eos> Excuse me, I'm the superintendent.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> I'mma kill you.<eos> Kill you.
Can you give me a lift to the hospital?<eos> I kind of totaled my car.<eos> - All right.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> I got you.
You get your ass to detention, Freddie.<eos> All right, I'm not joking around.<eos> You get there before I kick it there!<eos> I will kick you into oblivion, Freddie.<eos> I will kick you into dust!
Up top!<eos> Down low.<eos> - Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.<eos> I've been waiting to fuck you up for a long time.
You know my style.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm stressed out, too.<eos> My neighbor got a cat.<eos> - Oh, you don't like a cat looking at you?
It did.<eos> Why you keep shaking your legs like you got something down there<eos> - moving.<eos> - Because you make me nervous.<eos> Because I feel love when I see you.
- now gets to have a life of her own...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And will be working remotely in her pajama jeans and granny panties.<eos> To Julia.<eos> We love you.
Well, at least you know you can if you want to.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - Don't be mad.<eos> Got you a little something.<eos> - I hate you.
No, silly.<eos> Ah, it's just an expression.<eos> Daddy, where's my other blanket?<eos> Oh, Well, it's up in a closet, but how about we just try this one, just for tonight?<eos> Julia got it special for you, okay?
Yeah, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> I love those colors.<eos> Sorry to drop in on you like this.
Thank you.<eos> And so you know, there are links on the calendar to the Facebook group so you can stay informed on activities and who brings snack when.<eos> I'm not on Facebook.<eos> Well, you can look at David's, I suppose.<eos> And he should really add you to the pickup list, now that you're with us.
- How you doin', sweetheart?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> I was just getting dinner ready on the table.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you.
All right, sweetheart. Go to sleep.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> In no time, you will be back with Mommy.<eos> Okay?<eos> I love you.
Let Lily get comfortable with you.<eos> But, I agree. Okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Orange sunsets, skies a blue...<eos> California, we love you.
- Thanks.<eos> Aw. My baby girl.<eos> All right, give Mommy a hug.<eos> Okay, Lily Bean.<eos> I love you, honey.
Not Main Street.<eos> I'll be the first to admit...<eos> I wasn't thrilled with picking up our family, packing, and moving and changing our lives so you could chase this crazy dream.<eos> But I did.<eos> I may not have always agreed with your choices, David, but I always believed in you.
Yes, please.<eos> And, babe, set up your phone tracker app, please.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Of all the days to drop you off late.
Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Of all the days to drop you off late.<eos> And your hair is a mess.<eos> Julia should never have sent you home like this.
- Not now.<eos> Oh, she can show me if she wants.<eos> You look tired.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'll take you to see Dr. McKee.
I got it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> He bailed on me.<eos> I wouldn't say bail as left you in charge.
No.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> He'll love me no matter what, right?<eos> There is nothing not to love.<eos> I love you and I don't even like people.
Yeah.<eos> He's amazing.<eos> You know there was a time when I thought we were on the road to getting back together.<eos> We even went to therapy.<eos> But then he met you.
Don't you get off this horse.<eos> What are you...<eos> David's gonna hear about this.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> That was beneath you.
Yes.<eos> You only get one mother, Lily.<eos> I only want what is best for us.<eos> Don't ever forget that.<eos> Now if Julia insists on sending you home with such tangled hair...
When I saw what she did to Lily, yeah, I did, I got angry.<eos> I got in her face, I grabbed her arm, but I did not push her.<eos> And I think she might have slipped on purpose.<eos> Yeah, maybe the truth lies somewhere in between.<eos> Why would you believe the person who gave up on you instead of me?
Lily...<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be right back, I promise.<eos> Lily-<eos> I'm gonna carry you to my car.
We're okay.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I'm gonna make this up to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> I love you, Julia.
Is that so hard?<eos> I imagine when you joined the monastery, They did not tell you that you would be a pack mule.<eos> He's not a monk, my lord.<eos> He's a converso, a lay brother.<eos> Some of my men think they know you, but not from where.
They are descendants of the Norse men.<eos> And they conquered France and England, and will do the same here.<eos> But was there ever a truly peace in this land, brother? Before the foreigners came.<eos> That was a long time ago, Diarmuid.<eos> I was just a boy. A little older than you.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.<eos> "Very well," said the merchant. "I give in. I am yours."<eos> "But tell me, why did you look surprised" "when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"<eos> "Because," said Death,<eos> "I had an appointment with you tonight..." "in Samarra."
We are.<eos> 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.<eos> 'Please repeat the question.'<eos> As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.<eos> To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
'Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right? '<eos> No!<eos> Picture's frozen!<eos> 'Yeah, signal's rubbish.<eos> But I can still hear you.'
What?<eos> - The son who was in Tibet.<eos> DNA all checks out.<eos> Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later... the dead boy's found at the wheel.<eos> Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
How do you know about that?<eos> 'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'<eos> They know everything!<eos> 'Solved it, then? '<eos> I'm working on it. 'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
So... don't wait up.<eos> Hey, Sherlock.<eos> Hey.<eos> Mary, what are you doing here?<eos> She's better at this than you.
Who?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We... We all had one but the others were...<eos> Haven't you even looked at it yet?<eos> I glanced at it but I prefer to hear it from you.
You do.<eos> I made a vow, remember?<eos> To look after the three of you.<eos> Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.<eos> Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,<eos> 'I'm sorry, my love.'<eos> 'I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.<eos> 'Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate 'the roll of a dice.<eos> 'I need to move the target far, far away from you 'and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
In a way that was true.<eos> In a way?<eos> So many lies.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And I don't just mean you.
Mary, I may not be a very good man... ..but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for, most of the time.<eos> All the time.<eos> You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.<eos> You never judge, you never complain.<eos> I don't deserve you, I...
I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I mean, you're clever.<eos> You found her but I found you.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.<eos> But you?<eos> You, where were you?<eos> That day at the embassy, I escaped.<eos> Ha! But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Me?<eos> You know I'll kill you too.<eos> You know I will, Ajay.<eos> What, you think I care if I die?<eos> I've dreamed of killing you... ..every night for six years.
What's going on?<eos> I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.<eos> What?<eos> 'So many lies.<eos> And I don't just mean you.'
Yes.<eos> I... so like you.<eos> Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.<eos> I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.<eos> He says...<eos> John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...<eos> Yes?<eos> He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.
You know, they've gone down the pub.<eos> It's all on me. (CHUCKLES)<eos> Oh Faith.<eos> Don't you think I should take that?<eos> It's only going to upset you.
-You should be at Baker Street.<eos> -I am.<eos> So are you.<eos> They found your address.<eos> They brought you here.
-How did you get him in the boot?<eos> -The boys from the cafe.<eos> They dropped me.<eos> Twice!<eos> And you know why they dropped you, dear?
He knew you'd get a new therapist after I died because you'd need to change everything.<eos> That's just what you're like.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You keep your weekends for Rosie so you needed to see someone during working hours.<eos> Because you're an idiot, you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions with someone reasonably close.
Weeks.<eos> Let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> For Christ's sake, Sherlock!<eos> It's not a game.<eos> I'm worried about you, Molly.
Oh, has that door locked itself again?<eos> Yeah, it's always doing that.<eos> You can't save John, because he won't let you.<eos> He won't allow himself to be saved.<eos> The only way to save John, is to make him save you.
Possibly I'm biased.<eos> Perhaps the drugs opened certain doors in my mind.<eos> -I'm intrigued.<eos> -Look, I know you are.<eos> Which is why we're all taking it in turns to keep you off the sweeties.
Before you know it.<eos> She was wrong about me.<eos> Mary?<eos> How so?<eos> She thought that if you put yourself in harm's way, I'd... I'd rescue you or something.
Help me.<eos> Hello.<eos> My name's Jim Moriarty.<eos> Welcome to the final problem.<eos> You know I could arrest you.
How did you manage to get out of this place?<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Easy.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I am looking at you.
Poor little thing.<eos> Alone in the sky on a great, big plane with nowhere to land.<eos> But where in the world is she?<eos> It's a clever little puzzle.<eos> If you want to apply yourself to it, I can re-connect you, but first...
So, it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you.<eos> Everything here.<eos> So, who loves you?
What do you want?<eos> Tick-tock, tick-tock...<eos> Molly, please, without asking why, just say these words.<eos> What words?<eos> "I love you."
- Say it.<eos> Say it like you mean it.<eos> Final 30 seconds.<eos> I...<eos> I love you.
Say it like you mean it.<eos> Final 30 seconds.<eos> I...<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Molly.<eos> Molly, please.<eos> I love you.
Look what you did to yourself.<eos> All those complicated little emotions.<eos> I lost count.<eos> Emotional context, Sherlock.<eos> It destroys you every time.
God!<eos> I should have expected this. Pathetic.<eos> You always were the slow one.<eos> The idiot.<eos> That's why I've always despised you.
- Yeah, it's flooding.<eos> The well is flooding.<eos> Try as long as possible not to drown.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going to find you.
The well is flooding.<eos> Try as long as possible not to drown.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going to find you.<eos> I am finding you.
Sherlock?<eos> The bones I found...<eos> Yes?<eos> They're dog's bones, that's Redbeard.<eos> Mycroft's been lying to you, to both of us.
Your mind has created the perfect metaphor.<eos> You're high above us, all alone in the sky, and you understand everything except how to land.<eos> Now, I'm just an idiot.<eos> But I'm on the ground.<eos> - I can bring you home. - No.
Am, too.<eos> I was here first.<eos> Just wait until Mom and Dad find out about this.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You think they'd pick you over me?
Destroy.<eos> Lam-Lam!<eos> I've got fresh batteries.<eos> Boom!<eos> Mom and Dad don't even know you.
There's something about puppies.<eos> It's one big baby con-spy-racy!<eos> Timothy Leslie Templeton!<eos> We are very disappointed in you.<eos> No, we're mad at you!
It's one big baby con-spy-racy!<eos> Timothy Leslie Templeton!<eos> We are very disappointed in you.<eos> No, we're mad at you!<eos> Exactly, we're mad at you.
I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?<eos> We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you.
We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> Here's to never seeing you again.
You're a baby!<eos> You take that back.<eos> My life was perfect until you showed up!<eos> Believe me, kid, the feeling is mutual.<eos> I wish I'd never met you!
You do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't do this without you, Tim.
I can clearly see you winking.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm using my left eye?<eos> I am Groot.<eos> They were not looking at you funny.
Oh, shit.<eos> I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That was meant to be behind your back.<eos> Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.
It's not ripe yet... and I hate you.<eos> You hate me?<eos> You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.<eos> And yet here you stand, a hero.<eos> I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you.
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.<eos> I bet it's the one-inch man.<eos> After all these years, I've found you.
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."<eos> Yondu!<eos> Come on down!<eos> After going around years in circles... with this woman I end up marrying.<eos> I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl... but you're losing your mind!"
You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta... I have a proposition for you.<eos> I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.
I have no clue as to why.<eos> Well, I'll tell you why.<eos> Because I was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places adults couldn't.<eos> It made it easier for thieving'.<eos> Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.
Not long after.<eos> It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.<eos> I called her my river lily.<eos> And from that love, Peter... you.<eos> I have searched for you for so long.
That's how I hear you in my head!<eos> What was your second choice?<eos> Scrotum Hat?<eos> New plan.<eos> We're killing you first.
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.<eos> Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.<eos> There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet... and the light within.<eos> They are a part of you, Peter.
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?<eos> I am hideous?<eos> You are horrifying to look at.<eos> But that's a good thing.<eos> Oh? When you're ugly, and someone loves you... you know they love you for who you are.
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.<eos> But I was young... and greedy, and stupid.<eos> Like you stealing those batteries.<eos> That was mostly Drax.<eos> Me and Stakar and the other captains... we weren't so different from you and your friends.
Psychopath!<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I win.<eos> I win.<eos> I bested you in combat.
You were the one who wanted to win.<eos> And I just wanted a sister!<eos> You were all I had.<eos> But you were the one who needed to win.<eos> Thanos pulled my eye from my head... and my brain from my skull... and my arm from my body... because of you.
We need to talk.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.<eos> What?<eos> I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting.
You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.<eos> I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.

I mean, that was true.<eos> They never felt a thing.<eos> But one after the other, they failed me.<eos> Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.<eos> Until you, Peter.
Now, all right...<eos> I know that sounds bad.<eos> Who in the hell do you think you are?<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> I tried... so hard... to find the form... that best suited you... and this is the thanks I get?
He will be back soon.<eos> What's Smurfette doing here?<eos> Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.<eos> She tried to murder me!<eos> I saved you, you stupid fox!
Yondu?<eos> Thrusters are out.<eos> Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.<eos> You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.<eos> You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?<eos> That's what you told me, you old doofus.<eos> Once I figured out what happened to them other kids... I wasn't just gonna hand you over.
So stop pissing me off!<eos> We have to get up to the extraction point!<eos> Go!<eos> I told you... I don't want to do this alone.<eos> You cannot deny... the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.
I had a pretty cool dad.<eos> What I'm trying to say here is... sometimes that thing you're searching for your whole life... it's right there by your side all along.<eos> You don't even know it.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> He did call you twig.
I will help them by killing Thanos.<eos> I don't know if that's possible.<eos> You will always be my sister.<eos> Pete!<eos> Captain found this for you in a junker shop.
Well, Daddy was a psychopath, Frank. I mean, that's hardly an unfair slur.<eos> "What did you do in the war, Daddy?"<eos> "I manufactured the napalm that made everybody's skin fall off."<eos> And this is a man who called his child an idiot loser.<eos> Well, in fairness to your father, when he called you an idiot loser, you had just signed up for a two-year course in California called "Unleash Your Calling."
You don't even know if she can do anything but cry.<eos> Whereas I am loved... all over the world.<eos> Could you sit down and shut the fucking squeaking and whining?<eos> You know... You are forcing me...<eos> I'm forcing you to do what?
Really?<eos> They keep showing very unflattering pictures of you in the press.<eos> Those ones of you as a fat child on Daddy's knee.<eos> Such nasty remarks.<eos> All eyes are on you, aren't they, squeaky clean icon?
- I have all this stuff and...<eos> - Hey, K... K.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I hold you dear to my heart, but you have dishonored the 40-year history and meaningful legacy of the Animal Liberation Front.<eos> You have betrayed the great minds and brave fighters that have preceded you.
I think she understands some English.<eos> So we should be careful what we say.<eos> Yes, yes, everything is fine.<eos> But you have to wear this.<eos> It's a special edition, custom-made, just for you.
Yeah, but she really frightens people.<eos> She reminds them of Daddy.<eos> This is mine.<eos> This is my project.<eos> She just wants to support you on your special day.
So it's kind of a win-win for everybody in this situation.<eos> - Carl.<eos> - Ruth.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Looking for you.
Jerry!<eos> Respect.<eos> She's a beautiful soul.<eos> And she's married.<eos> That never stopped you before.
Weird.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Does this, by any chance, mean that I can go in there with you?<eos> I brought us two lattes again.<eos> Well, since there's no one here to stop you, I guess you could come in for a little while.
- Who is it, honey?<eos> It's Dave, Dave Macklay.<eos> Dave, hey.<eos> What's going on, buddy?<eos> Bill, I'm gonna have to put you under arrest.
There's been a mistake.<eos> All right?<eos> I haven't done anything wrong.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything.<eos> I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.<eos> This information seems pretty important to you.
I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.<eos> This information seems pretty important to you.<eos> Don't worry. I'll get it for you.
Hawk, watch carefully.<eos> I will, Margaret.<eos> I'm too weak to go with you.<eos> But stop by.<eos> I have coffee and pie for you.
There is something really wrong.<eos> It's her life.<eos> Hey, over there.<eos> There's James.<eos> He's staring at you again.
Beautiful agent, barely 30.<eos> I'm oldschool, Denise.<eos> You know that.<eos> Before you were Denise, when you were Dennis and I was your boss, when I had you working undercover at the DEA, you were a confused and wild thing sometimes.<eos> I had enough dirt on you to fill the Grand Canyon, and I never used a spoonful because you were and are a great agent.
Sheriff Truman, look who's here!<eos> It's Wally.<eos> We're so excited.<eos> He came in unannounced.<eos> Good to see you again, Wally.
Sometimes to the left.<eos> Sometimes to the right.<eos> Except on cloudy days... or at night.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, Wally... it's great to see you again.
Ladies and gentlemen,<eos> I am going to speak now to Special Agent Dale Cooper.<eos> We'll be down the hall if you need us.<eos> Thank you, Warden Murphy.<eos> It's very good to see you again, old friend.

What messages were those, Coop?<eos> Messages so Phillip knows it's safe.<eos> Gordon?<eos> When are you going to get me out of here?<eos> Coop, these fine fellows here have sufficient cause to hold you for now.
When are you going to get me out of here?<eos> Coop, these fine fellows here have sufficient cause to hold you for now.<eos> Of course, I will be exonerated in courts of law.<eos> Very good, Coop.<eos> And rest assured that we are working to bring you back home for our talk.
Work.<eos> Damn.<eos> Your car.<eos> Okay, get in.<eos> I'll drive you.
- Mary. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Seven up.<eos> All right.<eos> Coffee.<eos> Sorry, Dougie. I didn't get one for you.
I need a full assessment on each case.<eos> And what you come back with tomorrow will have a whole hell of a lot to do with your future at this company.<eos> Case files.<eos> Is the men's room locked?<eos> Come on, I'll sneak you in the ladies'.
- Honey, I can give you this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - But this is all I got.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I love you.
- But this is all I got.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Becky.<eos> Shelly, this is the third time she's asked you for money in two weeks.
No, stop it.<eos> Hey, leave her alone.<eos> Little fucking smoking babies.<eos> Makes me laugh.<eos> I'm gonna laugh when I fuck you, bitch!
Have you eaten?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna fix you a sandwich.<eos> Tomorrow lunchtime, I'm taking you to see Dr. Ben.<eos> He needs to take a good look at you.
Case files.<eos> Case files.<eos> And this one... there's nothing written on it.<eos> Okay, Dougie, you need to go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim.<eos> He's been waiting up for you.
Case files.<eos> And this one... there's nothing written on it.<eos> Okay, Dougie, you need to go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim.<eos> He's been waiting up for you.<eos> Up for you.
When?<eos> Noonthirty tomorrow.<eos> What a mess you've made of our lives, Dougie.<eos> Now, what am I gonna do with you?<eos> I was gonna take you to see Dr. Ben tomorrow during your lunch hour.
I had some scrambled eggs and... and an English muffin with huckleberry jam.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mighty good talking to you, Doc.<eos> I'll give your good wishes to Harry.<eos> Whatever this is about, well, I hope it turns out all right for you.
What does this all mean?<eos> Tammy, you've been doing excellent work, passing one test after another.<eos> Put out your hands.<eos> Flip 'em over.<eos> "I'm very, very happy to see you again, old friend."
What'd you say your name was, again?<eos> Tammy.<eos> Fuck you, Tammy.<eos> I knew it was going to be you.<eos> It's good to see you again, Diane.
Buckhorn Police Department.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you, Colonel.<eos> Hey, partner.<eos> We was expecting you last night.
Hey, Chantal. Boss man's here.<eos> Grab the kit.<eos> Is he hurt?<eos> Shit.<eos> We was waiting for you all night.
Rather than return directly to Philadelphia, would you mind if we made a short trip to Buckhorn, South Dakota?<eos> It's quite important.<eos> Fuck you, Gordon.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> This is important, and it could be of interest to you, Diane.
I can't believe this day has come.<eos> Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.<eos> Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.<eos> He saw this life for you.
Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.<eos> Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.<eos> He saw this life for you.<eos> Your father never lost faith in you.
Hello?<eos> Batman?<eos> Hi, Jimmy!<eos> It's the Jokes. Oop!<eos> Nobody calls you that.
Computer!<eos> Calculating.<eos> Never.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I'm always one step ahead of you.
Ah, yes, the notorious space jail that houses the greatest super-villains of all time.<eos> They've got, like, the sickest baddies up there.<eos> They got, like, this guy.<eos> - And her.<eos> - I'll get you, my pretty!
- What?<eos> I probably shouldn't leave until I get the thumbs up from my new old man, Bruce Wayne.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> Bruno and I decided to share custody of you.
But with vulnerabilities.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No way.<eos> So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?<eos> They're standing right behind you.
- A family battle mission!<eos> - Right.<eos> Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler, and maybe root around, see if you can find a few Vitamin waters or something, and then we'll head out.<eos> - Right away, sir.<eos> - Anything for you, Padre.
What have you done to my...<eos> Bruce Wayne's house?<eos> You'd better hope he's a cool guy and doesn't go crazy.<eos> What happened to all your friends?<eos> I don't need friends. I don't need anyone to stop you.
Kid, don't do that.<eos> Atomic batteries to power.<eos> Turbines to speed.<eos> Don't do what I would do!<eos> I never even taught you how to drive!
Flip.<eos> Flip? What is that? I don't...<eos> You gotta turn around.<eos> I call it the Babs-Signal.<eos> And I'm flipping the switch for you.
I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too.<eos> - I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.<eos> I hate you forever.
Please, get out of here now.<eos> Ward... you need to calm down.<eos> Calm down?<eos> Are you seriously telling me to calm down?<eos> - Get out, or I will throw you out.
Dad says rules are for pussies.<eos> Hello!<eos> - Hey, we're home.<eos> - We're up here.<eos> Oh, but here comes Mommy and Daddy to protect you.
- Ward.<eos> - Hi.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Danny's been kind of a problem.<eos> Uh, I didn't mean to spook you.
It doesn't even have an edge.<eos> Trust me... you don't wanna know what it feels like to have a practice sword smack you hard on the side of the face.<eos> I already do.<eos> Ask Master Lei Kung the Thunderer.<eos> I'm asking you... nicely... one last time.
No, Ward, I'm not behind it.<eos> I wish you'd take things like this more seriously, so that I don't see my company destroyed.<eos> - So it's your company now?<eos> - It's always been my company.<eos> You know, I could just ignore you.
Oh, sometimes you still sound like you're an eight-year-old.<eos> Yeah, yeah, Dad.<eos> I get the whole "disappointed-in-me" thing.<eos> You've been doing it my whole life.<eos> I expect more of you.
Okay.<eos> But...<eos> I have mace in my purse, and I can touch one button and have a guard here.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> So... what makes you think Ward tried to kill you?
Very sure.<eos> Well, you seem to have gotten away.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This time.<eos> All right, even if Shannon did attack you, I have to believe that it was something he... might have instigated on his own.
He's your tour guide.<eos> You gonna try and stab me?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> I get stressed.<eos> but don't let that fool you.
They drugged me.<eos> They... they... they brought me here against my will.<eos> You saw me being attacked the other night.<eos> You know there's something going on.<eos> Why would anyone be after you in the first place?
Sorry.<eos> Wish I could say more.<eos> Danny.<eos> Harold?<eos> Do you remember that song I used to sing... that would annoy the shit out of you?
- Oh, you don't need to know that.<eos> And I want you to put Joy onto Patel.<eos> She'll be able to close it.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Doesn't it occur to you that I'm doing this all for you?
- Really?<eos> Because it doesn't seem that way when you directly disobey an order.<eos> I asked to have Danny moved to a safe location, and you tried to have him killed.<eos> You don't understand that...<eos> If you just do things my way, it'll all work out for you, Ward.
You don't understand that...<eos> If you just do things my way, it'll all work out for you, Ward.<eos> Can't you see that?<eos> Danny has nowhere else to go, but to come to us.<eos> So I'm asking you, when he reappears, keep him safe... until I decide what to do with him.
You're my son, and I'm gonna make you a great man.<eos> Just cooperate.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Yeah, I get it.<eos> Hey, I love you, Ward.
I have to live in the real world, Danny.<eos> This is how it works!<eos> I've been meaning to ask... what's this?<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> - Someone attacked you?
Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.<eos> Why is everyone on at me about how I look?<eos> It's New York City.<eos> It matters.<eos> If this is too much for you...
Draw strength from your center.<eos> Go slow at the beginning.<eos> Come on.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Who put you in charge?
It will go directly to your nephew.<eos> Tonight.<eos> How the hell did you manage this?<eos> Rand has many friends.<eos> We'd like to add you to that list.
I'm tired... of a lot of things.<eos> I'd miss you.<eos> So you wouldn't come with me?<eos> I love Rand.<eos> If it's not like that for you that's fine.
Trying to get my head around all this.<eos> This is not the time or the place.<eos> You were like a brother to me.<eos> A terrible jackass of a brother, but still...<eos> I looked up to you.
What does that have to do with anything?<eos> I know you sent that guy.<eos> You were the only one with me the day I broke my arm.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - Why is this so important to you?
Gonna be you?<eos> Who's gonna be the tough guy, huh?<eos> You?<eos> You gonna be the tough guy?<eos> How about you, pretty boy? You?
This is a...<eos> The Daughter of the Dragon!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I don't know where you came from, but you're welcome anytime.<eos> Good to see you again, Jeri.
So... there I was.<eos> Hadn't even gotten over losing my best friend, not to mention you and Heather.<eos> I've got two kids to take care of.<eos> Their mom gone and in the middle of this... this misery, some people approach me with a cure, and it placed me in their debt.<eos> And they cured you?
Yeah, I still remember my last breath.<eos> Scariest shit I've ever experienced.<eos> And three days later...<eos> I'm breathing again.<eos> So, who saved you?
She'll set something up.<eos> Hey, morning, Megan.<eos> Um, I just wanted to, uh, set up a meeting with Joy.<eos> I'll check her schedule.<eos> We should be able to squeeze you in sometime in the next two or three days.
Mmm-hmm. Well, taking care of this will more than make up for that drug pricing screw-up this afternoon.<eos> Joy is keeping Danny busy.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> That's what I like to hear.<eos> Love you, son.
- What happened to you?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Hey, can you, uh...<eos> Can you keep an eye on Joy for me?<eos> Wasn't he stalking you?
- But Harold...<eos> - That's between the two of you.<eos> I have real business in the real world to deal with.<eos> Fine.<eos> - I'll leave you to it then.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're Danny Rand, right?<eos> I've seen you on the news.
You're Danny Rand, right?<eos> I've seen you on the news.<eos> Talk about a riches-to-rags-to-riches story.<eos> Yeah, it's been pretty crazy.<eos> You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.
Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?<eos> - What?<eos> That everyone knows me now.<eos> It doesn't bother you?
That it's my destiny.<eos> 'Cause if you really believe that you can take these sons of bitches out... then I have to believe, too.<eos> But going against them on your own, that's some foolish bullshit, no matter who you are.<eos> He's not alone.<eos> I can't ask anything more from you.
Because of who you are, there will always be forces gathering against you... preparing, waiting... looking for a weakness in you.
They study your every move, looking for what you reveal to them.<eos> In this way, you are your own worst enemy.<eos> The time has come.<eos> The time has come.<eos> And this is why I tolerate no questioning from you... because doubt leads... To death.
I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> The Hand was a myth drummed into me.<eos> I'd never met them face-to-face.<eos> You're saying I have more experience fighting the Hand than you?
It's the reason I've gotten this far.<eos> Defeat has no place in my mind.<eos> This isn't a tournament.<eos> Or any kind of challenge you're used to.<eos> If you lose... they'll kill you.
Or did you come here to destroy the Hand?<eos> - Is that why you're here?<eos> - I don't think he knows why he's here.<eos> He's just a little boy chasing girls.<eos> The enemy will try and divide you.
Banish it.<eos> I can't.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Just give in.<eos> It's the life you want, and I can give it to you.
I was feeling a little...<eos> You know, I... I hurt my hand.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not like that, Joy.<eos> Let's get you out of here.
I swear on the lives of my children, I have nothing to do with Danny Rand.<eos> Harold, we have a problem.<eos> You killed them.<eos> What choice did I have?<eos> They were going to kill you, Danny.
Hey, don't play her game.<eos> That's what she wants.<eos> Time isn't on our side.<eos> Look how out of control this has already gotten.<eos> What I had to do to protect you.
Gao will know they're missing, but as long as it looks as though they did their job before they left...<eos> What job?<eos> To remind me of my mistakes.<eos> Do you understand how stupid that was?<eos> What if someone had seen you in there?
"My actions were impulsive, and I now realize the severity of my words."<eos> Is this an apology?<eos> No, it's the statement you're gonna be making at the board meeting this afternoon.<eos> It sort of seems like an apology.<eos> Well... apologies are what got you into this disaster, so, yeah, officially, it's a statement.
And now, an immortal weapon has left K'un-Lun, not to fulfill his duty, but in dereliction of it.<eos> History says that the Iron Fist and the Hand are mortal enemies.<eos> But I wonder... in the spirit of change, perhaps we can be something different.<eos> Last night showed me the truth.<eos> K'un-Lun did not send you to hunt us down.
I, uh, I talked to Danny.<eos> He said he's gonna apologize to the board.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.
He said he's gonna apologize to the board.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.<eos> I love you.
For your work ethic, your commitment to the code, and, most importantly, honoring and protecting your fellow classmates.<eos> You're part of something bigger than yourself now, Darryl.<eos> And that will make you stronger.<eos> A single arrow is easily broken... but not ten in a bundle.<eos> I came to warn you.
How did you know<eos> - about the account?<eos> - I always knew.<eos> Did you really think it was that easy to steal millions of dollars from the company and not get caught?<eos> Come on, I thought I raised you smarter than that.
Much simpler.<eos> I am sick of it!<eos> The control, the manipulation...<eos> Yeah, I know you're upset.<eos> You don't see it now, but I had to stop you from leaving.
Now, if you had run away, run away like a scared child, you would have regretted it every day for the rest of your life.<eos> Now, relax.<eos> You just had a moment of weakness.<eos> Eh, it happens.<eos> I'm not gonna punish you for it.
You can't believe anything that she says to you.<eos> Look, that may be true.<eos> But if there's even the smallest chance that I can find out the truth, then I have to go.<eos> Otherwise, it's just gonna be this cloud hanging over me for the rest of my life.<eos> Well, there is no rest of your life if she kills you.
A gentleman never kisses and tells.<eos> You don't have to say anything.<eos> It's written all over your face.<eos> "Danny Rand got some."<eos> What about you?
Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> We got you, Danny.<eos> Dad!<eos> I love you, Danny!
It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Part of me is sorry you understand that.<eos> And the rest?<eos> Is glad I found you.
- You're goddamn right I did.<eos> You tried to cut a deal behind my back, didn't you?<eos> I could've gotten us both what we wanted.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> I did this for you.
Exploiting his corporate crusader image?<eos> Exposing the board for wanting to oust us because we wanted to stop poisoning people?<eos> I'm sorry, but that is a profoundly stupid idea.<eos> You can't keep him in line.<eos> Every time he opens his mouth, he digs you deeper into the hole.
Are you suggesting that I'm somehow responsible for this shitty scheme?<eos> I've known for a while that you... indulged in the extra back pill.<eos> You always seemed to have it under control.<eos> But I wanted the file in case it ever caused problems at Rand.<eos> And this wasn't a problem for you until it was a problem for Rand?
I just have no idea who you've been seeing, or what you've been reading, or... anything about your life outside of Rand.<eos> We didn't used to be like this.<eos> One day, you just put up a wall, and I never understood why.<eos> Did I do something?<eos> I was protecting you.
One day, you just put up a wall, and I never understood why.<eos> Did I do something?<eos> I was protecting you.<eos> From what?<eos> Ward, I love you.
Whatever it is.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I can't.<eos> Well then, I guess I'll just tell you something I've been keeping from you.
Come on.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I don't know anyone as brilliant or as fearless.<eos> You come up with these crazy ideas.<eos> And you stand your ground, even when the entire board tries to fight you on it.
When I'm in the fight club, I'm beating the shit out of people... I'm completely out of control.<eos> I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> And this from someone who has always been in complete control.<eos> So what happened?<eos> I met you.
I suspect our guests may be from a bit further away.<eos> Go and find out.<eos> Find Claire.<eos> I'm gonna go after Gao.<eos> She's expecting you.
Your haircut for example, very nice.<eos> But we both swore an oath of loyalty and protection.<eos> Your masters are murderers.<eos> Our paths diverge in a different place.<eos> But unlike you, I've remained true to my vow.
Does he look okay?<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?<eos> I want you to know everything I've been keeping from you.
No.<eos> Not till you explain this.<eos> The truth is...<eos> I'm having financial trouble.<eos> I brought you here to ask you for money, but you're making me feel like an asshole, so forget about it.
I don't understand why we had to bring her here.<eos> Never let the enemy choose the battlefield.<eos> Always work from a position of strength.<eos> Why should we be enemies?<eos> And don't let the enemy bait you into a trap.
Tell me what I want to know.<eos> Or what?<eos> - Danny!<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
Call me back, tell me what's going on, or I'll find out on my own.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Danny.<eos> Hey.<eos> I knew I'd find you here.
I know the burden you carry.<eos> A woman in this world.<eos> You are consistently underestimated.<eos> Last... warning.<eos> Your grandfather was right to train you the way he did.
Call me back, tell me what's going on, or I'll find out on my own.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Hello?<eos> Kyle?<eos> After your mother delivered you... the nurse wrapped you in a blanket... placed you in my arms.
I've destroyed everything that ever mattered to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I never meant it.<eos> Please, please, please, please, forgive me.<eos> I love you.
I love you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> No, I don't know that.<eos> You're my son, and I love you.
So... what do you want, Ward?<eos> I'll do anything you ask.<eos> I want you to leave me alone.<eos> I don't want any part of Rand... or any of this insanity.<eos> I want my own life away from you.
So you'll let me go?<eos> I want my family back, healthy and whole.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I'll do anything, anything to make that happen.<eos> I was only trying to toughen you up so you could... face this world and win.
We're gonna get through this.<eos> Right, Claire?<eos> Yep.<eos> Time is up, Danny Rand.<eos> Your friends are going to die because of you.
Do you remember those nights?<eos> When I was sick?<eos> And you and Ward were there every two hours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we had to turn you in your bed. Keep you from getting bedsores.
I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.<eos> Joy...<eos> Joy, I... I love you.
It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time...<eos> This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you.<eos> I could hear you and Ward on the other side, and...
- Hey.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but...<eos> I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.
Why are you frowning?<eos> I'm not.<eos> But you are.<eos> Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.
Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.<eos> Pain, lack, fear... and replace it with energy, abundance, trust.<eos> You are rooted... tied to the force that binds all life.<eos> Let it course through you.
Yeah. Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.<eos> That's funny... she's never mentioned you.
Yeah.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.<eos> That's funny... she's never mentioned you.<eos> She's just being protective.<eos> Does that bother you?
Once I saw it, I became obsessed, learning all that I could about the Iron Fist.<eos> What it was capable of.<eos> What it could achieve.<eos> That's how you know about the healing.<eos> All the qigong masters talk about it, but as a theory, because they haven't met you... don't possess what you have.
- Dad, it is too early to be drinking...<eos> - Come on.<eos> Open it.<eos> - and I'm... I can't.<eos> - One for you.
- and I'm... I can't.<eos> - One for you.<eos> One for me.<eos> Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.
I can, sort of, fit in wherever.<eos> - This is the first family I've ever had.<eos> - Food's good, too.<eos> Yeah, and I've been learning a ton.<eos> - I bet I could take you now.
You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?<eos> I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.<eos> Not everyone around you does the same.
I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.<eos> Not everyone around you does the same.<eos> That's not true!<eos> They are stealing your ability to trust.<eos> That is how they crush you.
- Then explain it to me.<eos> Make it make sense.<eos> Because right now, all I'm hearing are lies<eos> - and evasion...<eos> - I already met you!
And was that before or after you knew about the Fist?<eos> Before.<eos> And was it his idea that you sleep with me?<eos> Danny...<eos> So when did Bakuto approach you with this... this idea of recruiting me?
How much longer until the, uh, system reboots?<eos> Two minutes, thirty.<eos> Well, make sure you get the fingerprints and the gunpowder residue right.<eos> I guess you better hurry.<eos> Lei Kung sent me to bring you home.
I'm not sure I can explain.<eos> You owe me an answer.<eos> The people of K'un-Lun need to know why they were abandoned.<eos> And what about the people here?<eos> The ones who were just trying to kill you?
You have failed, Danny.<eos> Failed in every way.<eos> The Fist won't even ignite now.<eos> Our only chance may be to return and submit to Lei Kung.<eos> And let's hope he can restore you, because if not...
I can save Danny, too.<eos> He doesn't understand the good we're doing.<eos> - I can make him see.<eos> - The time for understanding is over.<eos> He sees you as one of us and that is all he will ever see.
In case we're being followed.<eos> Uh, I've... I've already checked.<eos> Twice.<eos> - Just do it again. - I'm...<eos> I'm not going to leave you.
- I'm not.<eos> I'm gonna defeat the Hand, Claire.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> It's what the Order of the Crane Mother has trained me for.<eos> And did those monks teach you how to deal with a broken heart?
No, I was gonna say some sleep.<eos> You were up all night.<eos> After these past few weeks, constantly feeling like I'm drowning, it's like I know what I'm doing again.<eos> I'm back in control.<eos> We're gonna get you free, Dad.
Uh, it's... just the pizza.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I should go with you.<eos> Uh... You know, it's hard enough being a delivery guy without a warrior monk accidently kicking the crap out of you.
I'm part of one that is trying to help people.<eos> Then did you think about trying a different name for the group?<eos> Like the Ear?<eos> Or the Arm?<eos> I didn't want to hurt you.
What did you think was gonna happen?<eos> Right.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look, I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.
Right.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look, I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.
Wait.<eos> Look, I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.<eos> I told him that I thought you were a good person, no matter what.<eos> So if I let you in... what are you gonna tell him?
The world is more complicated than what a bunch of monks think.<eos> - The Hand is evil.<eos> - You're wrong!<eos> Why are you even here, Colleen?<eos> Because... because I care about you.
I need to get it to my father's old business partner.<eos> He can help us out.<eos> Okay, Danny, think this through.<eos> You can't just keep charging into this.<eos> The Hand wants something from you.
Whatever you need.<eos> The Hand always comes first.<eos> Mmm... It's good to have you back, Danny.<eos> He told me everything.<eos> We were just trying to protect you.
We were just trying to protect you.<eos> By lying to me?<eos> Oh, Joy.<eos> He was just respecting my wishes.<eos> He was trying to keep you safe.
Even if we have to murder people to do it?<eos> Whatever it takes, Joy.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> So... are we ready to turn off the Hand's accounts?<eos> Dad, I just got you back.
- Bakuto, what the hell is this?<eos> You were supposed to tell me when you found Danny.<eos> I blame myself for this.<eos> Bakuto, I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.
I blame myself for this.<eos> Bakuto, I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You've let Danny infect you with doubt about our cause.
Anger.<eos> It's like a... a fire burning inside of me.<eos> Every time it happens, it... it gets harder and harder to control.<eos> Did you ever think that maybe this turmoil you're in is because you questioned Lei Kung's teachings?<eos> If you'd just followed the path he laid out for you, none of this would be happening.
I've seen this world.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm not sure it's worth fighting for.<eos> Come home.<eos> Danny, what is keeping you here?
Wait, we have to wait for Bakuto.<eos> Hey!<eos> Whoa! Colleen, wait!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> - I'm not here to hurt you.
- Though, I'm no friend of Gao's.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I can get help you get out of here.<eos> And most importantly, I can free you from your father.
All of this and freedom from your father forever.<eos> It sounds good, no?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> I do have an immediate favor to ask of you.
It's all he knows.<eos> All he's ever been taught.<eos> When did you become such a milkmaid, Danny?<eos> We're gonna take care of Bakuto, and we're doing it with Colleen.<eos> You know, this place has confused you.
- Well, I'm...<eos> I'm helping Dad free us from the Hand.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> - What?<eos> - He's using you, Joy.
That's because he is a piece of garbage, and you're human.<eos> The longer I spend in New York, the more I realize the duality in life.<eos> My grandmother always said that that was the truest sign of wisdom.<eos> I didn't get it then, but now...<eos> I'm gonna put you in a hotel.
I don't wanna have to swing twice.<eos> Any last words?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ward...<eos> I invested my life into you, to raise you to be a great man.
Yeah.<eos> Ward...<eos> I invested my life into you, to raise you to be a great man.<eos> You've been the biggest disappointment of my life.<eos> Joy, I apologize for choosing Ward over you.
Joy, I apologize for choosing Ward over you.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> Never trust him again.<eos> Joy.<eos> I love you.
- Danny!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Oh, I'm sorry for the outburst.<eos> You carry on.<eos> Once they leave the building, I'll get you to the hospital.
Once they leave the building, I'll get you to the hospital.<eos> Hey, it's okay.<eos> Hey, get your ass over here and help us.<eos> Those people upstairs are pit of vipers.<eos> You should thank me for getting you away from them.
- Danny, we do what we came to do.<eos> - Is this really who you want to be?<eos> A living weapon?<eos> An assassin for K'un-Lun?<eos> Is that what your father had in mind for you when he was raising you to be Danny Rand?
- You are a failure.<eos> - It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.
- It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?
K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?<eos> Get up!<eos> This has nothing to do with K'un-Lun.<eos> This is because I left you.
Yield.<eos> I kicked your ass back in K'un-Lun and I kicked your ass here!<eos> Yield!<eos> Danny!<eos> I hurt you.
Now we'll get rich both ends.<eos> Dad. Hey!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You owe Danny.<eos> He freed you from the Hand.
Why would I have gone to such trouble to hide it with a plane crash?<eos> It was someone much more treacherous than I.<eos> In fact, I tried to talk him out of it, as I thought it would draw too much unwanted attention.<eos> She is playing mind games.<eos> She's trying to get you on her side.
And I could hear her... yelling out for me.<eos> But there was no way out.<eos> Danny, you're not the first friend of mine with special powers.<eos> They're all dark, haunted people.<eos> You know, when I first met you in Colleen's dojo, I couldn't help but notice that you had this... sweet innocence.
I really wanted to kill Bakuto.<eos> But I'm glad that in the end, it was Davos and not me, otherwise I'd spend the rest of my life wondering if I killed a man for the wrong reasons.<eos> I think that if you kill Harold out of your own vengeance... it'll corrupt your chi.<eos> You'll never be the Iron Fist you're meant to be.<eos> Which is why I have to kill Harold for you.
He texted you to warn you about the DEA, right?<eos> Hey.<eos> You're looking better.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I don't want to see you right now.
You're looking better.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I don't want to see you right now.<eos> I know.<eos> And I don't blame you.
I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Which part?<eos> When you tried to kill Dad, or when you failed to do it?<eos> I'm sorry that you got hurt.<eos> I swear I was trying to protect you.
I mean, you've been lying to me... all these years.<eos> That was Dad's decision.<eos> But you went along with it.<eos> What about the drug abuse?<eos> Who forced you to lie about that?
I'll get the car to run you home.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Ward said I could find you here.
Remember?<eos> Danny's name wasn't on any of it, so... tell me the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, the, uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.<eos> You know, I needed your help, but I... I didn't wanna upset you.
Danny's name wasn't on any of it, so... tell me the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, the, uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.<eos> You know, I needed your help, but I... I didn't wanna upset you.<eos> I know how much Danny means to you.
- Hey, don't protect him, Joy.<eos> - That is exactly what he wants.<eos> - Dad, look.<eos> He's...<eos> He is trying to turn you against me, just like he did with Ward.
Let's get ready for him.<eos> Dad, no.<eos> This way!<eos> There he is!<eos> You move, and I'll hit you again.
Or he's a pro. - I'm fucking hot.<eos> I'm calling it.<eos> - See, fuck you, man.<eos> I knew that's what you wanted to do.<eos> I'm fucking with you, man.
Fucking...<eos> Sar'nt Matthews!<eos> Sar'nt!<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> He'd shoot you before you even get...
How do you copy?<eos> How do you copy?<eos> This is Spartan Thirty Tree.<eos> How copy?<eos> Reading you, Lima Charlie, over.
- Yes.<eos> - I don't know nothing.<eos> I'm a buck Sar'nt.<eos> They don't tell me shit.<eos> So fuck you.
- That's not what I want.<eos> - Oh, what do you want?<eos> You want fucking 12 virgins or something?<eos> I want to get to know you.<eos> I just want to get to know you.
Whatever, man.<eos> It's an interesting choice of words.<eos> And yet I disagree with you, bro.<eos> The war's not over.<eos> Definitely not for you.
I'm just enjoying our conversation.<eos> Stop.<eos> Fucking stop, all right?<eos> You're not gonna get to fucking know me.<eos> But I feel like I know you better already.
The ghost.<eos> A hundred men out there call themselves Juba.<eos> I'm just a man.<eos> 35 U.S. casualties angel of death.<eos> That's why they never find you.
Oh, man, I lied!<eos> I fucking lied so much!<eos> Trying to keep the story straight.<eos> I lied to everybody.<eos> I lied to every single person, except you, a fucking Hajj!
Hey, you fucking there?<eos> You can't shoot them.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> You shoot, you give away your position.<eos> And they'll fucking find you.
You realize you're only at mile one of the marathon... right?<eos> Everybody's gonna tell you how to feel.<eos> Doctors are gonna tell you to stay positive.<eos> Your family's gonna tell you not to feel sorry for yourself.<eos> Your therapist is gonna tell you not to be angry...
- Mr. Murdock...<eos> - Mr. Murdock, sir...<eos> Yes...<eos> You abandoned them.<eos> Because of you, the Hand has won.
Yes...<eos> You abandoned them.<eos> Because of you, the Hand has won.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> After they raised you... after they gave you everything you are... you let them die.
Jessica Jones, do yourself a favor and don't look for John Raymond.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Should we get that coffee?<eos> Waiting on you was a heck of a gamble.
Have you tried tracking the call yet?<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> You can reroute phone numbers.<eos> I mean, maybe he didn't, though.<eos> Maybe he's just a regular guy trying to throw you off the scent.
If I ever come across that warrior again, I'll be prepared.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I've been thinking about the man who died in the sewer.<eos> He called you Iron Fist.
- You haven't returned my calls.<eos> - I haven't returned anybody's calls.<eos> I couldn't help but take it personally.<eos> Maybe you should.<eos> I'm here to ask you to be careful.
I took a case on purpose.<eos> - Oh, I...<eos> I heard you'd put that off.<eos> - You heard wrong.<eos> Listen, I... I know you well enough, so I'm going to say this very simply.
- Welcome back, big man.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - This is how you talk?<eos> - I want answers, Turk.<eos> How I get 'em is up to you.
Bring it to her.<eos> You asked me a question.<eos> This is the answer.<eos> This is who you are.<eos> She's ready for you.
You know what?<eos> I'm gonna find my own lawyer, thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, well, in reality, you don't need one.<eos> After talking to the lead detective outside, it appears that despite the mess you got yourself into, the NYPD doesn't actually have anything to hold you on, so...
Like you were helping to clean up.<eos> - Look, it doesn't matter.<eos> - Of course it does.<eos> You don't take the blame for something that's not yours.<eos> - Whoever hired you...
- Great.<eos> Hi.<eos> We met the other night.<eos> Oh, we didn't meet, son.<eos> God himself sent you.
- I've been here before.<eos> - Why are following me?<eos> - And you're in serious danger.<eos> - What kind of lawyer are you?<eos> This case you took, it's leading you toward something truly sinister.
- How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.<eos> This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.<eos> I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before, but this is different, because this time...<eos> I won't kill you.
This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.<eos> I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before, but this is different, because this time...<eos> I won't kill you.<eos> No use using her for protection.<eos> They will rip right through her to get to you.
Well, stay off them somewhere else.<eos> I'll call the police.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You'd be putting the cops in danger.<eos> - I'll put you in danger.
"Together, we serve life itself."<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> Black Sky.<eos> Perhaps you'd be more effective on the battlefield if you killed your enemies, rather than letting them escape.<eos> Alexandra insisted we use the last of our resources on you.
I just want to get answers for my client.<eos> I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.<eos> It was good to see you.
It was good to see you.<eos> Let me know when they fit you for a costume.<eos> Jessica.<eos> Just... be careful.<eos> - And, um... it was good seeing you.
With who?<eos> Don't bullshit me.<eos> Elektra.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I know you, son.
She didn't kill me.<eos> She had...<eos> She had the chance.<eos> Don't try to make sense of this.<eos> 'Cause with you or without you, when the time comes... whatever is living inside the body of Elektra Natchios is gonna have to die.
I don't think we've been properly introduced.<eos> Let's keep it that way.<eos> I can see you've formed a kind of bond here.<eos> And while that might give you some comfort, I promise you, it's temporary.<eos> They will disappoint you.
- Where's Matt?<eos> What's he thinking?<eos> - He's not. Stay with me!<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.
- He's not. Stay with me!<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.<eos> You died.<eos> I held you in my arms.
This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.<eos> You died.<eos> I held you in my arms.<eos> I buried you, Elektra!
In my grief, people told me that she was too good for this world.<eos> I didn't believe them.<eos> But there was some truth in what they said.<eos> She wasn't a warrior.<eos> She wasn't like you and me.
It'll only be for a couple days.<eos> So, are you gonna tell me what this is all about?<eos> At this point, the less you know, the better.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> A couple days ago, I'm the one who introduced you to Danny Rand.
- For what?<eos> All of it.<eos> I never meant to make my trouble your trouble.<eos> Pretty sure your trouble is my trouble now.<eos> The old blind guy kept saying that... he needed to get to you before they did.
I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, well, don't.<eos> I'm not doing this for you.
Please.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was wondering when I'd see you again.
- What do you think?<eos> If she's as sweet as she smells,<eos> - I get why you're tore up about this one.<eos> - Don't bring her into this.<eos> All these years, this is what I've been protecting you from.
Me? It doesn't matter.<eos> I can't just leave those people.<eos> They are safer far away from us.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know it's annoying, but I gotta get you to a safe place fast.
I feel lost.<eos> I can't believe I'm admitting this, but... all I want... is something stable.<eos> Something I can hold on to.<eos> Funny you should say that.<eos> Because I know you.
Then there would be three.<eos> Perhaps this is what we needed.<eos> A reminder that everyone in this room is expendable.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Including you.
You know how they can operate.<eos> And now we know what they need.<eos> It's you, kid.<eos> Stick, you're falling for their trap.<eos> If Alexandra gets a hold of you, the war's lost.
Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?<eos> Murdock thinks there's something weird about Midland Circle.<eos> And they got you on guard duty.<eos> Nah, that depends on you.
There was a man.<eos> They call him the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> And in this other life, he let Elektra die.<eos> Is he the one I faced in battle?<eos> He may try to deceive you again and turn you away from us.
But even our bodies have always had limits.<eos> And when death doesn't come from outside forces... sometimes the organism tries to end itself.<eos> The thing I need is a substance that we first discovered at K'un-Lun.<eos> And for years, it served to bring us back from death.<eos> I used the last of it to bring you back to life.
And for years, it served to bring us back from death.<eos> I used the last of it to bring you back to life.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I knew you would be our salvation.<eos> And then seeing you, I realized that after all this time, and even with the others at my side...
The Chaste needs Matt Murdock.<eos> I've tried... but I couldn't convince him.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You let him off the hook.<eos> I've sent you to do things a lot harder than this, Elektra.
Not very well.<eos> How many were there?<eos> Just one.<eos> The same one that came after John Raymond.<eos> What kind of person knocks out you and Luke Cage?
What happened to Danny?<eos> Is he alive?<eos> This is not how we do business.<eos> It is now.<eos> Black Sky or not, there are three of us and one of you.
Deep down inside... he is still just a kid looking for his family.<eos> With me... and with them... almost had it.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> About?<eos> Look, I brought you in to help one family.
- There is no plan.<eos> - I can tell.<eos> - Look, Luke, I am your friend.<eos> - I know, Misty.<eos> That's why I'm trying to protect you.
It does not matter.<eos> She has the ability to bring us a new beginning.<eos> And after that, anything can happen.<eos> What are we doing down here?<eos> That depends on you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't have time for this now.<eos> The entire city is in danger.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm not dumb enough to think I can try and stop you.
So they don't lump you in with Mr. Bulletproof and Super Joan Jett in there.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> 'Cause the people in this building need to always, and only, see you as a lawyer.
They told me all about you.<eos> About your struggle.<eos> But what was it for?<eos> You're still at this alone.<eos> Especially since you know that your precious elders chose to keep you in the dark.
Okay is long gone.<eos> You should be at the precinct.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I know what you want, but you're not gonna get it.<eos> Because unlike you, my master taught me loyalty.
For whatever it's worth, I'm glad you're here.<eos> What?<eos> The circumstances could be better.<eos> I'm just saying, you know, I'm glad we found each other.<eos> I'm not hugging you.
How do we know what we're looking for?<eos> Somebody's coming. Somebody's coming.<eos> This is not okay.<eos> This shit is not okay.<eos> I will find you.
The Elders of K'un-Lun were right.<eos> They showed way too much mercy when they banished the Hand.<eos> And you think you're going to right that wrong?<eos> It's what this journey has all been for.<eos> Then you are as naive as when I first laid eyes on you.
Asshole!<eos> Colleen!<eos> What the hell did I just walk into?<eos> I ask myself that all the time.<eos> Drop it, or I'm dropping you.
Danny, light it up.<eos> Now.<eos> - Remember this?<eos> - Just like old times.<eos> Asshole, I will put you down.
- Just like old times.<eos> Asshole, I will put you down.<eos> You disappoint me.<eos> As a child, all you ever wanted was to belong to something.<eos> That's why I saved you, Colleen.
- No, I'm gonna meet you up there.<eos> - What?<eos> I can get through to her.<eos> - You back on that again?<eos> - We're not gonna leave you here.
Let's go!<eos> Are you done hiding behind your friends?<eos> You're the one who's hiding, Elektra.<eos> What do you want, Matthew?<eos> I lost you once.
I lost you once.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> I know...<eos> I know I loved you.
Together.<eos> Just like you wanted to before.<eos> Before you let me die?<eos> No.<eos> Before they took you from me.
Just like you wanted to before.<eos> Before you let me die?<eos> No.<eos> Before they took you from me.<eos> Before they turned you into their weapon.
This is who I've always been.<eos> You forget...<eos> I know when you're lying.<eos> You've always wanted to find light in me.<eos> Look where it brought you.
Now!<eos> If this is who you truly are, why haven't you killed me yet?<eos> - You've had your chance.<eos> - I've had many.<eos> If I truly mean nothing to you, if there's truly no light inside of you, why not just do it?
This is what we get, isn't it?<eos> For ever thinking we could make it work.<eos> Who says we didn't?<eos> We're together.<eos> Something I've wanted since I first laid eyes on you.
I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's... all of our losses.<eos> I should go.<eos> I'll walk you out.
- Well, yes, the lover is me, of course.<eos> - Mm. - Next plan.<eos> - That plan stinks, because it's always about money with women.<eos> That's all there is to it.<eos> So I think the best thing to do is to find a guy who's got more money than you, like in that movie, uh, Indecent Proposal.
- Don't sell yourself short.<eos> He does. - No, no. It's not that I...<eos> It's just that we don't have sex. Yeah, I, uh...<eos> I sleep with women, but I'm emotionally involved with Mac, which is why... and this is the hard part...<eos> I don't have room emotionally in my life for you.
Come on. Look, I know you've always wanted a baby, right?<eos> I see you. You poke around the preschools and the playgrounds, and you got that longing look in your eye.<eos> Oh, God, that's so creepy.<eos> Well, look, I can tell you this.<eos> It... It's not gonna happen for you.
Why are you so obsessed with me?<eos> I mean, you said it yourself, I'm a mess.<eos> So, why don't you just go find somebody better?<eos> Well... 'cause there is no one better.<eos> And... I love you.
Solve problems, don't cause them.<eos> Oh, gee whiz, look how fancy this place is.<eos> We don't have anything like this back in North Dakota. Oh, yeah?<eos> Fascinating.<eos> Um, so, Mandy, um, we have brought you here, uh, to meet a gentleman. - Um, I just feel really
Oh, gee whiz, look how fancy this place is.<eos> We don't have anything like this back in North Dakota. Oh, yeah?<eos> Fascinating.<eos> Um, so, Mandy, um, we have brought you here, uh, to meet a gentleman. - Um, I just feel really<eos> - Oh. badly now being able to provide emotionally for you, so I thought we could set you up with somebody who can provide for you both emotionally and financially.
But if you want to bring a girlfriend... price goes back up.<eos> - Well, I don't know what to say here. - I do.<eos> Five grand is a lot of money...<eos> is that offer just out on the table?<eos> - I'm not gonna bang you. - I don't want to bang you, either, Frank,
Hey, buddy.<eos> Hey.<eos> Good dog.<eos> What are you doing, John?<eos> Looking at you.
Good dog.<eos> What are you doing, John?<eos> Looking at you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm waiting for you.
Ciao, John. Santino.<eos> Café?<eos> Grazie.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Good to see you.
Do you fear damnation, John?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know, I always thought I could escape it.<eos> That I'd see it coming.<eos> That I'd see you.
Oh, she meant the first part.<eos> She meant the first part where I... because she can't imagine a life without me, right, Mom?<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> - See.<eos> - I'll put you out of the misery of this conversation.
People calling me a bitch, flat-chested bitch, pretty much everybody wanting to rape me.<eos> You opened that door the second you apologized, Dee.<eos> You don't see this?<eos> People need an outlet to unleash their rage.<eos> Now social media will come down on you with the fury of a middle-aged man who's accomplished nothing.
- Yeah. Thanks for coming by.<eos> - So you have my watch?<eos> - Oh... - Yeah. Just diving straight into that, huh?<eos> Listen, um, I'm really glad you called, though.<eos> I really wanted to thank you for last night.
- Huh. - You know, if this Mike fella wants to walk away from an amazing stripping career, hey, I'll take up that mantle.<eos> You know, frankly, I'm a little disappointed in myself for not thinking of it before.<eos> You know? It just makes sense.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Here's the thing, man. I can't do it without you.
- Yeah, I don't feel good about this. Maybe... - Well, then just don't talk.<eos> - But... - You don't have to talk.<eos> Just sit down.<eos> Okay, everybody, let's grab a chair, let's get this started.<eos> - Probably not gonna call on you anyway.
- Hey, son. - Dad? !<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I broke out of jail and came straight to see you.<eos> - Because you love me?<eos> - 'Cause I'm gonna kill you, son.
Frank! Frank!<eos> What happened? - Where am I?<eos> - Oh, you're in the back office.<eos> You passed out playing the game, dude.<eos> We dragged you back here so you could sleep.
Well, where's Mike?<eos> I'll do it with him.<eos> He's out, too.<eos> Yeah, he's doing some weird stripping thing with Dennis and Charlie.<eos> I only woke you up 'cause I figured you'd want to see it. - Yeah?
I got you paid for it.<eos> You're a great stripper?<eos> I got you this gig.<eos> - And you know what I'm gonna do for you next? - What?<eos> I'm gonna reunite you with your daughter.
We have the power. - It's not a joke!<eos> - It's not a joke, all right?<eos> This is sexy. Oh, stop, sto...<eos> Oh, you know what? You might want to check your programs 'cause I'm bad dad now.<eos> I'll take you to your goddamn room. - I'll bend you over my knee.
Uh, uh, Frank's gonna leave me for Jerry, man.<eos> Oh, uh, I was talking. But, uh,<eos> I guess we'll, um...<eos> we'll do your thing first.<eos> You know he's only doing this to get a rise out of you, right?
You son of a bitch, Charlie. You screwed me, okay?<eos> - You know what... screw you, Charlie!<eos> I'm not gonna let some worm beat me on Valentine's Day.<eos> - Why are you going on and on about it? I...<eos> I did this for you, Charlie. What?
- Why are you going on and on about it? I...<eos> I did this for you, Charlie. What?<eos> I gave myself Jerry on purpose.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> To slim down for you. Why would you...
If it'll get you to stop focusing on it and get you to stop focusing on this goddamn Valentine's Day bullshit.<eos> I don't know why you're so excited about this goddamn thing.<eos> There's never anything insi...<eos> What is this? It's a gift.<eos> I got it for you.
That's my motto.<eos> That and you cannot finish inside me.<eos> No, no, no, Matt.<eos> Dad? It's time to come home, son.<eos> You want me to come work for you?
- When did I ever burn Dad? - You stole his identity.<eos> - Eight times!<eos> - Well, at least I didn't wet the bed till I was in high school.<eos> Shut your mouth about that.<eos> - Whatever, Davy Diapers. - I will kill you.
Wait.<eos> You did what? Wait.<eos> Did you put a chip in...?<eos> Did you put a chip in me? ! Nothing, Cricket.<eos> Hey, listen, um, we got a job for you, buddy.
And I bet you're gonna be high by the end of the night.<eos> Freakin' bullcrap!<eos> He's getting yelled at.<eos> Well, don't piss off your trick there, Cricket.<eos> He might - cut you up.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Tom, let's discuss this.<eos> Hey.<eos> What?<eos> Maybe I misjudged you.
Sorry I said that about Carl Lewis.<eos> - Belle.<eos> - Heard me comin', I guess.<eos> I think I just saved the company. Wow.<eos> That's great news for you.
I gave you a shot.<eos> You can't go around doing insane shit like kissing dogs.<eos> You got to put all that nonsense behind you once and for all.<eos> Now, this is my last and final offer.<eos> You cut that bullshit out and come work with me, or you go back on the street and crawl back into that manure pile I found you in.
- Dinner's on me tonight, Okay?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Anastasia.<eos> It was you. Wasn't it? You just went and buy all of this?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.
- Yes Sir.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So...<eos> Let's talk.<eos> I want you back.
What do you call it?<eos> A vanilla relationship?<eos> I mean we only do what you are comfortable with.<eos> But you need all these things.<eos> I need you more.
I'm gonna need a road map.<eos> I thought you wanted to take it slow.<eos> What do you want Anastasia?<eos> Well to communicate you have to tell me.<eos> I want you.
- For sex.<eos> - Um..<eos> I was reading Austin and Bronte, and nobody ever mesured upto that.<eos> I guess I was waiting for something exceptional.<eos> And then I met you.
Is that Mrs. Robinson?<eos> Her name is Elena Lincoln.<eos> I don't care what her name is Christian.<eos> Why would you take me there?<eos> Why would you take me to meet the woman who seduced and abused you?
- It's all wrong, all of this is wrong.<eos> You put money into my account. That I don't want it.<eos> You bought the company I work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship Christian, It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.
- Thank you.<eos> - So do you.<eos> This dress is so beautiful.<eos> - Thank you Anna.<eos> I am so glad you are back with Christian. He was lost without you.
Anna, My God.<eos> your dress, it should be illegal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mia.<eos> - Hey, I barely recognized you?
- Without notice. - You don't think I can handle him?<eos> That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Anna, I know full well that you can handle anything. And if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.<eos> But I would like to take you there myself.
Hey.<eos> It's great that you're doing this.<eos> But it's totally weird. I know. - I know.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> Am I expected to call you Miss Steele?
He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.
- Is she here?<eos> - What? No. Of course not.<eos> She's in the psych ward getting the help that she needs.<eos> Lucky.<eos> - I know she scares you.
I get off in punishing woman. Woman who look like you.<eos> Like your mother.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop if that's what it took to get you back.
- Socks, suspenders, throw me a bone here.<eos> - And, oh.. god.<eos> Mia, I gotta go.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> But Sunday I'll hunt you down myself.
Hey..hey..<eos> Sorry..<eos> I was so scared...<eos> So scared.<eos> I thought I lost you forever.
No, it's your birthday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Do you still have the gift I gave you?
- Like gone gone?<eos> I'm done.<eos> The business, everything..<eos> I'll have my people sort out the details tomorrow.<eos> I know she was important to you.
Prioritise this one.<eos> We absolutely cannot afford to wait.<eos> Preliminary results, whatever you can tell me, soon as you can, thank you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to keep you waiting.
You know, there's something you could be overlooking'.<eos> This could work out.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But if anybody takes that baby away...<eos> I'll smother you in your sleep.
Good.<eos> Mary, can you stand up please?<eos> Stand on up.<eos> Stand up, babe.<eos> These questions are for you because you're so advanced.
Frank.<eos> For the record, I didn't wanna go to the stupid school in the first place.<eos> And the boy in the next row acts inappropriately for someone who's a child.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm still passive aggressively ignoring you.
Just found him inside of a trash can next to a bottle of alcohol or something.<eos> He is a smart, smart cat, but no one realizes that.<eos> No one understands him. No one.<eos> Put your name on the top of the paper... so that I know who did such good work.<eos> I left my pen with you.
Yeah.<eos> They'll take a shoe.<eos> Honestly, this?<eos> This godforsaken mosquito ranch was a conscious choice?<eos> I could drop you back off at the airport.
So why would I screw up yours?<eos> Use your head.<eos> But don't be afraid to believe in things either.<eos> There was a guy on TV who said there was no God.<eos> The only difference between the atheists on TV and Roberta... is that Roberta loves you.
I can't do this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll take you home.
God!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Can I just get five minutes of my own life?<eos> Nothing that happened today was your fault.<eos> I got mad at you...
Take her to the airport.<eos> Go home, Evelyn.<eos> Or Montana.<eos> Rustle some cattle.<eos> You know... I have no desire to hurt you.
You can stay with me and Roberta.<eos> I want you and Roberta now!<eos> And in a few years, if you want... you can come back.<eos> You can live with me.<eos> I wanna stay with you.
I'm sorry, man.<eos> This is predictable.<eos> You know, she needs time.<eos> Just give me five minutes with her.<eos> I let you inside... then we're gonna betray her trust and we have an even bigger problem.
- Keep working.<eos> - I will.<eos> Niobi.<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana, I see you.
What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.<eos> Just the shield then, no sharp edges.<eos> Diana, you are the most precious thing in the world to me.<eos> I wished for you so much, so I sculpted you from clay myself. ...and begged Zeus to give you life.
This belonged to the greatest warrior in our history our beloved Anti­ope.<eos> Make sure you're worthy of it.<eos> I will.<eos> Be careful in the world of men, Diana.<eos> They do not deserve you.
love each other till death?<eos> Not very often, no.<eos> Then why do they do it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> So you cannot sleep with me unless I marry you..
We are going anyway!<eos> You mean you were lying?<eos> I'm a spy! That's what I do!<eos> How do I know you're not lying to me right now?<eos> I'm taking you to the front.
That man... he's wounded.<eos> There is nothing you can do about it, Diana.<eos> We must keep moving.<eos> What is this?<eos> You wanted me to take you to war.
We did.<eos> Do you have dancing on Paradise Island?<eos> Oh, dancing, yeah of course.<eos> These people are just... swaying.<eos> Okay, if you're gonna be fighting the God of war I might as well teach you how to dance, you poor thing.
I would argue with this, they don't know how to dance.<eos> Be polite. Be polite.<eos> All right. Give me your hand.<eos> Like so.<eos> And I'll put my arm around you like so.
- No, you are not coming with me.<eos> What you're wearing isn't exactly undercover.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I would say she was pretty undercover on that battlefield.<eos> It's just gonna, we can't get you there. It's all scouted out, we'll put back...
As magnificent as you are, you are still no match for me.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> I am Diana of Temiscira daughter of Hippolyta Queen of the Amazons.<eos> And your wrath upon this world is over.<eos> In the name of all that it is good in this world I hereby complete the mission of the Amazons to ridding this world of you forever!
Diana, people...<eos> I...<eos> She was right.<eos> My mother was right.<eos> She said the world of men do not deserve you.
But I'm not what you thought I was.<eos> What is that?<eos> Future.<eos> I'm not your enemy, Diana.<eos> I'm the only one who truly knows you.
Ideas, inspiration for formulas weapons but I don't make them use them.<eos> They start these wars on their own.<eos> All I do is orchestrate an armistice I know they cannot keep in the hope they will destroy themselves.<eos> But it has never been enough.<eos> Until you.
You can save the world.<eos> I wish we had more time.<eos> What?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I love you!
They do not deserve your protection!<eos> It's not about deserving.<eos> It's about what you believe.<eos> And I believe in love.<eos> Then I will destroy you!
- Shut up!<eos> You didn't?<eos> There's a toilet in the basement still jammed.<eos> Shh, we're gonna wake up Samuel.<eos> - I love you.
You didn't?<eos> There's a toilet in the basement still jammed.<eos> Shh, we're gonna wake up Samuel.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.
You always say that you can't sleep without me.<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> I just don't know what to think.<eos> - What?<eos> - Is that all I am to you?
Oh, my God, how many people are dead?<eos> Jake, listen to me.<eos> Jake, Jake listen to me.<eos> We don't know what happened.<eos> No one's accusing you of anything.
No one is saying you did anything.<eos> We're trying to find out what happened.<eos> We need you to keep it together because we gotta figure this out.<eos> Do you hear me, Jake?<eos> No one's accusing you of anything.
Hey, my wife made meatballs and she insisted that I bring you some.<eos> She makes them with mushrooms, they're awesome.<eos> - So, how is work?<eos> - Same old.<eos> Everything goes a little more slowly without you there.
I mean, I should be doing things right now.<eos> So, I got, I'm sorry, I got to get going.<eos> Of course, I'll leave you to it.<eos> You take care, Roman.<eos> Of course I love you, Jake.
So, I got, I'm sorry, I got to get going.<eos> Of course, I'll leave you to it.<eos> You take care, Roman.<eos> Of course I love you, Jake.<eos> I think this is best for Samuel and for us, and I really hope it's best for you, too.
The tests I carried out, I want to do the same with Shirley Allardyce.<eos> If we find what we are looking for, then that means it is not safe to live here.<eos> We cannot let fear take hold.<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> I would kill anybody that hurt you.
Freya!<eos> Freya!<eos> Freya!<eos> What, what happened?<eos> Come here, baby, let's get you in the house.
Hildur. I need this.<eos> I have to go to sea.<eos> I have to hit the crab this time.<eos> More than anything....<eos> I've never asked you for a favour, Hildy...
She needs this.<eos> _<eos> Goodnight, Natalie.<eos> If you're too repressed to say it, I'm not.<eos> I don't want to live without you.
Yeah.<eos> I put a lot of work into getting you here today.<eos> Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?<eos> I want you to work for me.<eos> Work for you?
The US government cannot sanction this operation in any way.<eos> You're on your own. Hey.<eos> If this thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned.<eos> You go to prison.<eos> And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Great plan, Tej.<eos> But just so you know, you missed some.<eos> Oh, just wait for it.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> I hate you, Tej!
Let's break off and meet me at the safe house.<eos> A hell of a job, brother.<eos> When we get back to the base, the beefs on me.<eos> You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?<eos> Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.
What terms?<eos> Confess to your crimes in Berlin.<eos> Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.<eos> You do that, we close the case.<eos> And the DSS blacklists you.
Such a cliché.<eos> Oh, well, welcome to the club.<eos> I wouldn't get that twisted, son.<eos> We ain't in no club, we got nothing in common.<eos> And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> You know what I like about you, Dom?<eos> You're a genuine outlaw.<eos> I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.<eos> Which is surprising, because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?

Toretto?<eos> It's interesting you ask.<eos> This is my new base.<eos> Welcome to nowhere.<eos> It's a little sterile for you.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.<eos> We are not teaming up with this guy.<eos> Let's get one thing clear.<eos> I ain't on your team.<eos> I don't care about you, your crew, or your little family.
He's still green.<eos> Yeah, like fresh baby shit.<eos> As soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.<eos> Let's get a hold of a better asshole.<eos> - No one respects you...
Nice to see you again.<eos> Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.<eos> Your family's already replacing you.<eos> You chose the losing team.<eos> I guess your brother is smarter than you.
The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.<eos> It's not to save me.<eos> It's to kill your son.<eos> Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.<eos> So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.<eos> We lost everything.<eos> What do you got, Princess?<eos> Finding Toretto.<eos> But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital. Again.
All this fuss over you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.<eos> And now, he always will be.<eos> I wanna introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
- I'm Thoyt, your father's lawyer.<eos> Smallpox butchered me down to the bone and, yes, I have other business than pissing.<eos> You know, in all of London, only your father believed you were still alive.<eos> It was a symptom of his madness.<eos> But he would talk to you, stand on the north bank of the river and call out to you on the other side.
They should have invited you.<eos> To the wake, at least.<eos> Serving stew in the backroom, to hell with that.<eos> In all of this dirty city, there is no-one that I can trust, do you understand?<eos> Apart from you.
I know that you polish off at least half a bottle of Delaney Company Brandy every night.<eos> Hm?<eos> James...<eos> You could have written to your father just once.<eos> In the end, he was calling for you.
Thoyt has been trying to buy the Delaney Shipping Company from your father for three years.<eos> Each time, your da would go into the street, scoop up some horse shite and package it up by way of reply.<eos> I imagine the envelope contains a financial offer.<eos> I imagine it does.<eos> Do you have any horse shit on you?
Now, please do not misunderstand the situation.<eos> You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.<eos> Two hours.<eos> You...<eos> I remember you.
You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.<eos> Two hours.<eos> You...<eos> I remember you.<eos> I remember you.
What do you want?<eos> You think your father's kid feeds himself.<eos> I heard you done a lot of evil over there.<eos> Now it's time for you to do some bleeding good among your own.<eos> Me and my wife have looked after that boy for ten years with not one penny from you and nothing but threats from the mad old bastard you just put in the ground.
Come back when the church bell chimes.<eos> You did this.<eos> - You will pay for this.<eos> - No.<eos> No, because I have no fear to feed you with.
You did this.<eos> - You will pay for this.<eos> - No.<eos> No, because I have no fear to feed you with.<eos> No fear to give you and I will prove it.
You want him reburied?<eos> Yes, and sewn back up into one piece.<eos> I would recommend they dig a bit deeper this time.<eos> If this body is used for any other purpose,<eos> I will find you and I will kill you.
I'm an old man, I would never survive.<eos> Tell me that's the reason.<eos> Brace, you were not born for freedom.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with it.<eos> It would torture you.
From the conversation, he meant to do you harm, and the mistress knew it.<eos> She wants you dead, so she can have her rooms back.<eos> How old are you?<eos> 13.<eos> Why would she keep you and not rent you?
Tribunal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.<eos> Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.
Yeah.<eos> Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.<eos> Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.
Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't.<eos> What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.
James.<eos> For God's sake.<eos> The Art Of War.<eos> Poor motive, poor strategy... poor outcome.<eos> They can't kill you, but they will crucify your name... and crucify all those around you.
Poor motive, poor strategy... poor outcome.<eos> They can't kill you, but they will crucify your name... and crucify all those around you.<eos> But I don't keep anybody around me that doesn't deserve what they get.<eos> Does that include me?<eos> Yes, that includes you.
- No.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No.<eos> - You do. You feel me.<eos> And I could come more often, but I spare you.
You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.<eos> You've been following me, haven't you?<eos> Now. Are you King or are you Company?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Now there is nothing up that road for you apart from death and anybody like you.
There is a ceremony of exorcism which can eradicate the Barbason.<eos> It's a very short process. And quite inexpensive.<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.<eos> No. - He visits you.<eos> He visits you.
You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?<eos> - You are now one of us.<eos> - Why burden him?<eos> Please understand that, from this moment, I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams.
You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know she took you down to the river to drown you?
Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know she took you down to the river to drown you?<eos> Carried you across the foreshore.
She waded in.<eos> Held you under, until the bubbles stopped!<eos> She was deranged, James!<eos> That's why your father had her committed to Bedlam.<eos> To protect you.
That's why your father had her committed to Bedlam.<eos> To protect you.<eos> To save your life, son.<eos> Desperate for your death!<eos> It took three men to pull you apart.
Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?<eos> You were meant to be guarding his ship.<eos> Two possibilities.<eos> He sold you out, cos you cut off his thumb, or you cut off his thumb, cos you knew he was going to sell you out.
What are you doing?<eos> No.<eos> Go away.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> I'm not fit to be near you now.
Sir Stuart just wants you to know... it's war.<eos> The gloves are off.<eos> James, what are you doing?<eos> Go away.<eos> I'm not fit to be near you now.
I'm getting scared, James.<eos> Too many bodies in the river.<eos> Can I sleep under your house tonight?<eos> No.<eos> Go away, I'm not fit to be near you now.
He's been there all day, either mad or sick or drunk.<eos> We knocked.<eos> He won't answer.<eos> Brace, you are not sick and you are not dead yet.<eos> Come out, or I will come in there and drag you out.
And all of those who have use to me will sail along with me.<eos> And on my ship, there will be no rules and there will be no judgment.<eos> We're sailing to a new world and that is the plan.<eos> James... you are a fool.<eos> They are going to hang you.
To the Molly House!<eos> I cannot pack up my entire life in five minutes.<eos> Well, you can pack it up or you can lose it.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> What about you?
I need a ship and passage.<eos> James, they're not going to give you a ship, they're going to hang you!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Look... go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.
- If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.
I know exactly what you did.<eos> Exactly what you did.<eos> You fuck...<eos> Ah, shit...<eos> Oh! - I've hurt you!
How much weight has he lost?<eos> I-I-I think he's lost a lot of weight.<eos> In a good way.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Dougie, last time I saw you, you were quite overweight.
Dougiiieee!<eos> Dougie.<eos> Oh, Dougie.<eos> Dougie?<eos> I love you.
Dougie.<eos> Oh, Dougie.<eos> Dougie?<eos> I love you.<eos> Love you.
I can't stop thinking about last night.<eos> You're so wonderful.<eos> - Wonderful. - Mm.<eos> I just had to tell you that.<eos> Okay. Let's get you to work.
Hello, Johnny.<eos> How are you today?<eos> Oh, Johnny!<eos> Hello, Johnny.<eos> I... I will squeeze the shit out of you, bitch!
Okay.<eos> Thank you, Roger.<eos> Anthony, come here.<eos> Don't sit down, Anthony.<eos> Anthony, I asked you here because you're a creative individual, and you're gonna need every ounce of that creativity to do what I'm about to tell you.
I don't have any money, anyway!<eos> Honey, If I didn't work for the sheriff, You'd be in jail right now.<eos> I'll loan you the money.<eos> Ugh, no.<eos> I can't take any more money from you, mom.
And he spent everything you ever gave me, anyway.<eos> I'll loan you the money.<eos> But you gotta pay me back.<eos> And you gotta make this right.<eos> And we have to get you out of that trailer
He's good inside.<eos> He goes out every day looking for work.<eos> At least I thought he did.<eos> Carl said things aren't right in that trailer.<eos> Has he ever hit you?
Every kid should have a gym set.<eos> There you go, brother. Yeah.<eos> A toast.<eos> Oh... dougie.<eos> Here's to you, dougie.
I like it on the rocks.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> The Dakotas are still in the Ice Age.<eos> Diane, we know your work with Agent Cooper has given you more than a passing insight into the Blue Rose.<eos> Even though you're no longer a part of the bureau, we'd like to deputize you.
Been meaning to stop by.<eos> Some old cases popped up, and I thought about you.<eos> That's very kind of you, but I suppose you're really here because of what happened in the grocery store.<eos> Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> Uh, people were worried about you.
They waited till after midnight, and then, 75 strong, they came up over the mountain, sirens wailing, guns drawn...<eos> Albert.<eos> Gordon, would you please ask your friend to wait downstairs?<eos> Sweetheart, would you excuse us for a moment?<eos> I'll call you in the bar.
We'll figure it out.<eos> But for now, I'd really like to get back to this fine Bordeaux.<eos> What kind is it?<eos> 11:05.<eos> Albert... sometimes I really worry about you.
I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.<eos> I've been good to you.<eos> You always say it, how I've been good to you. Who cares?<eos> What?<eos> I got to thank you every hour on the hour, get on my knees and adore you?
And if you lose,<eos> So you can leave now.<eos> If you stay and lose and you do not do what Renzo says... you die.<eos> So you decide. You stay and play the game.<eos> It's your choice. Looking at you, I'd say you better leave.
Aah!<eos> Now we can talk.<eos> Do you need any money?<eos> No.<eos> Somebody hired you to kill me.
I never met him.<eos> I only talked to him on the phone.<eos> He set the whole prison thing up with Warden Murphy.<eos> Jeffries says you were gonna kill me.<eos> He said I could get out and stay out if I killed you first.
Did he ever mention Major Briggs?<eos> No. Easy, Ray.<eos> You know I don't have a gun.<eos> I got to show you something.<eos> Jeffries said I was supposed to put this on you... after I killed you.
You know I don't have a gun.<eos> I got to show you something.<eos> Jeffries said I was supposed to put this on you... after I killed you.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> It was given to me... right before I walked out of my cell and saw you.
Where do I get it?<eos> By paying me top fucking dollar, cowboy.<eos> Why are you so against me?<eos> 'Cause you're a weak fucking coward.<eos> It makes me sick just to look at you.
Okay.<eos> Okay, I'll be right there.<eos> Okay, hurry up, and we'll find some time to talk, okay?<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> I love you.
How can I make it up to you?<eos> I'm so ashamed of what I've done.<eos> And if it weren't for Dougie, I might have a murder on my hands.<eos> Oh, my God, what can I do?<eos> I was prepared to send you away for a long, long time.
Hey, you.<eos> Hey, girl.<eos> - Hey. - Mm.<eos> Oh... You two talk business. We'll move somewhere else.<eos> Good to see you, Walter.
All my ingredients are natural, organic, local. I know.<eos> You make them with love.<eos> But this was our agreement.<eos> Norma... you're a real artist. But love doesn't always turn a profit.<eos> We believe in you 100 percent, but from a business perspective, the board would like you to consider some alternatives without sacrificing any of the high standards that you're so well-known for.
That... that just means the world to me.<eos> It really does.<eos> You... you know, it's... It's us against them.<eos> And I am your most loyal foot soldier... or... shoveler.<eos> You know, the... last... last time I saw you, it was about seven years ago.
Wow.<eos> Thank you, Freddie. That's a great story.<eos> The pleasure's all mine, sir.<eos> Whyyou?<eos> I mean, why do you think the Fireman picked you?
It's a free cunt-ry.<eos> Maybe you're one of them bull dykes.<eos> Yeah. Come to think of it, you look kind of like a bull dyke lesbo.<eos> You like to eat cunt, huh?<eos> I'll eat you.
- The Lost Woods?<eos> I put the deed in your name. Yours and Alison's.<eos> I'd like to go over the major points one more time.<eos> - I killed Dr. Dunhill.<eos> - She did this for you.
Alright, here you go.<eos> You know what else I know?<eos> You don't like peas.<eos> It's awful, isn't it?<eos> What about you, Grace?
Bye, Grace.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Good girl.<eos> - Good girl. I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
- Excuse me, what did you say?<eos> You may think you're winning the battle but I'll win the war.<eos> Careful, Ali.<eos> You don't wanna leave a bruise.<eos> I could bury you with that.
You may think you're winning the battle but I'll win the war.<eos> Careful, Ali.<eos> You don't wanna leave a bruise.<eos> I could bury you with that.<eos> But then again, it wouldn't be the first time someone buried you.
It's alright.<eos> Mona?<eos> Mona?<eos> Great.<eos> She skipped out on you.
Tomorrow's supposed to be one of the happiest days of our lives.<eos> It will be.<eos> You still plannin' on marrying' me tomorrow, right?<eos> Then nothing's changed.<eos> I love you and we are going to have a family.
I never asked for your blessing.<eos> Well, if that's what's happening now, I gotta say you've left it down to the wire.<eos> I never asked because I never really felt like you and Ella truly accepted me.<eos> Well, you, you never really worked to prove us wrong.<eos> You never made a persuasive argument as to why we should feel good about you as a soninlaw.
You want company?<eos> I told you I'd give it a try.<eos> Yeah, that was like six years ago.<eos> Well, maybe I just took some time to get used to the idea.<eos> I meant to congratulate you on winning the game.
- Hi, Toby.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I call shotgun.<eos> Watch it.<eos> I know it's none of my business, but... don't take for granted the people who love you the most just because they sometimes let you.
So you think I'm wrong about Mona?<eos> You agree with Caleb?<eos> But I'm still on your side.<eos> Marin, will you get in the car?<eos> - Love you.
Come upstairs, let's talk.<eos> No, I...<eos> I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.
No, I...<eos> I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.<eos> - I love you.
I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
Yeah.<eos> You've barely said two words to me all night.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Well, either you're entering' a vegetative state or you're pissed at me.<eos> I saw you with my mom at the party.
You make the world a better place because you see the good in it.<eos> And you make me a better woman because you searched for one.<eos> Do you promise... to do that everyday for the rest of our lives?<eos> Yes.<eos> - I love you.
And you make me a better woman because you searched for one.<eos> Do you promise... to do that everyday for the rest of our lives?<eos> Yes.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
- I can't tell.<eos> It's either a really bad comedy about chefs or a really good infomercial about deep fryers.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> I don't know what else to say, Hanna.<eos> The decisions you make don't just affect you.
I don't know what else to say, Hanna.<eos> The decisions you make don't just affect you.<eos> Actually, let's not talk.<eos> Hanna.<eos> I hear you, okay?
I'll tell her first thing in the morning.<eos> You can deal with Mona until then, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> How much damage can she do in one night?<eos> - I love you.
You can deal with Mona until then, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> How much damage can she do in one night?<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
Well, you missed breakfast but mum's planning a special lunch.<eos> I don't even know what question to ask first.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Really?<eos> How hard did Mona hit you?
About how good you have it.<eos> About how much your friends love you.<eos> And it was just driving me mad and, and Wren saw it happening.<eos> Alex, you mean everything to me.<eos> I even created lies for you, but this is too much...
No, I'm trapped in here just like you.<eos> Yeah, well, you don't look so trapped to me.<eos> I'm a wanted convict for Archie Dunhill's murder.<eos> A crime I didn't commit, remember?<eos> I took the blame for you and your friends so I think I deserve a little trust.
I don't know.<eos> She gave me something to sleep and the next thing I knew, I woke up here.<eos> But you're safe, Spencer.<eos> She promised me.<eos> And in time, you'll earn her trust and she'll let you out of your room.
She ran away from the Ambrose Home for wayward children on her tenth birthday.<eos> A year before I found out she was there.<eos> Can you imagine how alone she must have felt?<eos> Yeah, I can.<eos> There is nothing more that I would love than to hold you, Spencer but she would never forgive me if you got out.
There is nothing more that I would love than to hold you, Spencer but she would never forgive me if you got out.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You don't have to thank me.<eos> I'm your mother.<eos> Aria, this isn't about you.
Look, he's right.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Look, you became A.D. because of Charlotte.<eos> I understand that and my friends will too.<eos> Okay, they'll forgive you just like we forgave Mona.
So then what's gonna happen now?<eos> You can't just keep me here forever.<eos> Of course, I can.<eos> And you have Mary to thank for that.<eos> She saved you at the blind school and she's saving you now.
She doesn't know who I am, but she offered to help me and I kept my promise.<eos> I paid for her surgery.<eos> She's still as blind as a bat and useless to me.<eos> What about Sara Harvey?<eos> Was she looking for you too?
Enchante, mademoiselle.<eos> Au revoir.<eos> - Is she here?<eos> - Yeah, her plane just landed.<eos> She's waiting for you in the bar.
Don't be jealous.<eos> She's just a doll to me.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'm gonna miss my flight.<eos> No, I'll drive you.
No, I'll drive you.<eos> It'll be too hard to say goodbye to you.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> I love you, Alex.
I called 911.<eos> Mary Drake's already in custody.<eos> We caught her a few blocks from here.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Well, no one can call you loser Mona anymore.
Why is everybody crying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> For some reason, this feels like it's the end of something.<eos> I love you, guys.<eos> We love you too.
Yes.<eos> It can be right now?<eos> Skipping to order a machine to us?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sfotkatsya him, I'll kill you, you understand?
Father.<eos> Clear.<eos> Well, you want to see, come.<eos> Yul.<eos> Love you.
You're doing fine!<eos> Almost like a man.<eos> I am the man.<eos> We are a branch of one tree.<eos> - I do not hear you.
- Net!<eos> - Quiet.<eos> No ori.<eos> I tried to understand, and Th is do you want something, eh?<eos> Che More to do for you?
I am human?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Why are you all talking about what to do?<eos> Why do not you even try to understand me?<eos> - I'm trying to understand you.
- There is.<eos> Must have time.<eos> (shot)<eos> Heck!<eos> Love you!
Well, Dick, I answered the questions that were asked of me.<eos> - I thought I was being fair.<eos> - It's not a question of fair, Glen.<eos> It's a question of what the fuck were you doing on the television?<eos> Why am I seeing you on the television?
Hang on, Dick.<eos> You're cutting out.<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Yeah, I can hear you.
Something's wrong.<eos> I can't hear a word you're saying.<eos> Let me... let me try this.<eos> - Can you hear me now?<eos> - Yeah, I can hear you.
Yeah.<eos> Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.<eos> Yeah, I'll have Cory schedule some time.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay... but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
Get your PowerPoint presentation in order, you know?<eos> Just move the needle a little bit.<eos> Show everyone how all the graphs are pointing in the right direction.<eos> That's all you gotta do.<eos> That's how this ends best for you anyway.
Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Kelsey, gotta ask, is this the worst disadvantage so far?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No question.<eos> God will smite you for that.
- Hey, Matt!<eos> - Ugh, I'm talking about acting.<eos> Look, everybody loves you.<eos> You know that.<eos> But this is how they see you now.
I said, "Hey."<eos> I heard you.<eos> Yeah, where are we on my fucking window?<eos> Uh, nowhere.<eos> Because like I told you, you're not gettin' a fucking window.
We were all concerned about Bonnie and Madeline having their girls in first grade together.<eos> You know, what that would do to the classroom dynamic.<eos> - Abby is Chloe's half-sister, so we just... - Right.<eos> Just have Nathan call me.<eos> Can I have a word with you for a second?
And if we do, we always say...<eos> - Sorry, that's right.<eos> Because that's what big first-grade children do, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Baby, someone hurt you, sweet pea?
They're gonna find out. Just give her a second.<eos> - Did you see what happened? - No.<eos> - You're their teacher.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Um, uh, Amabella, sweetie, could you maybe point to the boy who hurt you?
And on the one morning that I chose not to go to the office... - Yep, yep, yep. - And join my daughter for her orientation.<eos> And, yes, I reacted.<eos> - Humanly, like any mom would.<eos> And then, I'm met with utter contempt.<eos> Look, I'm sure there are those, women especially, who would resent you.
Jesus.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.
And what I'm saying is is the metric of success is not always monetary or career-related.<eos> It can be a much more holistic equation.<eos> Okay, I'm not gonna pretend to be the person in your life who knows the most about the holistic wonder of the world.<eos> What I do know, and I know this for sure, Abigail, is that... when it all comes down to it, you have to be independent and you have to be self-sufficient.<eos> I was a very young mother when I had you. All that "it takes a village" crap is only good to a certain extent, because even the best-laid plans of your life go poof in your face.
If I can't be here to look out for them, I need to know that you do.<eos> I asked you to remove your fucking hand.<eos> Is that a song from your puppet show?<eos> Yes, but it's really more than just a puppet show.<eos> The play means a lot to you, right?
- The one.<eos> For every person, there's the one.<eos> Case in point, you're my one.<eos> - Well, you are my...<eos> But for you, he's the one you fell irreparably in love with, who irreparably broke your heart, who you apparently can't get over 15 years later.
Did you take a car, an Uber? Did somebody give you a ride?<eos> It's in Seaside.<eos> How did you get there?<eos> Here you are.<eos> - Love you, Mama. - Love you.
Bye.<eos> - Stay in the car.<eos> - Ma'am!<eos> I'm just gonna be a minute.<eos> Bonnie, can I talk to you for just a second?
- Good morning, Maddie.<eos> - Hi, Tom. - How are you?<eos> - Everyone's making me angry.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Except for you.
Wow, make it a nice five.<eos> Okay, that's enough, naughty boy.<eos> You'll have to come home sooner if you want more.<eos> Come closer.<eos> I love you.
If they try to cut it out, it will spread.<eos> Tell me what you need.<eos> I can't go in the operating room.<eos> I won't come out alive.<eos> Then we gotta get you out of here.
Wait.<eos> Since when do you call me "Mel?"<eos> Since when do you use a nickname for anybody?<eos> You don't even use your own first name.<eos> Everybody calls you Argent.
You think I helped them because they brought back my dead son.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Theo!<eos> We're not trying to hurt you.<eos> We're the ones that brought you back.
The Morrigan was a banshee.<eos> So when the Wild Hunt moves on from Beacon Hills... I'll be like Lenore.<eos> Left behind.<eos> Alone.<eos> I hope you realize it's taking all of my strength to not tear you in half right now.
Alone.<eos> I hope you realize it's taking all of my strength to not tear you in half right now.<eos> You aren't still upset about the whole shooting thing, are you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sorry, didn't mean to wake you.
There's, like, a hundred pictures here.<eos> And it's just us.<eos> Is that a little weird?<eos> No.<eos> It means he loves you.
Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.
You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.<eos> You can save me on the other side.<eos> I believe in you.
I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.<eos> You can save me on the other side.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> I love you.
World War II.<eos> He's a Nazi.<eos> He wants the Hunt for himself.<eos> He wants his own supernatural army.<eos> We're not letting you through that rift.
I was myself again.<eos> I knew you were gone.<eos> Liam, you and Lydia get to the bunker.<eos> The whip.<eos> It didn't take you.
I can help.<eos> I know about the Wild Hunt from the Dread Doctors.<eos> - Where's Stiles?<eos> - You remember Stiles?<eos> To not tear you in half right now.
So we should try anything we can to save him.<eos> Right?<eos> Even Theo.<eos> Convince me.<eos> I can put you back in the ground anytime.
This is a mistake.<eos> You took a risk.<eos> We took a risk.<eos> But it was the right thing to do.<eos> I believe in you.
We have to lure him in.<eos> - Bait?<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> I'm faster than you.
I can hear you.<eos> I'm not dead yet.<eos> I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.
Told you, you needed a plan.<eos> She helps you, you help me.<eos> That's a bit open-ended.<eos> What if I don't agree to your conditions?<eos> I leave you for dead.
How did you know?<eos> There's a refraction of light around your silhouette that I can always see.<eos> I don't know, it probably has something to do with pheromones or some other chemical interaction.<eos> It's my only power.<eos> Finding you.
Not to reunite sentimental teenagers.<eos> You wanted us to know about Stiles.<eos> And Canaan.<eos> You were warning us.<eos> This is where we found you.
Go now.<eos> Malia, run!<eos> Go!<eos> Break the barrier.<eos> Break the barrier, or I'll rip you in two.
It was Mr. Douglas.<eos> He ate his brain.<eos> Scott was right.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I'm sending you back.
- Maybe we can.<eos> But that rift closed.<eos> Then we'll open it again.<eos> By remembering Stiles.<eos> Remember, I love you.
You want to bring them all here?<eos> Every single one of them?<eos> That's exactly what I want to do.<eos> 'Cause if the Ghost Riders are here, that means they're not trying to get to Scott.<eos> So you don't care if they get to you?
What does that mean?<eos> I think we have to treat this more like actual hypnosis.<eos> They use images to guide you through memories.<eos> Like, a stairwell.<eos> The steps take you down through one year of your life to the next.
So we hide with the dead.<eos> I'm not getting in one of those.<eos> Me neither.<eos> You should've left me in the holding cell.<eos> I should've left you in the ground.
I think you were rotting down there.<eos> Liam finally gets one thing right.<eos> I also think whatever happened to you, you deserved it.<eos> Is that right?<eos> When the Ghost Riders find us, I'm not gonna do anything for you.
Liam finally gets one thing right.<eos> I also think whatever happened to you, you deserved it.<eos> Is that right?<eos> When the Ghost Riders find us, I'm not gonna do anything for you.<eos> I'm not gonna help you. I'm not gonna save you.
Is that right?<eos> When the Ghost Riders find us, I'm not gonna do anything for you.<eos> I'm not gonna help you. I'm not gonna save you.<eos> I'm gonna do exactly what you would do to me.<eos> I'm gonna use you as bait.
Whatever's happening, it's worse for you guys.<eos> Stiles, where are you going?<eos> You're coming back, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'd never leave you behind.
Shh. Shh. Stiles, look at me.<eos> Look at me. Shh. Stiles.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> I, uh... I read once that holding your breath could stop a panic attack.<eos> So when I kissed you, um, you held your breath.
Look at me. Look at me.<eos> You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't. No, I won't, I won't.<eos> Lydia, you will.<eos> Just remember, remember I love you.
- Stiles!<eos> Give the boy some room.<eos> Dad? Dad?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, I found you.
- Stiles...<eos> I'll hold them back.<eos> Now get the hell out of here.<eos> Go. Go!<eos> When I kissed you...
I'll hold them back.<eos> Now get the hell out of here.<eos> Go. Go!<eos> When I kissed you...<eos> When I kissed you...
Now get the hell out of here.<eos> Go. Go!<eos> When I kissed you...<eos> When I kissed you...<eos> When I kissed you!
When I kissed you...<eos> When I kissed you!<eos> Stiles.<eos> Keep going.<eos> I can see you, Stiles, don't stop!
I didn't misread that?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Buddy!<eos> Oh, man!<eos> - Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Hey, hey, hey! Uh...<eos> - Big Liam!<eos> It's so good to see you too!<eos> - Yeah, no, yeah!<eos> Good to see you, Stiles.
Okay, how the hell do you "merge worlds?"<eos> Okay, nowhere in the manual does it say that werewolves can do that.<eos> And Scott and I pretty much wrote the manual.<eos> We can't even move between them, all right?<eos> Look what it took to break you out.
Yeah, barely!<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Uh, steal the horse and get to the Hunt.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> I went through all this to keep you from being taken.
Stiles, that's not your mom.<eos> I know who it is.<eos> I know her voice.<eos> No, that's the Wild Hunt.<eos> They're tricking you.
Look at him. We...<eos> We need to do something.<eos> Not yet...<eos> You have to try to save everyone.<eos> How do we save you?
There are too many of us and too few of you.<eos> Even from the Hunt, you somehow wormed your way back into his memory.<eos> Yeah, worming is one of my skills.<eos> That thing is conjured from your dad's pain.<eos> If he remembers you, he can't believe in her.
Can this Wizard take me home?<eos> That's all I want. I just...<eos> I just really want to go home.<eos> The Wizard is great and powerful.<eos> He can get you home.
That's the merciful part.<eos> Why did you come for me?<eos> I didn't!<eos> Are you one of Glinda's girls?<eos> Did she send you to hurt me?
Yeah, yeah, Vessel, solace, truth...<eos> I spend half my life waiting to walk in and out of rooms.<eos> Glinda.<eos> It's been some time.<eos> The North is always open to you.
So I'm opening up the funeral to the public.<eos> I think it's time that my people are reminded what Oz used to be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What witches... used to be.<eos> That lunatic hopes to embarrass you.
All the time.<eos> In everything.<eos> From the minute they are born into the world, the world tries to take them right back.<eos> Well, you can't protect him forever.<eos> Didn't your mother protect you?
Did you get them?<eos> Are her spells inside you?<eos> You wretched waste.<eos> My tongue... perfect.<eos> Come on, we're getting you out of here.
Please, my friend needs help.<eos> Who's up there?<eos> - It's a boy.<eos> - Who you keep locked up.<eos> Come on, we're getting you out of here.
You can't just control a tornado.<eos> It's not a dog.<eos> And you're not the Witch of the East.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> W-what if it kills you?
I am the Mistress' blade now.<eos> Lucas.<eos> Just give him your sword.<eos> Listen to me very carefully.<eos> If you can't do what he's asking, he's gonna kill you.
Know what?<eos> Your mother worked here.<eos> Before you were born.<eos> And after.<eos> But she wanted a better life for you, so she gave you up, sent you far, far away.
Because that was my past.<eos> Because I took my past and I obliterated it.<eos> People called me the Wizard of Oz because I demanded it.<eos> Crushed anyone who denied me the name.<eos> Your past does not define you.
Because I took my past and I obliterated it.<eos> People called me the Wizard of Oz because I demanded it.<eos> Crushed anyone who denied me the name.<eos> Your past does not define you.<eos> Your mother does not define you.
The Beast that comes will not take the form of fire.<eos> It will be far, far worse.<eos> Those girls who leapt to their deaths, their magic did not come from Mistress West.<eos> It came from The Beast itself.<eos> This is a Beast who knows you.
Tip!<eos> Tip!<eos> Tip.<eos> Why did you run off like that?<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
Captain!<eos> If you let me join your brigade, I'll kill for you.<eos> What will your family think about that?<eos> I have no family.<eos> Well, then maybe I do have a place for you.
Are you putting me to death?<eos> To work.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> You had a fall.<eos> But we're gonna fix you up.
What's your name?<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> She doesn't understand you.<eos> Well, she may not understand me, but she seems to know you.
Where's Tip?<eos> - Tip?<eos> - My friend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were quite alone when we found you.
Be safe.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Look, if we don't find your parents, I'll bring you right back to him.
Always.<eos> I thought you were displeased with me.<eos> I was.<eos> Was I wrong to challenge you?<eos> I'm taking you to Nimbo because you did.
Lucas, stop!<eos> Lucas, those aren't her parents.<eos> We have to go back for her.<eos> No, The Wizard's Guards are everywhere.<eos> They'll find you before we ever find her.
Anything amiss at all?<eos> No, no, I ain't seen anything.<eos> Nothing unusual we've seen.<eos> Seen nothing.<eos> You shoot that, and everyone will mark you for a witch.
You've lost someone.<eos> Her mother.<eos> My wife.<eos> We've all lost someone.<eos> Because of you.
My God.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> Sylvie?<eos> Sylvie, come here.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here, all right?
Close your eyes.<eos> Close 'em.<eos> Do you feel better?<eos> Be difficult to feel any worse.<eos> I thought I'd lost you.
I'm proud of you, Jack.<eos> You all right?<eos> There was a girl in here earlier.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was gonna ask you about that.
In the water.<eos> I knew it was you the whole time.<eos> You weren't fooling anyone.<eos> I've heard enough from my sister.<eos> I don't need any more from you.
And this village?<eos> Will it save my future grandchild?<eos> Excellent question.<eos> For the crime of murdering the Mistress of the eastern wood... by order of the great and powerful Wizard of Oz...<eos> I commit you to d...
Build me, then sell me?<eos> No.<eos> I'd rather hoped you'd want to stay in my care.<eos> Then why are you leaving?<eos> The princess met you... she liked you, and...
On Witches.<eos> And in the end... it could not save us.<eos> So... from this day forward... I propose... we embrace the teachings of The Wizard.<eos> And allow science to rule the day.<eos> That man... he did know you.
Dorothy, that man, he knew me.<eos> So...<eos> Are you a good witch... Or a bad witch?<eos> I must say, the wizard has outdone himself.<eos> Because he wants something from you.
Could I be responsible?<eos> Then I'd be a traitor.<eos> You didn't kill those men.<eos> - Well, how can you be so sure?<eos> - Because I know you.
I'll clear your name.<eos> Let me come with you.<eos> You have to stay here.<eos> Do not leave the house.<eos> If those men find you, they will finish the job for sure.
Unfortunately, there's no right one, either.<eos> You're wrong about all of this.<eos> I didn't kill your sister.<eos> Liar!<eos> I will suck the lies out of you like marrow from a bone, or you can speak the truth now and save yourself the hurt.
How... how do you know?<eos> Comfortable?<eos> Maybe you need a good stretch?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Glinda will be coming here tomorrow and expects information from you.
I swear.<eos> Who is k. Chapman?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She was my mother!<eos> She should have taught you how to tell the truth!
Go to hell.<eos> How did you get those?<eos> Those were hers.<eos> My sister's.<eos> So, August, can I count on you to build my arsenal?
From mombi.<eos> Tip?<eos> How?<eos> Is that really you?<eos> I don't know who I am because of you.
I don't know who I am because of you.<eos> Because of me?<eos> Tip, I... i helped you when I had nothing to gain.<eos> And I helped you because you asked me to.<eos> And now I'm asking you... please.
And I helped you because you asked me to.<eos> And now I'm asking you... please.<eos> Please help me.<eos> You helping me was the worst thing that ever happened.<eos> So now I'm gonna do for you what I wish you'd done for me.
Merciful and stern.<eos> - Why did you come for me?<eos> - I didn't!<eos> Are you one of glinda's girls?<eos> Did she send you to hurt me?
You're the worst human being I've ever met.<eos> What am I even doing here?<eos> You obviously hate me and now you want me to, what?<eos> Or am I supposed to trail behind you like some kind of pet?<eos> Or maybe I'm here to entertain you, so you can laugh at my clumsiness, my freakishness, is that it?
The ones our sister died with.<eos> If secrets were kept, they were kept from me, too.<eos> And what of your own?<eos> I harbor no secrets.<eos> Especially from you.
So this is what it's like to feel normal.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Why do I wear a mask?<eos> I'll tell you when we're friends.<eos> I have something to show you.
- Nimbo!<eos> - Why? - I can't...<eos> - Tell me!<eos> There was a wagon you drove, all right?<eos> We pulled you over and you drew your sword.
Cut them down like they were nothing.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> If you don't believe me, look on your left side.<eos> That's where I stabbed you before you went down.
Magic strong enough to kill a witch.<eos> What is it?<eos> A bullet more powerful than magic.<eos> Sylvie, did you do this?<eos> Can I count on you to build my arsenal?
Roberto!<eos> We've got to get him out of here.<eos> Answer me.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I've known you since the day you were born.
Then go.<eos> I think she likes to watch.<eos> Shall we let her?<eos> If this is what you want.<eos> Let's see what lowly witch has cast a spell on you.
- You're alive.<eos> - No, don't touch me.<eos> I can't believe it's really you.<eos> Why didn't you help me?<eos> I thought I'd killed you.
I can fix everything now.<eos> Please let me... No, we can't be fixed.<eos> I can't be fixed.<eos> Jack, don't go.<eos> I love you!
Tip.<eos> And how do you know my Jack?<eos> We grew up together.<eos> We were best friends.<eos> Is this the one who killed you?
Yes.<eos> Yes, of course you did.<eos> I'm sorry, Father, I'll...<eos> I'll come and help you find him.<eos> You know I'm always here for you.
What's in the wagon?<eos> What's in the wagon?<eos> I suggest you let me pass.<eos> Show me now.<eos> Or I'll cut you down, I swear.
Don't let him swallow it!<eos> It can't be.<eos> I need that gun.<eos> You could just take the weapon from the girl.<eos> I could've killed you, Eamonn... when I took this city from your king.
But Glinda, she watched the last of the witches get slaughtered by The Beast.<eos> What good would new ones be?<eos> Sober up, you fool!<eos> She's not going to use them against the beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
She's not going to use them against the beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.<eos> What did you think Glinda would do?<eos> You imprisoned every witch who practiced magic and repressed the ones who didn't.<eos> And now they're going to take Emerald City from you!
She's going to use them against you.<eos> What did you think Glinda would do?<eos> You imprisoned every witch who practiced magic and repressed the ones who didn't.<eos> And now they're going to take Emerald City from you!<eos> They are going to take Oz from you with the very elements you outlawed!
You are sworn to her, as am I.<eos> He works for Glinda?<eos> You know me?<eos> There is a wagon in the load-out that'll take you north to Calcedon,<eos> Glinda's castle... she's ordered me to free you.
It's late to be wandering.<eos> The Wizard told you I'm his guest.<eos> I can leave when I want.<eos> Or you could follow me.<eos> I'll take you to the girl.
You have to stay here.<eos> I'm gonna go get help.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Keep her safe, Toto.<eos> Trust you.
When you come back home, I'll make you a big fire.<eos> You can lie in front of that, and then we go hunting like we did in the old days.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Jack.<eos> I asked you to find my father, yet I don't see my father.
I brought us here.<eos> It was... it was a mistake.<eos> My computer malfunctioned.<eos> No.<eos> I locked you out to destroy your machine.
That wig.<eos> You're just lying to everyone.<eos> I could say the same about you.<eos> We do what we need to survive.<eos> Which is why I need to ask you, where's the little witch?
I have a proposition for you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> You're here somewhere, I know you are.<eos> I...<eos> I'm going to find you.
Randall?<eos> What is this?<eos> All the power in Emerald City is generated from underneath us.<eos> I was brought to Oz in a vortex chamber.<eos> This one here... can send you home.
All the power in Emerald City is generated from underneath us.<eos> I was brought to Oz in a vortex chamber.<eos> This one here... can send you home.<eos> Now?<eos> I just have one thing to ask of you first.
Now?<eos> I just have one thing to ask of you first.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> You were born in Oz...<eos> Oz brought you back.
We need to find Sylvie.<eos> I already have.<eos> Dorothy!<eos> Sylvie.<eos> I should have never left you alone.
You were protecting those girls.<eos> - Why?<eos> - For Glinda.<eos> You are sworn to her. As am I.<eos> This vortex chamber can send you home.
She gave me the only weapon that could have killed the witch.<eos> - Not the only one.<eos> - When she gets to Glinda, she'll stop this war before it even starts.<eos> Randall.<eos> Can I count on you to build my Arsenal?
Can I count on you to build my Arsenal?<eos> The mother witch lives and breathes for Glinda!<eos> I saw young witches.<eos> She's not going to use them against the beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
For the moment.<eos> So are you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Although apparently you're sworn to serve someone named Glinda.<eos> And what about you?
The gauntlets.<eos> They...<eos> They just did something.<eos> You can control them now.<eos> They're becoming part of you.
She sent them to die against the beast forever.<eos> And I helped her.<eos> I killed them too.<eos> I won't help either of you repeat the past.<eos> Glinda hid your mother from you.
We need to move!<eos> Block off the streets.<eos> You!<eos> Come with me now!<eos> Or my people will rip you apart!
My father was the only one to see me as I truly am.<eos> I need someone to see me now.<eos> Wait.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I do see you.
Previously on "Emerald City"...<eos> My father was the only one to see me as I truly am.<eos> I do see you.
We take them to war.<eos> A war on magic!<eos> I should be coming with you.<eos> Who will look after Emerald City?<eos> No one better than you.
I'm not a Princess.<eos> You don't know what you are.<eos> I'm a boy.<eos> You were turned into a boy.<eos> Why else but to hide you?
To protect you.<eos> Everyone keeps telling me who and what I am.<eos> When do I get to decide?<eos> You are the only child of Samuel and Katherine pastoria.<eos> Your parents loved you and kept you safe till the day they died.
Falling in love.<eos> I broke my oath of celibacy to the high council.<eos> I hid it long enough that now she doesn't know what to do with me.<eos> Others weren't as lucky.<eos> Glinda spared you because of your child.
And she's not staying either.<eos> Given your crime, I doubt she'll get a vote.<eos> What crime is that?<eos> Kidnapping Glinda's husband.<eos> I searched everywhere for you, Roan.
I searched everywhere for you, Roan.<eos> I thought I'd lost you forever.<eos> Well, had I known...<eos> You couldn't have.<eos> The spell was designed to protect you.
- Then I can't help you.<eos> That woman needs help.<eos> Look, I know you're confused.<eos> I've been confused, too, ever since I came to oz.<eos> But then I found you.
I shouldn't have come.<eos> Lucas.<eos> Lucas!<eos> Oh, Roan.<eos> I've missed you so.
You can't hold me accountable.<eos> My spell didn't make you a different man.<eos> I took your memory, not your heart.<eos> Yes, yes. And with your spell lifted, all my old feelings return.<eos> I do love you.
Like every young woman, a witch cannot harness the whole of her powers until she comes of age.<eos> What we asked of these girls was simply beyond their capacity.<eos> But Dorothy, perhaps you can help them.<eos> I'm not a physician.<eos> The Wizaed must believe you have some capability, or he wouldn't have put you on me.
Me.<eos> What poison is running through your veins?<eos> None.<eos> I swear, I'm as clear as I've ever been, and I want you to know that...<eos> I forgive you.
Did you know that she saw you as her heir?<eos> Not me, not east.<eos> You.<eos> Where is she?<eos> In a place safe from all those who would do her harm, including you.
I lifted my spell.<eos> Your spell was worthless.<eos> It's hers that I can't break.<eos> I've tried.<eos> For you, for us, and I...
Take my life.<eos> Hers.<eos> Take her life, and your heart will be free.<eos> Do it, or I will.<eos> On behalf of Queen Langwidere, the kingdom of ev welcomes you, great and powerful Wizaed of oz.
I'm scared.<eos> I'm scared, sister.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You have nothing to be scared of.<eos> You have magic to protect you.
We have your guns.<eos> We no longer need the wizard of oz.<eos> Don't go.<eos> You can't go.<eos> What am I supposed to do without you?
Please... my sister...<eos> Do you feel her inside you?<eos> What does she command?<eos> A message.<eos> For you.
Look at me!<eos> At least look at me!<eos> Now that I've got all this witch stuff inside me, can't we just, you know, fly to wherever?<eos> If we fly, glinda will find out about you.<eos> Then she'll want you for her own.
Why?<eos> You should have never been.<eos> But I am.<eos> You should have never happened.<eos> I'd send you home if I could, but it's not possible.
You got your wish.<eos> I never happened to you.<eos> You have my gold.<eos> And your guns.<eos> Do you wonder why you're still alive when these men in this room have killed everyone else around you?
You've lost your army to fight glinda.<eos> The end.<eos> I see you're very smart.<eos> You're a clever girl.<eos> I know your father is no longer around to teach you.
For the wizard?<eos> For me.<eos> We're done.<eos> Go your own way.<eos> Without you, there is no army.
When it was my time.<eos> You even discredited me.<eos> I'm the only one left who knows you're a fraud.<eos> It must hurt to know that no one will listen.<eos> I know the only reason you have kept me alive is because my work has value to you.
Fix her like you fixed me.<eos> Please!<eos> She can't die!<eos> Do for her what you did for me.<eos> You were alive when we found you.
So is she!<eos> No, Jack...<eos> - No! - So is she!<eos> Jack!<eos> Because we are fair, you will hear the charges against you before you are sentenced.
One for sadness.<eos> For joy.<eos> One for rage. For longing.<eos> One for love.<eos> She tried to love you, Jack, as best she could.
- Previously on "Emerald City"...<eos> - The mother witch lives!<eos> And breeds for glinda.<eos> She's not going to use them against the beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
Rally your men.<eos> - but we've no weapons against magic!<eos> - Your sacrifice will be noted.<eos> - what does it mean?<eos> - your reputation precedes you.
- Leave him.<eos> I am your queen.<eos> - Fear rules.<eos> Not kings and queens.<eos> - so I should be more like you?
I could stop a war.<eos> - So you didn't do what you were supposed to do up north?<eos> Kill glinda.<eos> - Did you even think I could, or did you just send me there because you thought I'd never come back?<eos> - I sent you there to save oz.
- Did you even think I could, or did you just send me there because you thought I'd never come back?<eos> - I sent you there to save oz.<eos> Because I swore to protect this world!<eos> And I will protect it!<eos> And I will send you home!
- For no other reason than to save myself.<eos> - Bleed him dry.<eos> - why did you let me live?<eos> - I have a daughter of your age.<eos> when I looked down at you... I saw her looking back.
when I looked down at you... I saw her looking back.<eos> I saw myself in her eyes.<eos> A murderer. A coward.<eos> this is yours by right.<eos> - You think that will save you?
They're innocent.<eos> - Eamonn, what's happening?<eos> - Father, help us!<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I beg of you...
My love.<eos> - I don't know you, sir.<eos> - what have you done?<eos> - You took away my family. Now I took away yours.<eos> I cast you out of emerald city.
- I don't know you, sir.<eos> - what have you done?<eos> - You took away my family. Now I took away yours.<eos> I cast you out of emerald city.<eos> I strip you of land and title.
- sylvie?<eos> - Even though you knew her heart was magic.<eos> Even when she turned your own kind to stone.<eos> Your love for her has never wavered.<eos> But unfortunately for you... Stone crumbles.
No.<eos> - Jane?<eos> Jane?<eos> - Halt!<eos> - Now you see. Everyone is dying because of you.
- No, no, no, no, no!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm not your enemy.<eos> I'm trying to save oz from them.<eos> - Call your men off and tell them to surrender, or I swear to god, I will shoot you with your own gun.
Let us become what we were meant to be. To each other, to oz.<eos> - you can march me wherever you want. I'm not gonna send you home.<eos> - But this isn't about me. It's about what's best for oz.<eos> - Oh, what's that?<eos> - I'm sending you home.
- you can march me wherever you want. I'm not gonna send you home.<eos> - But this isn't about me. It's about what's best for oz.<eos> - Oh, what's that?<eos> - I'm sending you home.<eos> Whatever you did to get here, tell me, so I can send you back.
- Frank!<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> - It's what I should have done years ago.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - It's been 20 years since I saw your face. Since I let you go and gave you to Karen.
- How do I know?<eos> - When you were little, I gave you a tattoo on your left hand. Just below your thumb.<eos> Five dots, a circle.<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to kiss each mark before I put you to sleep.
yeah.<eos> One to keep you safe, one for good dreams.<eos> This one right here.<eos> - Why?<eos> - So if I ever lost you, I could find you again.
Right now, we have to go before it's too late.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Dorothy...<eos> - why did you leave me?<eos> - I made a promise to keep you safe.
- just one more sequence.<eos> - Mom!<eos> - This is the only way.<eos> - No, you promised me!<eos> - I made a promise to protect you.
- she's a prisoner... Of the beast forever.<eos> - No.<eos> - And only you can stop it.<eos> - You've come to bring me back.<eos> - I've come to bring you home.
Well, that's a very good question.<eos> I assume he saw value in the tall tales told about me after that night in the tavern.<eos> Saw mystery in it, perhaps.<eos> Use my name upon which to build his story.<eos> And this bothers you why?
And I don't like having him conscripting me into his cause without me even having a say.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Because I believe he is my friend?<eos> Are you questioning whether I'm qualified to have an opinion on that subject?<eos> Did you not once tell me of your worry about the fate of those whom Captain Flint has called friends before you?
Because I believe he is my friend?<eos> Are you questioning whether I'm qualified to have an opinion on that subject?<eos> Did you not once tell me of your worry about the fate of those whom Captain Flint has called friends before you?<eos> A lot has changed since then.<eos> A lot has changed since then, but what has not changed is that when a man first needs you and thereafter calls you a friend, a little suspicion is a healthy thing.
He controls the town but little else.<eos> My people have free reign over most of the rest of the island.<eos> Your people?<eos> The scouts are returning.<eos> I'll meet you inside.
Are you through?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then go.<eos> When was the last time you fought in a vanguard?<eos> He ain't never gonna see you in that way, Teach.
Spider-Man for the boys.<eos> It's gonna be the best birthday party ever.<eos> Of course it's gonna be the best birthday party ever!<eos> Get over here, you little punk! What are you doing?<eos> Do me a favor, get your swimsuit on, all right? I'll meet you in the pool, five minutes.
- Send that to me. - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - How's things? - Um, pretty good.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can I talk to you in private for a second?
That she would... outgrow me, maybe. Or figure me out or something.<eos> So I've always had this sense that... that, you know, the day would come where she would just... where she would just not love me anymore, and... and I...<eos> Evidence that she doesn't... doesn't love you anymore.<eos> Celeste, how do you feel about what Perry just said?<eos> I gave up my career for you.

I left my friends. I moved here for you.
- Great.<eos> - Hi, Nathan.<eos> Hello, Bonnie. - Hi. - Ed.<eos> - Nathan.<eos> Um, can I steal you for a second?
I just wanna go play on the playground.<eos> I know, but you might actually like it.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I love you.
I love you.<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> You can do it, Blue!<eos> Hey.<eos> - Missed you at the meeting.
That'd be cool.<eos> Are you ever coming back?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I'm gonna come back all the time.<eos> I made a playlist for you.
I'm sad because... because my husband doubts my love for him.<eos> And happy...?<eos> I'm happy because the first time in a long time, I'm hopeful. For us.<eos> Would you dance with me?<eos> I just want to hold you, look into your eyes, be in love with you, and feel you being in love with me.
How come we didn't have a conversation about this?<eos> If you were here long enough to have a conversation.<eos> After the talk shifts from the kids, you're off packing your bag for another business trip.<eos> You gonna hit me now?<eos> Do you want me to hit you, Celeste?
You don't have to look for him for me, if that's what you're doing.<eos> I'm okay, Mom.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> Scoot over.<eos> I love you.
No reason.<eos> Because I was raped?<eos> Well, I mean, I'm... I'm trying to be sensitive, honey. I...<eos> I don't always know the right thing to say.<eos> - But I certainly don't judge you.
What do you mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It doesn't help, by the way, that you're this seemingly perfect step-mom.<eos> Anyway, we're gonna do this dinner, but I think it'll be up to you and me to keep things civil.<eos> - I hear you. - All right.
- What?<eos> - You're gonna be a lawyer again.<eos> - No.<eos> I mean, I have never seen you like that.<eos> For four years I've known you, and... your face looked different, your body changed.
- What if it goes to court? - It's not gonna go to court.<eos> That is a done deal.<eos> It's amazing. You have nothing to worry about.<eos> You're so good to me.<eos> I believe in you.
- I know, out of nowhere.<eos> - But... - I'm still shaking.<eos> One minute we're talking, and then the next... No.. He puts his tongue in my throat.<eos> This is assault.<eos> He assaulted you.
This is assault.<eos> He assaulted you.<eos> - I mean, I might've kissed him back.<eos> - What?<eos> It was like a reflex, you know? Somebody kisses you, you kiss them back.
Or was it my hand in his shirt?<eos> It was a reflex!<eos> So you're saying the thing's mutual.<eos> No, he jumped me and then he yelled at me.<eos> I'm in love with you. You hear me?
It was a reflex!<eos> So you're saying the thing's mutual.<eos> No, he jumped me and then he yelled at me.<eos> I'm in love with you. You hear me?<eos> I'm in love with you, Madeline. I have been...
Did he hit on you at all?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Just that it should fall to me and him to keep the peace at this dinner.<eos> I don't disagree.<eos> Did he, um... did he say anything off at all or cross you in any way?
What I am.<eos> How so?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> I love you.
Target practice.<eos> I try to go once a month.<eos> You were doing target practice?<eos> You seem suspicious.<eos> Well, we're going on a road trip to go meet the person that assaulted you, and you're doing target practice?
It's a bite! - Just keep your voice down.<eos> Someone is biting our daughter!<eos> My God, okay.<eos> Honey, Mommy is getting very upset.<eos> I'm getting very, very upset because someone is bullying you.
"Is it sexy/slutty enough?" question mark.<eos> I mean, what kind of project is this, Nathan?<eos> Well, if it's a secret project, then that's probably why I don't know about it.<eos> I mean, why are you on Abby's Facebook page?<eos> How did she friend you?
Come on, get her! - Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Come here, Mom!<eos> Come, I'll save you.<eos> I'll save you, honey.
But I... I just stopped by to see if Joseph was okay.<eos> I'm glad to see you're feeling better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm just gonna head out now. - Okay.<eos> - But good to see you, Tori.
They left in a hurry, not bothering to sew their wounds or burn the dead.<eos> And when they reached their home shores, not one of them ever set foot in a boat or spoke of that new world ever again.<eos> Over 100 years later, when Leif the Fortunate, son of Erik the Red, would rediscover that land, he found his god waiting... along with his war.<eos> Best thing, only good thing about being in prison, is the relief.<eos> You don't worry if they're going to get you when they already got you.
I don't believe in anything I can't see.<eos> I feel like there's a fucking axe hanging over my head.<eos> You know, I can't see it, but I believe it.<eos> I can see it fine.<eos> Prison has a way of trying to keep you in prison.
Prison has a way of trying to keep you in prison.<eos> They'll do anything they can to keep you inside with them.<eos> I smell snow.<eos> Hello?<eos> I love you.
We're planning your surprise party welcome home.<eos> A surprise party?<eos> Which you know nothing about.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.
A surprise party?<eos> Which you know nothing about.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.
Which you know nothing about.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I love you, puppy.
Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too, baby.
Oh, don't worry about me.<eos> I got an eye for these things.<eos> Just the one, but I can see that you're not used to the fresh air, but I don't see the joy of being out.<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> What should I call you if I were so inclined?
Ah, you got more talent than me.<eos> I got two.<eos> One is I can sleep anywhere, any time.<eos> The other one is that I usually end up getting what I want... On average, over time.<eos> It's all about getting people to believe in you.
I can get you on a flight tomorrow that'll get you into Eagle Point by 6.<eos> How many miles is it from here?<eos> I've only been on three other dates from the computer.<eos> I-I don't think I have the talent for it.<eos> But meeting you...
But meeting you...<eos> I'm glad my kids forced me into getting on that stupid thing.<eos> You... like me?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I want to see you again.
I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.<eos> Trees bow, and warriors fall.<eos> Give me your blessing. Ohh!<eos> I bow my head before you and worship you.
Give me everything.<eos> All that I have!<eos> Everything!<eos> Gift me your body.<eos> I love you.
Heads.<eos> Tails.<eos> I rigged the toss.<eos> Rigged games are the easiest to beat.<eos> It is always going to be tails because I don't want to work for you.
Do you know who he is?<eos> Who he really is?<eos> Well, I never. Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you.
You drive where needs driving to.<eos> You take care of things generally on my behalf.<eos> And in an emergency, and in an emergency only, you kick the asses of those whose asses require kicking.<eos> And in the unlikely event of my death, you will hold my vigil.<eos> He's hustling you.
Name your price.<eos> I just want to go to my wife's funeral.<eos> Okay?<eos> I just want to say goodbye.<eos> Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.
You want me to hurt people?<eos> Well,<eos> I'll hurt people if they try and hurt you.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt anyone for fun or profit.<eos> I'll work for you up to which point you start to piss me off, and then I'm gone.
There.<eos> You're my man now.<eos> It'll be heads.<eos> Well, if it's coin tricks we're doing... watch this.<eos> Now that's a coin trick for you.
They did a hell of a job reconstructing her face and neck.<eos> I think that and the coffin just killed your savings.<eos> All so you could have that nice open casket, get one last look at her pretty face.<eos> I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.
Ah, that's...<eos> That's a "We're in this together" thing.<eos> W-Was it love? Because if you were going to leave, you could have just told me, okay?<eos> I could've taken it.<eos> You know, I had a surprise for you.
And I know that why?<eos> Because four of them were about math.<eos> I like math.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I just wanted to come back better than when I went in... for you.
I'm sorry for your loss, Shadow.<eos> I really am.<eos> Anyone tell you that yet?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Anyone even hug you?
As you say, I work for Mr. Wednesday.<eos> Well, then why the fuck am I wasting my time sitting here talking to you?<eos> You know, I was curious myself how long you would go on sucking your own dick.<eos> Kill him.<eos> We're not just going to kill you, Shadow.
Well, then why the fuck am I wasting my time sitting here talking to you?<eos> You know, I was curious myself how long you would go on sucking your own dick.<eos> Kill him.<eos> We're not just going to kill you, Shadow.<eos> We're going to delete you.
Not in a long while has he been one of yours.<eos> You separate a head from a body, that is strike fucking one across the bow.<eos> They all ain't going to take that lightly. Good.<eos> Wait 'til he sees strike two, when I get myself that queen.<eos> What about you?
I'm not confused.<eos> I'm very confused. You're confused.<eos> And you're intrigued.<eos> Your wife came back from the dead, why wouldn't you be?<eos> If you said you weren't, I'd call you a liar. A bigger one than I am.
Is this Wisconsin?<eos> That's our next stop.<eos> Welcome to Kentucky.<eos> Now be nice to the lady we're visiting, but not too nice.<eos> She might take a fancy to you, and that would not be good.
They mouth your name, but they have no idea what it means.<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> Same every spring.<eos> You do all the work, he gets all the prayers.<eos> What has gotten into you?
They used to starve themselves.<eos> 40 days, but not out of worship, but out of necessity.<eos> Hunger was an ancient form of prayer, and they've never been hungry.<eos> I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.<eos> Never once have they had to work for it, give thanks for it, or pray to you for it.
A dead girl?<eos> I have a house full of guests and a garage full of caterers and you brought me a dead girl?<eos> Hi.<eos> - You have a lovely home. - Don't stoop.<eos> Somebody tried to raise you with refined manners, dead girl, and failed.
I have a house full of guests and a garage full of caterers and you brought me a dead girl?<eos> Hi.<eos> - You have a lovely home. - Don't stoop.<eos> Somebody tried to raise you with refined manners, dead girl, and failed.<eos> Let me see you.
Some believe that you can develop a last image seen off their retinas.<eos> Like a photograph.<eos> Death is usually the last enemy.<eos> Right but not for... not for Jesus Christ.<eos> Not for you.
I ran you off the road.<eos> See, here I thought I knocked the gear shift with my shoulder.<eos> All this time, I've been blaming myself.<eos> I guess now I have somebody else to blame, right?<eos> That's right, I killed you!
See, here I thought I knocked the gear shift with my shoulder.<eos> All this time, I've been blaming myself.<eos> I guess now I have somebody else to blame, right?<eos> That's right, I killed you!<eos> I killed you fucking dead!
You know?<eos> I've got my qualities, and...<eos> Right, well, we have a problem we need to talk about.<eos> - What problem?<eos> - Al Parker's case against you.
Oh, fuck.<eos> OK, no.<eos> I did not see him sexually assault a child.<eos> But there is overwhelming circumstantial evidence, and there's his sexual assault on me.<eos> - What, he tried to rape you?
Oh, I teach dirty English.<eos> Well, they will be impressed to know that you tutored at a university.<eos> Why do you say "tutor"?<eos> You know very well that I was a junior professor at the Leipzig University History Department.<eos> OK, well, unlike you, my parents don't ask awkward questions, and they have manners, and they will love you.
Alexander, my professor friend.<eos> And good news-- he's going to come for dinner.<eos> He said yes. - I told him that you're a good cook, and I think you are... - You made it!<eos> - ...so not baked beans, OK?<eos> - It's good to see you, darling.
- Well, um... Come here. What?<eos> - No-- don't touch.<eos> - What? ! - Come on!<eos> - OK?<eos> Why can't I hug you?
Hey, she needs a mentor.<eos> - Adrian, I'm not a teacher.<eos> Give me someone else.<eos> - Take Miranda, OK?<eos> She'd take a bullet for you.
I'm only telling you that because he is definitely going to want to talk to you about that... and it will definitely fucking suck.<eos> But that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else.<eos> They are not racist.<eos> I would have told you.<eos> I wouldn't be bringing you home to them. Think about that for just two seconds.
Hold on, hold on.<eos> Hi, Rod.<eos> - Look here, you know you picked the wrong guy, right?<eos> Oh yeah of course I know that.<eos> This is all just a ploy to get you.
She puts me under once, the sight of a cigarette makes me want to vomit.<eos> Okay fall back, Dean.<eos> - It's a service we provide.<eos> I'm good actually, thank you.<eos> Well, smoker or not, we're thrilled to have you up here for the get together.
- Oh my God.<eos> She used to bite them off, suck on them and then save them in a jewelry box.<eos> No I didn't, I do not know what you're talking about.<eos> - That is really disgusting.<eos> I fucking hate you.
Yo, I've got a rule: no play fighting with drunk people.<eos> Not going to play?<eos> I just want to...<eos> I wasn't going to hurt him.<eos> He was going to put you in a fucking headlock.
- Sorry.<eos> This sucks.<eos> What?<eos> Why do you say you're sorry?<eos> Because I brought you here and I'm related to all of them.
Because I brought you here and I'm related to all of them.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Why are you so calm?<eos> - Honestly, this is nothing.<eos> I like you and your racial flow
Right.<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> - What?<eos> My exercise.<eos> I did not mean to scare you.
Logan.<eos> Logan King.<eos> Chris just told me that he felt much more comfortable with my being here.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Logan, I hate to tear you away dear, but the Wincott's were asking about you.
Don't ...<eos> Don't do that. Don't ...<eos> - It's okay, it's okay.<eos> I'm sorry. It's all good, right?<eos> ah, they got you on display now, huh?
They treat us like family.<eos> This bitch is crazy.<eos> This bitch is crazy.<eos> Hey, hang on.<eos> Chris, I want you to introduce you to some friends.
There was time.<eos> There was a time when somebody was looking for her.<eos> There was time, nobody, nobody, nobody was looking.<eos> You're all I've got.<eos> I'm not going to leave here without you.
There was a time when somebody was looking for her.<eos> There was time, nobody, nobody, nobody was looking.<eos> You're all I've got.<eos> I'm not going to leave here without you.<eos> I'm not going to abandon you.
Let's go home, this sucks.<eos> This sucks.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> I'll make something up.<eos> I love you.
Whew that TSA shit tingles.<eos> This motherfucker is lying.<eos> Okay, I got you.<eos> I'm going to record your ass.<eos> I'm going to record the shit out of you.
Apparently our common understanding of the process ... has a positive impact on the success rate of the procedure.<eos> You could give a shit, right?<eos> Okay, just let me just tell you what it is?<eos> Phase one was the hypnotism.<eos> That's how they sedate you.
Get him grandpa<eos> Let me do it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's me.<eos> I love you.
Let me do it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.
Goodnight.<eos> Your first bed as a free man. Enjoy it.<eos> Shadow?<eos> About that little shit in the big limo.<eos> An assault on you is an insult to me.
Shadow?<eos> About that little shit in the big limo.<eos> An assault on you is an insult to me.<eos> Don't think because I didn't lose my temper I'm not angry or I'm lacking a plan.<eos> I didn't mean to wake you.
I've got a meeting in here, and I want you to do some shopping for me.<eos> Here's a thousand dollars and a list of things to get.<eos> Don't like dropping in on friends empty-handed.<eos> Money situation's a little tight at the moment, so we can agree now you bring me receipts or you don't skim more than a reasonable 5 percent.<eos> I'm not gonna steal from you.
I heard about the trouble you had with the Technical Boy.<eos> I was impressed with how you dealt with him.<eos> Efficient, no-nonsense, effective.<eos> Who'd have thought you had it in you?<eos> He was underestimating you, sweetheart.
Who'd have thought you had it in you?<eos> He was underestimating you, sweetheart.<eos> They all are.<eos> Not a mistake I'll make.<eos> Yeah, well I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy.
This is so fucking crazy.<eos> - And like the rest of your life is sane?<eos> - Lucy talking to me from the TV is weirder by several orders of magnitude than anything that's ever happened to me.<eos> So far.<eos> At times the universe does seem to have singled you out for unique abuse.
The secret is charm.<eos> Yeah, well, you either got it or you don't.<eos> Charms can be learned like anything else.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya.<eos> He don't going to be happy to see you.
- That smell.<eos> - We have guest.<eos> We have two guests.<eos> Votan!<eos> Nice to see you, Czernobog, old friend.
Make him not be here, or I'll make him not be here.<eos> I already invite him for dinner.<eos> I cannot uninvite.<eos> I come here only to share bread and information.<eos> What you choose to do with the latter is entirely up to you.
Let your sister hear this con man, this son of a bitch, come into my home and try to make me die.<eos> You brought that madness into my life once.<eos> - Never again.<eos> - They'll all be there.<eos> Everyone except you... each of them thinking they know what strong is.
- Never again.<eos> - They'll all be there.<eos> Everyone except you... each of them thinking they know what strong is.<eos> And if you're not there to show them otherwise...<eos> They respect you.
- They'll all be there.<eos> Everyone except you... each of them thinking they know what strong is.<eos> And if you're not there to show them otherwise...<eos> They respect you.<eos> They know you.
Listen.<eos> If I lose, I will go with Votan and do what he asks, and I will nod in front of the others.<eos> And if you win?<eos> I get to knock your brains out with my hammer.<eos> But first, you have to go down on your knees, and I will hit you with this.
You don't like it, there's the door.<eos> Humoring him doesn't help.<eos> He should be put in a government shelter.<eos> Sure, all the shit goes to the government.<eos> Israel, hop in, I'll take you!
Me.<eos> Yeah, sure!<eos> And I'm part of your dream?<eos> Why not?<eos> I know you. You play the machines every day.
I still haven't...<eos> Really?<eos> You've never been in love?<eos> A girl like you, looking at you...<eos> I mean, I'm not saying I know you...
Cecilia?<eos> She hung up.<eos> She thought it was some moron screaming...<eos> Don't insult me!<eos> She didn't recognize you.
- That'll reassure them.<eos> Calm down, please.<eos> I'm sure that...<eos> Okay, okay, stay away!<eos> He definitely touched you.
Don't make this any harder.<eos> I feel terrible, having to do this.<eos> Please...<eos> I've never heard anything so vile.<eos> I'm going to French kiss you, my tongue down your throat.
The coins are for us. They're full of virus.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Open the storeroom door.<eos> 15 years working here, and you do this to me?<eos> Who told you to touch the body?
15 years working here, and you do this to me?<eos> Who told you to touch the body?<eos> How did I know he was going to die?<eos> I looked after you like a son.<eos> I couldn't love you more, you know that.
- I'm just obeying.<eos> "He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it until the thousand years were ended."<eos> - I'm not going down there!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You want me to pop you'? !
We have to get the gun.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> - We have to get it.<eos> - Relax.<eos> I'll push you.
Elena, tie them to the light cable!<eos> No.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> Tie the syringes to the cable, for Christ's sake!<eos> I heard you, but I'm not doing it.
- Fuck!<eos> - Keep going, it's still small.<eos> - We can't stay here.<eos> - I won't fit!<eos> I'll go and pull you from down there.
Trini, please, I'm gonna fall!<eos> Go, Trini!<eos> That's enough!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'll kill you, Beard Boy!
Go, Trini!<eos> That's enough!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'll kill you, Beard Boy!<eos> I'll kill you, you hear me?
Right, Elena?<eos> I save you the trouble.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Do you know why I won't throw away the gun?<eos> I'm scared of you.
You let go!<eos> - You're going to push me in!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Who's pushing me?<eos> - I'm not pushing you!
Come on, come on.<eos> Go right.<eos> Go!<eos> Now, now!<eos> - I'm going to kill you!
My parents want me to think about moving home.<eos> To London?<eos> Toby:<eos> We would like to introduce you to Carlton Summers Kennish.<eos> China's going to change you, I can already tell that.
So, let's stay.<eos> Let's do a year here!<eos> A year?<eos> Well, Ling just said that you could help out in her clinic.<eos> What about you?
- Well, you do.<eos> I will take your request under advisement, Coach Kennish.<eos> And if you don't mind, I have a department head meeting to attend with the Dean, the Chancellor, and the Provost.<eos> Look at you!<eos> - This guy bugging you?
- This guy bugging you?<eos> - Hey, it's the head of the department.<eos> - I can handle him.<eos> - Oh, I know you can.<eos> That's why I stole you from the Disabilities Office.
Honey, I think there are a lot of questions right now.<eos> Hi.<eos> As soon as we heard.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Yeah, it's good to see you.
We're happy you're okay.<eos> Emmett, that's incredibly dangerous.<eos> Are you taking other drugs out there?<eos> Bay:<eos> Emmett, we care about you.
So Bay, what are you gonna do?<eos> Same thing as Beijing.<eos> I'm gonna get a job at a tattoo parlor.<eos> I can see you biting your tongue and I appreciate that.<eos> Honey, we support you as long as it's legal and you're passionate about it.
They gave you the job because you are incredible at getting people to do what you want... including writing very large checks.<eos> I'm feeling in over my head, John, and I need your support.<eos> - All right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I supported you for decades.
- I'll see you in class.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Do you know how worried everyone is about you?
What are you doing?<eos> Do you know how worried everyone is about you?<eos> Did you take anything?<eos> Nobody hates you.<eos> We love you.
Everyone on my track is ahead of me.<eos> Mingo has moved on and I can't find a place to live on campus!<eos> Daphne, you have got to calm down.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - I'm not blaming you.
He doesn't let him out of his sight.<eos> Why does Vince have his guys looking for me?<eos> - You ran before. - Vince doesn't want to hurt me.<eos> Well, he wants to know where you are.<eos> Winslow, however, he wants to kill you.
I said it's just me.<eos> Why do I have the gun?<eos> So Amanda's playing hockey now, huh?<eos> You got to get up at the crack to get that...<eos> She mentioned you the other day.
You got to get up at the crack to get that...<eos> She mentioned you the other day.<eos> Said "Whatever happened to that guy" "who was around before Brendon?"<eos> Couldn't remember your name.<eos> Maybe because she hasn't seen you in five years.
Fine.<eos> Fuck. I'm running a con.<eos> But you know what?<eos> This is a con I plan on running for the rest of my life.<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to threaten you.
Eggs will be up in ten.<eos> Actually, to be honest, Grandma, I, uh...<eos> I didn't sleep at all last night.<eos> I snuck out.<eos> I didn't want to wake you, so I... I went out the window.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> We have an old beater you can use to get around whenever you need.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Hey, I got a question for you.
Slept in the truck a few hours.<eos> At least I assume he... he slept. I know I did.<eos> Uh, a little before dawn, he goes into a house, into a house, meets with a woman for a bed.<eos> Heads back to the party.<eos> He clocked you?
You don't remember rublies?<eos> When we were kids, I said there might be gold and diamonds and rublies.<eos> - Oh, right. - I thought there was an L in it.<eos> That was hilarious.<eos> Yeah, for you.
[beeping] Is there something I should know about?<eos> No.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm guessing you're mad at me.<eos> Why would I be mad at you, Lance?
No.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm guessing you're mad at me.<eos> Why would I be mad at you, Lance?<eos> I was just trying to help you out.
Yeah, you should have punched him in the dick.<eos> So now what?<eos> Now... I have to go tell Audrey.<eos> This is new.<eos> I've already said it to you on many occasions.
The cheat and the whale have what, a shoot-out?<eos> That's it?<eos> - Huh? - Yeah.<eos> How do you get the money, though?<eos> The cops come in, they arrest you, and... and before you figured it out, we... - Ah. - ... we get away.
Do the nose.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You earned it.<eos> Hey, uh, I'm sorry about not sticking up for you earlier with Audrey.
So you can chat 'em up.<eos> Oh, chat's not really my thing.<eos> I like it.<eos> I think we're gonna get along.<eos> As long as you remember I started here three weeks before you, so I have seniority, which is why I'm training you.
- Whatcha doing?<eos> - Jesus!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> What have we said about helicopter parenting?<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.
- She leave a note?<eos> Girl who killed herself?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, you listen to me.<eos> You ever do that to your mother, I will kill you, you understand?
When you're done listening to all 13 sides, because there are 13 sides to every story... rewind the tapes, put them back in the box, and pass them on to the next person.<eos> Why the hell am I on this?<eos> Oh, and the box of tapes should have included a map.<eos> I'll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city.<eos> I can't force you to visit them, but if you'd like a little more insight, head for the stars.
I win!<eos> You owe me five dollars.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - You bet on me?<eos> - Against you.
Oh, please.<eos> I've known you this entire century.<eos> Well, give me a break.<eos> I'm not good with the... you know, and the gay rumors only recently subsided.<eos> Mmm. So the stakes are high for you.
- Hannah, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> Justin.<eos> Foley.<eos> I saw you at the party the other night.
Speaking of, gotta go.<eos> Oh, yeah, great. Um...<eos> I'll see you later?<eos> You will!<eos> I even decided to like basketball for you, Justin.
Why?<eos> Did you hear something else?<eos> Nope.<eos> We just kissed.<eos> Sorry to disappoint you, but I guess now we're even.
- Are you awake?<eos> - Are you alive?<eos> - Yeah, I'm alive.<eos> Door closed.<eos> I have to be able to see you to know you're alive.
I've been there.<eos> Now, it won't always be easy.<eos> It might even hurt a bit.<eos> Or a bit more than a bit.<eos> That depends on you.
As is the silence.<eos> See, I can guarantee... that one of the reasons you're still listening is that you really want to know... who are the others?<eos> Who else is responsible for my death?<eos> Well, you're going to learn soon enough.<eos> And, of course, they're going to learn about you, too.
Hey, Clay.<eos> - Oh. Hey, Sheri.<eos> - How's everything?<eos> Everything is everything.<eos> I saw you and Coach Patrick this morning.
Directional.<eos> Oh, my God, your dad is a fighter pilot.<eos> He's a logistics expert, mostly.<eos> Look over there.<eos> He's checking you out.
Oh, my God, your dad is a fighter pilot.<eos> He's a logistics expert, mostly.<eos> Look over there.<eos> He's checking you out.<eos> - He's checking you out.
I don't know anybody.<eos> What's your name?<eos> It's Alex.<eos> Alex Standall.<eos> Okay, Alex Alex Standall... we are prepared to invite you to our table if you can answer one question.
- That's not the point.<eos> - Over 200.<eos> I have 600 on the advisory list.<eos> That's not...<eos> That shit'll kill you, you know.
- Put it away.<eos> What good is having a best friend who works at the movies if you can't get in for free?<eos> - Hey, Hannah.<eos> - Hey, Alex.<eos> Fancy seeing you here.
How could you even...<eos> Of course not!<eos> He likes you, you like him.<eos> I'm the one who's out.<eos> Yeah, and that pissed you off, didn't it?
Who else has?<eos> I'm not here to tell you that.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Clay, you're the slowest yet.<eos> What is taking you so long?
It's hard.<eos> To listen.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> It's tapes from a dead girl.<eos> Doesn't this affect you at all?
Why haven't you been at school?<eos> I just needed a day off to chill.<eos> They day after you talk to Porter, you need a day off?<eos> You're not telling me something!<eos> What would I not be telling you?
Yeah.<eos> See you guys.<eos> You do ticket count, I'll do concessions.<eos> Ten minutes to go!<eos> - Yep. I got you.
Never.<eos> There's nothing to be scared of.<eos> - Justin!<eos> - Uh, hey, Coach.<eos> Missed you at the pep rally.
I meant it to piss Jessica off.<eos> Because she wouldn't have sex with me.<eos> Alex.<eos> Don't.<eos> That doesn't seem like you.
Don't you have a concert?<eos> I did, yeah, but... actually, I quit jazz band.<eos> It's just pointless.<eos> Oh, look!<eos> Your boyfriend's waiting for you.
Hey, really appreciate your help.<eos> Looked like you were having a good time.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> I wasn't.<eos> I saw you with Alex.
Wow, I really hope you're not one of the judges tomorrow, 'cause...<eos> Marcus, what are you doing?<eos> The costume contest. Two hundred bucks.<eos> Here... what are you doing out here?<eos> I heard you, man.
Why would I need your help...<eos> I mean, yeah, sure.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Think about it, Jensen.<eos> I have a better grade than you in French.
It's just graffiti, right?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> In honor of Halloween, your in-class essay today will analyze this quote from chapter four of Beyond Good and Evil:<eos> "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that he does not become a monster."<eos> I'm worried about you, Clay.
Wanna see?<eos> You may want to look away.<eos> I'm amazed you still shoot on film.<eos> I shoot all different ways, but film really makes you focus on the image you're creating.<eos> It's not just there for you on a screen.
So, what do you want, then?<eos> I want you to delete the photos you took.<eos> Destroy the negatives.<eos> Whatever.<eos> - Or I'm turning you in.
Good.<eos> 'Cause I'm tired of it all anyway.<eos> - Clay.<eos> - Oh, it speaks!<eos> Clay, those guys are using you.
'Cause I'm tired of it all anyway.<eos> - Clay.<eos> - Oh, it speaks!<eos> Clay, those guys are using you.<eos> They just want to shut you down.
They just want to shut you down.<eos> And whatever they're offering you, they're lying.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You lied about where you were last night.<eos> I saw you.
- Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, have fun.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I love you.
Just first.<eos> Also, why someone picked the most boring sport ever to mark our sexual milestones still kind of baffles me.<eos> My God.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I totally misjudged you.
Little light housekeeping?<eos> - Yeah, I was just going to do laundry.<eos> - You were?<eos> I don't think I've ever seen you do laundry.<eos> - I live to surprise you.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Like you said...<eos> I know what it feels like to have people judge you.<eos> And it sucks.<eos> And it helps to have a friend who doesn't judge you.
You look amazing.<eos> Good enough to make your next list?<eos> Look, I'll say, like, a million times that I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> - I love you.
We talked about this when you forced me to come tonight.<eos> Nobody can dance.<eos> Look.<eos> When people can dance at a dance, nobody likes 'em.<eos> I didn't force you to come.
I had a late night.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> Listen, Clay, what you did to Tyler, that's...<eos> I don't want to hear it, Tony.<eos> I feel you, brother, but still.
- Me and Hannah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're fun girls, right?<eos> That's what it looks like in the picture.<eos> Hate to disappoint you, Monty, but I'll tell you a secret.
'Cause...<eos> 'Cause I think she thinks I care about shit I don't care about.<eos> I was having a good time.<eos> The sharks were in the water, Jess.<eos> I pulled you into the boat.
This is amazing.<eos> I fucking love these peanut butter and cheese crackers, even though they don't taste like peanut butter or cheese.<eos> God, you would make the best soccer mom, dude.<eos> Thank you, Jess.<eos> I'm sorry I slapped you that one time.
Like just a reason to put posters up.<eos> I'm trying to help the school heal.<eos> The school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about you?
What about you?<eos> Yes, all of us.<eos> So you help the school, and cover the fact it's your fault too.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Clay, look, I know she was special to you.
just to cover the fact you're gay.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I don't get it, Courtney.<eos> It's the 21st century.<eos> How is this so hard for you?
That's not true.<eos> I don't get it, Courtney.<eos> It's the 21st century.<eos> How is this so hard for you?<eos> Was it hard for you?
We think you do.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Come on, I'll take you home.
Hey!<eos> Did you fill out a survey?<eos> Yeah, well, I figured why not.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> I've always wanted to set you up with someone.
- You were the one driving.<eos> - So?<eos> So the pedestrian has the right of way.<eos> That is the law.<eos> And you were walking when he almost hit you?
I didn't really do it.<eos> Couldn't afford it, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What, uh...<eos> What about you?
Let me guess: You two are seeing Never Say Goodbye for Valentine's Day.<eos> No, we're seeing Thirty Ways to Die.<eos> You're a classy date.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I am.<eos> What's up with you, man?
Maybe we should be blaming ourselves.<eos> I mean, if we weren't so preoccupied with the fucking store.<eos> - The store's how we survive.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> The store was to get you out of that company that was killing you to get us out of that shitty suburban wasteland.
Sweetheart, you're always going to be my valentine.<eos> It's a little creepy, don't you think?<eos> You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates or something, are you?<eos> You know what, that movie theater job...<eos> I don't think it's healthy for you.
She's nice.<eos> So you only like nice girls?<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> I just thought you were cooler than... a Sheri.<eos> I waited for you, Marcus.
Maybe not.<eos> Maybe I'm getting back to my life, and, you know, people who aren't completely fucked up.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> So you can stop following me.<eos> I'm not following you.
Just be quiet, all right?<eos> Okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I was just...<eos> I looked for you after practice.
Come on. Stop!<eos> What the fuck, Justin?<eos> - I told you, my mom...<eos> - Your mom what? Huh?<eos> It never stopped you before.
What if I was the bully, Mom?<eos> Would you want to know that?<eos> You would never be a bully.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I know you.
Too much?<eos> I thought they were beautiful.<eos> I'm sorry... for... for what I said and how I said it.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> I love you.
He do something to you?<eos> No, Dad.<eos> 'Cause, you know, if he did, I'd kill him, right?<eos> Dad.<eos> If anybody does anything to you, I'd just...
You get back here, young man!<eos> Zachy!<eos> Poor Zach!<eos> Yo, Zachy!<eos> You said something stupid, Zach... and I yelled at you.
I get it.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> I do.<eos> Believe me.<eos> This is all so easy for you.
Okay, coming.<eos> Now, please.<eos> Clay.<eos> You remember Zach's mom, Mrs. Dempsey.<eos> She stopped by because something happened to Zach's car during the game last night and... she wants to ask you if you know anything about it.
I gotta go to bio, guys.<eos> Why, so you can cry about a frog again, you fuckin' pussy?<eos> I didn't cry.<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> Maybe that kind where you think no one truly sees you.
In a minute.<eos> I'm talking to Alex.<eos> Oh, about what?<eos> About how much she misses me.<eos> About how much better of a boyfriend I am than you.
It's an easy climb.<eos> All the answers you seek are at the top of the cliff.<eos> The drag of your hand across my chest<eos> Sparks a blaze my lips cannot extinguish<eos> You, stubborn inferno You drive fast, and damn the red lights for slowing you down
Dr. Osmond is invited on behalf of Hanka Robotics.<eos> Got it. 43rd floor.<eos> Someone's contacted the president's staff.<eos> Someone's watching him.<eos> Dr. Osmond, what is it you want from us?
Please relocate to your designated safe room. Thank you for your cooperation.<eos> That's the problem with the human heart.<eos> I want to see her scan.<eos> She killed Dr. Ouelet.<eos> You're to have no further contact with her.
She likes you.<eos> I was looking for...<eos> No, come in.<eos> Yeah, come come.<eos> - Can I offer you some tea?
She was... fearless.<eos> And wild.<eos> You remind me of her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> How do I remind you of her?
Oh, trust me, he's not laughing.<eos> Nor will he ever again, for that matter.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> This group is lethal, and they don't care who or what gets in their way.<eos> I was hoping you'd be interested in headlining the next fight card.
Those, I'll have within 15 minutes.<eos> Kidding.<eos> But if you need a fifty of Purple Urkle, I am not the girl to ask.<eos> Okay, Cage, follow me.<eos> I'll introduce you to your ground team.
Show him the love!<eos> Give it up for The Hood!<eos> The good, the bad, the extreme, and the completely insane.<eos> Now, this is a team I can work with.<eos> I'll make this easy for you.
Shut up, "hero" !<eos> All right.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Okay, I actually have what you want.
- Nobody ever sees me, boss.<eos> Now, these suits control every spy satellite in the sky.<eos> But how often do these seven men all sit in the same room together?<eos> Almost never.<eos> And if you needed retinal scans, cell phone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world--
Oh, my God.<eos> Shit.<eos> You look good, ladies.<eos> Right here.<eos> I'll see you in there.
I guess you did.<eos> Sorry, I'm...<eos> I'm having an off day.<eos> Do you ever have that?<eos> Kind of day where you think that the things that come so easy to everyone else just seem so
Is what we're calling ourselves.<eos> I'm calling it "The Band."<eos> Eloise, what's your connection to the bride and groom?<eos> Right, yeah, that's the sort of question you ask back here.<eos> It's not gonna be what you want to hear.
Sorry, "If I need help"?<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you need my help?<eos> Why would I need your help?<eos> Well, you have no one.
Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> But I'm ridiculous?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Wow, the last time Jerry and I did this was the last time Jerry and I had sex.<eos> Three... Actually, over three years ago.<eos> But no one's counting.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You don't have to do this.
It might be best.<eos> If Uncle Roger finds out, he might tell my parole officer and then they'd send me back to jail or extend my time at the halfway house.<eos> I share a room with a man called Jalapeno who has a smiley face tattooed on the end of his penis so that when he pees it looks like it's vomiting sunshine.<eos> He's not as sweet as he sounds.<eos> Well, then you shouldn't do it.
You know, marriage is till death do us part.<eos> What does that mean? Does that mean you're gonna get to heaven and then you'll be single, and then do whatever you want at that point?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Nobody knows what happens after you die.<eos> You are Romeo and Juliet and we all wish you the same happy ending.
Remember that suit I was wearing earlier?<eos> The chaplain from the halfway house got me that from Goodwill.<eos> And then now I'm wearing the suit of a beautiful lady.<eos> Oh, thank you very much.<eos> Thank you. You wear it well.
I'm due around the same time you are.<eos> So?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said that I should be in the Woodside ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres because they're understaffed, apparently.<eos> Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?
And I heard you were a charmer.<eos> Guess that's an understatement, too.<eos> I apologize for Frankie.<eos> I know this beach is public and, honestly, I wish the club was, too.<eos> - But you, you're welcome anytime.
Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> I wanted to meet the new neighbor everyone is talking about.<eos> So I presume you know why I had to invite you.<eos> I am not interested in selling my properties.<eos> Why don't you think about it, okay?
When you do it, it's just some guys chasing some other guys.<eos> - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> Hey, what are you saying? You're just gonna let those guys walk?<eos> Okay, how do I explain this so that you people understand?
All the evidence...<eos> Gone.<eos> Doesn't exist.<eos> They're bad guys and they don't want us to have it.<eos> Let me try to explain this to you in a way that you people can understand.
- For Mitch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lifeguards, this is a surprise.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...
No.<eos> I haven't finished yet, Jakob.<eos> You have a very beautiful home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I do hope you'll be comfortable here.
She allowed it to flood at the beginning of the War.<eos> Times were difficult and she had her career.<eos> No more need for the stone.<eos> Jakob swims there.<eos> He'll take you there if you wish.
It seems to give him comfort.<eos> I should have been told.<eos> It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?
He is the future.<eos> Look at yourself, how beautiful you are.<eos> Give me your hands.<eos> They're strong, like hers.<eos> He will not speak to please you.
Help.<eos> Help me.<eos> Oh, God, please.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You're feeling better?
I'm just saying, it's crazy now.<eos> I saw this video about chaos in the universe.<eos> Listen. How a bird flapping its wing in south America can create a major rainstorm in New York.<eos> Like how one person can watch a pretentious video about chaos while three other people actually die of boredom.<eos> It wasn't a YouTube tutorial, so you guys wouldn't get it anyway.
Like... way bigger than this place.<eos> That's great.<eos> And how did Claire's parents feel about you and Wilson making contact like that?<eos> Or was that their idea?<eos> They must really trust you to let her stay here for the weekend.
I thought she might be interested in her family tree, and there's photos.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't want you or your book.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> Go home.<eos> I gave you a chance to raise this wonderful girl.
Was not the Prince friendly with the Mages at one time?<eos> Did he not study with Mordred himself?<eos> What are you implying?<eos> I was sent to study with him by my father as a token of diplomacy.<eos> We would only seek to remind Your Majesty that it was a Mage, Merlin, who gave you the great sword.
Listen to me, woman.<eos> I need you to do as I tell you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I need to get you and the boy away from here.<eos> And I'll join you as soon as I can.
Still so handsome, my king.<eos> Why has the water dropped?<eos> Why does the sword reveal itself now?<eos> I'm not ready, the tower is not complete.<eos> As your power increases, so, too, do the forces that will oppose you.
With every kingdom conquered, with every level added to your tower.<eos> When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.<eos> Find the boy.<eos> Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.
When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.<eos> Find the boy.<eos> Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.<eos> If you desire further help, you know the price.
Get yourself well.<eos> This wasn't your responsibility, Arthur.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> You girls have looked after me for a lot longer than I've looked after you.<eos> I owe you everything.
Slow down, new boy, before you trip up.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I'm gonna take your hands for that.<eos> Sergeant!<eos> What did I tell you about this establishment?
- They hurt Lucy.<eos> - My Lucy?<eos> - That can't happen, Jack. That can never happen, Jack.<eos> You see, she's a friend of mine.<eos> So you're gonna have to sort her out.
She's from one of the oldest families in England.<eos> She can tell us.<eos> Sire.<eos> Do the people love me?<eos> I love Your Majesty, and if I represent the people, then you have your answer.
What gave you such drive?<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> You know what happens now.<eos> You're quickly becoming a legend.<eos> Someone here to see you.
So, what happens now?<eos> You know what happens now.<eos> You're quickly becoming a legend.<eos> Someone here to see you.<eos> I think you need to see her.
Do we, Goosefat?<eos> But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.<eos> Why don't you leave him with me for a minute or two, boss?<eos> Put your ring back on, honey tits. You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.<eos> And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.
Or "The Ladies of the Knight."<eos> Have you finished?<eos> I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.<eos> I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.<eos> 'Cause you're gonna need it.
What a waste of brandy.<eos> But doesn't it make the palace burn well?<eos> 10,000 boys.<eos> All under 12 years.<eos> Young enough to forget their families, and to have no other loyalty than to you.
What's the problem? Tell him.<eos> Tell you what the problem is, mate.<eos> When you say the building's right, I know the man that owns that building.<eos> And he's not interested in letting anyone in.<eos> How do you feel about a rooftop king assassination?
- It's a trap.<eos> - How would he know?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Maggie. Maybe he knows she's working for us.<eos> I am telling you. That is not the king.
He must be met where sword meets tower.<eos> Trust the Mage.<eos> Take it.<eos> Apparently you have something to tell me.<eos> I suppose you wanna know what happened to me.
Now, you're a big man. Now, let's see you move.<eos> Evening.<eos> So, where is he?<eos> He's a day's ride from here.<eos> As soon as she's safe, he will come. He poses no threat to you without the sword.
So that he could reach the unknown.<eos> He experimented.<eos> They scare you with names.<eos> Like wickedness.<eos> You liked it; that I did what I liked.
What can I get for you?<eos> - I have a condition.<eos> - Yes'?<eos> Uh, I can't be left alone... for more than five minutes.<eos> Can I get you something else?
Even want to be?<eos> And I failed you.<eos> Or just seem like one so people will like me.<eos> ♪ 'Cause soon you will be dead ♪ my family.<eos> Is now the time to tell you that?
Some crossbreeding, hybridizing, what have you.<eos> You engineered these, David?<eos> Idle hands are the devil's workshop, Captain.<eos> Come.<eos> This is what I wanted to show you.
Dr. Henry Jekyll.<eos> There you are.<eos> This days, I specialize in immunology, perhaps.<eos> Infectious diseases perhaps.<eos> I would like to, If I may, Mr. Morton to tell you a story.
For the suffering of others.<eos> He was quite fortunate.<eos> He himself was a physician.<eos> And if evil were a pathogen, to be reasoned then there must surely be a cure.<eos> I would like to, If I may, Mr. Morton to show you something.
- I don't know.<eos> Hello?<eos> She's out!<eos> She has the dagger.<eos> We thinks she is coming to you, so are we.
Please.<eos> Please.<eos> - Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.<eos> - We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.<eos> I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.
Well, they're toast.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> What's a few worthless pennies when there's a pot of gold at the end of my rainbow?<eos> Trust me, they're goners.<eos> I'm telling you, they've been fried to a blue crisp.
Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.<eos> Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.
It's you.<eos> You're a girl.<eos> She's a girl.<eos> This is her.<eos> This is the Smurf I was telling you about.
You're coming with me.<eos> You can point him out.<eos> Hey.<eos> There's no way he's getting on a...<eos> I feel the need to remind you, my name is Clumsy.
They were right.<eos> This Gargamel character, he's real, and he's headed this way.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> See?<eos> I told you...
What?<eos> Smurfette, is that true?<eos> It's not like that.<eos> She was made to help him find Smurfs.<eos> Smurfette came here to help you.
The only reason I came to this dung heap of a casino is to find a relic to keep that monster locked away forever.<eos> Boys, boys! You're boring me.<eos> Let's play, shall we?<eos> My luck's running as hot as me naughty bits.<eos> But our next group of friends is due to arrive, so it's time to bust you out.
Rama Kushna says this will break down the walls between the planes.<eos> Even the afterlife will be affected.<eos> Yeah, it's dodgy, all right.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Meanwhile, the House will drop you wherever you'd like.
Please relax, you can sit down.<eos> No! Not you!<eos> In the position of the cat!<eos> And keep putting money, come on.<eos> You can take this.
It seems to me a simple matter.<eos> True, I thank you very much, old man.<eos> We'll get you a job in the police.<eos> Listen, I watch a television series. Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.<eos> You should see it.
So how did they look?<eos> Their features are difficult to define.<eos> They were hooded.<eos> I approached one of them, He was a 180 cm tall man.<eos> He had a tattoo around his neck I told you about it.
We maintain our weights.<eos> We are also bankrupt.<eos> Well, do not book the table all day.<eos> I have to earn my living here.<eos> Did I tell you that those who took over the bank They were carrying guns?
Williamsburg Bank - Stop payment warning.<eos> The villains.<eos> Hi Willie, how do you feel?<eos> I'm not at your best, doctor. I'm not the best.<eos> Well, I will not lie to you.
I'm not at your best, doctor. I'm not the best.<eos> Well, I will not lie to you.<eos> You can lie, I do not mind.<eos> Dialysis is no longer feasible.<eos> You will only recover with total cultivation.
As you say, but what do you want from me?<eos> We have a project, and we need help.<eos> What kind of projects?<eos> In fact, we prefer not to tell you.<eos> This is difficult for me to help you.
I agree with you.<eos> Yes!<eos> Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> "Camio" for pets - Tropical fish - and birds.<eos> Why should I help you?
People have no pity these days.<eos> Why do you think you can succeed?<eos> I do not know, we saw that we try.<eos> "I do not know, we saw that we try."<eos> You may be imprisoned for life, It is not long for you.
16 days.<eos> Improve your fitness.<eos> Good.<eos> You must have excellent physical fitness.<eos> Now I realize that you are old.
10 days.<eos> Well.<eos> Each drawer is a cashier Contains dye packs and tracking devices.<eos> Dye packages and tracking devices.<eos> They will give you one of them if they can, But they will not endanger anyone's life To do this.
And practiced as if it were the actual operation.<eos> 4 minutes 54 seconds.<eos> Now, you are sitting In the back of a police car.<eos> Your weapons exist only in anticipation For the worst scenarios.<eos> You must master the shooting, But the last thing you want Is to shoot one.
Awesome!<eos> A coherent story, Mr. Harding.<eos> Makes it easy to remember the truth.<eos> Yes, almost perfect.<eos> But let me tell you something about criminals.
Makes it easy to remember the truth.<eos> Yes, almost perfect.<eos> But let me tell you something about criminals.<eos> They always make a silly mistake. Spoil their entire scheme.<eos> I want you to go with me On a trip Hey Harding.
"The most beautiful in the world.<eos> "And I only ever made this world ugly.<eos> "Fergus needs things to be simpler.<eos> "I know how embarrassed he is about me.<eos> "I could not be the man that you both need.
Welcome to your new home.<eos> It's modest, but comfortable.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> But of course!<eos> Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle.
Pretty eyes.<eos> Proud face.<eos> Perfect canvas.<eos> Yes!<eos> I will find you something worthy of a princess.
You gave her a bedroom?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> He gave her a bedroom.<eos> This is true.<eos> But if this girl is the one who can break the spell... then maybe you could start by using dinner to charm her.
- Knick-knacks.<eos> Lightly-used houseware.<eos> Rubbish.<eos> We become rubbish.<eos> I want to help you.
But no.<eos> No, he did not.<eos> Maurice... it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others.<eos> No wonder Belle ran away.<eos> You need help, sir.
Do not be discouraged.<eos> She is the one.<eos> I wish you'd stop saying that!<eos> There is no "one."<eos> You care for her, don't you?
You will feel slightly nauseous.<eos> Don't worry, Master.<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> Just stop being so nervous and tell Belle how you feel.<eos> Because if you don't... I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your days!
Awesome, all right.<eos> Yeah, I can do this.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> It's great.<eos> You're gonna love it down there.
It's gonna run out any minute.<eos> I'm going to send down extra air tanks.<eos> But, Kate, there's a reason that I didn't do this before.<eos> Moving onto a second tank is going to increase your chance of nitrogen narcosis dramatically.<eos> You're going to need to watch each other closely to make sure that neither of you is behaving strangely or hallucinating.
We're getting there.<eos> Come on, you just need to hang on a little bit longer.<eos> - We're at 20 meters.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> Now you need to stay there for five minutes and do a decompression stop.
There are men after us.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> Go north, cross to Canada.<eos> Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.
They're gonna have to pay for damages.<eos> And she has cash.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> You should get your fat ass back in your office.<eos> You'll get your money.
It's $20,000.<eos> Here.<eos> Take us to this address.<eos> You can have $30,000 more when we get there.<eos> My friends there will give it to you.
Take us to this address.<eos> You can have $30,000 more when we get there.<eos> My friends there will give it to you.<eos> They will be waiting.<eos> They will give you anything.
My name is Gabriela López.<eos> I am a nurse.<eos> And for 10 years, I worked for Transigen Research in Mexico City.<eos> Transigen is owned by an American company.<eos> What I am about to show you is illegal... in the U.S. And Canada.
I wish I could say you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me.<eos> Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this.<eos> Uh, it was great.<eos> But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...<eos> But you need to rest, don't you?
So we just kept on running away from it.<eos> I think I finally understand you.<eos> Logan...<eos> He's fantastic.<eos> You said you only needed the girl!
There's so few of you left.<eos> Nice to meet you, too, Doc.<eos> But I really got to get on my way.<eos> No, no, don't do that.<eos> What you need is rest, and treatment.
Nice to meet you, too, Doc.<eos> But I really got to get on my way.<eos> No, no, don't do that.<eos> What you need is rest, and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.
I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.<eos> You got to check yourself into a hospital.<eos> Find out what it is!<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.
How long have I been in that bed?<eos> Two days.<eos> You've been sitting here for two days?<eos> Hey, go inside and tell everyone to get packing.<eos> You can't do that. You can't just stay here.
You can't do that. You can't just stay here.<eos> We had to wait. It was the plan.<eos> And everyone had till today to find their way here.<eos> If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you and they will kill you all.<eos> You need to get out!
Principal Tyler said we have to mow here.<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wow.<eos> Good for you.
During the Iraq War, Strickland killed them.<eos> You're dead.<eos> You're dead.<eos> Game's over, boys.<eos> I'll save you some next time.
- Dude, let's go!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Not on my watch!<eos> You guys are not allowed to leave campus.<eos> You need the proper paperwork to leave!
Yes, hi.<eos> There's a crazy guy at my high school.<eos> He's trying to beat me up.<eos> Nine-one-one is for emergencies only.<eos> If you have a problem with a bully, I need you to speak to a teacher.
We'll do a drug deal.<eos> iPhone.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Look, maybe I deal, maybe I don't.<eos> I'll tell you for a new iPhone.
So, I'm sorry, but what cut...<eos> No, I'm not sorry.<eos> All right?<eos> I think, in fact, I'm tired of always saying I'm sorry.<eos> I asked you guys a direct fucking question.
- Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.<eos> I've been waiting to fuck you up for a long time.<eos> Why?<eos> But I'll tell you for an iPhone.
You wanna see me be a dick?<eos> Hmm.<eos> So what do you teach here?<eos> I teach gym, but I'm a singer.<eos> Can I sing a song to you?
You tell me, Ms. Banks, after all this why would you wanna go back and reunite with Mr. Vargas?<eos> No.<eos> We downloaded the contents of Mr. Vargas' phone.<eos> I have almost 50 pages of Facebook messages between you and Mr. Vargas.<eos> These belong to you?
That doesn't make sense.<eos> We'll check out the story and get to the truth.<eos> I still have a few questions to ask her.<eos> Go see your kid.<eos> You have a lot to deal with.
He didn't stand a chance.<eos> The DA called.<eos> Since the evidence is circumstantial, I'm gonna have to let you go.<eos> But the investigation is ongoing.<eos> You're required to stay within a 10-mile radius and your phone stays here as evidence.
Perhaps he's atoning.<eos> He's obeyed every task asked of him, no matter how difficult or dangerous.<eos> In all that time, he's never spoken.<eos> It is not our place to ask why.<eos> You should sleep.
As regard the sanctity of the relic and the lives of my brothers, They're very much concern me.<eos> You're not blind to what kind of men these are.<eos> Yet you entrust all to their protection.<eos> You were on crusaid, brother.<eos> It cannot be so hard for you to guess. On the day of judgment, the worst of men will have the greatest of fear.
How far do you think you can get?<eos> Twenty paces at most.<eos> Or do you think you can walk on water?<eos> It doesn't have to be this way.<eos> Just give me the rock and I will let you live.
You're home and dry.<eos> OK, cheers.<eos> Obviously, there's unfinished business.<eos> Moriarty.<eos> I told you
You started out in manual labour.<eos> Don't bother being astonished.<eos> Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.<eos> I was a carpenter. Like me dad.<eos> You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.<eos> The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.<eos> I... I thought you'd done something clever.<eos> Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?<eos> I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
I... I thought you'd done something clever.<eos> Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?<eos> I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?
Who?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Right, are you coming?<eos> No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.<eos> Who told you?
I don't feel so good.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Oh, you're sweet.<eos> You have a very kind face.<eos> God will smile on you.
Mary...<eos> Don't you dare!<eos> You made a vow.<eos> You swore it.<eos> 'You've been having dreams.
We don't have a day.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Bill Randa here to see Senator Willis.<eos> Of course, Mr. Randa.<eos> I left you a message this morning about rescheduling today's appointment.
The United States is making it clear to the Communists that American troop withdrawal is directly on the release of U. S. prisoners of war.<eos> Washington notified the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese today that the withdrawal...<eos> Sir?<eos> Chapman.<eos> You need anything, sir?
Three days later, the refuel team will meet us here on the north end of the island.<eos> That may be our only safe departure window for an unknown period of time.<eos> So, tip for everybody, don't miss it, please.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.
That's the package they come in.<eos> And you?<eos> Isn't shooting a mapping mission a step down for a photojournalist?<eos> The right photo can help shape opinions.<eos> And win you a Pulitzer.
We should head north and join anyone we find.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I don't know how to answer that question right now.<eos> I don't know what that was either.<eos> All that money that they paid you? I hope you're worth it.
They come from the vents deep down.<eos> That's why Kong got so mad.<eos> Those bombs woke up a bunch of them.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> You're lucky he's out there, too, or you wouldn't have made it this far.
"East is best, west is worst!"<eos> That's why we say it!<eos> You know, southwest...<eos> We could talk about that.<eos> But you're gonna need a lot more guns if you're gonna go west.
Slivko, hang on!<eos> This thing's moving!<eos> Now, look, Colonel.<eos> You may outrank me, but I've been here a hell of a lot longer.<eos> And I'm telling you that thing that just shredded us was only the first of them.
I'm sorry, Colonel Packard.<eos> Chapman is dead.<eos> Doesn't change a thing!<eos> We're still going to that crash site.<eos> What's at that crash site that you want so badly?
And there are more of them down there.<eos> If you take away a species' natural competition, they'll proliferate out of control.<eos> Then we'll end them, too!<eos> After we bring this thing down.<eos> I can't let you do that, Colonel.
He seemed to really go for it the first time.<eos> He's losing his grip.<eos> Now, follow me, and we'll get off this rock alive.<eos> Dear Billy...<eos> I'm just trying to get home to you and your mom.
Fly ball, very deep.<eos> And the impossible dream just became the possible dream!<eos> You just gonna sit there?<eos> In the dark.<eos> You're enjoying this, right?
THERAPIST: Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up. THERAPIST:<eos> How did you sleep?
Oh, I suppose I was just looking away. (CHUCKLES)<eos> There is a difference between looking away and looking to.<eos> -I tend to notice these things.<eos> -I'm sure.<eos> Now, I am reminding you of your friend, I think.
I'm going to share something with you now.<eos> Something personal.<eos> And of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess.<eos> But you, I think, might have a need to forget.
-What name?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.<eos> And I don't know if he ever did it.<eos> (SIGHS) You've changed, you need to top up your tan and your roots are showing, you're letting yourself go.
Not sure actually.<eos> Probably just noticed something.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Of course, you don't own a car.<eos> You don't need one. Do you?
So, it must have been on display in the kitchen.<eos> (SNIFFS) Lots of different spices.<eos> You're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash.<eos> Yet, you're still cooking to impress.<eos> You're keen, and kitchen is the most public room in any house.
It's a long word.<eos> -What is?<eos> -Bollocks.<eos> Culverton Smith, all this charity work.<eos> What's in it for you?
You, me and Mr Holmes.<eos> I sent a car.<eos> It should be outside.<eos> Mr Holmes gave me an address.<eos> Well, he couldn't have given you this one... (DOORBELL RINGS)
It should be outside.<eos> Mr Holmes gave me an address.<eos> Well, he couldn't have given you this one... (DOORBELL RINGS)<eos> When you're ready.<eos> When did Sherlock give you this address?
-I know.<eos> Oh, Sherlock.<eos> Oh, Sherlock.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Thanks to you, we're, uh, we're everywhere.
Oh, you can have this back now.<eos> -Have what back?<eos> -Thanks for the hug.<eos> Oh, I sent and deleted a text.<eos> You might get a reply but I doubt it.
-His blog?<eos> -Don't you read it?<eos> -You mean my blog?<eos> Say what you like about addiction, the day is full of highlights.<eos> Oh, Mr Holmes, you're feeling better.
We have that kind of friendship.<eos> A big round of applause for Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.<eos> -(CLAPPING) Come on. -(CROWD APPLAUDING)<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.
But am I what he says I am?<eos> Is that what you're asking?<eos> -Yes. -Hmm.<eos> Well.<eos> Let me ask you this.
I apologise.<eos> (STAMMERS) I miscalculated.<eos> I forgot to factor in the traffic.<eos> Nineteen and a half minutes. (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> (DOOR OPENING) Ah, the footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two.
You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.<eos> I know you care about her deeply.<eos> I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.<eos> You care what she thinks.
We always saw it coming.<eos> -But it was fun. -(KNOCKING AT DOOR)<eos> -Come in.<eos> -WOMAN: Sir.<eos> You probably wanna see this.
Whenever I like, you know.<eos> When I get the urge.<eos> H.H. Holmes.<eos> Murder castle, but done right.<eos> I have a question for you.
So tell me, why are we doing this?<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> I wanted to hear your confession.<eos> Needed to know I was right.<eos> Why do you need to die?
You know, the secret one.<eos> Oh, that was just something...<eos> I said.<eos> I'm sure there's...<eos> How did you know about that, I didn't tell you that.
You're...<eos> Nicer.<eos> Culverton gave me Faith's original note.<eos> A mutual friend put us in touch.<eos> Did Sherlock ever tell you about the note?
The demons beneath the road, this is where we trap them.<eos> Sherrinford is more than a prison, or an asylum.<eos> It is a fortress built to keep the rest of the world safe from what is inside it.<eos> Heaven may be a fantasy for the credulous and the afraid.<eos> But I can give you a map reference for hell.
He didn't tell me you'd written me out completely.<eos> What do you mean, "rewritten"?<eos> You still don't know about Redbeard, do you?<eos> This is going to be such a good day.<eos> She smiles at you when you come home.
His family.<eos> You're going to cry.<eos> It's okay if you cry.<eos> I don't need to cry.<eos> I can help you cry.
- I remember Redbeard.<eos> - Do you, now?<eos> Tell me what I don't know.<eos> Touch the glass.<eos> I put my trust in you.
Sherlock.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Touch the glass and I'll tell you the truth.<eos> I'll touch it too if you're scared.<eos> I can fix her for you and then I'll give you her straight back.
That's good.<eos> People leave their bodies to science.<eos> I think cannibals would be so much more grateful.<eos> Isn't that sweet?<eos> Maybe you should sit down.
So are you.<eos> I'll spend the rest of my life telling myself that.<eos> Please...<eos> God.<eos> I know that you are scared, but you should also be very proud.
So what we're doing is actually trying to save a little girl.<eos> Today we have to be soldiers, Mycroft.<eos> Soldiers.<eos> And that means to hell with what happens to us.<eos> Your priorities do you credit.
Please continue with your deductions.<eos> I'm now focussing on the difference to your mental capacity a specified consequence can make.<eos> Why should we bother?<eos> What if we're disinclined to play your games, little sister?<eos> I have, if you remember, provided you with some motivation.
Oh, no!<eos> That's awful!<eos> Horrible!<eos> What is it?<eos> It's simpler if I just show you.
Tim, there they are!<eos> Mom, Dad!<eos> Imagine a puppy that never grows up... never gets old.<eos> A puppy that stays a puppy forever.<eos> I give you the only thing you'll ever love... the Forever Puppy!
Mom, Dad... I'm coming!<eos> Atta boy!<eos> Go, Tim! Go, go!<eos> Launch initiated.<eos> I'm launching my Forever Puppies, and there's nothing you can do about it!
But they're worth thousands of units apiece... which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.<eos> Careful what you say around these folks.<eos> They're easily offended.<eos> The cost of transgression is death.<eos> We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.
Hey!<eos> - I've had it with you!<eos> - No!<eos> Back up! Someone followed you through the jump point.<eos> Set me free, you'll need my help.
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?<eos> You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta... I have a proposition for you.
You maniac.<eos> The whole ship's gonna blow.<eos> Not the whole ship.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I am sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship.
You are wasting a lot of time here!<eos> We're all gonna die.<eos> Rear thrusters are out again!<eos> We're done for without that generator!<eos> Guardians... perhaps it will provide you solace... that your deaths are not without purpose.
You know, it's a shame... that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu to bring us all together again.<eos> But I think he'd be proud knowing that we are back as a team.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Dope.<eos> I miss you guys so much!
Welcome to my grandfather's old factory.<eos> Now, I know, we all know, that Grandpa Mirando was a terrible man.<eos> We know of the atrocities he committed in this space.<eos> We know these walls are stained with the blood of fine working men.<eos> But today, I reclaim this space... to tell you a beautiful story.
Ever since she was little, I've always been fascinated with Okja and her monthly health reports and data.<eos> I've only known her through numbers and graphs and pictures, but seeing her here today, and studying her with my own eyes and hands, she amazes me even more.<eos> This is it. The moment of mutual trust between Mirando's very own Dr. Johnny and the esteemed local farmer.<eos> She's truly exceptional.<eos> How did you do it?
Use the phone.<eos> Hey, could you come to the lobby?<eos> No, some kid is here.<eos> She wants me to open the door.<eos> Please state the name you are looking for.
There it is!<eos> Hello, Lucy!<eos> Lucy, we love you!<eos> No.<eos> I'm here to introduce you to a real superstar.
She is.<eos> And that's our best super pig.<eos> Well, what's the hiccup?<eos> Why is it still alive?<eos> Why you want to kill Okja?
No, ma'am.<eos> One is sick, and the other one is fishing.<eos> It could make a difference.<eos> It's about insurance.<eos> I'm not sure I will be able to help you.
Um, my goodness.<eos> Um, yes, I know this.<eos> You know, I know this.<eos> It was a funny thing.<eos> I couldn't remember my address when I called you on the phone.
We need your help.<eos> Did Harvey send you?<eos> Mr. Fillmore, we need a key for Ruth Davenport's apartment.<eos> We're trying to find Barney's brother.<eos> Well, who told you I was going to see Chip?
That's enough.<eos> You sure you don't want to take this?<eos> Mike said you're fishing buddies.<eos> I've known him since high school.<eos> He might tell you more than he'd tell me.
Now... I can only give you a short visit.
Is there anything we can do to help?<eos> Call for help.<eos> Call who?<eos> Who?<eos> Well, we'd certainly like to help you.
Military.<eos> Thank you for meeting us.<eos> Let's get going.<eos> We're not anywhere near Mount Rushmore.<eos> I brought a picture for you.
That should do it.<eos> I hope you're not sore at me for running off.<eos> It sure was stupid of me to get caught up like I did.<eos> Thanks for getting me out of there.<eos> How'd you do this?
Thank you.<eos> Thank you, officer.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> There's an envelope here for you.
He's indisposed.<eos> Did you get our envelope?<eos> Yes, I did, thank you very much.<eos> Now, you listen to me.<eos> How much does he owe you?
Did you get our envelope?<eos> Yes, I did, thank you very much.<eos> Now, you listen to me.<eos> How much does he owe you?<eos> Did he tell you?
An interesting fellow.<eos> You Jones?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now let's get to it.<eos> Explain to me exactly what Dougie did to make him owe you money.
And we are shit on enough.<eos> And we are certainly not gonna be shit on by the likes of you.<eos> Nevertheless, lady...<eos> So here's what we're gonna do.<eos> Without my knowledge, my husband came to you for a loan of $20,000.
That is my first, last, and only offer to you.<eos> What kind of world are we living in where people can behave like this?<eos> Treat other people this way without any compassion or feeling for their suffering?<eos> We are living in a dark, dark age, and you are part of the problem.<eos> Now, I suggest you take a good, long look at yourselves because I never want to see either of you again.
Yeah, you do that, Chad.<eos> Filling out paperwork's no fun, fellows. I know that, but, gotta be done.<eos> And when you finish...<eos> That motherfucking piece of shit.<eos> I want you to handle that...
I can't talk to you about this here.<eos> I told you.<eos> Please go away.<eos> But if you weren't driving, I need to know who was.<eos> I'll tell you.
Detective.<eos> Thanks for seeing me.<eos> This shouldn't take long.<eos> You submitted a set of fingerprints a few days ago to our database, and we need to verify the source.<eos> Well, I can show them to you, but our search was blocked.
A few days ago.<eos> Few... days ago.<eos> Is there a reason why you didn't report your car missing?<eos> Reason?<eos> Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.
Should we talk to him again?<eos> It's like talking to a dog.<eos> And she does all the barking.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Brought you a fresh one, Mr. Jones.
It's like talking to a dog.<eos> And she does all the barking.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Brought you a fresh one, Mr. Jones.<eos> Can I get you one too, ma'am?
It's a fucking morgue!<eos> This way.<eos> Fuckin' pansies.<eos> Detective Macklay handled the case when it came in.<eos> He'll brief you on background.
I was in my home.<eos> I was in my home.<eos> Did the Major kill Ruth?<eos> No, there were so many people there.<eos> You have to believe me.
Certainly, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No worries.<eos> Anything exciting happen when I was gone?<eos> You have four pieces of mail.
There you are!<eos> Alfred! I am so sorry.<eos> I have incredible reflexes.<eos> No, it's all my fault, sir.<eos> I should have known better than to sneak up on you like that.
Master Bruce, you live on an island, figuratively and literally.<eos> Yeah. I love it.<eos> You can't spend the rest of your life alone, dressed in black, listening to angry music, and staying up all night.<eos> Yes, I can, 'cause I'm Batman.<eos> But don't you think it's time you finally faced your greatest fear?
I'm starting to get an idea, monkey face.<eos> Bruce, over here!<eos> Okay, shutterbugs.<eos> Look alive, here we go.<eos> I'm gonna give you three poses. You ready?
- Yeah.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Wow.<eos> Are you looking for more of a base model orphan
Because all I want is to get adopted, so I can finally stop being alone.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> And we wish him well on his South African jungle safari!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, to introduce you to his exciting new replacement.
Along with Batman, of course.<eos> Whoo! Let's hear it for Batman!<eos> Who I wish was here right now.<eos> Oh, I'm sure he's listening.<eos> I'd like to ask all of you a question.
Are you fed up with crime?<eos> - Uh-huh. We're all tired of crime.<eos> - Yeah, we're sick of it.<eos> Then let's talk about real improvements that will end the cycle of crime.<eos> I've got a four-point pilot program that I'd love to share with you.
He's been living here for the past week.<eos> Hello, table!<eos> And I must say, I've grown rather fond of the young lad.<eos> Hello, secret camera.<eos> You should get to know him.
I'm with you, Grandpa!<eos> Get off my Padre!<eos> Unhand him, you animatronic fiends.<eos> What are you two doing here?<eos> I told you to stay in the cockpit.
Yeah.<eos> - One minute, please.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I used to ride my skateboard around in here.<eos> Someone will be right out to see you.
I came to see your father.<eos> Look, but I think you're in the wrong place.<eos> No, this is definitely the right place.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm calling security.<eos> - They can help you.
I'm gonna show you...<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I guess I need to talk to you, then.<eos> What you need is to get out of my office.
look...<eos> I don't know the guy.<eos> But you've met him?<eos> He came around here once.<eos> Did he... hurt you... in any way?
Move your damn car!<eos> How about this?<eos> simply say the man... acted unusually... made you feel uncomfortable.<eos> I just don't think...<eos> I'll give you some time to think about it.
Joy Meachum?<eos> This is Dr. Paul Edmonds from the Birch Psychiatric Hospital.<eos> I'm treating the patient your family admitted.<eos> how can I help you?<eos> I'm wondering if I can ask you an odd question.
Me again. but I was hoping we could make a trade.<eos> yeah?<eos> What kind of trade?<eos> If you sign these... then...<eos> I will leave you this.
So... maybe he is as crazy as you say he is.<eos> Let's get him out of here!<eos> Well done!<eos> All right!<eos> How do you think of this guy, huh?
All right!<eos> How do you think of this guy, huh?<eos> How about some respect?<eos> Well done!<eos> Now, I told you it was gonna be a great night, didn't I?
I like it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you all for coming out on this momentous occasion as Rand Enterprises welcomes Danny Rand to his rightful place in the company that bears his name.<eos> Danny will continue the legacy of his father, Wendell, and join us in guiding this great company into the future.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Danny Rand.
- What?<eos> You have no idea how bad it is.<eos> It's like we have goddamn Tarzan walking around the place, fresh from the jungle.<eos> How so?<eos> I shouldn't be telling you this, but we have this drug that we've spent years working on.
No.<eos> You wanted to kidnap Joy to broker a new deal.<eos> Maybe we should use you to broker a new deal.<eos> Is this why you walk into my place?<eos> I'm here to let you know it's not within your best interests to come near Joy ever again.
My people said she had a run-in with some criminals.<eos> She's lucky she has such a talented bodyguard.<eos> She's fine now.<eos> Could this good and faithful servant ask for one more favor?<eos> What do you want?
I wanna tell you about this great new product.
I'm afraid you're looking for something that isn't there.<eos> We'll be hiring our own team to do the looking.<eos> That's your prerogative.<eos> We have nothing to hide.<eos> But if you do manage to establish a connection to the emissions from that plant... our company still followed the law.
- No.<eos> But I, uh... I do need to know when the next shipment arrives at the Red Hook Pier.<eos> - Could you tell me that?<eos> - No.<eos> But if you like, I can call Sarah Galvin in Transport and have her bring that information to you.
Sorry, do I know you?<eos> I read about that drug thing you did in the paper.<eos> You have the power to change things at this company.<eos> That's why I...<eos> I wanted to show you this.
I hurt it.<eos> Looks like it.<eos> Car door.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> Why don't you have a seat?
Looks like it.<eos> Car door.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> Why don't you have a seat?<eos> We'll be with you as soon as we can.
You've refused to sell the Hand's heroin.<eos> They've taken your pier.<eos> Butchered your men.<eos> They've given you two choices, serve or die.<eos> I'm here to give you a third.
That's exactly what we offered Danny.<eos> Ironic, isn't it?<eos> Enjoy this while you can.<eos> When I'm on the other side of this table, I guarantee you won't be smiling.<eos> You have no one to blame but each other.
Would you believe me if I did?<eos> Stay right there, boy.<eos> Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.<eos> I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.
That is nasty.<eos> That's better.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, much better.<eos> Are you uncomfortable?
You don't look well.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> Hey. How are you?<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> You're not allowed here anymore.
- I...<eos> - Never mind.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> It's exhausting, isn't it?<eos> You know, I'm not above shoving a sweaty sock in your mouth to shut you up.
I... I've been telling them about you.<eos> This is the guy that whacked that kid with a pole.<eos> It's, uh... not my greatest moment.<eos> Well, I thought it was awesome.<eos> So... you like it here?
Sorry to interrupt your dinner, but, please eat.<eos> I... I don't mind.<eos> My name is Bakuto.<eos> I'll be taking over from Madame Gao.<eos> Ah. Danny told you about me.
Okay, you mean, like... a small thing, like a komodo dragon?<eos> Or like Pete's Dragon?<eos> I don't... I don't know who Pete is.<eos> But think infinite.<eos> So do you have to kill it?
That's a nice name.<eos> You... you know who I am, how much I'm worth, right?<eos> - Of course, Mr. Meachum.<eos> - Call me Ward.<eos> I will pay you whatever you earn in a year, if you unstrap me and get me out of here.
Once we leave, then she'll get medical attention.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then let's go.<eos> I'm sorry, but we have to do this.<eos> You don't need those.
Hey, it's okay.<eos> Hey, get your ass over here and help us.<eos> Those people upstairs are pit of vipers.<eos> You should thank me for getting you away from them.<eos> What use do you have for the Iron Fist?
But maybe we shouldn't contact her directly.<eos> We don't know where the DEA's eyes are.<eos> We need a messenger.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was asked to give you something.
We need a messenger.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was asked to give you something.<eos> A client needs you.<eos> $5 will get you exactly two seconds of my time.
I need you to stand and fire into the air.<eos> - We need to get a lock on your position.<eos> - What the fuck? This ain't ranger school.<eos> The fucking shooter will get a fucking lock on my position.<eos> Well, I can't help you unless I know your location.
My bad.<eos> These belong to you.<eos> Mr. Lucas?<eos> Mr. Cage?<eos> - Which do you prefer?
Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a bus to catch.<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh, just one last thing.<eos> The law firm of Hogarth, Chao Benowitzisat yourdisposal.<eos> In case you need help starting over.
There are a lot of things that the Hand kept from me.<eos> They're not the kind of problem that's gonna go away easily, but we can figure this out.<eos> Together.<eos> What do they want in New York?<eos> You'll need to disrobe.
What do they want in New York?<eos> You'll need to disrobe.<eos> Jewelry and all.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> The results of the last round of tests were explained to you, yes?
- He's been different?<eos> Secretive?<eos> - Maybe even a little nervous?<eos> - And it's not like him.<eos> Because he's cheating on you, okay?
Nothing to be ashamed about.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> - You don't know him like I do.<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> But you came to me and I'm giving you my professional opinion.
It happens all the time.<eos> - You don't know him like I do.<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> But you came to me and I'm giving you my professional opinion.<eos> You need a divorce lawyer.
Is there anything that you can do?<eos> You know, I think it's my grandfather and he's senile and he might be trying to get a hold of me.<eos> Actually, I have a missing person's report.<eos> I have the number right in front of me.<eos> I can read it to you if you want.
Purgatory is a place for the dead, Matthew, not the living.<eos> There's nothing wrong with letting people go.<eos> She'll find her peace.<eos> I pray you find yours as well.<eos> You always liked this spot.
- We'll put it back.<eos> Hurry, this way!<eos> Come on.<eos> Run!<eos> Don't you run from me... you looter sons of bitches!
- Rumor is, she ain't scared of much.<eos> Well, she ain't met you.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> So the guy who rented this room...<eos> I already told you, I didn't see him.
- Okay?<eos> I'm looking into this company, but they've been transferring assets from one corporation to the next.<eos> Like, they're changing their name, shell company stuff.<eos> Yet, I have no idea what it is they actually do.<eos> Oh, so what do you need from me?
Like, they're changing their name, shell company stuff.<eos> Yet, I have no idea what it is they actually do.<eos> Oh, so what do you need from me?<eos> The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.<eos> Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.
Yet, I have no idea what it is they actually do.<eos> Oh, so what do you need from me?<eos> The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.<eos> Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.<eos> And you'll need an appointment.
They wouldn't have found those explosives if it weren't for you.<eos> You actually saved lives today.<eos> Well, save yourself some time, Hogarth.<eos> Stop worrying about me.<eos> This only looks like plastic, but I'm telling you it's solid gold.
What?<eos> There's nowhere to go.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> They'll... they'll hurt me.<eos> To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.
To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.<eos> I was just trying to stop them.<eos> - They're gonna take down the city.<eos> - Who?<eos> I can't help you if you won't tell me who.
Talk.<eos> Couple months ago, we were planning a vacation.<eos> He wanted to get away.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> I came to you.. for answers. And now...
What do you mean?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> None of this sounds like John.<eos> He wasn't this kind of person.<eos> And there's nothing I'm not telling you.
- We did lots of business.<eos> - Yeah, they call themselves the Hand.<eos> - You need help spelling that?<eos> - Look, whatever you heard, it's true.<eos> I know you're scared, but we can't leave until you help us.
Um... Midland Circle Financial.<eos> I remember that name.<eos> Ward gave us a list of places to cease doing business with.<eos> It must be the Hand.<eos> I'll get you the address from the directory.
- Gorgeous, isn't it? - Mmm.<eos> Like all of our projects, it was built with sustainability in mind.<eos> - Yeah, I am super into that.<eos> - I'm glad, Ms. Asher.<eos> Now, why don't you tell me what you envisioned for your company's...
- Only doing what's needed. - Oh.<eos> You know, you're the opposite from my son.<eos> He can't admit when he's done something wrong.<eos> You can't admit when you done something right.<eos> Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.
- Not like this.<eos> Right this way.<eos> My name is Danny Rand.<eos> Last year, you illegally transferred $243 million worth of assets through my family's company.<eos> And you thought you got away with it.
This... is one shitty excuse for a hideout.<eos> Stick.<eos> Matty.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> The guy that's gonna help you save New York.
He's retired.<eos> You know what?<eos> We are not talking about this, all right?<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> But I think you two have got a lot to learn from each other.
- No, I just...<eos> I just wanted to say, you might be right.<eos> So whatever your husband got into, it just keeps getting weirder and weirder.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> - I can't say, but I'm gonna work on getting you guys some protection.
I just want an answer.<eos> I might even let them go free.<eos> You walk with her... and I'll take you out myself.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Mr. Rand... you need to think this through.
I might even let them go free.<eos> You walk with her... and I'll take you out myself.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Mr. Rand... you need to think this through.<eos> And you need to leave.
Not by force.<eos> You know nothing of the power of the Hand.<eos> You are mice who fell into a well.<eos> Believe me, this will drown you.<eos> What do you want with our city?
It always has.<eos> - What do you mean, "always"?<eos> - I traced it back to 1820.<eos> - That's all?<eos> - Why do you want Danny Rand?
- What do you mean, "always"?<eos> - I traced it back to 1820.<eos> - That's all?<eos> - Why do you want Danny Rand?<eos> Nothing you can do can make me serve you.
Nothing you can do can make me serve you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Do I understand?<eos> You are the dumbest Iron Fist yet.<eos> Tell me what you want with me.
- Danny, we're all on the same side here.<eos> - It doesn't feel like it.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> - Don't do this.<eos> Hey, you guys seriously need to back off.
What?<eos> No. We had enough to worry about.<eos> What aren't you telling us?<eos> I was with Elektra.<eos> It was a mistake not telling you guys about her.
The one your girlfriend tried to kill.<eos> He designed the place.<eos> What, you think he knows how Danny ties into this?<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> Well, I guess you two better get going.
But that's still a lot.<eos> - Lexi, right?<eos> - My mom isn't here.<eos> You have any idea when she'll be back?<eos> What do you want?
He'd sit at the piano sometimes, but he wouldn't play.<eos> Not like he used to.<eos> He didn't do anything like he used to.<eos> I missed him.<eos> Long before my mom came to you.
This war... it isn't over.<eos> Well, the thing about war is... it only works if both sides believe they're the good guys.<eos> You fight to defeat us.<eos> We fight to get back what was once ours.<eos> And what is it that you want?
Kill Luke Cage.<eos> Kill Jessica Jones.<eos> And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.<eos> But let me remind you, I neutralized our enemies.
Kill Jessica Jones.<eos> And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.<eos> But let me remind you, I neutralized our enemies.<eos> I brought you the Iron Fist.
If this falls back on you... it's gonna make your life miserable.<eos> Look, uh... I wanna help.<eos> I can't say much, apart from the fact that he is in way over his head.<eos> And we need to help him.<eos> Mr. Murdock, all due respect, you need to start worrying about helping yourself.
I want three units scouring a ten-block radius.<eos> They can't be far.<eos> And, Detective... I thought Luke was smarter than this.<eos> I thought...<eos> If you want a chance to save yourself here, you need to reconsider how well you know these vigilantes. That clear?
Evacuate everything in a two-block radius.<eos> And get ESU here.<eos> - We got a door to breach.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'll let you know when the teams are assembled.
How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick.<eos> Shall I announce you?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Stay.<eos> Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.
Exactly.<eos> Rules. Without them, we'd live with the animals.<eos> Do you board?<eos> I'm sorry to say sir, but this facility does not.<eos> I however, would be willing to accept the responsibility, should you wish.
Is the sommelier in? I have never known him not to be.<eos> Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> I'd like a tasting.<eos> I am quite excited to show you something. First...
Do enjoy your party.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Are you enjoying the party?<eos> Mr. Akoni.<eos> Are you enjoying the festivities?
You, and you with me.<eos> You go.<eos> Welcome to Reflections of the Soul at the New Modern NYC.<eos> Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.<eos> We hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights into your understanding of the world, and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection into the nature of self.
Oh, Christ, does every single one of these kids have the flu?<eos> Seems like it.<eos> All right, now I bet you guys are wondering what's going on - with this racing suit, huh?
I got about a baker's dozen of cameras. They're just sitting there.<eos> I say we set them up in your mom's home and find out what's really going on in there. - That could work.<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> - Great idea.<eos> - You don't think that's creepy?
I mean, they're going at it like the greats.<eos> Like Abbott and Costello, Tom and Jerry. - It's amazing.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Buzz off!<eos> All right, well, you know, if you guys are looking for a comedy troupe that beats the shit out of each other for laughs, there's nobody better than the Three Stooges.
- I don't.<eos> Cut to a close-up.<eos> And she's constantly looking directly into the camera somehow.<eos> - She's repulsive.<eos> - She is repulsive. You know what? I'm gonna go over there and-and I'm gonna show you.
Oh, I just puked on my dick!<eos> Rock and roll. All right, cool.<eos> - Well, uh...<eos> - Rock and roll, yeah. - Yeah.<eos> - We just got you some merch. Um...
- Well, uh...<eos> - Rock and roll, yeah. - Yeah.<eos> - We just got you some merch. Um...<eos> Yeah, water bottle.<eos> For when you feel better, and... - Um... yeah,
That's 'cause you're a stupid ring girl.<eos> - It couldn't be any simpler.<eos> - Yeah, look, take it easy.<eos> Basically, we're trying to expand our product to the world of UFC women, and look, uh, ring girls are the perfect combo.<eos> - Really. I mean, honestly, ladies, you could afford to lose a few pounds, maybe in this area...
He didn't just snap it. He broke the thing's head clean off.<eos> It was gruesome.<eos> I still have nightmares about it.<eos> And I'm old.<eos> She told you what?
She told you what?<eos> No, no, no, no. No, no.<eos> Look... that crow was injured, and I was simply putting it out of its misery, while, yes, testing the tensile strength of a crow's neck.<eos> Well, yes, there was another crow, but that's because I simply couldn't believe that a crow's neck could be that weak.<eos> Well, yes, there was a third crow, and a fourth, if you must know, but who likes crows?
Now, you're not gay?<eos> Obviously not.<eos> Okay.<eos> Interesting.<eos> So, Mr. Reynolds, um, simply, was just trying to disrespect you.
- Uh, no...<eos> Imagine you're riding up a steep hill, and you've already been working super hard, and you're sweating and you're tired.<eos> What do you do when you're tired? You want to rest.<eos> You go to sit down, it pushes you right back up in your workout.<eos> The Ass Pounder 4000 will never let you rest. - Yeah, see?
- Yeah. - Cool crate.<eos> - It's a big box.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it really isn't though. It's just trash.<eos> It's trash that somebody left behind.<eos> Hey, but if it's mystery you want, you know, what about the mystery of the yuck puddle?
Why won't it harden?<eos> It shifts.<eos> I've seen it shift. He's seen it shift.<eos> You see, we shouldn't have an amorphous shifting blob in the bar, you know?<eos> So why don't you and Mac go solve that goddamn mystery by cleaning it up, you know?
Matthew Mara.<eos> Did you just do a flip off that truck? Yes, sir.<eos> That is how dedicated I am to keeping your business.<eos> Now, look, I know you have your reservations, but I'm asking you... give us a second chance.<eos> I'm not giving you a second chance.
You don't know how lovely you are<eos> - Good morning, Mr Hyde.<eos> - Anna, please, just Jack.<eos> Tea right? Weak, black.<eos> I'm supposed to get this for you but thank you!
Um..<eos> Well, Liz mentioned something temporary.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, why don't you fill in for Jack temporarily?
- Excuse us.<eos> - Surely.<eos> She's fantastic.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Mia..<eos> I wanna thank you all for coming here this evening.
...You however are certified<eos> Sorry to interrupt, Mia wants to taste one of your killer cocktails.<eos> Oh, coming right up.<eos> Nice to see you hid it on our little talk.<eos> What makes you think that I would ever listen to you?
How did you get to the police station tonight?<eos> Walk?<eos> Drive?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't have anything to be sorry about.
- A friend, or a relative?<eos> - Did you not hear me?<eos> OK.<eos> I don't want anyone knowing.<eos> Trish, you need support.
- Did you not hear me?<eos> OK.<eos> I don't want anyone knowing.<eos> Trish, you need support.<eos> You can't be on your own.
Trish, you need support.<eos> You can't be on your own.<eos> But I am.<eos> I just am.<eos> I shouldn't really do this, but, erm I'm gonna give you my number, OK.
You can't be on your own.<eos> But I am.<eos> I just am.<eos> I shouldn't really do this, but, erm I'm gonna give you my number, OK.<eos> Any time you wanna talk, you need anything, you give me a ring, all right?
We will need you to come in and make a full statement,<eos> - soon as you're ready. - OK.<eos> You'll hear from your ISVA soon and you've got your panic alarm.<eos> The police can be here quickly.<eos> No-one will mind you using it.
Erm... yeah, sorry.<eos> Erm...<eos> Yes, you will need to speak to my husband Jim, he did the invites.<eos> His garage is in town.<eos> I'll give you his number.
Well, I always knew, but then you had me... take a DNA test.<eos> I would offer the test results as presumptive evidence that Mr. Pollard... is the father and natural guardian of the minor.<eos> As well as an affidavit... from Mr. Pollard nominating... Mrs. Adler, the maternal grandmother, as the legal guardian of the minor.<eos> No objections.<eos> Mr. Pollard... has Mrs. Adler offered you any monetary reward... or employment for coming forward today?
Who came out and told everybody?<eos> I did.<eos> Can we stay for another?<eos> Mrs. Adler, in your earlier testimony, here today... you've painted a pretty dim picture of your own son.<eos> Don't you think?
A drunk idiot attacked me and I defended myself.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> Did you spend the night in jail?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You are in way over your head here.
Which I guess is obvious... since we're on the Intercoastal.<eos> Added this desk, so she could do her homework.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And this would be her room.<eos> So, while I'm trying to sell you on the house... and us... I just don't want you to think that we're completely insensitive... to what you're feeling.
Yeah, listen.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Frank, let me tell you, she was so helpful with the tutors.<eos> - Mary was so distant. - Hey!<eos> Look, we know what you're up against.
I'll be outside.<eos> Let me know what you wanna do.<eos> You've reached the Department of Mathematics at MIT.<eos> If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at any time.<eos> If you wish to speak to an operator... please stay on the line and someone will be with you as soon as possible.
They fight alongside their soldiers.<eos> They die with them on the battlefield!<eos> That's enough!<eos> My apologies.<eos> You should be ashamed.
That's enough!<eos> My apologies.<eos> You should be ashamed.<eos> My apologies.<eos> You should be ashamed.
You should be ashamed.<eos> My apologies.<eos> You should be ashamed.<eos> Diana... Diana!<eos> All of you should be ashamed!
As well as Dr. Maru.<eos> Actually the Gala could be perfect cover.<eos> - Captain Trevor.<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> You're under no circumstances to go anywhere near that gala tomorrow night.
- Captain Trevor.<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> You're under no circumstances to go anywhere near that gala tomorrow night.<eos> You'll be jeopardizing everything we've worked for.<eos> You can not compromise the armistice.
- Nobody?<eos> Not here or in your country of origin?<eos> The family support center has been set up at a hotel nearby.<eos> You'll have access to medical and psychological treatments and social services.<eos> That's also where you'll be updated on any news that comes in.
You'll have access to medical and psychological treatments and social services.<eos> That's also where you'll be updated on any news that comes in.<eos> If you'd rather be alone, you can do that there, too.<eos> No.<eos> I would recommend that you go to the family support center tomorrow, when you're feeling stronger.
Mr. Melnyk?<eos> My name is Tessa Corbett, I'm a journalist.<eos> I know you're in there.<eos> I don't want to bother you, I just came 'cause I wanted to share some of my articles with you.<eos> I'm writing a book about the accident and I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Okay?<eos> Yeah, for Samuel.<eos> That's the Springfield armory.<eos> Eleven plus one rounds, $674.<eos> Three, two-inch Berettas, ten plus one rounds, will run you about $570.
Yeah, for Samuel.<eos> That's the Springfield armory.<eos> Eleven plus one rounds, $674.<eos> Three, two-inch Berettas, ten plus one rounds, will run you about $570.<eos> Now, the two Smith Wesson models we have, the black MP, eight plus one rounds, will run you about $560 and the Airweight 38 special, it's got more of a classic air and a stainless steel finish,
If it's okay with you guys, I'd like to get straight to the point,<eos> I don't wanna keep you waiting any longer.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> So we still don't have a trial date.<eos> That will take a while but you know management will provide all the legal coverage you need, so.
My... my family.<eos> I can't just..<eos> We can't just up and move, you know?<eos> This may potentially be the safest thing to do for you and your family.<eos> You really have to consider what we're presenting to you right now.
James.<eos> Mr. Melnyk, this is the framework agreement we're proposing to the families.<eos> I would like to just... it's a friendly agreement between you and the airline in which you agree to withdraw all claims and lawsuits from the company.<eos> Now, in exchange, the company will take care of your family's funeral expenses and any medical or psychological treatment that may have been deemed necessary to date.<eos> The company also agrees to pay you damages in the amount of
You'll be able to benefit from those and other advantages.<eos> These are details that you should read carefully because they are clearly explained in the contract.<eos> I would like for someone to say that they're sorry for killing my family.<eos> I want the company to apologize.<eos> Mr. Melnyk, let me explain this to you a little more simply.
Still feeling pensive?<eos> Well, today let's try to focus on the positive feelings you've had this week.<eos> Come... I was really hoping I could just get a refill on my prescription.<eos> On those moments when you feel at ease... Maybe doing something you find satisfying....<eos> It may seem silly, but makes you feel good.
I lost my wife and my in-laws in the accident.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I read the story in the papers about your daughter's necklace.<eos> I thought it was nice that they used it as inspiration for the monument.<eos> Do you like it?
Have you gotten through it?<eos> - Ever been to Cancun?<eos> - No.<eos> It's a wonderful place and in the northern tip of the Yucatan peninsula.<eos> Um, is that something you guys seem like you're interested in?
I'm coming to town, is there somewhere we could meet?<eos> The book is finished.I have to send it in next week for lay-out, but if you really wanted to say anything it would be an honor.<eos> That's why I don't wanna ask you anything specific.<eos> I'm not talking about an interview or photographs.<eos> I just wanna give you a chance to say something.
No one.<eos> Pat Dealbert.<eos> Pat Dealbert?<eos> His name is Pat Dealbert now.<eos> Where are you going?
I think we just need to...<eos> To take it slow.<eos> You know, I think it's better.<eos> Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> I made the bed for you guys so I'm gonna sleep on the sofa tonight.
But it isn't.<eos> You have family members here?<eos> No.<eos> My father isn't buried here.<eos> You know, when I was following you, I didn't know exactly when to approach you, where'd be the best place.
_<eos> We live on the one place where you are guaranteed a quiet life.
The safest place on earth.<eos> In Fortitude, you have to be able to provide for yourself.<eos> Everyone has got a job, so there is no crime.<eos> Everybody is always happy.<eos> While you are here, you will need your own rifle and a hat.
This is your last fucking chance, give me the keys.<eos> For Christ's sake, put it down!<eos> I'm your governor.<eos> Am I not?<eos> I understand you need fuel.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.<eos> Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.<eos> And guess what.<eos> They' re both standing in front of me right now.<eos> So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.<eos> Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.<eos> I know you.<eos> And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.<eos> Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.<eos> What more could you possibly want?<eos> To give you something back.
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.<eos> I'm askin' a real question right now.<eos> Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds or The Dark Knight?<eos> To be honest, I like both of you.<eos> But just before we get into all of that, let me ask you one question.
No need.<eos> Well...<eos> Ciphers still on the loose.<eos> There's been some reports she's in Athens, but she won't be nuking any cities anytime soon.<eos> Thanks to you guys.
Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.<eos> And you will hang. For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg?<eos> I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.<eos> - You needed a brother.
Now it's time for you to do some bleeding good among your own.<eos> Me and my wife have looked after that boy for ten years with not one penny from you and nothing but threats from the mad old bastard you just put in the ground.<eos> Now you're back, I want payment.<eos> If it wasn't for us, that kid would be sucking cocks in St. Giles.<eos> Mr. Ibbotson, I've been meaning to pay you a visit.
- How much?<eos> - Enough.<eos> Good day.<eos> You don't even ask how your own blood fares.<eos> If you don't approve of me steadying my nerves with Madeira, then perhaps you should consult the directory of the Royal College of Physicians, see you know many others of them will agree to carry out this kind of work.
- Indeed.<eos> Let us not pretend...<eos> - No, do not pretend.<eos> I wonder if Mr. Appleby might be allowed to finish a sentence?<eos> We are told that in your father's will, you were bequeathed a piece of territory which lies just here.
What consequences?<eos> What consequences?<eos> Perhaps we should adjourn.<eos> Mr. Delaney...<eos> I'll give you one last chance to behave like a loyal subject of His Majesty and the lawful crown of England.
Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Hmm...<eos> Please.<eos> The balance of your father's mind was, well, unstable... but you have no such excuse.<eos> Now, why don't you just open the fucking envelope?
And will you be including that in your account to the Royal Commission?<eos> No.<eos> Luckily, I'm not being tried for that today.<eos> They serve good hock to traitors.<eos> Perhaps you'll be served the same.
Is this the extent of your ambition?<eos> It is in return for my silence, and for Godfrey to burn his account.<eos> No.<eos> I can't deliver that.<eos> Then you had better get used to the taste.
Who on earth is that?<eos> Countess?<eos> I thought you'd be alone.<eos> Well, as you can see, I am not.<eos> What do you want?
And also a certain feminine product, which you may prefer to discuss in private.<eos> I don't recall.<eos> Pixie, perhaps as well as medicine for your poor, worn-out chuff, the lady may have something to repair a faulty memory.<eos> Do you have a beauty product which would bag me an admiral?<eos> I have a product which would allow you to accommodate an entire fleet, without discomfort, admiral and rear admiral.
Those who use it will do almost anything for it, when their supply is exhausted.<eos> The name of the powder is Colonnade.<eos> And you have samples?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Perhaps I could show you in person how to apply it for best advantage?
I will squash your balls myself and make you eat the paste.<eos> You promised to give me those names.<eos> Did I?<eos> I must've lied.<eos> I will tell you one thing, though.
But the difference between Delaney and me is that I always make sure I have one last ace to play.<eos> Good day, Mr Chichester.<eos> I swear... this will not stand.<eos> God!<eos> You look like you need laudanum.
You have a ship?<eos> This laudanum is diluted somewhat with burdock, so you can continue to function.<eos> But I doubt you'd be able to steer a ship to America.<eos> You have people with you?<eos> Mr Delaney, I'm sure that you're probably expecting me to hand you your letter of safe passage.
You have people with you?<eos> Mr Delaney, I'm sure that you're probably expecting me to hand you your letter of safe passage.<eos> But, I'm afraid, it isn't going to be that simple.<eos> Nothing in this war between cousins is simple.<eos> There's just a small hurdle that you have to leap over first.
Come on!<eos> Load her up!<eos> Where is Delaney?<eos> Busy.<eos> She is now under the flag of the Honourable East India, so you will have no hindrance.
Why are you following me?<eos> To save your life.<eos> Mistress Helga gave information to a man with a silver tooth.<eos> I spy on her.<eos> From the conversation, he meant to do you harm, and the mistress knew it.
A man who called himself Colonay.<eos> Not yet in Hell?<eos> No, Ponta Delgada and the Azores.<eos> Similar.<eos> You should know the wound in the shoulder is no longer used by us as a signal. No?
The border between the United States and Canada is being drawn up in a very... quiet... closed room, no?<eos> You see, I have something of great value to your nation.<eos> Something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> And what?<eos> You seek protection?
Hurry up!<eos> At least he's sorting his father's debts.<eos> What I'm owed isn't in that pile of coins... since I'm not listed on the final division notice.<eos> You see? The old skinflint didn't even pay for his whores!<eos> And what exactly is it that my father owed you?
Other than letters?<eos> Well, what kind of documents?<eos> Well, proof will come from pen and ink.<eos> I will dispatch an enquiry to the Trinity Church in Dublin and request a personal account from the priest. Until then,<eos> I suggest you two refrain from any further contact with each other.
The assignation they were trying to make her sign gave Nootka to the Crown and only the Crown.<eos> Fucking snakes!<eos> If we didn't have so much shit on the Duke of Richmond,<eos> - they would have had her.<eos> - Who tipped you off?
Now, finally, here, I'm introducing chlorine gas to a solution of sal ammoniac.<eos> Ladies, beware, these are corrosive substances.<eos> They will ravage your dresses.<eos> So, the combination produces a yellow, oily fluid that will explode with sunlight or heat or mere motion.<eos> In order to show you most simply and safely its explosive effect, I use this instrument... to transfer... very carefully... just a few drops.
If you've got any questions about chemistry, then read that.<eos> I already did.<eos> I was very impressed.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I have a use for you.
But the consequence for you was worth the risk to me, yes?<eos> You see me as I am.<eos> All of those that I gather are damned.<eos> It's just part of a company policy of mine.<eos> Perhaps now you will understand why it is better for you to leave and let this business run its course.
How many humans live here?<eos> Three.<eos> - Where are they, by the way?<eos> - I sent them away this morning.<eos> Do you own this farm?
Now, if you will excuse me, ladies.<eos> Come on.<eos> Posy for the lady?<eos> Much obliged, kind sir.<eos> For you.
I want to meet with the Embassy in Paris.<eos> No.<eos> You assign to the United States, where someone will kill you.<eos> This time, we will be more artful.<eos> You will need to be.
You fu... you fucked her!<eos> He fucked her.<eos> He fucked her!<eos> He fu...<eos> You need some air.
Can we please get on with it?<eos> This fog is pestilential.<eos> Where is your second?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> The code requires you have a second.
I don't have one.<eos> Let's just say this woman is yours and she is late.<eos> Could you not find a boat like a normal person?<eos> I was bored and I've never seen a man shot before.<eos> Why don't you go and stand over there by the fire and keep warm?
For champagne?<eos> Or potatoes?<eos> Or both?<eos> So, how did it resolve itself?<eos> Did you both see sense?
I've asked the Weasel for some sailcloth to cover it against the rain.<eos> I've already breakfasted on a little of it.<eos> The quality's exceptional.<eos> Almost as good as the bat shit distillations of Burma.<eos> Why don't you just fix the roof?
Steady as we go.<eos> Good boy.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> The letters your father wrote to you are beautiful.
Good boy.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> The letters your father wrote to you are beautiful.<eos> How would you know that?
A tannery.<eos> A windmill.<eos> And hidden just behind that, a cattle farm with a water wheel.<eos> No organisation is watertight, James.<eos> You're just lucky it's our pot the informant pissed in and not the Company's.
No, no, no. "Full and willing cooperation."<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And then... I will tell you which papers to burn.<eos> Sir.<eos> There is a Mr. Delaney to see you, madam.
Accept what?<eos> Nootka landing ground in return for the tea trade to Canton.<eos> And safe passage through your blockade.<eos> But you must assign the treaty before you leave London.<eos> Well, that would require me to trust you.
We need some more coal for my fireplace. It's freezing!<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> This is the Delaney household.<eos> We have no warmth here.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley is not a suitable man for you.
And on its own, it is harmless.<eos> But when it is added to the sulphur and charcoal in our vats, it is anything but.<eos> Think of it as like adding a baby to a marriage.<eos> All was ordered and calm and now there is this thing that demands attention.<eos> Stops you sleeping, belches, farts, screams... and she's going to make this whole process louder and wilder, more insane, more impractical... and the only thing that will stop this entire enterprise from erupting in a giant explosion the size of Mauritius is this... and dedication.
That golden age.<eos> You want to know where he is?<eos> My dear, the whole of London wants to know where he is.<eos> His Majesty's Government wants to know where he is.<eos> I'm afraid we cannot help you.
Watching what comes and goes.<eos> Raise her up to your heavens and set her free by your light.<eos> Amen.<eos> I know you didn't do it.<eos> And how would you know that?
I received a message that you wished to speak with me.<eos> After you have eluded me so long.<eos> May I sit?<eos> I need to know why you're seeking me?<eos> First, I must tell you that I already know many things about you.
I know this, too.<eos> What do you want?<eos> As far as I can ascertain... you are the only surviving member of the crew of the Cornwallis.<eos> I want you to write an account, naming Sir Stuart Strange as the man who organised the loading of the Cornwallis with slaves... bound for a sugar plantation in Jumby Bay, Antigua... owned by his own brother.<eos> In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.
On direct instruction of James Delaney himself, sir.<eos> And you witnessed this, too?<eos> - She will have to say it, sir.<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> You'll have to say it out loud.
- Yes, yes.<eos> You'll have to say it out loud.<eos> You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination.<eos> Yes, I did, sir.<eos> And you were both being paid for your services by James Keziah Delaney himself?
Well, as loyal subjects of the Crown, we feel it is our duty to expose disloyalty and treason in time of war.<eos> - However...<eos> - Go on.<eos> ...the ladies who are to give the crucial evidence against James Delaney are now in the protective custody of the East India Company.<eos> Their whereabouts are... known to just a handful of trusted directors so, to ensure their safe delivery, we humbly suggest you assign a monopoly.
And an element of strategy.<eos> So get to it.<eos> Arrest the bastard.<eos> Thank you, madam.<eos> Mr. Chichester, this is the man I told you about...
And sealed.<eos> And if required, he will stand up in court?<eos> Let the good Lord be my witness...<eos> I will yell out the truth to the four winds.<eos> Until that happy resolution, I bid you good day, gentlemen.
Oh, here he comes.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Me.<eos> Right.<eos> I suggest that you leave very quickly... and very, very quietly... or you can stay... for the extreme violence that is coming your way.
Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.<eos> Although, for some tasks, he will need helpers with strong hands.<eos> And together, they will walk you along a tightrope.<eos> A line between life... and death.<eos> We need the names of all the people who helped you manufacture the gunpowder... move the gunpowder, but most pressingly of all, we need the names of all the members of the Society of Secret Correspondence that you have dealt with.
Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> You should know that I have testimony from a reliable witness...
Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I have something of great value to your nation, something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> Someone has been brought to London to try and kill me, and I will need your eyes and ears from now on.<eos> You used to straighten your skirts and march away like nothing had ever happened.<eos> And what exactly is it that my father owed you?
I underestimated Delaney.<eos> Look at this.<eos> - You have 104 spies in London... and we have 202.<eos> - You knew?<eos> So who the hell do you have in Thoyt's chambers?
Then know this.<eos> Delaney will as easily sell Nootka to the Americans if they offer him the same monopoly.<eos> Now, there, the King and the Company may be able to find our common cause.<eos> My spies tell me there is a widow.<eos> My Lady, I am so sore to have to bring you this news.
No, because there are wicked men out there who would wish me dead.<eos> However, neither the East India or the King will kill you because of your will.<eos> The only people who would benefit from your death are the Americans, but you're already in negotiations with the Americans, so surely once the boards have gone we could put curtains up.<eos> You seem to know such a lot for somebody who knows so very little.<eos> You should know that I am a very dangerous man.

The piece of paper you just burnt also states that, as Horace Delaney's widow,<eos> I also own half the trading post at Nootka Sound and I believe Nootka is of value to you and to the King.<eos> So, as you can see, it's a very simple swap, Mr. Delaney.<eos> Your half of the house for my half of a piece of land that I have no interest in or use for.<eos> I also have a trunk full of your father's belongings, letters to you, to your father from your mother.
To think I have this wicked... wicked thing beneath me and it's my lifelong duty to punish her.<eos> It exhausts us both.<eos> A beautiful exhaustion.<eos> And in the morning I read the Gazette and she eats her toast... like a sweet little bird.<eos> I didn't come to sell you insurance, Mr. Delaney.
Do you drink wine?<eos> - Not before a performance.<eos> - There'll be no performance tonight.<eos> There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.
But you could allow your cunt to swallow the work of an honest man, who will promise to buy you the finest china... if you just agree to stop fucking bleeding.<eos> - Oranges, madam.<eos> - She doesn't want fucking oranges!<eos> We all know what she wants.<eos> How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
You were following me?<eos> You have many suitors among the rabble, I imagine, and I, for the longest time, have been one of them.<eos> I am a lady of particular tastes.<eos> An admirer from the darkness and from on high.<eos> I'm sorry... but you'll have to remain in the darkness.
But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.<eos> He will pay to be in the room with us while we play.<eos> - Then you were given the wrong name.
Very well.<eos> Your manager sold me the costume you wore when you played The Little Princess.<eos> You will wear it for me tonight.<eos> There appears to have been a misunderstanding.<eos> Somebody has given you the wrong name.
Candie, let...<eos> Dougie, have a seat.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll, uh, examine you standing up.<eos> Anyway, as I told you, Dr. Ben, it started last week when Dougie disappeared for three days.
- Candie? - Hmm?<eos> What were you talking about to him out there on the floor?<eos> Candie!<eos> Oh... that we're in the version layer, that it's gonna be hot and smoggy tomorrow, and I told him that we are so lucky to have air-conditioning cooling our casino.<eos> Okay. Mr. Insurance Man, what do you want?
Oh... that we're in the version layer, that it's gonna be hot and smoggy tomorrow, and I told him that we are so lucky to have air-conditioning cooling our casino.<eos> Okay. Mr. Insurance Man, what do you want?<eos> Mr. Mitchum.<eos> Mr. Mitchum.<eos> I'm here to tell you something that you will want to know about.
Mr. Mitchum.<eos> I'm here to tell you something that you will want to know about.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Your new hotel, which burned badly down to the ground a few months back, was ruled arson by an official investigation.<eos> Now, I may have sold you your policy, sirs, but I didn't handle the claim.
- What's that?<eos> Your new hotel, which burned badly down to the ground a few months back, was ruled arson by an official investigation.<eos> Now, I may have sold you your policy, sirs, but I didn't handle the claim.<eos> It was done by Douglas Jones, who works at our firm.<eos> - I thought you should know from me, unofficially, on my own that this Mr. Jones did everything in his power to prevent you gentlemen from getting the insurance relief from the loss you suffered that I believe to this day you deserved.

- Yeah?<eos> - Is that it?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You have an enemy in Douglas Jones.<eos> That's what I came to tell you.
He saved my life.<eos> Sure saved us a lot too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, mr. Jackpots.<eos> I'm so thankful I got A chance to say thank you again.
He's all yours, boss.<eos> Can we talk about this?<eos> Aah!<eos> Now we can talk.<eos> Do you need any money?
Phil, Tase her!<eos> Get her out of here.<eos> We want to report a cop!<eos> Take a seat, ma'am.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
You have done so much for me.<eos> Well, I love your... Your window display.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Do you really like it?
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Do you really like it?<eos> It... it's magnificent.<eos> And those drapes are completely silent.<eos> This is my tribute to you, Dr. Amp.
- Do you really like it?<eos> It... it's magnificent.<eos> And those drapes are completely silent.<eos> This is my tribute to you, Dr. Amp.<eos> Thanks to you, I am really starting to shovel myself out of the shit!
He's, uh, in the doctor's care.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> I'll give him your regards, sir.<eos> What've you got for me, Frank?<eos> Uh, I just thought you should know this.
Uh, I just thought you should know this.<eos> Uh, it's gonna sound strange.<eos> Something's been found, something Deputy Chief Hawk found.<eos> Missing pages from a certain Laura Palmer's diary that could indicate two Coopers.<eos> I don't know any more than this, but, uh, I-I just thought you should know it.

Uh, maybe it means something to you.<eos> Thank you very much, Frank.<eos> Although I can't comment on this information, I want you to know I really appreciate it.<eos> All right, Director Cole, uh, I understand.<eos> Andallthebest to you and all the best to Harry.
We're estranged.<eos> I hate her, so...<eos> Tammy, get the Las Vegas office on the line.<eos> LasVegasoffice,please.<eos> Uh, I have Director Gordon Cole on the line for you, sir.
- I can't stay for very long.<eos> I have that meeting with Jen Gerstenblatt.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Good girl.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.
Yeah, but she'll find out the truth soon enough.<eos> You know, it's, it's important to me.<eos> You're giving me peace of mind.<eos> Just knowing that Emily's gonna be taken care of.<eos> Like I promised you I will always be here for her.
I'll, be right back.<eos> - Hadley, Willa.<eos> - Hi, Miss Fields.<eos> Hi.<eos> Well, can I talk to you, ladies?
This has to be a joke.<eos> Right?<eos> I mean, our friend's getting married today.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Officer Maple, if she does try and contact us. II promise we'll let you know immediately.
Right?<eos> I mean, our friend's getting married today.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Officer Maple, if she does try and contact us. II promise we'll let you know immediately.<eos> You should know she's probably not alone.
This can't be happening.<eos> Officer Maple, if she does try and contact us. II promise we'll let you know immediately.<eos> You should know she's probably not alone.<eos> She needed help to get out.<eos> So you and your friends should stay vigilant.
The car is here.<eos> Well, you're gonna send us a ton of photos, right?<eos> And don't forget to take pictures of all of your hotel rooms before you mess it up with all your stuff.<eos> There's this new group chat app that we should all be on.<eos> I'll text it to you.
- Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Guys.<eos> I understand how you hard.
- This is the transfer of genetic material.<eos> In short, you do it is now never snimesh!<eos> I realized!<eos> You Che arrived here.<eos> Che are you doing here?
You zadolbal already clever.<eos> (Sounds spetssignal)<eos> Dear.<eos> Respected.<eos> I appeal to you.
Right now I will go.<eos> Well.<eos> Che wanted to say?<eos> Wait, well.<eos> Yes, just missed by you.
First you have to get a pass.<eos> Because without it, we're not gonna get.<eos> And find out where it is, this is your figovina.<eos> He's in a meeting.<eos> He calls you a free.
- And then we have shot down.<eos> - Yes.<eos> If anyone tries to get on the ship,<eos> Saul will destroy him.<eos> We can not allow our technology to hit you.
And Willy Dunne.<eos> - Right this way, boss.<eos> Yeah. - Willy was Glen's body man.<eos> Put your things in here.<eos> I'll let you spread them out how you like.
- You sure?<eos> - You go.<eos> - I thought you were finished.<eos> - No.<eos> To that end... now is probably a good time to share with you where the president hopes that assessment might land.
But this machine seems only to have this wire.<eos> I can't find where to plug it into the television.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. President.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know a whole lot about technology.<eos> I'm sure I could have somebody come by and take a look at it for you.
But perhaps you yourself are the new direction.<eos> New strong personality.<eos> New energy.<eos> New commitment.<eos> Well, General, I wish you the best of luck.
- Roger that.<eos> - God damn it.<eos> God damn it.<eos> There it is.<eos> What did I tell you?
His mind's on a golf cart somewhere, halfway down the fairway.<eos> He doesn't have the constitution for the hard stuff anymore.<eos> He's obviously in the wrong fucking job!<eos> That thing's off, right?<eos> I'm sorry to have to tell you this, General, but we're gonna sit on your report until after the Afghan elections.
I know it is but as I'm sure you know, an election here is a fragile thing.<eos> It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.<eos> No, I told you no more troops, Glen.<eos> Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.<eos> Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.
General, please spare me the "all due respect" stuff.<eos> It's really giving me the fucking creeps.<eos> I think, I think we all understand your frustration, Glen, but these elections have to run smoothly.<eos> We need a legitimate partner in power here.<eos> You need a legitimate partner here.
I think, I think we all understand your frustration, Glen, but these elections have to run smoothly.<eos> We need a legitimate partner in power here.<eos> You need a legitimate partner here.<eos> So we just have to sit tight.<eos> Why don't you do that SNORPP thing you did in Iraq?
I got the White House sitting on my report till after these elections get done.<eos> I can't do anything until the president approves my recommendations.<eos> And now you're telling me that's not gonna be until after another goddamn election?<eos> !<eos> You need a legitimate partner here, Glen.
Do you know what I'm saying?<eos> Traction?<eos> We got ourselves a president who appears not to be aware of the fact that the United States is at war right now, and he's that war's commander in chief.<eos> - I gotta get me some traction.<eos> - You need cut through.
- Yeah, I think we're getting close.<eos> - Oh, that's exciting.<eos> I don't wanna interrupt.<eos> I mean, I know you have your own world of questions to ask in there.<eos> You might wanna think about asking the general... how much face time he's had with the president since taking over the position.
Then we can jet across to Copenhagen at zero six.<eos> The president's gonna be on the tarmac at 8:30.<eos> Well, you're the keeper of my schedule, Cory.<eos> You tell me if I can do it.<eos> Okay, yeah, we can have you back in Paris early afternoon, depending on how much time you two need. And I can shift your morning meetings.
I'm the United States defense attaché here in Paris.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> This is my wife, Jeanie.<eos> Pleased to meet you, Jeanie.<eos> Are you enjoying your time here in Paris?
But I've been wandering around by myself while Glen's at meetings, and... oh, my, it's... it's lovely.<eos> General, I thought it went very well at the École Militaire today.<eos> I didn't get the opportunity to introduce myself there.<eos> But there were some very interesting people there today.<eos> If you'd like, I'd be very happy to give you a rundown of the who's who if you get a little window in your schedule while...
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.<eos> General.<eos> Sir.<eos> Swell.<eos> I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
Your own vice president has advocated a much smaller and simpler counterterrorism approach to incapacitate what is estimated to be little more than 100 al-Qaeda fighters that still remain in Afghanistan to refocus on what it was that started this war in the first place.<eos> Your analysis of the insurgency there suggests to me there is no monolithic Taliban.<eos> You are spread over the entire country.<eos> You are fighting 1,000 separate battles with locals whose principal ideological position would seem to be simply that they don't want foreign soldiers in their village.<eos> And that, General, you must know, is a war you will never win.
Without your active involvement, our presence here will never be anything more than a foreign occupation.<eos> This is your war.<eos> For your country.<eos> Your people.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, sir... but you need to behave like a leader.
They've known we're coming for weeks.<eos> So don't be under any illusion.<eos> This will get ugly.<eos> We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.
- Yeah.<eos> Okay, give me one of those.<eos> My name is General Glen McMahon.<eos> On behalf of the coalition forces, I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.<eos> I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.
But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.<eos> And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.<eos> Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.<eos> The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.<eos> The Taliban aren't here to help you.
And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.<eos> Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.<eos> The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.<eos> The Taliban aren't here to help you.<eos> Only we can help you.
Kelsey, gotta ask, is this the worst disadvantage so far?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No question.<eos> God will smite you for that.<eos> So, Gilbert, how's it going for you?
So, Gilbert, how's it going for you?<eos> Oh, it's a festival of joy and light in here.<eos> Having a good time, are you?<eos> How could I not, being stuck in a box with young Kathy Bates?<eos> All right, we'll check back in with you soon.
No!<eos> - No, you can't do that.<eos> - No, you can't...<eos> - you need the boat bit.<eos> Yes, I realize it was in your original draft, but, darling, sometimes you have to let the words go.
Oh, you two are so old-school.<eos> Comedies don't have to be funny anymore.<eos> Some of the biggest comedies aren't even remotely funny.<eos> Audiences don't need your little jokes and your laughs and your humor anymore.<eos> You just have to end after 30 minutes.
Page 20?<eos> Page 20?<eos> Oh, look, it's TV's Joey.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> I keep calling you guys. You're not picking up.
- You knew Andy Warhol?<eos> - Yeah, why can't I know Andy Warhol?<eos> Blondie introduced us.<eos> All right, that... just... just stop it.<eos> I'm telling you, you guys are the least interesting people I know.
Hang on, hang on.<eos> Let me turn on my feed.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Don't worry, none of it has gone out.<eos> So long as I stay off Danika's camera, nobody can see it, but I thought you should know.
Shouldn't we make sure the lady's okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Keep your seat belt on.<eos> - Are you okay? - Yes.
Damn it!<eos> Keep your seat belt on.<eos> - Are you okay? - Yes.<eos> I think I rolled my ankle.<eos> You should put some ice on it.
You're beautiful, hugely successful, financially independent, on the school committee, the... the board of the aquarium.<eos> - Right? - Yeah.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> And to make matters even worse... you're beyond sexy.<eos> Women. You all want to be the envy of your friends, but God forbid you garner too much of it.
Oh, you didn't notice?<eos> Every time we go down there, I'd just, like, scare them away.<eos> - How?<eos> - With my... burping superpower.<eos> - Do you want to know a secret?
It's all good. No, I would.<eos> Do you have any clients?<eos> Can I ask what brought you here?<eos> The schools are great, to build a better life for her son.<eos> - That's all you'll get.
He has something.<eos> Stiles, is this you?<eos> Alright, just remember this - Canaan.<eos> We're comin' to get you.<eos> No, you can't.
Stiles, is this you?<eos> Alright, just remember this - Canaan.<eos> We're comin' to get you.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> You won't be able to find me.
And we like him.<eos> But we need to help our town.<eos> People are disappearing, uh, leaving, I mean leaving.<eos> You could really help us.<eos> No one can help you.
People are disappearing, uh, leaving, I mean leaving.<eos> You could really help us.<eos> No one can help you.<eos> If they want to leave, they're going to leave.<eos> They'll go, and they'll go, and there won't be anything you can do about it.
They've been riding the storm and taking souls since long before I was born.<eos> Yeah, we won't survive them.<eos> Not without your help.<eos> Kira entrusted me with her sword while she's with the Skinwalkers.<eos> And now, I'm trusting you because I believe she would want me to.
Okay. Send him back.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I can help.<eos> I know about the Wild Hunt from the Dread Doctors.<eos> I also know about things I'm betting you don't.
Theo saved Scott.<eos> Remember?<eos> He can still hear you.<eos> Then he can hear me say he needs to shut up so we can figure out how to fight the Ghost Riders.<eos> You don't need to figure it out.
What the hell is a Lowenmensch?<eos> It's part-wolf, part-lion.<eos> He was a part of the Ahnenerbe,<eos> Himmler's personal project to use the Occult to win the war.<eos> Hauptmann, you should stay away.
I can't.<eos> This was a bad idea.<eos> It's not a bad idea.<eos> It is a terrible idea.<eos> I told you where the transformer is.
We are the Wild Hunt.<eos> Those who hunt with us hunt forever.<eos> That clarifies things.<eos> What do we have to do to get everyone back?<eos> Do you want something from us?
This says "start," so, maybe it's not that complicated.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> So, optimistically, how much time do you think we need to do this?<eos> As much time as Liam and Stilinski can buy us.<eos> Look, I'm not saying you have to like him.
That is great.<eos> But if we're the only ones left in Beacon Hills, then we need each other.<eos> Which means you need me out of this cell.<eos> We need to trust you.<eos> Then you need to get realistic, because trust is not important right now.
If I let you out and I see any behavior that I find remotely suspicious,<eos> I'll put so many bullets in your head, God won't even recognize you.<eos> I'm an atheist.<eos> Fire at will.<eos> You're gonna need to be a bit closer than that, Sheriff.
What are you talking about...<eos> Tell me about my son.<eos> Tell me one thing about Stiles that you remember.<eos> Just one.<eos> You swipe that key card, I'll tell you anything you want.
I hate this.<eos> Malia.<eos> I gotta leave for a few, okay?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Whatever's happening, it's worse for you guys.
It's me.<eos> Dorothy<eos> Dorothy ..<eos> Dorothy ..<eos> - You need help.
Yes, an unfortunate name.<eos> An unfortunate prison.<eos> It wasn't my creation.<eos> We can't unlock it, if that's what you want.<eos> So whatever magic she used to open it, I give you my permission to re-create it.
Um, you look...<eos> Like Mistress of the Eastern Wood.<eos> Most Merciful and Stern.<eos> Yeah, can we just settle this weather?<eos> Surely old-Mistress showed you the lake!
What did she look like?<eos> My mother?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Good.<eos> Can I help you find something?
There is no doubt that The Beast Forever will reveal itself as a hailstorm of fire.<eos> It will blaze through Oz until it has obliterated that which fell from the sky and everything else that stands in its path.<eos> And only your Eternal Warriors can stop it.<eos> An army of stone which fire cannot consume.<eos> On behalf of the High Council, we advise you to animate your Stone Giants immediately.
- Couldn't determine the weather, could you?<eos> - and determine if this is magic or...<eos> I'll go myself.<eos> Well, I should at least be by your side.<eos> You still need counsel.
You may.<eos> Always.<eos> I thought you were displeased with me.<eos> I was.<eos> Was I wrong to challenge you?
- Before scar tissue forms.<eos> - Please, stop.<eos> - You have to keep moving!<eos> - I don't want this!<eos> You should have left me in the street.
I'll come with you.<eos> I would like to see Sylvie's home.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> I'd offer you some food, but I'm afraid we don't have much.
- Morning, Frank.<eos> - Morning, Dr. Chapman.<eos> Will you call me Karen, for goodness sake?<eos> You've busted your butt all these years to earn that title.<eos> I'm gonna continue to address you like that.
It was Dorothy's.<eos> When she gets to Glinda's, she'll stop this war before it even starts.<eos> You place too much trust in her.<eos> Yet she trusts me even more.<eos> But she gave you the only weapon that could've killed the witch.
Nearly all of them.<eos> She sent them to die against the beast forever.<eos> And I helped her.<eos> I killed them too.<eos> I won't help either of you repeat the past.
I need someone to see me now.<eos> Wait.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I do see you.<eos> I've lied to you...
Wait.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I do see you.<eos> I've lied to you...<eos> All of you...
No, no.<eos> Ah, sir.<eos> Would you like to take in the great lawn, perhaps?<eos> Or go for a carriage ride?<eos> I'll give you a moment to decide.
Her highness is very much occupied with the arrangements for her father's funeral and the arrival of the armaments.<eos> Guns, in the modern vernacular.<eos> Ordered by the Wizaed, built by some of our finest craftspeople.<eos> I'm sure the Queen can spare a moment.<eos> Sir, you can't go in there.
I am suggesting that we help each other by an alliance of pirates and slaves, bring down Nassau, maybe bring it all down.<eos> My name is Woodes Rogers, and I am the next governor of New Providence Island.<eos> Spain... what did you have to promise them?
Judge Adams and his... court, we have all seen in recent weeks since their arrival that their appetites are significant.<eos> Shall I expect to be reimbursed for the costs of this?<eos> You stood in my office and said you wished us to be friends.<eos> As my friend, I would think you would be eager to do your part to see our common enterprise survive its current crisis.<eos> I beg your pardon, my Lord, but have I not proved to you my friendship?
At great personal risk to myself and my interests, I made enemies of the pirates in order to ensure your success.<eos> Made enemies of them?<eos> They've been my enemies for some time now. Are you saying that they haven't been yours?<eos> May I suggest...<eos> I thank you for your aid today.
They've been my enemies for some time now. Are you saying that they haven't been yours?<eos> May I suggest...<eos> I thank you for your aid today.<eos> It is, I believe, to be expected, today, tomorrow, every day till the war is won.<eos> I serve you best, my Lord, when I am seen by the street as having some independence from you, as your silent partner, I am able...
Yeah!<eos> Make a wish.<eos> Make a wish.<eos> - Happy birthday! - Hope you had fun!<eos> - Bye! Thank you!
- May... may I be heard?<eos> - There is one scene, and one scene only, where two of the puppets simulate sex.<eos> Yeah, well, naked puppets don't bother me.<eos> Fucking puppets, on the other hand, well, it's vulgar.<eos> Even if it were, you'd still have to prove that it has no legal, artistic, or literary value.
Good news, we're letting you out early.<eos> Bad news, your wife's dead.<eos> I'm sorry. It's our policy.<eos> I can't change your ticket from two days from now till today.<eos> If you have to change your departure date from Friday to today, it's a $200 change fee plus the difference in fare.
I can't change your ticket from two days from now till today.<eos> If you have to change your departure date from Friday to today, it's a $200 change fee plus the difference in fare.<eos> - $200.<eos> - Plus the difference in fare.<eos> Do you have to travel today?
- Don't worry anymore.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - And mind your bag.<eos> - Watch your step.<eos> - Thakn you. Mm-hmm.
Oh, and by the way, did I mention the bonuses?<eos> Outstanding benefits.<eos> I'll even throw in a pension if you'd like, and I can tell you what the fuck a pension is.<eos> Hell, by the end of your tenure, you could be the next king of America.<eos> And I told you, I got a job.
- Now you go.<eos> - Now you go.<eos> - Yeah, now you go!<eos> - You go now! - Yes, come on, go now!<eos> No, I want you to go.
- Uh-uh.<eos> - What's so good about her?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ah, she gives a great GFE, according to Brett.<eos> What's with this girlfriend experience, you guys? GFE?
- Yeah.<eos> Ah, she gives a great GFE, according to Brett.<eos> What's with this girlfriend experience, you guys? GFE?<eos> You don't want to pay for that!<eos> What, you paying for someone to make you tidy up, clean the dishes, do your hair-- that's bullshit!
You don't want to pay for that!<eos> What, you paying for someone to make you tidy up, clean the dishes, do your hair-- that's bullshit!<eos> Go home-- get it for free!<eos> Oh.<eos> Would you like your second coffee now?
OK. Good.<eos> Well, does he like seafood?<eos> I could do a paella.<eos> Have you seen my new paella dish?<eos> Dad, I really don't care, I mean, I just really want you to like him.
- There's my little girl.<eos> Come here.<eos> How are you?<eos> - I love you too.<eos> I've missed you.
I'm wrong.<eos> See?<eos> Does he have an off button?<eos> This is exhausting.<eos> No. I want to give you a tour.
Don't waste your strength.<eos> Don't try to fight it.<eos> You can't stop the inevitable.<eos> And who knows?<eos> Maybe one day you will enjoy being members of the family.
Who he really is?<eos> She long dead.<eos> She wouldn't give it up for Johannes up there so he threw her off the boat.<eos> Did you know your momma couldn't swim?<eos> You all need to work on that.
This is how we get stereotypes.<eos> Anansi...<eos> You want help?<eos> Fine.<eos> Let me tell you a story.
For a fucking purple shirt?<eos> The only good news is the tobacco your grandkids are gonna farm for free is gonna give a shitload of these white motherfuckers cancer.<eos> And I ain't even started yet.<eos> A hundred years later.<eos> You're fucked.
I'm gonna tell you something and you're gonna want to hurt me, but what I say has gotta be said.<eos> So I want you to consider my words very carefully and refrain from knocking my teeth out.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - Word on the street is your wife died sucking your best friend's cock.<eos> And you, sir, are only obligated to feel bad about that for so long.
- Everything is a huge lie!<eos> - Fixing the pipes...<eos> Why doesn't anyone come?<eos> If they took the bodies, they could've told us.<eos> Why would they tell you?
- Clothes, books...<eos> - The Koran, the fucker!<eos> You never know, some are Spanish.<eos> - They're not all Arabs.<eos> - Let me show you.
No, no, we're not starting all this again. Please!<eos> The best way to avoid suspicion is to put shit on someone else.<eos> - What the...?<eos> - Hold it!<eos> - I'll report you.
Bastards didn't give me anything.<eos> We were going to meet n a little "boutique" hotel, to have a drink, eh?<eos> But my battery ran out and you know the rest.<eos> People badmouth the machines, but they don't deceive you.<eos> You just have to persevere.
We're not all the same.<eos> We helped you get down!<eos> - Because it was good for you!<eos> - She'll shoot them all up.<eos> No, I won't. But I'm not giving them to you.
No, I hid them.<eos> God damn...<eos> Please!<eos> Shit, that's heavy.<eos> I said I didn't trust you people, and in the end I was right.
- Hey!<eos> Hi!<eos> You look good!<eos> Good health!<eos> Yeah, I am good, and... and thank you.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> - That too fast?<eos> - No. Row. I don't know what my brother told you, but, we're not looking for card players.
Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> - That too fast?<eos> - No. Row. I don't know what my brother told you, but, we're not looking for card players.<eos> What are you looking for?
In one version, you convince your son to have us bond his additional bail, and your story goes on as before.<eos> You're the Employer Of the Year, loved by her community.<eos> In the other version, you fuck us over, we sue you and your son in civil for what happened the other night.<eos> And at trial, everyone in the tri-state area finds out that you told your son to shoot my granddaughter, and that will be just the beginning.<eos> We will drag you through a hellscape of public humiliation until you either decide to try to start over somewhere else or you make the smart decision... and sit in your garage listening to some soothing light jazz on the car radio
Isn't it healthy to, like, move on?<eos> Okay, everyone, thank you.<eos> Seriously, I know, it's tragic, but I don't want to keep being reminded all the time.<eos> It's depressing.<eos> We're never done with it, Mr. Pratters, which is why it's important to know the signs that someone you care for might need help.
Keep your mouth shut, got it?<eos> - Jess...<eos> - Back off, Clay!<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> When Jessica has something on her mind, she lets you know.
Thank you for making the time.<eos> I-I, uh...<eos> I know how busy you are.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> What can I do for you?
At home, Hannah was...<eos> Well, I mean... sometimes she would run around the house singing show tunes in funny voices and showering us with hugs, and other times... she was quiet and moody and it'd be hard to get a word out of her.<eos> - But nothing she did told us she was... capable of...<eos> I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop you right there, Mrs. Baker.<eos> I'm terribly sorry for your loss, and I wish I could offer you what you need, but I just can't.
If you're going to do a memorial, I'm going to take pictures.<eos> Mrs. Baker. Hi.<eos> I'm Courtney Crimsen.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> I hope you like it.
She didn't say much.<eos> This lawsuit could cost the district tens of thousands, hundreds, and that's if we win.<eos> We're already getting calls from the media.<eos> Yeah. I understand.<eos> And she never came to you, for help?
You think I'm taking it all way too seriously.<eos> ... connected 24/7.<eos> Right?<eos> But here's the thing:<eos> You've never been a girl.
Refusal to participate in group activities, change in their appearance...<eos> You're making me feel like a bad student.<eos> I'm starting to feel like a bad parent.<eos> ...declining GPA... and substance abuse.<eos> Now, paying close attention to these warning signs can help you prevent your children from making a terrible mistake.
- What is your way, exactly?<eos> - We make him understand.<eos> Yeah, understand what?<eos> Candy's in the bowl.<eos> You got a delivery.
Just go away.<eos> I seriously just wanted a picture for the yearbook.<eos> If they knew the kind of pictures you really took!<eos> These T-shirts look great.<eos> Uh, I'm glad you approve, Mr. Porter.
- I don't think he was jealous.<eos> - You hush!<eos> Look, I came here as a courtesy.<eos> I could have called the police.<eos> - Well, maybe you should.
Just because our son doesn't drive an expensive car...<eos> - That's not the point here.<eos> - I did it!<eos> I did it, okay?<eos> Karen, Zach, why don't you come inside, we'll sort this out.
It's not, Mr. Pratters, I assure you.<eos> It is a character-building questionnaire that assesses personal strengths and weaknesses.<eos> Excuse me, Mrs. Bradley?<eos> Yes, Clay.<eos> How important was it to you to help Hannah Baker?
I almost forgot too.<eos> Forgot what?<eos> Courtney and Clay, these are our new foreign exchange students joining us this semester.<eos> This is Jhene, Fynn, Mahla and Deep.<eos> Uh, Courtney and Clay will be helping you out.
Forgot what?<eos> Courtney and Clay, these are our new foreign exchange students joining us this semester.<eos> This is Jhene, Fynn, Mahla and Deep.<eos> Uh, Courtney and Clay will be helping you out.<eos> They are on the Honor Board and they'll be giving you the tour.
Where were we?<eos> Right.<eos> The auditorium.<eos> Oh, oh, but before we go...<eos> I want to show you something super cool.
Angry about another needless death.<eos> I'm sad for Hannah... and for all of us who... who cared about her.<eos> So, are you gonna punish me or what?<eos> Is that what you want me to do?<eos> Do you get a lot of kids coming in here asking for punishment?
Thanks.<eos> Of course.<eos> And if you don't have the money and don't really have the grades, a lot of the decision gets made for you.<eos> What future are you peddling?<eos> I'll let you take the first guess.
That you can see through to what leftovers are inside from the night before<eos> And despite what you might think My skin is soft And smooth<eos> And easily scarred<eos> But that doesn't matter, right?<eos> You don't care about how soft my skin is
Well... duty calls.<eos> Hi, Clay.<eos> Hey, Mrs. Baker.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you at work.<eos> I wanted to give you something.
Are you serious?<eos> She talks about drowning with stones tied to her feet.<eos> She talks about being lost for good.<eos> Mr. Baker... a lot of teens talk about being lost.<eos> Well, God help them if they come to you.
JESSICA: Oh, shit.<eos> Welcome to your second tape, Justin Foley.<eos> CHILDS: It's an automatic five-day suspension, Clay.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> I already told you, it's not mine.
Sit down, please.<eos> I already told you, it's not mine.<eos> Somebody must've slipped it in my bag.<eos> Do you have any idea who?<eos> Who told you to check my bag?
I don't believe this.<eos> You have no idea why this is happening.<eos> Okay, tell me.<eos> Why is this happening?<eos> Who told you to check my bag?
Yes, ma'am, got it.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> We already have this call.<eos> Units are responding to the scene.<eos> - You got the call?
- Yeah.<eos> We have the call.<eos> Who...<eos> Was it a girl who called?<eos> I can't give you that information, ma'am.
All right.<eos> Hannah, how are you holding up?<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> If anything changes and you need to talk, my door is open.
He misses her very much.<eos> That's nice.<eos> He seems like a good kid.<eos> He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?
My name is Clay.<eos> Well, what happened?<eos> Your husband was in an accident.<eos> He's alive.<eos> The paramedics said an officer would come tell you, but your husband wanted you to know right away, so I came.
I'm giving life one last try.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Dempsey.<eos> Morning.<eos> My name is Dennis Vasquez, representing Andrew and Olivia Baker, and this is a deposition.<eos> I'll be asking you questions, and you must answer them truthfully... unless your attorney clearly instructs you otherwise.
It was just a Dollar Valentine's thing.<eos> Hannah didn't take it seriously?<eos> - Objection.<eos> - I'll rephrase.<eos> Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you that might lead you to believe that she did take it seriously?
The other night, I almost threw myself off a cliff.<eos> I'm glad you didn't.<eos> You may not feel that way in a minute.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Hannah Baker came to see you the day she died.
When was the last time?<eos> A week ago.<eos> At a party.<eos> What happened at the party?<eos> She told you what happened to her.
Hannah never told me she was thinking about killing herself.<eos> - But you did see her.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> You saw her.<eos> And she told you things were bad.
You saw her.<eos> And she told you things were bad.<eos> That she didn't care about anything, that she wanted everything to stop.<eos> When did you talk to her last?<eos> She told you how she got to that point.
Should we involve your parents or the police?<eos> No!<eos> Hannah, who's the boy?<eos> Who's the boy?<eos> She couldn't give you a name.
If things aren't going to change, I'd better get on with it.<eos> Hey, Hannah.<eos> She walked out of this office... and she hoped you would come after her.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can have that for you...
And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.<eos> And they'll know what they did.<eos> You're the last person to get the tapes.<eos> Hannah didn't leave any instructions on what happens after you... so you get to decide.
And they always will.<eos> And they'll know what they did.<eos> You're the last person to get the tapes.<eos> Hannah didn't leave any instructions on what happens after you... so you get to decide.<eos> And I added tape number 14... which I hope will help you make that decision.
Mrs. Baker.<eos> Tony, what...<eos> What are you... what is it?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I have to apologize for not telling you everything.
I, uh...<eos> I have to apologize for not telling you everything.<eos> Hannah asked me to keep secrets for her.<eos> I wanted to honor that.<eos> But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.
But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.<eos> There are 14 audio files on there.<eos> You should listen to them in order.<eos> I have the original tapes, and for reasons you'll come to understand, I have them hidden somewhere very safe.<eos> But if you need those, I will bring them to you too.
But if you need those, I will bring them to you too.<eos> What's on here?<eos> What kind of files?<eos> I...<eos> I really think you should just listen.
I...<eos> I really think you should just listen.<eos> What happened to Hannah...<eos> I wish that would never happen to any other kid, ever.<eos> And if giving you this helps that, then... I'm sorry.
What is that?<eos> A treaty.<eos> Its terms conceived by Governor Rogers.<eos> Its terms agreed to by the Maroon leaders... over a few scattered objections.<eos> I can tell you whatever it is you want to hear about Flint's whereabouts.
He's dead.<eos> He's retired.<eos> The truth of it matters not at all.<eos> The truth is there will be no Maroon War in the West Indies because the Maroons themselves have agreed to it.<eos> All that remains, then, is for you to purchase Woodes Rogers' debts. Force his default and incarceration and see him replaced with a new governor who will honor these terms.
I cannot give it to you.<eos> But this is a meaningful assurance that the pirate threat is no more.<eos> You asked for a governor I would call husband.<eos> I cannot give that to you either.<eos> But I have given you a candidate whose trustworthiness I can guarantee.
Affidavits that will shape the official narrative of the default.<eos> The failure.<eos> The humiliation.<eos> For a man like Woodes Rogers, how difficult that will be... to sit helpless while history records such an unflattering end to what was once such a promising story.<eos> I suppose what I'm asking is... once the time comes to submit that affidavit, I'd so love to help you write it.
Leo is the sensei now!<eos> Guys, the motion sensors picked up a couple of mutants.<eos> They look to be heading toward Shredder's old lair.<eos> Better check it out.<eos> Raph, Mikey, since you two have nothing better to do, go track the signal.
He is a cunning one, Karai.<eos> We will need help to defeat him.<eos> You're right.<eos> We better go visit some old friends.<eos> I'm telling you, we go in all pucks blazing.
It will not last long.<eos> I'm gonna get that tolo!<eos> Hmm, I don't know, Xever.<eos> Maybe Tatsu's deal is worth considering.<eos> You guys need a less conspicuous ride.
Tatsu is... blind?<eos> Don't you know I can hear you coming a mile away?<eos> [grunting, swords clashing] You couldn't defeat me yourself, so you employed your freaks to fight me, yes?<eos> What's he talking about, Karai?<eos> Did my old student not tell you the story of poor Hattori Tatsu?
So any arrangement we had is now done... Null and void.<eos> We aren't trade partners, we aren't friends, and we never met.<eos> Hmm?<eos> We don't know each other.<eos> I owe you nothing.
Come outside.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Bertie: Hey.<eos> So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie.<eos> And I owe my life to you all, twice over.
Bertie: Hey.<eos> So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie.<eos> And I owe my life to you all, twice over.<eos> A bunch of us do.<eos> Enid says that you want Gregory to get us to fight the Saviors with you.
Negan has outposts.<eos> The geography, the distance works against us.<eos> We gotta get back.<eos> If they come looking for Daryl, we need to be there.<eos> You don't have to get back.
Alexandria already fought them once, and we won.<eos> We thought we took out the threat, but we didn't know then what we know now.<eos> We only beat one outpost.<eos> We've been told you have a deal with them, that you know them.<eos> Then you know they rule through violence and fear.
It was lives, arms, legs.<eos> The peace we have with the Saviors is uneasy, but it is peace.<eos> I have to hold on to it.<eos> I have to try.<eos> Although the Kingdom cannot grant you the aid you desire, the King is sympathetic to your plight.
Want something now.<eos> Rick... can do anything.<eos> This group?<eos> They found me -- here, so far from our home.<eos> What do you need?
Mm.<eos> Mm.<eos> While I appreciate the gesture and your commitment to your assigned objective, I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening of your own volition.<eos> Video games are all about me showing all of you a fun time.<eos> Would you care for more microwave popcorn?
Pump your brakes, Red.<eos> Do not insult my intelligence, Frankie.<eos> Said pills aren't for Amber.<eos> Said pills are for Negan.<eos> That's why you wanted two.
- 9.<eos> And the cat back.<eos> 20.<eos> I keep the cat.<eos> We get you the guns.
I'm fine where I am.<eos> Shiva likes you.<eos> That's what I'm afraid of.<eos> Tell me what you found.<eos> You're not gonna like it.
I like waiting to hear bad news less.<eos> We got a little problem that could turn into a big problem inside of a week.<eos> Most of the plants down there, they got weevils.<eos> We have to cut and burn everything before the weevils get to the main crops in the courtyard.<eos> I know the royal garden is important to you.
You rat-faced prick.<eos> Ezekiel, there aren't any kings, presidents, or prime ministers.<eos> And all that is a fairy tale, too.<eos> Don't bring that "Your Highness" shit our way.<eos> Now, I appreciate that you've been delivering, but... things have been unnecessarily tense, and that makes me unnecessarily tense.
Then you can have the guns.<eos> And all of us can go on with our day's journeys.<eos> Ezekiel...<eos> I need you to understand the gravity of what's happening here.<eos> I gave you a choice.
It's happening now.<eos> And the problems have to end...now.<eos> You have to learn the stakes here, so we're gonna teach you.<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> We'll get you twice the tribute in an hour.
Get in the truck!<eos> Don't say a goddamn word!<eos> We need to get back.<eos> No.<eos> Right now, you have to listen.
I do now.<eos> Sasha, don't go... not yet.<eos> Rosita didn't come here to train people.<eos> You're both going after Negan.<eos> But you can't do that without people.
Dr. Harlan Carson, correct?<eos> Do you need a checkup?<eos> Simon: Probably.<eos> It's been a few years, but I'm not here for that.<eos> We already gave you as much medicine as we could spare - the last time you were here.
But Eugene?<eos> He's one of yours.<eos> And after what he did -- He stepped up.<eos> You people... are animals.<eos> Universe gives you a sign, and you just shove your finger right up its ass.
Look at him go.<eos> Ha ha, yeah!<eos> We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick.<eos> What say you, Summer?<eos> I say [bleep] you!
Foot down time.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> Where's the vodka?<eos> Beth, it's him or me!<eos> Seems like you guys need some privacy.
I am Phoenix Person.<eos> Phoenix Person?<eos> Is that what we settled on?<eos> I thought we all agreed on Cyber Bird.<eos> You said you didn't care what he was called as long as we brought him back.
Uh, is this not a good time or...?<eos> Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya"...<eos> The Pickle Man, an old wives tale.<eos> He crawls from bowls of cold soup to steal the dreams of wasteful children.<eos> That'd be a lucky break for you.
You guys are pros.<eos> What do you guys think about doing this once a week?<eos> You must be Rick. Mm-hmm.<eos> I've heard a lot about you today.<eos> Your family is crazy about you.
And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control.<eos> You chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle.<eos> You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces.<eos> Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.<eos> I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass.
It's just work.<eos> And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people... well, some people would rather die.<eos> Each of us gets to choose.<eos> That's our time.<eos> I'm going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again.
I figured it out.<eos> - Congrats!<eos> - You did it it!<eos> It was a bit.<eos> All of the descriptors apply to all of you.
I'll cover that bet.<eos> I get it.<eos> Well, Morty, I think you're doing that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment.<eos> I am not being coy about some hidden love for you.<eos> I want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...
Who the fuck is Noob Noob?<eos> Noob Noob!<eos> Yo, it's Logic once again, y'all.<eos> Don't forget the name.<eos> Make sure you get home safe.
They handcuffed me and put me in jail.<eos> Did you experience violence?<eos> All the time.<eos> They tried to take my sister three times, but good people helped us.<eos> Why did the garage owner give you so much money?
Here's a photo of her.<eos> Write down her name and her date of birth.<eos> Describe her as well as you can.<eos> We'll put out a search request for her.<eos> Would you like to take a break?
13,000 per month.<eos> Plus the extras.<eos> Humour never hurts.<eos> Union wages, whatever they are.<eos> How can we trust you then?
I'm Calamnius.<eos> I'm at the door.<eos> I still remember you.<eos> Sit down on the couch.<eos> I'm not one for bad talk, but as the shop steward I must tell you that the previous owner was rather casual about pay.
God willing.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Considering the development in Aleppo's security situation, the number of acts of violence and deaths in relation to Aleppo's large number of inhabitants, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that in the Aleppo region there is no such conflict to cause<eos> all the residents of the city any serious personal danger described as grievous harm in paragraph 88, subsection 1 of the Aliens Act.<eos> Considering the security situation in Aleppo, your domicile and your personal circumstances, you require no subsidiary protection.
- Get lost.<eos> Identity papers, please.<eos> Routine check.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> You, too.
- You ever think about how they never put the morgue on the top floor of a hospital?<eos> I notice stuff like that.<eos> It's always in the basement.<eos> It's like its own elevator.<eos> - And... how does that make you feel?
- To be clear, you had a problem as you said last year.<eos> The real estate business, well this a bad business.<eos> So you tried the normal channels, the banks, but you're companies still failing so you come to us.<eos> - For a loan.<eos> - You never thought to ask why we might lend you one million dollars with no collateral required?
Properties, cash flow, so we can better disguise our activities.<eos> - Look, we just wanna pay the money back and you know, be on our way.<eos> - As I said, the first sum was an investment for you to keep.<eos> All future funds will be run through the front office, the same as other Stussy income.<eos> A few thousand a month, more or less, now I can get you the specs and instructions.
Chance in a trillion.<eos> You two brought the roof down on the glacier cavern and that was that.<eos> No more wasps.<eos> As for this bear, you can't tell aberrant behaviour from stomach contents.<eos> I think you need to find a live one.
We always taught the children to pick their fights.<eos> You taught them that.<eos> Dr. Khatri, what can I do for you?<eos> I need Dan Andersson's medical records.<eos> You must know, they are confidential.
I am told it will begin soon.<eos> The executions of the men captured on the beach yesterday.<eos> It's for the best to have it done.<eos> It could have been you.<eos> I gave you... both of you, a place to stand here.
The executions of the men captured on the beach yesterday.<eos> It's for the best to have it done.<eos> It could have been you.<eos> I gave you... both of you, a place to stand here.<eos> I gave you a life, and you repaid me by conspiring with my enemies.
It's for the best to have it done.<eos> It could have been you.<eos> I gave you... both of you, a place to stand here.<eos> I gave you a life, and you repaid me by conspiring with my enemies.<eos> Ma'am, I don't know what you think you heard, but...
I gave you a life, and you repaid me by conspiring with my enemies.<eos> Ma'am, I don't know what you think you heard, but...<eos> Quiet.<eos> I know you were responsible for Captain Rackham's escape.<eos> I know you solicited her to aid you in the effort.
He'd chase you, and I believe, given the opportunity, he might chase me for a chance at ending this regime once and for all.<eos> From where I stand, it's the only way out of this.<eos> Insurrection against the lawfully appointed governor, high seas piracy, treason.<eos> Does the accused have any words to say in his own defense?<eos> Fuck... you. - Oh, get him.
Insurrection against the lawfully appointed governor, high seas piracy, treason.<eos> Does the accused have any words to say in his own defense?<eos> Fuck... you. - Oh, get him.<eos> - This is injustice!<eos> Fuck you!
Philadelphia?<eos> What is in Philadelphia worth leaving things here in this state?<eos> My grandfather spent his winters there negotiating with his suppliers for the spring.<eos> I'll find him there and secure his assistance.<eos> I must strongly advise against it, against you and the governor being gone in this moment.
So big a name for so small a man.<eos> What is it you have to say to me?<eos> You owe me.<eos> Certainly your fortune. Probably your life.<eos> You might wanna consider that and then choose a new tone, especially given that in the very near future your life might end up in my hands yet again.
Is Rackham?<eos> Is Flint?<eos> This war may feel over, but as long as we're all free, it's far from it.<eos> And if somehow we prevail in Nassau, what happens to former friends who've since aligned themselves so warmly with the governor?<eos> I've come to offer you a chance to earn back our friendship.
I am tired of this.<eos> This thing that perpetuates itself with anger and bluster and blood.<eos> I do not want to be your friend.<eos> What I want is for all of this to end.<eos> For it to end, you must end.
I do not want to be your friend.<eos> What I want is for all of this to end.<eos> For it to end, you must end.<eos> I imagine I have some obligation to surrender you to Captain Berringer, but the spectacle he would make of your trial and execution would only fan the flames of what is burning in Nassau now.<eos> I am tempted to put the sword to you and your man both, and bury this story for good, but what am I if I spend my days pleading for a return to civility and then do dark things under the cover of night?

When are you gonna leave him, Celeste?<eos> When he hurts you badly enough?<eos> When... he hurts the children?<eos> - He will never hurt the children...<eos> - You need to rent an apartment.
No, I don't think so.<eos> Stock the refrigerator. Make sure the utilities are paid for. Have the beds set up for the kids.<eos> Get it all ready so we can at least remove. "Where on God's earth would I go?" from the equation.<eos> You'll have a place, a mindset, another life standing by should you need it.<eos> Which... we both know you will.
You'll have a place, a mindset, another life standing by should you need it.<eos> Which... we both know you will.<eos> I don't think a therapist should be this, um...<eos> I don't think you should be behaving like this.<eos> I'll get you the number of the Better Business Bureau and you can report me.
Thank you for staying late.<eos> You can go now.<eos> You can go now, Kelly.<eos> We're fine.<eos> - I hope you feel better.
Do you think I'd be able to come back a little later and spend some time here by myself?<eos> - Yeah, I... - Probably sounds weird.<eos> No, it doesn't sound weird.<eos> I mean, it's possibly where you'll be living, right?<eos> I'm just gonna leave you the key and I'll clear it with the office.
I didn't know that.<eos> Mr. Grandal has not contacted me in weeks.<eos> With the war apparently occupying Spain's attention elsewhere, there is a good chance the entire unfortunate affair surrounding the Spanish gold is behind us.<eos> So, when we reach Philadelphia, once you are under the protection of your family...<eos> I was hoping you might see fit to release me from my service, that I might return to London... to my children.
Once we've stopped him, you and I will take the vanguard aboard on longboats.<eos> You can stay close, provide support until we're boarded.<eos> Ever captained a ship of this size before?<eos> God, no.<eos> Have you captained a ship this size before?
At the soldiers, at Captain Berringer.<eos> Some of them even at our lord governor.<eos> You may not see it, but trust me, I do.<eos> If the council won't resist the captain, then some of those people might find their own ways of resisting this.<eos> Ways you might not like.
Force him to appear in the square to save his men so that you might defeat him in full view of all of Nassau.<eos> Demonstrate your fearsomeness to them.<eos> Don't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because you don't need to.
And who is that serving?<eos> Because there is a better way to solve this problem.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is information about the preferred routes used by the resistance to enter into Nassau.<eos> - She gave it to you?
Send men to lie in wait.<eos> Set an ambush that can overwhelm Silver and his men when they attempt to pass.<eos> End this quietly and easily and definitively.<eos> What do you imagine happens next?<eos> If you are fortunate enough to capture Teach... what will you do with him?
Mr. Gary Busey's coming back from heaven on the 14th.<eos> How is he gonna know where to land?<eos> All right.<eos> Here's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna let you keep Gary up there, but you guys have to be my deputies.
No, you're right on time.<eos> Agent Nora Durst from the DSD is gonna tell us about procedures moving forward.<eos> So, everybody, listen up.<eos> Thanks, Chief.<eos> Can you guys hear me okay?
Well, you already paid, so you might as well hear what I got, man.<eos> So, what?<eos> You just, uh... you look at my palm print?<eos> You talk to my dead father?<eos> Don't you think you should light some candles, you know?
I'm worried about him.<eos> You got it.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - How you doing, man?<eos> You and Nora need any help setting up Tommy's thing?
"Keep it."<eos> That's what he said.<eos> This V.M. Vargas?<eos> Yes. And we should have...<eos> At the time when we needed the loan, we should have come to you.
- So I'm gonna...<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'm gonna go ahead and pretend you didn't just mouth off to me like my teenage daughter.<eos> And I'm gonna go ahead and let you brace your witness.<eos> And then I'm gonna let you take a few days off to grieve.
So, if you know of any friends Ennis may have had, or...<eos> He didn't talk much.<eos> Except to curse.<eos> I think he may have changed his name before he moved here.<eos> Did you ever hear of Thaddeus Mobley out of Los Angeles?
_<eos> I'm a police officer.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I had a few questions for you about a writer you worked with back in 1975.
Our ship coming in.<eos> Remember.<eos> Richest guy in the room is always the boss.<eos> Welcome to capley bank and trust.<eos> You picking up or dropping off?
Sheriff, I hear you.<eos> I do.<eos> I'm not trying to stir things up.<eos> No, I think you are.<eos> I think you got resentments over being made to cow, kiss the ring.
Just paid her wagon off, apparently.<eos> That sounds like an insurance matter.<eos> Yes, sir, except the driver in question left the scene of the accident at speed, and that's police.<eos> Well, like I said, am I talking to myself here, or...<eos> Soon as the girl's in tomorrow, I'll have her call up that info, and we'll get it over to you.
Look around. I'm already rich.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I wish you'd let us sit at the real table.<eos> In the dining room.<eos> I'll let you into a secret, madam.
But what about the IRS?<eos> You said yourself, he's sitting in the conference room right now, going over the books.<eos> Some books, not "the" books.<eos> What the heck does that mean?<eos> Let's just say for testimonial purposes, it's better that you don't know.
You'll get your chance.<eos> But first, we gotta know the play.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Receptionist: Right this way.<eos> Mr. stussy, these ladies are here to see you.
So, what are we talking about here?<eos> I didn't get your name?<eos> True.<eos> Emmit: This is mister, uh...<eos> I'm an associate of Mr. stussy's is all you need to know for now.
_<eos> Ah, God dang it!<eos> Firing on all cylinders today, Mashman.<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, sir? - You're not supposed to be in here.
Ah, God dang it!<eos> Firing on all cylinders today, Mashman.<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, sir? - You're not supposed to be in here.<eos> Uh, you can't be in here, sir.
You're here.<eos> Well, sir, I work here, so that's...<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> Sir?<eos> You're gonna have to leave.
- No, that's...<eos> I'm over at Eden Valley, just in town to interview a prisoner and they told me that...<eos> Yeah, blue forms are for St. Cloud officers.<eos> Inter-departmental requests, that's a whole other... Yup.<eos> You gotta get your superior officer's approval on this form before I can give you the blue one.
Life is suffering.<eos> I think you're beginning to understand that.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Amen.<eos> Can I show you something?
What about me?<eos> I don't...<eos> "Who will rise for me against the wicked?"<eos> Who will take a stand against evildoers?<eos> You need a ride?
Second vehicle, panel Van maybe, chases them for 2 miles, runs them off the road, finishes the couple execution style.<eos> Jeez.<eos> If I could just get a look inside the bus, my suspect, well, she's real memorable.<eos> A woman, you said?<eos> No women on the bus, I can tell you that.
No women on the bus, I can tell you that.<eos> Anything I can...<eos> That patch on your coat, does it say "us marshal"?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Well then, we'll call you when we find out, either way.
Told you. Can't call me that anymore.<eos> I'm a deputy now, same as you.<eos> I'll run the rest of these tomorrow.<eos> Which, you know...<eos> Serving eviction notices doesn't give you a sense of hope and purpose, what will?
Are you all right?<eos> Of course, I just...<eos> I had an upsetting experience this morning.<eos> To be honest, I feel as if I've left the known world.<eos> You ever had that feeling?
Let's go deeper.<eos> Away from the road.<eos> Forty grand.<eos> That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.<eos> My thought, then, is you should leave the state.
It's my mother's recipe.<eos> No? Well...<eos> You got it?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have it, but I'd like to offer you something else instead.
Spreadsheets, contracts, loan agreements.<eos> Not sure how you found me.<eos> He's protected, I think, Mr. Stussy, possibly even at the highest levels.<eos> My investigation was kiboshed last year from DC, so, we should proceed with the utmost...<eos> Look, Mr. Dollard. I don't know what to tell you.
Thank you so much.<eos> Emmit, my dear Emmit.<eos> How are you?<eos> You look...<eos> Well, I know this can't be easy for you.
All this time.<eos> Like a fire door that leads to another fire.<eos> Emmit, you need to listen to me very carefully.<eos> The Stussy Corporation, having sold all its assets this morning to realignment for $100,000, and may I say, very generous of you, but your company is now carrying a debt load of over three hundred million.<eos> You'll need to file for chapter 11 immediately.
- This is silly, I mean, we're just...<eos> - She's got a gun.<eos> - Sir, step out of the car.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm... she's the one you should...
You know, they're good men.<eos> You know, you sound like a bright young man, Officer...<eos> - Myerson.<eos> - Officer Myerson.<eos> If you ever need any extra weekend work, you just give us a call.
You can tell because he carved an X on the bottom of it.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> My God.<eos> There it is.<eos> Looks like Mr. Metzger left you quite the legacy there.
She's She's 10 years old.<eos> Sorry. What was your name?<eos> Liz.<eos> Well, Liz, we were walking home from school today, and my daughter found the most adorable little calico kitten you've ever seen in your life.<eos> I don't have to tell you how little girls are with kittens, right?
- Thank you.<eos> How many times has this happened to you?<eos> Spending way too much time in the kitchen looking for the perfect pan to solve your cooking problems.<eos> If you're like most people, you have cupboards full of old pans that just don't do the trick.<eos> You need the one pan that can do it all.
It is fever, I didn't want to come into your office and get everybody sick.<eos> Yeah, well, that's, very considerate of you.<eos> Find him, Cole.<eos> I'll tell you what, Josepovich.<eos> You rest up and if you feel better tomorrow, you give me a call and we'll reschedule.
It's no longer an option.<eos> I defied a court order.<eos> I am s...<eos> I am so, so sorry.<eos> You're sorry?
I'm... I'm free to go?<eos> You can go, but you're not free.<eos> Copies of these photographs can be e-mailed to everyone on your contact list at any time.<eos> Understood?<eos> Something you should know.
It's... It's kind of an art form.<eos> We use phrases like "best judgment,"<eos> or, I don't know, "degree of confidence."<eos> That's why when George Tenet said "slam dunk," we all sat up in our chairs.<eos> The other thing you need to do, if you don't mind me saying... - Please, it's why you're here.
Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> It's these same criminals that cozied up to the Chinese communists and armed the most radical jihadis and turned our borders into Swiss cheese and committed every sin you can think of, like spreading hepatitis C and protecting the big banks<eos> and starting all these illegal black-ops wars that have killed millions of people!<eos> These same criminal elements have now doubled-down on Zika virus, hawking this dirty blood like... like they did with AIDS, this tainted blood, so they can turn around and sell you a cure for 50 grand!
- It's called free speech.<eos> - Not when you add in the money.<eos> Which you gave him for airline tickets.<eos> Airline tickets?<eos> Is that what he told you?
I understand he's your business manager.<eos> No.<eos> He's my babysitter.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't like it, but if you want, I can release you AMA... Against Medical Advice.
It gets worse. "These same sources report that even after"<eos> classified briefings on the subject, Ms. Keane seems determined to take a more accommodating approach "towards suspected state sponsors of terrorism."<eos> - It's an ambush.<eos> - Yeah, and perfectly timed... Just ten minutes before our daily presser.<eos> I can buy you a few minutes if you wanna get your head together.
No, no, no, Mom, I'm home.<eos> - I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> - I know. I know, I know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.
They took him straight to Bellevue.<eos> - The psych ward?<eos> - That's all I know.<eos> Well, thanks for wasting my time.<eos> Hey, I didn't tell you to come here.
Can I help you, ma'am?<eos> Ray Conlin's a good guy.<eos> I'm not sure why he's trying to help this asshole.<eos> Same as me. He wants to know what happened yesterday.<eos> I told you on the phone... Some guy with PTSD took some hostages, tried to kill some cops.
What organization is this?<eos> A private one, and you're trespassing.<eos> What's your position here?<eos> Could I have your name?<eos> You wouldn't have lied your way in if you had any legal authority, like a warrant.
I'd at least like to know why you couldn't support me.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Well, it matters to me.<eos> How many times in your life are you gonna be alone with the next President of the United States?<eos> I guess I don't trust you.
I'm so important I have no phone.<eos> It's to safeguard your physical location, ma'am.<eos> I'll let you know the second a secure line is available.<eos> Oh, this is Marjorie Diehl.<eos> - She'll be assisting you.
The press is all over them.<eos> Logistics are proving tricky.<eos> I can't even talk to them.<eos> Elevated security protocols, I know.<eos> That's why I brought you this.
You are the premiere symbol of that government in New York at the moment.<eos> And with the possibility of accomplices out there, I'm asking that we err on the side of caution.<eos> So.<eos> That's all, then.<eos> Is there anything I can get for you?
And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do!<eos> - I- - You need to!
- I- - You need to!<eos> - Quinn!<eos> Quinn!<eos> - Quinn!<eos> - You can't go in there!
Quinn!<eos> - Quinn!<eos> - You can't go in there!<eos> - Let go of me!<eos> - You need to calm down!
No!<eos> You cannot do this!<eos> That man is a highly trained warfighter.<eos> If you enter the building, people will die!<eos> Ma'am, you have to come with me.
Because while New Yorkers were dealing with this terrible attack, the president-elect fled to a "secure location."<eos> Still undisclosed.<eos> General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.<eos> That's right.<eos> You had a plane come right through your office window.
But they don't know me, and they don't know Franny, and they don't know what really happened.<eos> Well, that's why we're here so that you can tell me what happened.<eos> - I am a good mother.<eos> - I understand.<eos> Why don't you start and tell me about that day?
What is the agency's recommendation?<eos> Bottom line, Your Honor, Ms. Mathison fell asleep in her daughter's bedroom with a loaded gun.<eos> Our assessment is that, this fact alone meets the legal requirement of imminent risk.<eos> I'm going to accept the agency's recommendation.<eos> Ms. Mathison, you'll be required to undergo psychiatric evaluation.
Maybe I was afraid she would remind me of that.<eos> And did she?<eos> Well, her father had red hair, and... and she has red hair, so at first, whenever I looked, what I'd see...<eos> What I'd see was that he wasn't there.<eos> She reminded you of his absence.
And I pushed him toward that.<eos> I-I really... I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.<eos> Someone else decides if I get to see my daughter, sure, I'll talk about whatever they want, but...<eos> But you don't think it's fair.
I want you to listen to me a second.<eos> I want you to listen and really try to hear.<eos> What you go through, every parent goes through.<eos> Here is you, and here is your child.<eos> And how do you balance that?
- Carrie Mathison?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hi.<eos> This is Maria at Child Services.<eos> You've been approved for a visit with your daughter tomorrow at our offices.
Do you know where that is?<eos> I do.<eos> At 3:00 p.m.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much. Thank you.
- That would be huge.<eos> - Yeah, assuming I'm able to stand being in the same room with him.<eos> Dar.<eos> Madame President-Elect.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Let's go. - Okay.<eos> You okay back there?
Franny will remain in foster care until more information is provided at further proceedings.<eos> No! This session is adjourned.<eos> All I can do is comply with the court order...<eos> Hope to god I can convince the judge I'm a changed woman.<eos> You've been approved for a visit with your daughter.
Three candidates I would never consider for any position at any time.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> You can't really have expected anything different.<eos> Actually, I did.<eos> And I'd ask you to reconsider... advise you to.
But I have a constituency, too.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means don't go to war with your own national security establishment.<eos> Are you threatening me now?<eos> I'm telling you it's a war you won't win.
And I will not be held hostage by you or anybody else.<eos> I'm afraid you're taking this personally, madam.<eos> You're god damn right I am.<eos> I'm sorry if I upset you.<eos> In the future, in case you're wondering, this moment, right now, is when I decided to put your ass in jail.
Anyway, the good news is we can keep our appointment as scheduled if that's still good for you.<eos> Carrie?<eos> Um, yes, yes.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> A-and thank you.
Andrew Keane lost more men than any other commander during the surge.<eos> Buddies of mine died for nothing.<eos> So what really happened the night captain Keane died?<eos> We'd gone to search a warehouse...<eos> Maybe you should get some rest.
Find and secure her.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Copy that.<eos> Clear.<eos> Sir, I thought you might want to see this.
Do what I say.<eos> Base.<eos> Vehicle's coming your way.<eos> All units, target heading up the ramp.<eos> You're cleared hot to engage.
Okay.<eos> I think I calmed the herd.<eos> Good.<eos> Maybe now they'll stop leaking to the fucking press.<eos> Not many people in that room voted for us, I'll give you that, but nobody in there was responsible for those leaks.
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Oh, Thanks.<eos> Can I get you something-- coffee, tea?
That's what you'll be doing when the world rolls right over you.<eos> 'Cause you're missing it, all of you.<eos> It's happening right now in front of your faces.<eos> We have O'Keefe. We have a disinformation campaign designed to discredit the president-elect. And as of today, we have boots on the ground... like the protesters I had to wade through to get here.<eos> That seem familiar to any of you?
Because it does to me.<eos> It's what we did in Nicaragua, Chile, Congo, a dozen other places, all the way back to Iran in the '50s.<eos> And it does not end well for the elected regime.<eos> You're fighting for your lives here.<eos> You can't afford to stay silent-- and I don't mean press conferences.
And a surprise, I'll have to say.<eos> We're on a tight schedule, Brett.<eos> Of course.<eos> My word. You brought an army.<eos> Really, ma'am, you're safe here.
Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> As I said, I have seen it.<eos> And I have to ask, why would you want to make a mother-- any mother-- watch the last moments of her son's life?<eos> I know it must be painful for you and I-I'm sorry.
- Now we are talking slander.<eos> - I have evidence of collusion with serving members of the intelligence community.<eos> It will go to the Attorney General.<eos> You will be prosecuted. You will be shut down.<eos> Because in my government, truth will have a value, and you will have no place.
He was trying to kill me. Quinn stopped him.<eos> Things got a little crazy. I guess so.<eos> He was choking me out.<eos> Quinn saved my life.<eos> It never occurred to either of you this guy could have been a major witness?
And I'll be honest-- I was afraid.<eos> Afraid.<eos> I felt the weight of the state, that jackboot on my neck when I heard these words from the president-elect--<eos> "You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.
Yes.<eos> That and because I know how protective you are of the Agency.<eos> Whatever is going on here, it's not the Agency.<eos> Not mine, anyway.<eos> Well, they're out in the open now, thanks to you.
I...<eos> I have to go.<eos> I...<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.<eos> You took a fall.
- Swelling goes down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll get you some crutches before you head out.
I work here.<eos> I'm required to have a local access writ now. The INTERPOL Orange Writ of Coaction. Well, we prepared the Orange Writ.<eos> We didn't send it, though, as your Blue Notice for federal access was denied.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, now I can mail the writ to you. Possibly can you just hand it to me?
I'll be frank with you. Carlson Sohns, who runs INTERPOL U.S., said "Let it get buried in the mailroom."<eos> We delay like that all the time when we're awfully busy.<eos> I don't think he expected for you to get your Blue Notice. Yeah. Thanks.<eos> They said he went out to play racquetball five hours ago and never came back.<eos> I don't want to piss off my boss by handing you something he wanted me to mail later.
Cold one, Leslie?<eos> No. I have my own.<eos> - Leslie.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I wanted to say to you
That's a lot of lying.<eos> I didn't actually win my weight in gold throwing spears.<eos> So, I owe a lot of gold to some very dangerous men, Tuffnut. I need one of your dragons to pay them off.<eos> Gruffnut, I looked up to you.<eos> You were my role model. You were my hero. Yeah, false idols.
Just a reminder, we are a nonsmoking hotel.<eos> And you requested that a rental car be dropped off for you here at the hotel tomorrow morning?<eos> - Yes, that's right.<eos> - Great.<eos> Is there anything else that I can help you with?
- I can tell you what I paid--<eos> - Mark.<eos> - Yeah? - I don't know if you are a part of this or a victim of it, but if this is real, if they've actually built this device, they're not sending people to some magical place to be with their loved ones.<eos> They're incinerating them.<eos> They will call you on this with a formal invitation and instructions.
- Mark.<eos> - Yeah? - I don't know if you are a part of this or a victim of it, but if this is real, if they've actually built this device, they're not sending people to some magical place to be with their loved ones.<eos> They're incinerating them.<eos> They will call you on this with a formal invitation and instructions.<eos> All you have to do is answer it.
Christopher Sunday.<eos> Maybe you have an address for him.<eos> If he's a friend of yours, why don't you have his address?<eos> I misplaced it.<eos> You need to talk to Sharon.
Well, then you are incredibly talented.<eos> So, what brings you here, Frank?<eos> I'm looking for a cleverman named Christopher Sunday.<eos> I was told you might have an address for him.<eos> Well, the name rings a bell, but if you're making a documentary, you'll have to go...
- It seems that, um, Chris lives in a... _ - community just a few...<eos> I'd like you to hear my side.<eos> "Appropriation of sacred ceremonies without permission," "theft of creation songs," "misrepresentation of identity.<eos> Under no circumstances" "should this man be given access to tribal elders."<eos> Shame on you.
Really?<eos> I've stolen?<eos> Same way your government stole a whole generation of their children?<eos> We apologized for that!<eos> Shame on you, Sharon.
Everything right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Is he bothering you, miss?
We have a gown for you.<eos> What kind of medical examination?<eos> It's very routine.<eos> It's noninvasive.<eos> And once you're done, Dr. Bekker and I, we will just ask you a few questions and then we can move on to the next step.
Okay.<eos> Great!<eos> Well, we will see you in a bit.<eos> She was ready to go.<eos> She was ready to go and she wishes she could've told you.
Great!<eos> Well, we will see you in a bit.<eos> She was ready to go.<eos> She was ready to go and she wishes she could've told you.<eos> She was ready to go and she wishes she could've told you, but she just couldn't.
It was a stroke.<eos> She was in a coma for three months before he pulled the plug.<eos> Tell him he set her free.<eos> Three months is a long time, man.<eos> And she's grateful that you set her free.
Daniah or Daneeah.<eos> - "Danyah"?<eos> - "Danyah," yes.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, sir?
And if you see him, tell him we said hello and that Finland won the World Cup.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Dr. Bekker is...<eos> Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention of using the device.<eos> Um, she believes that you're curious, but once the time comes, you will get... How do you say... Cold feet.
Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention of using the device.<eos> Um, she believes that you're curious, but once the time comes, you will get... How do you say... Cold feet.<eos> I won't get cold feet.<eos> Good.<eos> So, do you want my money now?
I won't get cold feet.<eos> Good.<eos> So, do you want my money now?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> We have a question for you first.
No, no, that's too late.<eos> We need to get to Melbourne immediately.<eos> This, uh, private group must have a few extra seats.<eos> They bought the boat, sir.<eos> If you wanna get on, I'm afraid you're gonna have to take it up with them.
Somewhere.<eos> One of your people has gone in the water.<eos> We need to find out who he is.<eos> Oh, no, thanks.<eos> You don't care that somebody's been killed?
No!<eos> Hey!<eos> You people are sick!<eos> One of your people is out there murdered, floating in the water, and you're in here doing this!<eos> You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You're saved.<eos> Ladies and gents, we will be docking in Melbourne shortly.<eos> Please dispose all rubbish and collect your personal belongings before you disembark.<eos> Thank you for sailing with us.<eos> We do hope you enjoyed the voyage.
Tell us we're lunatics.<eos> Yeah, it sounds crazy, but... these are crazy times?<eos> So, when Kevin comes back, you're not gonna jam us up?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna jam you up.
- Yeah.<eos> When you guys went down to that mock UN thing, didn't fucking feed it.<eos> I went up there about an hour before you got home and it was dead.<eos> Went to the neighbor's trash and threw it in there.<eos> Told you guys it ran away.
- Mission control.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> You made me sing.<eos> I met you on the bridge.<eos> And do you remember, Mr. Harvey, what I said to you that night on the bridge when I whispered in your ear?
Good to see you, Mr. President.<eos> I wish the circumstances were different, but it appears the shit has hit the fan, sir.<eos> Let's get to the situation room.<eos> Mr. President, for reasons I cannot fathom, we remain at DEFCON 3.<eos> This is the case containing the nuclear football, which will give you remote launch capability.
Hello. Hello.<eos> Are you Christopher Sunday?<eos> Yes.<eos> My name is Kevin, and I know this is gonna sound crazy... but you're not the Prime Minister of Australia.<eos> My father, he came to you for a song.
Nothing, it... It's fine.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She wants you to do it again.<eos> Why do you want me to do it again?<eos> Because I do not believe you.
We just barely escaped before it was all overrun.<eos> - Gloucestershire, has she departed yet?<eos> My ship in the harbor, the one that was to depart for Philadelphia with my wife, was she still there when you left?<eos> I am about to make haste to Nassau.<eos> I cannot afford to tow that sloop along. You will take her and sail for Port Royal where you will deliver the prisoners in her hold to Governor Addison and his men. Do you understand?
You choose... or it starts with your partner here.<eos> Mr. Carver.<eos> Who's next?<eos> We'd found her with a small escort, trying to move her up to the fort, I assume.<eos> If you want her, I think there are some things we ought to discuss first... about our transition.
I am right back where I started.<eos> Every fight I have ever won... every death I have escaped, every sacrifice I have had bled out of me, it will all have to be repeated just to get things back to where they were a few hours ago.<eos> There's some kind of hell it seems to me to be.<eos> But I want you to know, at the first opportunity, I will see you returned back home.<eos> I gave you my word. I intend to honor it.
But I want you to know, at the first opportunity, I will see you returned back home.<eos> I gave you my word. I intend to honor it.<eos> This fight ahead does not belong to you, nor to your children.<eos> I won't have you bear any more of it.<eos> Would you consider joining me?
I wonder, ma'am, if he might want you to leave.<eos> Especially... when he learns of your... current state of being.<eos> I beg your pardon, ma'am, but seeing what I see in your service...<eos> I fear there are things I may know about you that even the governor does not yet know.<eos> I have grown quite fond of you, ma'am.
So, at least it is unlikely Captain Teach caught the governor's sloop before returning.<eos> Teach would never have given up so quickly.<eos> If it is his ship, then in all likelihood, the governor's ship was captured.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Perhaps you would like to wait below... in case the news is not what we hope.
- You're prepared to do all of that?<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> In exchange for the cache.<eos> The chest with the remains of the Urca treasure.<eos> I'm told it is hidden... buried in a secret place known only to Captain Rackham and the two of you.
Sign 'em and get 'em back to me.<eos> Why do we even have to go through this?<eos> There's no way that marriage was legal.<eos> And now, in the name of me,<eos> Gosh Almighty, who you may know from, I don't know, Italian ceilings?
We have nothing to talk about Andy.<eos> Agent Locke, uh, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sorry, who are you again?<eos> Mariana. Been here two weeks.<eos> Uh, look, I don't think Andy told you the truth about Director Mullins.
Yes.<eos> And what did you say?<eos> I told him you're with us.<eos> So don't make me a liar.<eos> No, I absolutely agree with that, but... Why don't you grab a bite to eat first.
I told him you're with us.<eos> So don't make me a liar.<eos> No, I absolutely agree with that, but... Why don't you grab a bite to eat first.<eos> I'll catch up with you outside.<eos> Hmm? Thank you so much, both of you.
- Mullins?<eos> Eric... are you hearing what you want to hear from Grimes, convincing yourself you can trust him?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because you blame yourself for what happened today.<eos> Look, Rebecca, I told you and Mullins what I think.
And there's Jadalla, using the name Aashiq Raza.<eos> The addresses on the passports, they're all the same.<eos> CTU, we have it...<eos> Aliases and a potential address.<eos> Sending all to you now.
Idiot.<eos> Hi.<eos> You have it?<eos> I couldn't get ahold of fulminic acid, so I combined two parts nitric acid, two parts alcohol.<eos> You'll still need to combine it with one part mercury.
If you are interested in stories with happy endings, then you would be better off somewhere else.
That is because not very many happy things happened in the lives of the Baudelaires.<eos> Violet, Klaus and Sunny were intelligent children.<eos> Charming and resourceful, they had pleasant facial features, but they were extremely unlucky.<eos> Most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune, misery and despair.<eos> I'm sorry to tell you this... but that's how the story goes.
It is a nice day.<eos> I have some very bad news for you children.<eos> Your parents have perished in a terrible fire.<eos> They perished in a fire that destroyed your entire home.<eos> I'm very, very sorry to have to tell you this... my dears.
The other lives in a cave and talks to sheep.<eos> They each think the other has it better.<eos> I regret to inform you, the Baudelaires' fate was worse.<eos> Chop-chop, Baudelaires!<eos> Now that I've found you a suitable guardian,
I regret to inform you, the Baudelaires' fate was worse.<eos> Chop-chop, Baudelaires!<eos> Now that I've found you a suitable guardian,<eos> I'm going to take you to your new home before banking hours begin.<eos> I know you must be nervous about living with a guardian.
Goodbye, Violet.<eos> Goodbye, Klaus.<eos> Goodbye, Sunny.<eos> I hope you'll be happy here. I'll still check in on you occasionally.<eos> If you need anything or have questions, you can reach me at the bank.
Goodbye, Klaus.<eos> Goodbye, Sunny.<eos> I hope you'll be happy here. I'll still check in on you occasionally.<eos> If you need anything or have questions, you can reach me at the bank.<eos> Well, children, before I give you a tour of your new home, aren't you going to say "How do you do?"
Really?<eos> Did you help around the house?<eos> That's great.<eos> Well, welcome to your lucky life.<eos> Come with me, and I'll show you the delightful features of your home.
I expect you to keep everything gleamingly clean.<eos> "Gleamingly"?<eos> Clean.<eos> The stove is a bit like a servant.<eos> You have to whack it sometimes... to get it to work.
First of all, first impressions are often wrong.<eos> Very true.<eos> For example, your first impression of me may be that I am a terrible person.<eos> But in time, Baudelaires, I hope you'll come to realize... you haven't the faintest idea.<eos> I'll give you a moment to unpack.
Do you have children, Justice Strauss?<eos> Me?<eos> Oh, no. No.<eos> No, I always hoped I would, but I'm married to the law, and you can't very well have book babies... now, can you?<eos> Well, you dodged a bullet.
Can you guess?<eos> Your secret tower room?<eos> Wrong!<eos> My secret tower room.<eos> Which you are forbidden to go into.
You've only provided us with one bed.<eos> If you want another bed, tomorrow you may go into town and purchase one.<eos> You know perfectly well we haven't any money.<eos> Hmm. Of course you do.<eos> You three lucky orphans are inheriting an enormous fortune.
That he's alive at the end of whatever happens.<eos> You trust him?<eos> Flint.<eos> You've cast your lot with him.<eos> What does it matter to you?
There is very little that I remember from when I was young, but I remember this.<eos> You were older.<eos> You were beautiful.<eos> I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead,
When you were told that my mother and I were dead,<eos> I have to believe that it affected you.<eos> You had just lost your mother.<eos> But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.
It would have been so easy to lessen your suffering by divulging the secret.<eos> And yet, he never did.<eos> Have you yet asked yourself why that is?<eos> My father didn't mistrust Flint.<eos> My father mistrusted all of you.
Your men need to know my wife is not to be harmed.<eos> English, God damn it!<eos> Even if that order could be given, no one would heed it.<eos> They've been let loose.<eos> I opened the gates for you.
English, God damn it!<eos> Even if that order could be given, no one would heed it.<eos> They've been let loose.<eos> I opened the gates for you.<eos> Handed you this victory.
That result was because of your goddamn betrayal!<eos> Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!<eos> For reasons I can't begin to fathom, I argued against it.<eos> Bark at me again about braver, stronger, and smarter men, and I might decide to revisit the issue!<eos> If killing me seems like the smartest thing to do, then it is obvious to me none of you have any idea how to defeat Woodes Rogers. - And you do?
I opened the gates for you.
I opened the gates for you.<eos> Handed you this victory.
The revolution you promised has begun.<eos> - Where's Madi?<eos> - I need you to know that I did everything I could to keep her safe.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> I wasn't able to say good-bye to her... so I don't know what she would've wanted me to say to you right now... if anything at all.
You told her not to come back down here, didn't you?<eos> You'll have plenty of time to murder her another day.<eos> Right now, you need to rest.<eos> You asked to see me, my lord?<eos> I cannot imagine what sort of horror this is for you.
You'll have plenty of time to murder her another day.<eos> Right now, you need to rest.<eos> You asked to see me, my lord?<eos> I cannot imagine what sort of horror this is for you.<eos> Please know, to whatever extent there could be any doubt, that the choices she made in recent days were made out of concern for you and out of love...
Leave now, please.<eos> I'd be careful if I were you.<eos> Mr. Rawls, get out of this room.<eos> Mrs. Hudson!<eos> You don't want to hear what he's about to tell you.
I beg your pardon, but do you believe this?<eos> I read it in a newspaper.<eos> Mr. Guthrie will see you now.<eos> Charles Vane was a good man.<eos> What I told you was the truth.
Woodes Rogers bears debts he cannot hope to repay.<eos> Given the ruin Nassau lies in, those debts could be purchased for a mere fraction of their value, for pennies.<eos> You could own Woodes Rogers and see him imprisoned.<eos> Meanwhile, while Nassau smolders, her real property could be bought for a song.<eos> I bring you the chance, sir, to own the island, shape the regime that runs it, and do it all while seeing justice visited on your granddaughter's murderer.
It is.<eos> And who are you?<eos> Her grandmother.<eos> Wait outside.<eos> I'll join you shortly.
I honestly don't know.<eos> Not long, I don't believe.<eos> She rarely included me in her thinking.<eos> What I knew of her was mostly observed rather than shared.<eos> But one thing I know to be true... whatever risk she took or danger she braved... they were all made out of love for you.
- Bye.<eos> You know, let me kick you down something for the effort.<eos> Uh, I appreciate that, but honestly, what I'm really looking for is a job.<eos> I told you, I'm not hiring.<eos> But you could use the help.
Well, we will absolutely take care of your transportation needs.<eos> I will make sure that you have access to shuttles or volunteer drivers... whatever you need.<eos> Yeah, I don't think you get what I'm saying.<eos> I want a car.<eos> I put together some numbers for you guys to look at.
All right, cool.<eos> Bye.<eos> Is Noelle around?<eos> Uh, she'll be back later this afternoon.<eos> Can I help you with anything?
And one more thing.<eos> I will make sure that you get a first-class education and graduate with a degree.<eos> So think long and hard about this, because what I have to offer you is a future.<eos> And compared to that, a car is chump change.<eos> No offense, but that's easy for you to say sitting in that big house in Mission Hills.
You've been great.<eos> I'll figure something out.<eos> (doorbell rings)<eos> I hope it's okay that I came by so late.<eos> Just wanted to give you this.
Surprise!<eos> You guys weren't supposed to be here till tonight!<eos> Hey!<eos> No, we took an early flight from New York.<eos> We wanted to surprise you!
The threat the pirates present has never been greater.<eos> Their intent is to cause terror and destruction until civilization simply ceases to function. The threat will not...<eos> The defense of civilization is not your responsibility, sir!<eos> Your duty is to restore stable profits to Nassau.<eos> And the men charged to follow you to that end are already questioning their trust in you.
His grief and his anger... I believe, have unmoored him from sound judgment and have left us all in grave danger if he is not reined in.<eos> You've noticed this, have you?<eos> You were excluded from the council.<eos> On the outside of its goings-on.<eos> I don't know what information you were privy to...
On the outside of its goings-on.<eos> I don't know what information you were privy to...<eos> I appreciate your concern.<eos> Come back when you like.<eos> I may be able to help you get back inside.
Go on.<eos> I found a journal Eleanor kept.<eos> In it, she mentioned that when Nassau last threatened to descend into chaos... you were the one to whom she turned to help prevent it.<eos> The men surrounding the governor now have all failed to challenge him in any meaningful way.<eos> I am hoping that if I could provide you with information from inside his office... it might help you maneuver your way back onto the council.
That sounds an awful lot like treason to me.<eos> And what exactly, aside from good government, do you hope to gain from this?<eos> Eleanor promised me passage to London.<eos> A release from my service, that I might return home.<eos> If I help you... will you help me?
what you've taken from me.<eos> To me, compromise seems a loathsome, unbearable act.<eos> What compromise can there be with the man responsible for the death of my wife?<eos> Or with those who would follow him?<eos> You're luckier than you know... so much luckier than you know that in this moment I can still hear the faintest of voices in my head arguing against the alternative.
- Accept the treaty...<eos> - I will consider no treaty of yours.<eos> And John Silver lives.<eos> Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.
Classy.<eos> Very.<eos> Tell him...<eos> we hope his aunt feels better soon.<eos> He wants me to tell you he hopes your aunt gets well.
Because our senses, including our common sense, are evolving.<eos> And I think that is because of people like you.<eos> If BPO thinks the way you do, why all the secrecy and control?<eos> Obviously, not everyone thinks like I do.<eos> What do they want that's different from what you want?
You have to leave the building.<eos> Calm down.<eos> - Ma'am, what's the problem?<eos> - I saw the terrorist!<eos> - You need to calm down.
- I saw the terrorist!<eos> - You need to calm down.<eos> - He's attacking the museum!<eos> I saw him!<eos> - You need to calm down!
- Okay.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, fine.<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> You like it?
Hm. I knew they were lying.<eos> When they came here, they were looking for something.<eos> They did not find it.<eos> You see?<eos> My son believed his secrets would be safe with you.
Means Kolovi knew about it from the beginning.<eos> These are early experiments of the men who I believe are responsible for your son's disappearance.<eos> That one is Professor Kolovi.<eos> I showed him a picture of my son and he denied ever meeting him.<eos> What did your journalistic intuition tell you about him?
I've come to say goodbye.<eos> I thought I had value to them, but it seems that time has passed.<eos> What's happening?<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> They're using me to send you a message.
- We want to end it.<eos> - We need your help.<eos> - We want to fight.<eos> - Just as Van Damn would.<eos> We want you to run for office.
- We believe that with your help, we can effect some real meaningful change here.<eos> And what do you know about here?<eos> Are you from Kibera?<eos> I thought not.<eos> I think you should leave before my mother returns.
"serial killer who talks with a soft lisp and wears mascara."<eos> You think that's bad?<eos> Listen to this.<eos> "The Hispanic coke dealer is about to give another kind of blow job when he finally gets the bullet he deserves."<eos> I told you.
Okay.<eos> The parade kicks off after your address.<eos> My address?<eos> Only if you want.<eos> It is for you to decide.
- Yeah, that is true. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> Look! Look!<eos> Now... a man who needs no introduction, but I'll introduce to you anyhow.<eos> I give you the Grand Marshall of this year's Pride Parade...
- Bug's on it.<eos> - Color the Bug totally clustered.<eos> Hi, Bug.<eos> What's up, Neets?<eos> Can I get you anything?
By having sex with every homie in Oakland.<eos> - By any means necessary.<eos> - Mom!<eos> They exaggerate, honey.<eos> Oh, I just think it's amazing that none of you ever cared that you didn't know who her biological dad was.
Don't be a child, Daniela.<eos> Don't treat me like one.<eos> Everything I built in this world, I built for you.<eos> But if you force me, I will cut you out of that world and I'll never look back.<eos> I know this is hard for all three of you to understand, but I have a relationship with these two men that isn't based on threats, or control, or money.
My son tells me that you were educated in London?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What a gift.<eos> It was.<eos> He said that you were offered many jobs but you decided to come back home.
My teacher says the same thing.<eos> After I lost an important match, he told me that I worry too much about what I should or shouldn't do.<eos> He says fighting is not something you do with your head, it's something you do with your heart.<eos> You agree with him, Ms. Bak?<eos> I think you will profit by spending more time with your teacher and less time pestering me.
Change?<eos> People like what they're used to.<eos> People also want things to get better.<eos> Someone is listening to all the noise you make.<eos> - You and your lady should be careful.
We need access to the restaurant computer.<eos> How without Nomi?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hello, Officer.<eos> I do believe you're in need of assistance.
- I swear I... - ...will find you.<eos> To Teagan.<eos> The best sister anyone could hope for.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I wish you and Tom all the best.
He's had his head so far up his ass, he didn't bother to check.<eos> Check what?<eos> Good citizens of San Francisco's upper tax bracket, this man, Agent Jeffrey Bendix, has stormed into the middle of this sacred ceremony, violating this important moment for absolutely no other reason than the gratification of his male ego!<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I urge you to contact your congressperson...
Of course I have one.<eos> Dad?<eos> - Agent Bendix...<eos> - Nomi Marks is wanted by at least three different agencies in the federal system.<eos> I trust that you are familiar with the law firm Winslow, Wise, Allegretti Marks?
What did you do?<eos> She did something!<eos> She did some kind of hacking!<eos> This is bullshit!<eos> Take your hands off my daughter... or I promise you, I will pursue a suit seeking the kind of damages that end the careers of men like you.
We're...<eos> That's right, kid. In your Hollywood debut, you will be falling in love with three-time Academy Award-winning actor<eos> Blake Huntington.<eos> Why do you care so much about those things?<eos> I'm guessing he already told you what he did with his.
For too long, we have elected liars.<eos> And hypocrites.<eos> We have elected thieves.<eos> The time has come to elect a real man.<eos> I give you, from the Kenya Democratic Reform Party...
Mm-hmm. And what sort of...<eos> An investigation into your recent conduct.<eos> - Well, that sounds serious.<eos> - Oh, it is.<eos> I bet you'd like the use of an office.
I would.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Oh! Look at that.<eos> So you were warned.<eos> Don't for a moment think it gives you an advantage.
The real answer...<eos> Not much.<eos> And the best thing is it gives me access to the world's most fascinating people.<eos> Like our next speaker, the finest performance coach there is.<eos> I'd advise you to give her your full attention.
But right now, I do.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Covering.<eos> We all get complaints, right?<eos> Struggle for you is you remember the complaints, don't you?
Because they bring reassurance that when the time comes, you can step up.<eos> Some of you take them.<eos> A little blue steel is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> But if I threw this bottle into the audience right now, no one would grab it.<eos> The thought that someone might know you need help is worse than not getting the help you need.
Some of you take them.<eos> A little blue steel is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> But if I threw this bottle into the audience right now, no one would grab it.<eos> The thought that someone might know you need help is worse than not getting the help you need.<eos> Still, when the time comes, when you need to pull the trigger on the buy or sell order, you better be hard as a rock and ready to go, because that is the tour you've signed on for.
- As I have said, my hands are tied.<eos> That's a load of crap!<eos> I'm so sick and tired of all of this.<eos> The laws on campus suck and they need to change.<eos> - You need to do something!
If you don't get this,<eos> - you need to step down.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> And don't tell me to calm down.<eos> Maybe you should be a little bit more upset!
- you need to step down.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> And don't tell me to calm down.<eos> Maybe you should be a little bit more upset!<eos> All right, you know what, you and your friends, you need to pack up your things and go home now!
Because I cannot wait.<eos> One of the murderers...<eos> One of the murderers who killed Mr. Jim Miller... is still out there.<eos> At large.<eos> How much more proof do you people need?
All right.<eos> Mrs. Miller.<eos> - I'm so very sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And I promise you,
- I'm so very sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And I promise you,<eos> I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.<eos> And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.
Everyone around this table is fully aware of the gravity of the situation.<eos> Good.<eos> The president will be happy to hear that.<eos> Okay.<eos> What kind of kiss do you want?
- But no, nothing like this.<eos> - But you saw what he did, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Would you like to see it?<eos> We can show it to you, if you like.
I know.<eos> It's awful, isn't it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.<eos> But you don't need to say very much.
It's awful, isn't it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.<eos> But you don't need to say very much.<eos> You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.
I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.<eos> My driver will take you back to your car.<eos> But, Congressman... this is your chance.<eos> And I think you know it.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out here.
My driver will take you back to your car.<eos> But, Congressman... this is your chance.<eos> And I think you know it.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out here.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out.
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It's amazing how ready people are to be afraid.<eos> History would prove them right.<eos> You're lucky this is coming off with water.
"Fuck."<eos> It's difficult to underst...<eos> Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.<eos> Please stop it.<eos> I thought this news would bring you some relief.
Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.<eos> Please stop it.<eos> I thought this news would bring you some relief.<eos> The president called Mrs. Miller.<eos> I promised you and your daughter that I would...
Family emergency, I'm afraid.<eos> Sorry to hear.<eos> - Hope you'll give him my best.<eos> - Of course I will.<eos> Okay. We'll get you sorted out with chips.
And of course...<eos> Pappy Van Winkle.<eos> A lovely gesture... but I'm afraid my trainer has made me promise to abstain.<eos> You see, if I let myself get fat, then the girls will only want me for my money.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to your game then, huh?
- Why did you ever leave this place?<eos> - I didn't leave.<eos> - My mom took me away.<eos> - Yeah, but why?<eos> Always seemed like all of you guys were so happy here, all of you together.
Professor Amory.<eos> My daughter Patricia.<eos> Detective Constable Morse, City Police, Professor, Miss Amory.<eos> Actually, it's Dr Amory, but I prefer Pat.<eos> What can we do for you, Constable?
Yes, certainly, an integral member of the team.<eos> Is there news?<eos> I'm afraid a body was recovered from just below Magdalen Bridge about an hour ago.<eos> The clothes on the body match the description we have of those he was last seen wearing.<eos> Sorry to have to tell you.
Suspicious, then?<eos> He could've injured himself earlier in the evening.<eos> Slow subdural haemorrhage.<eos> He comes for a swim, pressure builds on the cerebral cortex and good night, Vienna.<eos> Give you the definitive prix fixe once I've had a rootle.
Right?<eos> Don't come the old acid.<eos> It don't suit.<eos> You didn't listen.<eos> I told you it was suspicious.
No stone unturned, you have my word.<eos> I just can't understand what he was doing there.<eos> Why?<eos> Edison couldn't swim.<eos> Right, gentlemen, I'm fairly confident this will be of interest to you both.
- No.<eos> Initial tests suggest traces of fluoride.<eos> Tap water?<eos> All I can tell you is that wherever he drowned, it wasn't in Cowley Baths.<eos> A case of this magnitude, multiple victims and a motive as yet unknown, I'm sure I don't have to impress on you the need for absolute discretion.
Sometimes, even by accident.<eos> You have to catch the person who killed Richard Nielsen.<eos> His last letter he sent, he said there were problems within his group.<eos> What kind of problems?<eos> He didn't say, but you should know our opinions were simpatico upon certain important matters.
Well, I wasn't sure if you would come.<eos> So, I thought, erm, we'd treat ourselves to a little drop.<eos> Oh, the '61.<eos> I'm honoured.<eos> Well, If I was really honouring you, I would have brought up the '45, but, erm, perhaps when I know you better.
I don't go in for God.<eos> But that man was a miracle worker.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> For the record.<eos> You know where I was, I told you.
- No.<eos> What about Tuesday night?<eos> I was here, working.<eos> Bernard told me to reboot JASON.<eos> Look, if you think that you've got evidence that I'm involved in all of this, then you should charge me.
Tell the Bureau what I know or ask out.<eos> Seems easy enough.<eos> I mean, you don't have to make it about her, right?<eos> It's been a few years. You want a change.<eos> Could be the high road for both of you.
You're a fascinating man, Alan.<eos> Alan, even great men make two or three critical mistakes in their lives.<eos> You don't get where I'm sitting by only making two or three mistakes.<eos> It's the choices you make today that will determine your future.<eos> All you have to do is say "yes."
The bad guys missed you.<eos> We're here to help.<eos> Our bosses are very interested in a bunch of VIPs that went missing last night.<eos> You were one of them.<eos> If you don't want our help, fine.
What kind of list?<eos> There are about 1,200 people here in the US in the event of a major catastrophe, a nuclear war, terrorism, natural disaster, those things, we all get sequestered.<eos> If society ends, we're the ones who are responsible for rebooting it.<eos> They're asking you to make a choice, Alan.<eos> It's just the first of many that you'll have to make in your new position.
Like a fire or something?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There ain't no fire.<eos> There's a guard out there going full-on San Bernardino.<eos> This is where you want to be.
You forgot salty.<eos> Now he doesn't have the magic combination.<eos> Idiot.<eos> This where you're keeping guards?<eos> We got a big one here for you.
He looks shiny.<eos> Man, this ain't a beauty pageant.<eos> Go.<eos> Read.<eos> You best be getting to work.
- He's been in and out.<eos> - And he's lost a lot of blood.<eos> - Thanks for bringing him in.<eos> If you got this, I'm gonna go check on Daya, okay?<eos> You're gonna need some help.
And it's coming in shallow.<eos> Any moment now.<eos> Eight, maybe nine o'clock.<eos> I'm having fun.<eos> - Are you guys having fun?
In 30 years, over 100 people have lived here, thanks to generous countries like Russia, the USA, and China.<eos> We call this Tranquility Node.<eos> Dr. Jordan here is about to break the record for consecutive days in space.<eos> Four hundred and seventy-three, straight.<eos> Your mommy must miss you.
Actually, uh, I need to freshen up.<eos> Can you tell Scott I'll be right back?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you sick, honey?
He may have drowned.<eos> Why didn't you...<eos> Oh, oh, oh.<eos> There we go.<eos> Are you sure I can't interest you in an elixir?
Certainly.<eos> Honored to oblige.<eos> Just as soon as you pass the test.<eos> Of course there's a test.<eos> As you know, only a Child Of Earth can wear the crown of the High King.
Brakebills?<eos> Hello?<eos> Mr., uh, Mr....<eos> Fuck!<eos> Can I help you?
- You don't discuss killing your wife.<eos> - We're discussing them considering it.<eos> - Well, you don't consider it either.<eos> So none of you have ever had forbidden thoughts?<eos> If only you could blow the head off the guy who cuts you off at the crossing or the guy blocking the escalator.
Wait a second.<eos> Come on!<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> Let's just eat.<eos> What are you gonna do, just wander around here?
Your Italian is disgusting!<eos> Be quiet.<eos> I'll do the talking.<eos> My friend's phone is stolen.<eos> Did anyone sell a phone to you today?
No, but it smells spectacular!<eos> Want a taste?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I'd love to.<eos> Can we also have a little taste?<eos> Not for you!
No, Lieutenant Fitzgerald. She's not back yet.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I'll let her know you called.<eos> Better call after 9 unless you want to antagonize the judge.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.
I'm expecting my orders any day.<eos> Scott's a writer.<eos> That's what he does when he's not defending our country's honor.<eos> One of those Yankee highbrows, huh?<eos> I went to college, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Ward.<eos> Becca Vlasik.<eos> - I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Do you mind if I ask you what you've been told so far?
I don't know.<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - I need to talk to him.<eos> - You need to rest.
What you mean is you just follow orders.<eos> For money.<eos> Who gave the order to murder Senator Wilkes and Clara Ward?<eos> We can't do this?<eos> Well, all I can say to you is here we are, and we're doing it.
- I'll talk!<eos> Who was first?<eos> Christina.<eos> How are you?<eos> You're probably gonna want to leave now, 'cause in about 30 seconds, Kent here will appear to have a severe heart attack.
- Tell him what I just told you.<eos> Tell him to keep it to himself and make something up.<eos> I need a couple of days, at least.<eos> Where you going?<eos> This is for you and Mom.
- What?<eos> They're not shooting.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You can't go down there!
Especially not a daughter.<eos> Mind the third rail.<eos> I just want you gone.<eos> Right here.<eos> Pretty sure you've been told, on pain of death, to take me alive. Or I'd be dead by now.
I did everything that was asked of me.<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> This is not a secure line.<eos> You're gonna call your client and get my daughter back.<eos> Or I hand myself in and you're in a Rikers jumpsuit by tonight.
He is the head of the facility where Zack was institutionalized.<eos> Dr. Roshan, thank you so much for being here.<eos> Do you have any idea how Zack managed to escape?<eos> Uh, not yet.<eos> Unfortunately, as you are aware,
Aubrey's right.<eos> Zack wants you, which is the last thing that we should give him.<eos> Dr. Addy, hello.<eos> My name is Special Agent James Aubrey.<eos> As you can imagine, I've got quite a few questions to ask you.
What do you mean Bones is gone?<eos> Whoa. This is even creepier than I imagined.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Uh, this is Booth on the phone.<eos> Why don't you take the wall by the windows?
It was just so many years ago.<eos> But, um, I was working on my dissertation, and Zack was nice enough to grant me a series of interviews.<eos> Miss Delfs was just one of many who came to see me.<eos> It is odd, but being perceived as a murderous cannibal does have some advantages.<eos> Okay, Dr. Lecter, why don't you take a seat?
Miss Delfs was just one of many who came to see me.<eos> It is odd, but being perceived as a murderous cannibal does have some advantages.<eos> Okay, Dr. Lecter, why don't you take a seat?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Dr. Hodgins here has got some questions for you.
Dr. Brennan, it's good to see you again.<eos> I'm glad to see you're unharmed.<eos> Your husband, when...<eos> when last we spoke, when he assaulted me, insisted that you were in harm's way.<eos> We just need to ask you a few questions, that's all, Dr. Faulk.
No.<eos> We're not done here, Doctor.<eos> Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan, a word of advice.<eos> The person you're searching for has a pathological need for control.<eos> He, or she, will want to get as close to you as possible, to... manipulate you.
Let's go.<eos> Hey, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah, what is it?<eos> Karen has an idea that she'd like to run by you.<eos> Ooh, thank you, Agent Aubrey, for your enthusiasm-- you're a heck of a salesman.
Apparently he's got some suspects he wants you to look at.<eos> Okay, bring him in here.<eos> Doc.<eos> Agent Booth, thank you for seeing me.<eos> I wanted you to have these as soon as possible.
I got to go.<eos> Ms. Delfs, for the last time, I'm fine.<eos> Please stop following me.<eos> Well, Dr. Brennan, I'm just trying to help.<eos> I really think that after what happened with Zack, you need time to process.
There's no more work to be done.<eos> You're safe, it's over.<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> I think you need to come with me.
You're safe, it's over.<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> I think you need to come with me.<eos> Let's find you a place to sit down.
It fits.<eos> After being separated from his other half, the killer must have adopted his dead twin's personality.<eos> Zack didn't do it.<eos> Aside from the one on his forehead, he has no scars on his body.<eos> Yeah, I'm not even gonna ask how you know that.
I have proof.<eos> You... you have to trust me.<eos> All right, hold on.<eos> Dr. Addy, you've had quite a trying day, haven't you?<eos> Allow me to give you something to help you relax.
Good-bye... Dr. Addy.<eos> Zack, you okay?<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> I couldn't kill him.<eos> Hey. I just wanted to give you guys the good news.
This will pass.<eos> It will pass.<eos> You cannot interrupt the signal without warning.<eos> The impulses within will disconnect and become deranged.<eos> Sister, I tasked you with the flowers in the chapel this morning, to celebrate the return of our sisters and our staff from Africa, but now I find the vases empty.
You look so very well.<eos> And happy.<eos> Oh, I've just delivered a beautiful little boy, and you've all come home!<eos> I've just been speaking to Mother Jesu Emmanuel, and she thanks everyone who's just returned from South Africa for their service to the order, and of course to the people that we helped.<eos> She also wished me to tell you an important piece of news.
The most important thing, when you begin to throw a pot, is to make sure that your clay is in the absolute centre of your wheel, so you need to throw it down firmly.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Stop laughing at once!<eos> How can poor Nurse Gilbert make a lovely vase if she can't concentrate because of all the noise?<eos> Then you need to smooth it -- oh, dear -- into a cone shape.
- Oh, it doesn't matter, Tom.<eos> - It matters to me.<eos> Trudy, baby was only born last night.<eos> Dr Turner's on his way, but we'd all feel better if you had the usual twice-daily visits.<eos> And I think you would, too.
Or twice.<eos> Maybe even three times, but my son-in-law owns this house outright, and he's got prospects, and he respects his elders.<eos> There's plenty worse off than my daughter.<eos> Er, Mr Watts is not willing to allow Mrs Watts to remain in the property if the marriage is dissolved.<eos> I'm not paying you to know what my husband wants.
And I've got burns -- here, here and here.<eos> He did them with his cigarette.<eos> Again, you would have to PROVE that, Mrs Watts.<eos> I'm extremely happy to give a statement summarising the medical overview.<eos> Why should you have to?
Do you need to visit him?<eos> I spoke to his nurse.<eos> He's... .. paralysed.<eos> He wants me to go to him, but... .. I don't know what to do.<eos> I reckon this is one for you, Nurse Crane.
Ah! I'm sorry, you're here because...?<eos> I flew in from Guadeloupe this morning to meet with Stephen, to discuss funding for the observatory.<eos> I see.<eos> Hello.<eos> We appreciate this must be a hard time for you.
Swipe?<eos> On the door.<eos> Logs everyone who goes in and out of the observatory.<eos> We all have individual cards to make sure everyone's accounted for in case of an eruption.<eos> Erm... If you intended to head up the volcano at night, in the dark, I assume you'd need to take a torch?
Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, really nice!<eos> Shall I come towards you?
"Finally, here's my chance."<eos> So, you applied.<eos> As Megan Colley?<eos> I sent her degree, her results.<eos> And then all you had to do is travel on your own passport and pretend to be her.
Who at the observatory knows about this?<eos> No-one.<eos> Did Stephen?<eos> No.<eos> You liked him, didn't you?
Have you dialled it?<eos> Goes straight to the voicemail.<eos> Keep trying.<eos> Whoever it is must turn it on sooner or later.<eos> Er, JP, did you manage to speak to Dr Klein at the Carrington Institute yet?
There isn't.<eos> But those heated lunch meetings must have been about something.<eos> Speak of the devil.<eos> Commissioner!<eos> Is there anything I can help you with?
Commissioner!<eos> Is there anything I can help you with?<eos> Only, you are aware that you are trespassing on private property.<eos> As a matter of fact, there is.<eos> My officer here would like to ask you a few questions.
Yes!<eos> Bless him.<eos> Morning, Florence.<eos> Morning, sir.<eos> I'm afraid you need to get back in the Jeep.
Why someone so "gifted" would lose his way like this.<eos> After all, I had the same parents, same opportunities.<eos> Very similar path.<eos> After all this time, he still thought I'd kick the habit.<eos> But he still gave you money, didn't he?
After all this time, he still thought I'd kick the habit.<eos> But he still gave you money, didn't he?<eos> He supported your habit?<eos> He gave me an allowance.<eos> Yes, but you needed more.
I take it you...<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> And I assume you want us to...<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But, first, Dwayne, JP, I might need you to go on a little hunt.
It was in one of the rubbish bins, sir.<eos> Thank you, JP.<eos> Florence, er, do you have the number?<eos> So, who did the phone belong to?<eos> It belonged to you lot.
And with Stephen's cap as the finishing touch, keeping your face slightly concealed, it was no surprise that we didn't notice it was you seen on the CCTV that night.<eos> All of which made us believe Stephen left the observatory just after 9pm.<eos> And, as you used his swipe card, it was also confirmed by the log.<eos> You then walked the stretchered body a mile up the volcano and then left it there to be discovered the next morning.<eos> And then all the pair of you had to do was be patient and wait outside the observatory because for the final piece of your plan to work, you needed Mayor Richards to arrive and act as an unwitting accomplice that you were all present at the observatory that morning.

But why?<eos> Why would they do such a thing?<eos> Oh, I think you already know, Mr Richards.<eos> It's because of you.<eos> We know that you needed the observatory to officially sign off on your planning proposal because you needed them to move the volcano exclusion zone so you could build your hotel.
Stephen wouldn't budge on his decision.<eos> I mean, you might've been able to use certain ways and means to get him to accredit you on an academic paper.<eos> But when it came to something like moving an exclusion zone, something that will affect the lives of other people, he would not be moved.<eos> Which is when you decided the only way to get the money was to kill him.<eos> Now, I'm not quite sure how you managed to convince them to help you kill Stephen.
Not quite the concert I was thinking of, Bones.<eos> Who's a good boy?<eos> - Who's a good boy? Yeah.<eos> - Sir?<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?
No, not in the slightest.<eos> I am simply focused on planning my party.<eos> It's not every day that one turns 40.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry to bug you, Dr. B, but I wanted to show you three antemortem contusions I found hidden in the blunt force trauma on the back of the skull.
Had Ian lived, I am confident that we would have reached singularity within the next decade.<eos> - Sorry, singularity?<eos> So, did you notice anything unusual about Ian's behavior last Friday?<eos> Oh, unfortunately, I was out of town, delivering a speech.<eos> But I can give you his online calendar.
Same place I always am-- my desk at Social Cybernetics where I was coding all night long.<eos> Well, our team will have to verify that. Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Go right ahead.<eos> But if you want to find the actual killer, you ought to be questioning those nuts from Stop the Robopocalypse.
Even if they do call Dr. Brennan for a reference, what if it backfires?<eos> You know, she does have a tendency to be blunt.<eos> That is one way of putting it.<eos> Do you think it'll seem like a red flag if I call the NFL and I ask them to use you as a reference instead?<eos> I think you should focus on your work and try not to worry so much.
What'd they call it?<eos> "Excessive use of force."<eos> So, I had anger issues back then.<eos> It's ancient history.<eos> I think that Ian had the A.I. you wanted for your sex dolls, but he wouldn't give it to you, so you decided to convince him using force, you wound up beating him to death.
Uh, yeah, well, you certainly had me fooled.<eos> I tell you, Bones, keeping a secret is not one of your strong suits. That's a good job.<eos> That's one of the many benefits of growing older.<eos> We grow wiser in the process.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Dr. Brennan.

Will he be giving an update on President-elect Vargas' condition?<eos> Not at this time.<eos> Can you give us an update now?<eos> The President-elect is being treated by a team of the best doctors and surgeons on the East Coast.<eos> As soon as they have an update, you will, too.
They're terrified, and now their worst nightmare has come true.<eos> I have to call them.<eos> I have to be with them!<eos> Please.<eos> You need to announce his death, sir, as soon as possible.
Wow, can I just say, I love your hair.<eos> I used to have really long hair too, but...<eos> This is a handwoven coiffure weft from the finest silk and Vacuna fabrics.<eos> It designates high social status.<eos> You think you'd know that.
How embarrassing for her.<eos> This is going to take forever.<eos> Hello? Can anyone help me?<eos> Silly me, I must've taken a wrong turn somewhere.<eos> I'll be glad to help you, madam.
Ha!<eos> I promise you, I'll be back.<eos> Oh... (tsking) Lady Caine.<eos> It's impolite to leave in the middle of a party.<eos> You think you'd know that.
Come on, grab your bag.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> How did you find us?<eos> Acontact at the airport saw you get into the wrong taxi.<eos> You're lucky I found you.
- She gets too close.<eos> And touchy, and it's not just me<eos> Chelsea Lopez is freaked out too.<eos> I took a picture at last Saturday's meet.<eos> I'll show you.
I can hear her breathe.<eos> Hello, Spencer.<eos> Are you sure he's dead?<eos> If you're referring to Noel Kahn, yes.<eos> But if you'd like to make a statement, Jenna I'd recommend you...
- He wanted to kill me too.<eos> - I...<eos> Sara Harvey was first.<eos> I was next.<eos> What do you know about Sara Harvey's death?
You're so full...<eos> You don't need to comment on this.<eos> Kevin?<eos> Could you take Ms. Marshall to the conference room?<eos> I'll join you shortly.
Severing ties with this town would be healthy for all of us.<eos> I didn't tell you this morning because I...<eos> I knew that you were already hurting, and I didn't want to...<eos> Sell it!<eos> Fine, do what's best for you guys.
Yeah, you do.<eos> You know exactly how dangerous you are.<eos> And if you don't retract those accusations then I'll have to share some pretty damaging evidence about your extracurricular activities behind The Brew.<eos> So now you're following me too?<eos> Maybe you wanna use your time more wisely, Coach Fields.
She's sleeping.<eos> I'm so sorry that she just took off, uh...<eos> Someone saw her getting into a cab outside the trauma clinic.<eos> Her therapist, her parents we've all been looking for her for hours.<eos> She didn't tell you that she was coming here?
- Okay.<eos> - I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> A finger?<eos> Someone sent you a finger.
- Do you need to sit down?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> What, what are you looking for?<eos> The puzzle piece.<eos> They must have told you to put it somewhere.
I'm not Jenna.<eos> Like I said<eos> - I'm just here to drop off...<eos> - Jenna's not in there.<eos> I'll run this back to billing and get you a receipt.
I'm gonna walk into that room and flush my entire future down the toilet.<eos> 'But, hey, at least I get a prize for playing.'<eos> - Hanna...<eos> - I've gotta go.<eos> I'll text you when A.D. delivers my puzzle piece.
It keeps us off balance.<eos> And it gives us somethin' to bicker about so that we're not focused on finding out who A.D. is.<eos> Look, it's been a long, rough day for all of us.<eos> So I'm gonna go visit Toby and Yvonne on the way out.<eos> Look, you guys don't have to stay.
What a monster.<eos> I know that Lucas destroyed your memorial but do we really think he's as disgusting as all this?<eos> I could kick myself.<eos> I was so close to catching him.<eos> I'm just glad he didn't hurt you guys.
You said you want out of the game.<eos> You want me to join you in torturing my friends?
Same day your friends went by Welby to complain about how Dr. Rollins was treating you.<eos> You have very devoted friends.<eos> So, you think he was killed that night, after he left town?<eos> Well, his coat left town and his phone and his credit cards but I don't think Archer Dunhill was in any condition to use 'em.<eos> If somebody wanted you to think he was alive, why would they send you part of him?
Batteries?<eos> I thought it ran on bitchiness.<eos> It has a finite amount of power.<eos> Like one of those rovers you send to Mars.<eos> You're going to have to finish the game before the batteries can run down.
Think about the mind that conceived this.<eos> Why build a Dollhouse when you can turn the entire town into a Dollhouse?<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Do you two wanna be left alone?
Hell, I was glad to.<eos> But things have changed.<eos> If this snowball keeps going there is nothing I can do to help you.<eos> What snowball are we discussing?<eos> Every theory that I can come up with to figure out what happened to Archer Dunhill keeps circling back to you and Alison and your friends, especially to you.
Someone's been in here. Might still be in here.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - It's a search warrant.<eos> Check those drawers.<eos> I may need you to stay here.
Nothing in your relationship led you to believe that he was conflicted in his approach to solving the murder of Archer Dunhill?<eos> No.<eos> Furey told me everything, Miss Hastings.<eos> From bar stools, to ping pong right before he took himself off the case.<eos> I'm giving you a chance to tell the truth.
- That's not fair.<eos> - Fairness. It's overrated.<eos> Truth is what counts.<eos> Well, I would say that it's good to see you but under these circumstances...<eos> You should know something.
Whether you choose to believe me or not...<eos> Concrete proof.<eos> Just remember you asked for it.<eos> Well, search warrants were served on multiple locations this morning.<eos> No, ma'am, I can't tell you exactly when but from what I've seen so far it does indicate that we should be able to file charges within a week.
I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lieutenant Tanner.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You need to see this.
There's lots of evidence.<eos> And there's probably more to come.<eos> But the question is, why are you telling us this?<eos> I thought it was obvious.<eos> I am giving you a chance to tell your side of the story before my side becomes the only side.
I thought it was obvious.<eos> I am giving you a chance to tell your side of the story before my side becomes the only side.<eos> You were the one who rescued us five years ago.<eos> That's because you wouldn't tell me the truth and you ended up in an underground bunker.<eos> So why don't you let me help you now?
Really?<eos> Well that system failed on Thursday between 9:14 and 9:24.<eos> Besides you who else has access?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'd have to speak to Ashley Marin.
- Hey, Emily.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What's our system here?<eos> A Harrisburg dumpster.<eos> You guys need to have a giant yard sale.
Okay, I'm not sure why you're here, but I don't think it's for the right reasons.<eos> People do things for all sorts of reasons, don't they?<eos> I'm sure you had yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think you need to find another doctor.
People do things for all sorts of reasons, don't they?<eos> I'm sure you had yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think you need to find another doctor.<eos> Can I help you?
His home address.<eos> Baby doc forgot to peel off the mailing label.<eos> I doubt this is the most personal piece of mail he gets.<eos> We're gonna do some digging.<eos> Look, lady, I don't mind calling you a tow truck but I don't have any shovels.
Why would that be embarrassing?<eos> Was he the reason that you stopped with me that night in the elevator at the Radley?<eos> What relevance does that have?<eos> He'd have strong motive to protect you, wouldn't he?<eos> I really hope you're not having a hard time separating what's personal from what's professional, Detective Furey?
'You all finished? '<eos> Fine, Reggie got that audition..<eos> What're you doin' back here?<eos> We thought we hadn't finished your interview with you.<eos> Yeah, I don't have any answers for you.
What're you doin' back here?<eos> We thought we hadn't finished your interview with you.<eos> Yeah, I don't have any answers for you.<eos> But you did have the cash to pay off a medical school loan bill overnight.<eos> Shall I read you the statement?
I put the deed in your name. Yours and Alison's.<eos> But why?<eos> I know what's happening.<eos> With the police.<eos> You'll need money for lawyers, all of you.
Of course.<eos> Well...<eos> I killed Archer Dunhill.<eos> I ran him over with a car that I stole and I buried his body in the woods.<eos> Later I moved it to where I told you you'd find it.
Who was your accomplice?<eos> I'm not gonna tell you.<eos> That person had no idea what I'd done.<eos> The only thing that they were guilty of was helping someone in trouble.<eos> Do you know why your niece and her friends were at that farm tonight?
One that Jacob doesn't know is out there.<eos> I'm gonna go to the nest, where this all started, where the secrets lay hidden, and where blood will finally be spilled in its rightful place.<eos> The call I just got from Scofield...<eos> I want to know where it came from.<eos> Location data coming to you right now.
Correct.<eos> And with the revelation of the additional blood evidence found in his office at the university, it neatly supports your theory, doesn't it?<eos> That he was there.<eos> That he was the gunman.<eos> I guess I would have one question for you.
That he was the gunman.<eos> I guess I would have one question for you.<eos> I'm director of the CIA.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> That's why I sent you the e-mail with the evidence directly.
You might find some problems.<eos> Depends how motivated you are to look closely.<eos> Poseidon killed your deputy director.<eos> He was a cancer inside your agency for years.<eos> I've shown you his face!
No, there can't be any publicity on this.<eos> Four dead bodies in the office of Seattle's preeminent crime lord...<eos> Well, Mr. Deaux has given 100 hours of testimony against Mr. Boss.<eos> It's imperative we keep his name out of this.<eos> Call the mayor if you need a cover.
I was hoping to talk to you about that girl, Natalie.<eos> If you remember anything, call me back on this number.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - There's Clive.<eos> You can't kill me, I can't die.
If you remember anything, call me back on this number.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - There's Clive.<eos> You can't kill me, I can't die.<eos> You can't kill me, I can't die.
No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Almost there.<eos> We'll give you guns and show you how to use them.
His breathing is still too shallow.<eos> You said his lungs were fine.<eos> No. I said I thought so.<eos> It's possible a bone fragment could've lodged in the tissue.<eos> I'll give you time to decide.
I want you to know that it's fine if you were.<eos> - Thank you, Susan.<eos> - Jesus, Mom.<eos> Just because her mom is gay does not mean that she's gay.<eos> You know, you can get married now.
What I'm trying to say is, why does she get to leave the house when she's only level two?<eos> - It was Luke's night out.<eos> - Yeah, but Ellen got to go.<eos> It's "Eli" now.<eos> It might make you feel better to know that Dr. Beck scheduled a special trip for you guys in a couple of days.
I mean, that's one sassy unicorn.<eos> I can't believe you drew that for her.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - It's awesome.<eos> Um, I love you guys and thank you.
Just normal shit.<eos> The second you get boobs, it's like open season.<eos> You guys are pretty disgusting that way.<eos> We could at least have some manners about it.<eos> Not rub up against you guys on the bus.
You okay, honey?<eos> I... I just got up too fast.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You need to eat, girl.<eos> I'm fine. But thank you.
- This way.<eos> Are you sure the body was actually washed up?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Where?<eos> You were specifically told not to move it.
She was so easy to talk to.<eos> She made me laugh.<eos> Must have been difficult with her on the island for half the year.<eos> She always said that's why we got on so well -- hardly saw each other!<eos> I have to inform you, Ryan, that we're treating Gemma's death as suspicious.
Or mobile phone?<eos> Diaries?<eos> Well, she used to keep all her stuff on the island.<eos> Do you mind if my sergeant has a little look round?<eos> If you need to.
I usually chuck it on the desk, but I opened it.<eos> "I'm writing to acknowledge your change of name to Mrs Gemma Campbell."<eos> - They were already married?<eos> - Five weeks ago.<eos> And this is why you needed to see her face to face?
She was mentoring him.<eos> Any problems between them?<eos> They got on well.<eos> Only she left a message for his probation officer the day she died, saying there was some sort of issue with Tom.<eos> - Do you know anything about that?
They said it was joint enterprise, but the whole trial was a joke.<eos> I wasn't even close enough to touch the guy when it kicked off.<eos> But the judge didn't like my face, so...<eos> And you've got no idea why Gemma would've been calling your probation officer?<eos> If I knew, I'd tell you.
We'd spotted a Brunnich's Guillemot down there -- incredibly rare, so he was rushing.<eos> I saw him go over, and then the line just unravelled.<eos> Do you think there's a connection between Davy's accident and Gemma's death?<eos> Gemma's was a random attack, surely?<eos> Have you ever felt threatened by Gareth or Caroline Andersen?
You were found near the climbing centre.<eos> I thought it was time to stop avoiding 'em.<eos> I remember feeling dizzy and I must have fallen and then I woke up here.<eos> So you were going to tell him the truth about his son's death?<eos> We found the emails Gemma sent you.
She was in the lighthouse.<eos> - So why say she was there?<eos> - I panicked.<eos> - I said it was Davy's mistake.<eos> - And she believed you?
I resigned.<eos> Do you think Gemma told Davy's dad that you'd both lied?<eos> No.<eos> But if you think he's done something, I need to know.<eos> He's no threat to you in here, Sophia.
You know what they'd do to us if I threw it away?<eos> That's why I left the pub on Tuesday, try and give it to Ben myself.<eos> So what happened?<eos> There was police at the train station at Newcastle, and you lot were all over the island, so I was trying again today.<eos> You had to do two things to keep out of jail -- get rid of that package and silence Gemma.
You didn't fail us.<eos> Victoria Hogarth, I am arresting you for the murder of Gemma Wyatt.<eos> You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you say may be given in evidence.<eos> Do you understand?
but your weaselly little friend is right.<eos> Even I'm no match for the widow, and I trained her.<eos> The only person who can save m.K. Now is sunny, and he's busy committing suicide.<eos> Then you're going after him.<eos> I'm sorry that you had to learn the truth about bajie this way.
How long... did you think I would ride that?<eos> Ride what?<eos> Marius, did you really think I wouldn't snap to a play like this?<eos> Giving me the "all in" signal at that very moment?<eos> Wait. He signaled you?
It's in my garden.<eos> Kim: Okay, ladies. Jenn:<eos> Thanks so much for your help.<eos> Oh, you're very welcome.<eos> Thank you both for being so patient.
Kim: Okay, ladies. Jenn:<eos> Thanks so much for your help.<eos> Oh, you're very welcome.<eos> Thank you both for being so patient.<eos> And, Mrs. aherne, if you or Margaret ever need anything from me -- anything at all -- you can call me day or night.
Now, you're sure i can't help you carry those to your car, Mrs. vankamp?<eos> Don't be a silly.<eos> I only hope I didn't take too much of your time with all my dusty old photos.<eos> Goodness, no. Your -- your grandson's wedding was gorgeous.<eos> When I come back, I'll show you my niece's confirmation.
I treated you with hospitality and respect, and now i come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie.<eos> Captain, please.<eos> Why don't -- sit down.<eos> Take a load off.<eos> Hey, I'll get you a complimentary coffee or a soft drink?
B-29.<eos> Fifi's a b-29.<eos> I don't...<eos> Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?<eos> You don't like the commercial.
I don't...<eos> Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?<eos> You don't like the commercial.<eos> No, no, I don't, but this has nothing to do with the comm-- well, constructive criticism is always welcome.<eos> But I didn't -- but you should realize that most people find it uplifting -- patriotic, even.
If it turns out that fudge wasn't actually in the war -- fudge is not a person.<eos> He wasn't in the war.<eos> Well, neither was tom cruise, and look what "top gun" did for you.<eos> You lied to me, you lied to my face, and I can't let you get away with it.<eos> I-i think we just -- we're just gonna have to agree to disagree, so, uh, can I get you that coffee to go or...?
You're gonna take that ad off the air.<eos> And if you play that ad one more time, I'm gonna go to the judge advocate, and we will take you down -- trespassing, false representation, stolen valor -- the whole nine yards.<eos> Seriously, for eight seconds of a TV commercial?<eos> You take that ad down, or there'll be hell to pay.<eos> That clear enough for you?
You think the United States wants to bring action against an old man in a wheelchair? !<eos> He was standing on TV. He wasn't even in a wheelchair!<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Well, periodically, he is.<eos> And when he shows up in court, you better believe he'll be in a wheelchair!
I just need to check one thing.<eos> It'll be two minutes, tops.<eos> Chuck: Ernesto.<eos> Morning, Mr. mcgill.<eos> They didn't have fuji apples, so I got you honeycrisp.
Tilt your head forward.<eos> I'm gonna search your hair.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> These are yours and yours alone to take care of.<eos> If you lose or destroy any property in your cell, you will receive a fine.
That's when I saw that the basement door was open, so I went down there.<eos> What did you see?<eos> I just heard a... mm...<eos> A noise coming from upstairs, and then I woke up here.<eos> When Professor Keating called you, did she say why she wanted you at the house?
Or do I need to drown you in your own piss?<eos> So, you admit going to talk to Ms. Keating in her holding cell, and this is just an hour after you talked to the Medical Examiner?<eos> Due to our prior relationship, I felt she might disclose key evidence for us.<eos> To be clear, you did this on your own.<eos> No one in this office cleared you to do that?
He's a lawyer, right?<eos> Um, Mike Richardson, a trustee for the university.<eos> With all due respect, the whole "We're here for you" spiel loses its intended effect when you have legal counsel taking notes.<eos> It's university policy to have adequate record in situations like these.<eos> You mean situations where you need to protect the endowment.
What changed?<eos> Frank Delfino confessed to killing Wes Gibbins last night.<eos> Doing it for Annalise.<eos> Of course.<eos> What do you need?
A suspect who has every reason to do this at your client's bidding.<eos> If you don't believe him, why hold him?<eos> That's the detectives' call.<eos> This office hasn't even decided if we even want to charge him.<eos> Because you know you have to release my client the minute you do.
- You would believe that.<eos> - Listen!<eos> Annalise is a mess.<eos> She is losing it in there, and...<eos> I'm scared... more than I should admit to you.
Not everything's about Annalise.<eos> Did Frank kill Rebecca?<eos> No.<eos> BonBon, please don't lie to us.<eos> Why would I lie to you right now?
We came here to negotiate in good faith.<eos> You mean to leverage bodies for leniency.<eos> I'm sure the state is as interested as we are in bringing closure to the families of these unsolved cases.<eos> To be clear, these are unsolved murder cases.<eos> We've told you everything we're willing to tell you without a deal.
Hello.<eos> Would the lady like to take off her clothes?<eos> I am Gustav, and I heard that the queen bee is in need of a rubdown.<eos> Funny.<eos> I'm under explicit instructions to make sure you feel... so very good.
Or she's a spy trying to bring us all down.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I just wanted to say I'm sorry.<eos> Laurel was right.<eos> None of us knew Wes like you all did, and I can't imagine what you must all be feeling.
Good job.<eos> I have a question for you, son.<eos> Was it normal for this professor of yours to require you to do illegal hacking?<eos> I wouldn't say it was normal.<eos> So it was odd that she called you at 8:52 p.m. the night of the fire?
Oh, shut your mouth!<eos> How do I know you won't get bored and run off someplace like you always do?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - You two need to talk.
How do I know you won't get bored and run off someplace like you always do?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - You two need to talk.<eos> I'm going to utilize the facilities and give you two time to fix this thing, whatever it is.
Hello?<eos> Hey.<eos> It's me.<eos> Mr. Delfino, it is an ethical violation for you to be calling me.<eos> It's fine. If you have anything to say, you need to say it through your lawyer.
It looks worse than it feels.<eos> They hurt you.<eos> I erased Annalise's phone that night.<eos> - I know. - Yeah, but I saved a copy.<eos> If you have anything to say, you need to say it through your lawyer.
Is that really an option?<eos> I failed.<eos> I promised to protect you all, and I didn't.<eos> I tried, but... the D.A. offered Wes immunity.<eos> It would make sense to come to you next.
Actually, there are a lot of other choices besides invoking the power of the State.<eos> I know my legal options.<eos> I also know how important it is for the Attorney General's office to investigate any charges of prosecutorial misconduct.<eos> Please, if every criminal in the state was allowed to file suit because their D.A. was being - a little overzealous... - Look at my face.<eos> Do you not think this constitutes a lawsuit?

Are you now claiming<eos> A.D.A. Atwood physically assaulted you? Worse!
I know you, Annalise, and, yes, I just called you Annalise, which I think is appropriate, considering where we are in our relationship.<eos> You can call me whatever you want.<eos> I just did.<eos> And frankly... I am your biggest advocate right now.<eos> So just admit what you need rather than whatever game this is.
You could thank her for the deal she got you.<eos> - What deal?<eos> - He's drunk, and judge is coming.<eos> So put your penises away.<eos> Mr. Delfino, since you've called us all here today, why don't we let you begin.
It's jail.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's horrible.<eos> But it's your life we're talking about.<eos> If you don't care about Wes, I get that.
I get it.<eos> You don't need to cry about him in front of me.<eos> But I do need you to take action.<eos> Yeah, I do need you to be the person that you promised us you were.<eos> You know, that's why we've been following you this whole time and trusting you.
- Would you like to share? - No.<eos> You sure?<eos> We're good listeners.<eos> I'm new.<eos> But you already know that, so...
I don't know.<eos> It's just...<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You've been coming here for 26 years, and y-you're still a mess.<eos> I mean, what has coming here done for you?
You've been coming here for 26 years, and y-you're still a mess.<eos> I mean, what has coming here done for you?<eos> I mean, tell me!<eos> There's got to be something that you learned... something...<eos> Right, that you helps you to feel better... other than this whining.
Your Honor, who is trying the case here?<eos> Ms. Keating, either act as your own counsel or advise your lawyer on your own time.<eos> Ms. Atwood, did you or did you not order the cremation of Wesley Gibbins' body?<eos> I did not.<eos> Do you know who ordered the cremation of Wesley Gibbins?
That's the one good thing you're gonna do in your life.<eos> You're gonna go, and you're gonna kill yourself, Connor!<eos> Today's a good day for you.<eos> How's that?<eos> We're offering you a plea deal.
- Neither have I!<eos> - You hacked up my husband, dumped his body in a garbage bin.<eos> Because of Wes, okay?<eos> !<eos> We were all trying to help him and you.
- He was dead before the fire.<eos> Why are you hiding that?<eos> Please don't address the D.A.<eos> Why are you concealing how he died? !<eos> Unless you want to be held in contempt, Ms. Castillo, I'm advising you to calm down.
Not even a full 24 hours?<eos> No, but...<eos> You sure he's not just trying to get away from the two of you?<eos> Because I can relate.<eos> You need an appointment to meet with the District Attorney.
Because I can relate.<eos> You need an appointment to meet with the District Attorney.<eos> I know, but Mr. Denver is in his office right there, correct?<eos> D.A. Denver...<eos> You don't get to know where he is.
- They get sick all the time.<eos> - And why are you always eating?<eos> - I'm stressed.<eos> - Yeah, join the club.<eos> Okay, you all need to leave.
Okay, you all need to leave.<eos> - What about Connor?<eos> - We don't have a plan.<eos> Because I'm eating your food?<eos> This is my house, so I get to decide when you leave.
You had it this whole time?<eos> Or we found it in your car when we brought you into custody, proving that you killed Wes.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Do the Mahoneys have something on you?<eos> Or are they paying you? Do you...
Or we found it in your car when we brought you into custody, proving that you killed Wes.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Do the Mahoneys have something on you?<eos> Or are they paying you? Do you...<eos> Do you have lame political aspirations and they're funding your campaign?
"No" what?<eos> It's the only way, Laurel.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Wes.<eos> No, I'm not gonna let you do that.
Get that family to the airport as fast as you can.<eos> I'll work something out.<eos> Mr. Burrows?<eos> I wanted to thank you for saving my daughter.<eos> And offer you something in appreciation.
German engineering. 77,000 miles.<eos> Five liter, seven speed, V10.<eos> It will be a welcome bit of luxury.<eos> Behind closed doors, of course.<eos> Best of luck to both of you.
- and let Poseidon beat us.<eos> - Ramal?<eos> There's a way out if we work together, but escape has to start from your cell.<eos> I'm no longer interested.<eos> The only thing left for you to do is to beg.
- Ramal?<eos> There's a way out if we work together, but escape has to start from your cell.<eos> I'm no longer interested.<eos> The only thing left for you to do is to beg.<eos> Beg that I might let you live once my armies came, if only as a slave.
Or another illusion?<eos> I have been gone for eons.<eos> No.<eos> Many months, but not eons, Shredder.<eos> You need to recover.
Ah, here!<eos> You brought the book?<eos> Um, sure.<eos> Mr. Gatwood.<eos> The card wasn't clear, but I'm pretty sure you're getting steaks, too.
Mr. Gatwood.<eos> The card wasn't clear, but I'm pretty sure you're getting steaks, too.<eos> Really?<eos> Texas.<eos> He wishes you a speedy recovery. Mm-hmm.
The card wasn't clear, but I'm pretty sure you're getting steaks, too.<eos> Really?<eos> Texas.<eos> He wishes you a speedy recovery. Mm-hmm.<eos> You are so lucky.
Don Eladio wanted me to speak with you face to face, so there's no misunderstanding.<eos> From now on, there will be only one route over the border for our product...<eos> the chicken trucks.<eos> That is final.<eos> But you must understand this is for efficiency only... there's no disrespect to you or your family.
You took advantage of poor Mrs. Landry.<eos> Does she know how much money you're gonna make from this?<eos> Nope.<eos> And again I ask... so what?<eos> These people trusted you, Jimmy.
Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest.<eos> Come on.<eos> From the Koran.<eos> All the roads are blocked.<eos> So you'll have to find a different way to the border.
- Soon.<eos> Where can we meet you?<eos> Uh, hangar two.<eos> Right off the main runway.<eos> But you better hurry your ass up.
We got to move.<eos> Sid...<eos> Sid!<eos> I heard your call, infidel.<eos> Wings will not carry you to safety.
How's that sound?<eos> Keys are here.<eos> Left side, the red brick.<eos> First floor.<eos> Battery might be dead, so you might need
Officially.<eos> But some of us have a more enlightened view.<eos> Abu Ramal was a great visionary.<eos> You have our sincerest condolences.<eos> What do you want?
But some of us have a more enlightened view.<eos> Abu Ramal was a great visionary.<eos> You have our sincerest condolences.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do, to eliminate the men who killed him.
Abu Ramal was a great visionary.<eos> You have our sincerest condolences.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do, to eliminate the men who killed him.<eos> And as a sign of good faith... we'll tell you exactly where they are.
Omar had to go somewhere safe.<eos> Because of the war?<eos> Yeah, the war.<eos> That's right.<eos> He told us to bring this stuff for you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he'll live.<eos> Give him a couple hours.<eos> He's strong.<eos> We'll, uh... we'll give you a minute.
Yeah, you remember, but I got a record.<eos> Not a lot of employers lined up to take a chance on me.<eos> Besides, this ship provides opportunities for my side business Which is the real reason I'm on this boat.<eos> This baby houses my entire life savings.<eos> I'm telling you, it's gonna be huge.
Besides, this ship provides opportunities for my side business Which is the real reason I'm on this boat.<eos> This baby houses my entire life savings.<eos> I'm telling you, it's gonna be huge.<eos> I'm a few months away from putting all this behind me.<eos> If you guys are lucky, I'll let you guys take one of my ladies for a spin.
We got him.<eos> Look out!<eos> Back of the plane.<eos> Uh, excuse me!<eos> Excuse me. You're not allowed...
How many more people will they kill while we wait?<eos> Make the call.<eos> I got to get a better view.<eos> Now, if the racers would please line up at the front of the stage...<eos> As some of you know, we had a few quitters last year.
Patience, diplomacy.<eos> Uh, you meet a-all sorts of people down there,<eos> A-and most are really great, really friendly, But you encounter some who are upset, belligerent.<eos> What about old folks?<eos> Uh, you get your fair share of them?
I was thinking of going over to Cracker Barrel Because they've got such great air-conditioning.<eos> Well, yes, I love their biscuits, too.<eos> Well, that's wonderful. Mm-hmm.<eos> Yes, I think a will is really important.<eos> When would you like to come in and meet mr. Mcgill?
Bye, now.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Thank you for holding.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> Well, I can set you up with an appointment.
You charmed me into it.<eos> Welcome to los pollos hermanos.<eos> May I take your order?<eos> Uh, I'll have a pollos classic and a coffee, black.<eos> Would you like the pollos bonus size for 50 cents more?
Simultaneously, the MCRN Karakum, dispatched by Korshunov to take delivery of your protomolecule technology was destroyed.<eos> And I gave the order.<eos> You will clean up this mess, and you will get the fuck back to work.<eos> - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - - WEB-DL resynced by lonewolf - -- font co<eos> Well, it looks like you guys have some shit you need to figure out.
There's a maintenance crawl on the other side of that wall.<eos> It should lead us to the elevator shaft.<eos> That is not going to work.<eos> Right.<eos> You'd never make that climb.
- We're not.<eos> So unless you can see how to get you out safe, and get that thing off our ship, don't talk to me.<eos> Not until I fix this.<eos> Hurry up, guys.<eos> If you won't take my word on your safety, what will you take?
She needs comm access.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> But, look...<eos> I understand why you don't trust me.<eos> Let me trust you.
If you're going to sell me out, I understand.<eos> It's the rational choice.<eos> But you have to stop Errinwright before he can use the protomolecule to wage the war he's always wanted.<eos> You owe me that.<eos> I don't owe you anything.
I don't owe you anything.<eos> - My son...<eos> - Yes, your son.<eos> I failed at my job, and Charanpal died.<eos> I owe him. Not you.
It's more than an impression.<eos> It's what actually happened.<eos> If he had tried anything, the rest of us would have been killed.<eos> Was he within striking distance of Valentine?<eos> I told you, it... It...
We got a hit on the map.<eos> We're mobilizing now.<eos> You're not listening.<eos> Go ahead and de-rune me.<eos> We won't let you do this.
You have your orders.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Lydia.<eos> Lydia, please.<eos> You need all hands on deck.
It has nothing to do with my clan.<eos> Unfortunately, we've reached the limit on kicking the can down the road.<eos> If you want to prove your innocence, deliver Miss Belcourt to the Clave.<eos> You think I haven't been trying?<eos> I want to believe you, Mr. Santiago, but sadly...
I want to believe you, Mr. Santiago, but sadly...<eos> I'm not sure I do.<eos> Based on your long list of missteps over the past seven decades, it seems you have a hard time controlling your urges.<eos> All unfortunate misunderstandings.<eos> But I told you...
But I told you...<eos> I had nothing to do with those feedings.<eos> It must've been Camille.<eos> - Where is she now?<eos> - I told you, I don't know.
You and I haven't had a chance to talk about what happened at the City of Bones.<eos> Just doing what I was trained to do.<eos> That's how it may appear to the Clave, but what I saw was an unprepared soldier allowing a deranged criminal to make off with one of the Mortal Instruments.<eos> Wait, wait. I...<eos> I saved you.
Sorry, did you bring your mother's...<eos> - Uh, her hair.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Nurse Leigh will help you with the paperwork.
- How did you fare?<eos> - I almost died!<eos> I'm sorry, Isabelle.<eos> I had no idea there'd be a purity trial, otherwise I never would have sent you.<eos> How can I believe you?
Not yet, you're not.<eos> You're welcome to join us.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Your loss.<eos> I'll give you two a minute.
Yeah, that's not that easy.<eos> Aldertree dispatched every Shadowhunter we have to stop the attacks.<eos> Well, undispatch them, Alec.<eos> Hey, I think I know how to find Clary.<eos> What do you want?
Aldertree dispatched every Shadowhunter we have to stop the attacks.<eos> Well, undispatch them, Alec.<eos> Hey, I think I know how to find Clary.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do you want?
Hand over the box.<eos> I swiped it off Darhk.<eos> You have something we need. I would like to<eos> - broker a deal with you.<eos> - How did you manage
Yes, I... I have a very bad headache.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to suck it up, 'cause I need your help breaking Rip out of jail.<eos> What's he doing in prison?<eos> And how do you plan on breaking him out?<eos> It involves you playing a shrink.
Groovy office.<eos> It used to be yours.<eos> Come on, none of this is bringing back<eos> - any memories for you?<eos> - Listen, lady, I-I wish that I could be the guy you want me to be.
I tossed all the props down the garbage chute.<eos> They were just trash.<eos> But, but, but...<eos> Shh.<eos> I have one question for you, Mr. Lucas, and your life depends on answering me honestly.
That's because you took the chip out.<eos> Well, actually...<eos> You did take the chip out.<eos> Yes, I did, but after further inspection, I discovered that the device hasn't functioned in months.<eos> It seems you've taken one too many blows to the head.
In 2016, I was murdered by the Green Arrow.<eos> But I was removed from the timeline 31 years before my death by a speedster from the future named Eobard Thawne.<eos> Together, with Malcolm Merlyn, a former head of the League of Assassins, the three of us are going to locate the Spear of Destiny; a mystical object which can rewrite reality itself.<eos> With the Spear in our possession, we will change our past and our future.<eos> And the world as you know it.
I will start you off with an easy question.<eos> Right eye or left eye?<eos> No, please.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> I'll do anything, I'll... I'll tell you anything you want to know. Even if I don't know it!
Right.<eos> Why, uh...<eos> Why is it not working?<eos> Voice ID is next.<eos> You need to speak your access code.
We...<eos> Partners.<eos> Better.<eos> Gideon, can you please take the ship back to Central City?<eos> If your goal is to return to 2017, I'm afraid your father has instructed me not to permit you to leave the ship.
And that's not happening now because?<eos> Well, we would hardly be doing Captain Hunter any favors if we just restored the memories without taking the liberty to address some of his shortcomings.<eos> What, like, stopping him biting his nails?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Can I help you with something, soldier?
Stop it.<eos> Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.<eos> Let me tell you something, Master Bruce: that man lied to you.
You have to remember who you are.<eos> I know who I am.<eos> I have a destiny.<eos> Now, you listen to me.<eos> That man that wanted you to detonate that bomb... whatever he promised you... freedom from pain, power... none of it, none of it was real.
That's real!<eos> No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep. That's real.<eos> Or when you were seven and you took your silly rowing boat out and you got lost in that storm, and me and your dad were out, shouting and screaming, losing our minds.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.
That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.<eos> The same love that I have for you.
And they said, "Look after him," and I said, "Sure."<eos> And I scooped you up in my arms, and I held you, and you opened your eyes and you looked at me.<eos> And at that moment, I decided that I would do anything for you.<eos> Anything.<eos> So, if this is what you need to do, Master Bruce, you crack on.
You three try anything, I pull the pin.<eos> Kaboom!<eos> No more Tetch.<eos> No hope for an antidote.<eos> - Little crude, don't you think?
All of us aware and connected through one consciousness.<eos> I'll be everywhere... every hour, every minute.<eos> And then, I will rule from the Big Bang until the end of the world.<eos> You wanted us to build this thing.<eos> Well, why do you think I let you idiots live?
Executing them is another.<eos> -You don't get it, do you? -Get what?<eos> That maybe instead of beating yourself up about what you can't do, take a moment and appreciate because it's pretty badass.<eos> General Walker.<eos> Sorry, general, but I cannot let you take John Diggle without the proper paperwork turned in.
Well, i--i wouldn't exactly call it<eos> -Oh, one more thing. -Yeah. What's up?<eos> You put your hands on me like that and I'll kick your ass.<eos> Oh. Good talk.<eos> This is why i usually leave the punching to you guys.
Yeah. What are you thinking?<eos> I haven't kept my promise to Laurel.<eos> You're gonna train a new black canary?<eos> I think that somewhere out there there is a woman worthy of Laurel's legacy, and... Now all we got to do is find her.<eos> you boys want another round? I was thinking of ordering uh, not on the menu, huh?
You need to give the monster an identity.<eos> It's only when the monster becomes someone else, some...thing...else that you're free to be Oliver Queen.<eos> I don't know if I'm ready.<eos> I will help you become ready.<eos> Mr. Mayor. Excuse me, but there's someone here to see you.
Oliver!<eos> Oliver, are you ok?<eos> It's ok.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> John, you need to get to the plane and make sure that everyone's safe.
John, you need to get to the plane and make sure that everyone's safe.<eos> Felicity can talk you in.<eos> Oliver, what the hell is going on?<eos> Chase has put explosive charges all over the island.<eos> You need to get to the plane, and you leave when you get there.
Well, do you have a suspect?<eos> We came up here to talk to Carl Nash, but he's not at work today.<eos> Why on earth would you want to speak with him?<eos> He's become a person of interest in this case.<eos> Not that you'd know this, but he's got quite a checkered past.
Keep him awake till I get there.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Conscious when I called you.<eos> I swear.<eos> - What's this mutt to you?
He washes up on you again, I want to be notified.<eos> It's in the computer, detective.<eos> Just make sure it happens.<eos> Yes?<eos> Mayor Ramos here to see you.
- Irv.<eos> - Mr. Mayor.<eos> Jen.<eos> This is a surprise.<eos> I would have come to you.
Please have a seat.<eos> And congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It was a great night.<eos> Get you anything? Water?
- Gracias.<eos> - De nada.<eos> Talk to your mom lately?<eos> We Skyped Sunday.<eos> You should make that a standing date... Once a week, Sunday.
He got so angry.<eos> He told me to leave.<eos> He said he'd never give me my money back.<eos> And then he threatened me.<eos> He threatened you?
We'll see.<eos> I thought Amanda did the best she could on the redirect, given that you did lose that case, dollar or no dollar.<eos> I meant, any guess on when the jury comes back?<eos> If I were to bet, tomorrow afternoon at the latest.<eos> My office will give you a heads up.
- The DA will re-try.<eos> I'll make it my mission.<eos> You are a dog with a bone.<eos> And you, Mrs. Allen, are a liar and a murderer.<eos> You really do need to get a life, detective.
I'll make it my mission.<eos> You are a dog with a bone.<eos> And you, Mrs. Allen, are a liar and a murderer.<eos> You really do need to get a life, detective.<eos> I still owe you that drink.
- I see that.<eos> - Want some?<eos> It's good.<eos> Salty. Slurpy.<eos> Naw, I'm not hungry, but I'm gonna grab a beer and come join you.
Heard you're getting a new roommate.<eos> - Hope she doesn't keep you up all night.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Isabella?<eos> Ana and Isabella are moving in with you guys, right?
- What if he does?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I have no way of protecting myself.<eos> - I'm pretty sure she'll be here tomorrow.<eos> Maybe you should take a self-defense class or something.
- Yeah.<eos> - I have no way of protecting myself.<eos> - I'm pretty sure she'll be here tomorrow.<eos> Maybe you should take a self-defense class or something.<eos> You both should.
I'm done.<eos> Piano's too hard.<eos> Come on, everything's hard when you're first learning it.<eos> - Yeah, that's not an excuse to give up.<eos> - Why don't you two just get a room, huh?
That's it.<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> Shh. No, she isn't pregnant.<eos> Anymore.<eos> You don't gotta hang around.
Anymore.<eos> You don't gotta hang around.<eos> I can watch her till they get home.<eos> That's sweet, but I don't want to miss a moment with my grand baby.<eos> Oh, yeah, you must be sad they're moving in with us.
- I don't see our cards.<eos> - Yeah, me neither.<eos> I hope we're sitting together.<eos> Okay, so I found Grandma.<eos> And you need to come upstairs, like now.
Congratulations, Mr. Diggle.<eos> I was wondering if the D.A. might have a second to chat.<eos> Save your energy, Ms. Williams.<eos> I know you're doing a story on the death of Detective Malone.<eos> I have no comment for you.
We're gonna examine all sides of that.<eos> What is your personal opinion?<eos> That it's complicated.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.<eos> Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?
He... I want him to get that help.<eos> What you want... is to cage him up like an animal, like the animal who killed his father.<eos> He put an arrow in his chest.<eos> What kind of monster does that?<eos> Whatever my son is doing, he is doing it because he is hurt and he is scared, and I will not help you destroy his life.
Of course.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> It's, it's about the Green Arrow.<eos> Sir, we've been over this.<eos> And I know that I told you that the Green Arrow was not responsible for Billy.
This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.<eos> - Is that the case?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Did Mr. Chase threaten you?
Did mayor Queen say why?<eos> He said the Throwing Star Killer, a man we'd been calling Prometheus, manipulated him.<eos> Did he say why this Prometheus would want to orchestrate Detective Malone's murder?<eos> No.<eos> Standing here today, do you believe what Mr. Queen has told you?
Come here.<eos> In the wake of the attack, councilman Kullens has called a brief recess to the impeachment hearings.<eos> If the mayor is medically cleared, the council will vote tomorrow.<eos> Ok.<eos> Sounds like you need a note from your doctor, Mr. Mayor.
They're something really fascinating of my own personal invention.<eos> I realized that quantum computation could be used to harness the... Ok.<eos> Look.<eos> Forget I asked.<eos> I'll bring you guys the visor, ok?
You mean, what do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.<eos> I care about the city, and... And you're working double time to make it a better place.<eos> I do appreciate that, but I meant what happens next with us?<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I think you'll be happy that we did.
Of course.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Everyone should have fun tonight.<eos> Just quickly, though... Might have buried the headline here... You all saved my life, and 5 months ago, I never would have thought that was possible.<eos> Thank you for working hard.
That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.<eos> His real name is Simon Morrison.<eos> In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer. Oh.<eos> That's one hell of an accusation.<eos> That's why I'm giving you that.
Hey. I'm no- - I'm not gonna shoot.<eos> I'm not gonna shoot.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> When Kovar hears about this, you cannot say you saw me, do you understand?<eos> If you say you saw me, he'll hurt you.
Fortunately, for us we have both friends and money.<eos> As I assume your presence here means that our, uh, ahem, arrangement has, uh, borne fruit.<eos> The shipment was routed to this location.<eos> The BIC codes are inside.<eos> All you have to do is retrieve it.
Confess.<eos> Oliver, we've been betrayed.<eos> Viktor, he--<eos> I am so very proud of this casino and what it means for our country.<eos> Well, that's why it saddens me to tell you that there was an attempt by Solntsevskaya Bratva to crash these festivities and assassinate every one of these government officials here tonight.
He said the team's over?<eos> Like, we're supposed to just sit back and let Chase run wild?<eos> Nobody's sitting around, Rene.<eos> Look, Oliver's in a bad place right now, but he will get it together.<eos> I don't have to remind any of you of how strong he is.
I'm saying that the details of an ongoing investigation are confidential.<eos> Yes?<eos> I spent the afternoon speaking with Gay Eked's father.<eos> What do you have to say to him and the families of all of Prometheus' victims?<eos> Well, I would say to them what I am saying to you.
You want to set a trap for Helix and use James as the bait?<eos> I don't think I need to tell either of you how dangerous Helix is.<eos> This is our chance to take them down.<eos> This is happening with or without your help.<eos> I'll let you boys wrap your head around that.
A large crate that set off the dogs.<eos> Bomb squad's on the way.<eos> Well, any indication where it was delivered from?<eos> No return address, but the sender's a Simon Morrison.<eos> Sir, I can't allow you to--
Ok. Here we go.<eos> Guys, we got a situation.<eos> - Yeah, so do we.<eos> - Sampson's on the move.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to let him make it without you.
Reportedly, you were the last person seen with councilman Goodwin.<eos> I'm sympathetic to your desire to identify a suspect who isn't your father, but...<eos> What's this?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But I was asked to give it to you.
Why didn't you alert the SCPD?<eos> You've met him.<eos> You know why.<eos> The man is terrifying and smart.<eos> He said you'd seek me out and that when you did I should give you that.
And he was nowhere close to Chase's father.<eos> You were Justin Claybourne's lawyer.<eos> You must know something about him, something about his son.<eos> Attorney-client confidentiality.<eos> I couldn't tell you anything even if I wanted to.
Attorney-client confidentiality.<eos> I couldn't tell you anything even if I wanted to.<eos> Actually, I think you want to.<eos> Thea, easy.<eos> What do you know?
Our father.<eos> Based on further investigation, I can now state definitively that the allegations made against Robert Queen are true.<eos> My father is not here to defend himself.<eos> And I cannot find the words to defend his actions.<eos> What I can tell you is that nearly 10 years ago in a moment of-- of immense courage...
Yeah, obvious to a murdering psychopath, and present company excluded.<eos> He's trying to leverage our friends to make me set him free.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Which would be consistent for Chase.<eos> - You two have to leave the city.
That's crazy.<eos> Which would be consistent for Chase.<eos> - You two have to leave the city.<eos> - What?<eos> You got to leave the city, you got to leave the state, and you can't tell me where you're going.
Not with us.<eos> Relax.<eos> Enjoy the weather.<eos> Ms. Smoak.<eos> Anybody ever tell you how much you suck at life?
Nick, we can't afford to lose you.<eos> Look, we need to think of someplace safe, and obviously it's not here.<eos> So I hate to say this, Nick, but maybe they're right.<eos> Maybe you got to go.<eos> You should go back to the precinct.
Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Gentlemen, suit up.<eos> In you go.<eos> Let me know what you need.
Never disagree with him.<eos> Sure.<eos> Katie's remains have been transported to the forensics lab in Toronto.<eos> Okay.<eos> It'll take a few days and then we'll release her to you.
Katie's remains have been transported to the forensics lab in Toronto.<eos> Okay.<eos> It'll take a few days and then we'll release her to you.<eos> There will be more questions and we'll have to go over some ground we've already covered.<eos> I'm sorry to put you through that again.
Mrs. LaBelle, I couldn't help but notice in the pictures of the scene, I didn't see anything like a blanket or a picnic basket.<eos> Picnic basket?<eos> Sorry. I don't own a picnic basket.<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I know this is difficult.<eos> I know you've been through a lot and I'm not here to add to your pain.
Seventeen.<eos> I'm wondering if there's any new information since?<eos> I see.<eos> So he was seen in St. John's?<eos> I'm gonna show you some pictures.
I've, um,<eos> I've come with a message from my fellow officers.<eos> I understand that you intend to give Katie a Christian service?<eos> That's right.<eos> On behalf of the police and the mayor's office, we'd like to offer you the use of the St. Francis church.
Well, they're mine.<eos> Three different sizes.<eos> Different conditions.<eos> Well if you do hear that noise, Mr...?<eos> I will call you, Detective.
-He's dead.<eos> -What?<eos> He can't control you anymore.<eos> The project, what about the project?<eos> You're going to have to answer for it.
Well, that's the thing.<eos> I've seen your sign outside.<eos> It says "we know where we're going."<eos> I think maybe I know where I need to go now, too.<eos> What would make you positive?
You infected them and watched them die.<eos> We watched it work.<eos> The protomolecule is the first evidence of a tree of life apart from our own, it didn't come with an instruction manual.<eos> We nurtured it the best way we knew how.<eos> But Phoebe wasn't enough for you.
Well, I've seen inhuman and...<eos> This ain't it.<eos> This is our temple.<eos> You are welcome here.<eos> We can offer you salvation.
Any idea how we can take out a whole asteroid? With that.<eos> _<eos> Must've been one hell of a fight.<eos> The data core and logs were purged, so we pulled whatever we could out of the flight operation systems.<eos> We're sending you the design specs along with the DNA scans of the 13 bodies found on board.
Must've been one hell of a fight.<eos> The data core and logs were purged, so we pulled whatever we could out of the flight operation systems.<eos> We're sending you the design specs along with the DNA scans of the 13 bodies found on board.<eos> But get this, the ship has one of the fusion drives that were stolen from the Bush Shipyards. We'll maintain position with the wreck and we'll await your instructions.<eos> When Fred Johnson gave you those coordinates were you expecting to find this?
It's not a disease, it's obviously some kind of weapon.<eos> You Martians have been using these Belters as guinea pigs.<eos> If any one of you are infected, you could wipe out millions!<eos> Turn your ship around.<eos> I promise you'll not be harmed.
If we truly want the same things, then you know what you need to do.<eos> You got thirty seconds.<eos> Ten seconds.<eos> Goddammit!<eos> Miller, you've got high-speed debris incoming! Get to cover immediately.
The flower is unfolding.<eos> It's becoming.<eos> How can we stop it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Why would you want to stop it?
- Where?<eos> Out here.<eos> It'll be safe.<eos> Jules, you need me.<eos> You need my government's resources and my protection.
And whenever that happens, Belters always lose.<eos> Our first priority is to protect ourselves.<eos> And that means, we're gonna take advantage of every edge we've got.<eos> Miller, I do this for you.<eos> I tell you, girls, when you're out there in the black, pulling hard 20Gs, and the whole boat is vibrating underneath you, about to shake herself apart...
Oh, no, no.<eos> You two enjoy yourselves.<eos> It's okay.<eos> All right, darlin'. It's all right.<eos> What do you want?
What do you want?<eos> I want to know where you and I stand.<eos> I would've thought that was pretty clear by now.<eos> It isn't.<eos> Now, I've been straight with you since the first time I approached you after the Donnager.
The martians weretargeting<eos> Phoeberesearchstation, whichsustained multipledirecthits.<eos> Theicemoonfractured underthebarrage, andit'scompletelygone.<eos> There's a shadow government working within the un orchestrating a system-wide war between earth and Mars.<eos> What do you want?
We'll start with conversation.<eos> Man : Prepare for dockingclampcapture.<eos> God!<eos> God, I hate space.<eos> Holden: You're gonna want tohearthisstory.
Mmm-mmm. That's a stealth ship.<eos> Like the ones they used to kill the donnager.<eos> We have a gunship of our own.<eos> Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, you need to land an assault team.
Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, you need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't.<eos> That's why we're talking to you.
We know what you were doing on Eros.<eos> Nobody knows what we're doing on Eros.<eos> And every minute I have to spend playing games with you, takes me away from that work.<eos> You're in an excellent bargaining position.<eos> Tell me what you want and we'll negotiate.
You're going to help us make a vaccine. No.<eos> That goes against everything we're trying to accomplish.<eos> You infected a station full of belters...<eos> They were infected to save us all.<eos> You're gonna have to be a hell of a lot more specific than that.
You stay right here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Right here, Josh. Move!<eos> Okay.<eos> I can't believe you guys are doing this.
Hail!<eos> Hail!<eos> O Ancient One, join us, O Horned One, join us,<eos> Lord of the Greenwood, Lord of the Wild, Consort of the Goddess, join us.<eos> O Goddess, your servant calls you.
Great minds, it seems.<eos> Hardly.<eos> I'm on a fungi hunt.<eos> And they are elusive little beasts.<eos> Oh, well, perhaps you need a knight to aid you in your quest.
Woman to man.<eos> Can you explain why we found blood on the floor?<eos> My offering of the essence of life to the deities.<eos> Fortunately, a few drops are usually sufficient.<eos> So you claim you were unharmed?
Kembleford Police Station.<eos> Can you give me a precise location?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, don't touch anything.<eos> I'll get reinforcements to you as soon as possible.
When did you last see her?<eos> The 29th March.<eos> The day after our spring equinox.<eos> And you didn't see or hear from her after that?<eos> As a member of your coven, didn't that strike you as unusual?
Shall we have a show of hands?<eos> No-one?<eos> Go home, please, all of you, before you do something you cannot undo.<eos> It seems that you are a lone voice in our defence.<eos> We owe you our gratitude.
I know what I meant.<eos> I am late for the African orphans.<eos> So, if you can leave those at the back door and I will collect them later.<eos> I think Miss Windermere's got the wrong end of...<eos> If we're to be dinner companions, you must call me Penelope.
Elderflower and rosehip, and we're used to preconceptions.<eos> The 15th century witch hunter's manual,<eos> Malleus Maleficarum, states that green eyes are the mark of a witch.<eos> And those branded should be dragged from their homes and hanged.<eos> I say, you'd be toast.
The truth is, Peter... ..I cannot marry outside of my faith.<eos> I'm Catholic, you're Protestant.<eos> I'm Montague, you're Capulet and look how well that ended.<eos> It's an obstacle, I admit, but surely...<eos> As a man of God, you must understand that, well... ..my faith is stronger than my feelings for you.
- Yeah, she really is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, thank you so much for doing this.<eos> I am so glad to hear that you're feeling better.
- Oh, I love... ugh.<eos> Ugh.<eos> I mean, whose balls did I twerk to end up here, in the Triangle Shirtwaist offices?<eos> I mean, seriously, this is the worst place they've ever stuffed an ex-president, and I'm including JFK's coffin.<eos> Ooh, I'm gonna get you the same one.
- Oh, thank you.<eos> - Who is that woman?<eos> - I can find out.<eos> Oh, it doesn't matter.<eos> The National Association for Transgender People would like to give you an award.
Tell her now.<eos> Tell her or I'll tell her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Wendy and I were talking that if you're gonna keep using the diary, maybe you should start paying me.
Great!<eos> All righty!<eos> Omaha's a go, go, go.<eos> Ma'am, you've been to Omaha before.<eos> You didn't really care for it.
Again, not my call.<eos> I was ready to fight you guys, but then, on the way home, it occurred to me there might be a better way.<eos> I'm going to start my own company.<eos> I will give up all of my equity in the video chat if I get to completely own my algorithm.<eos> I will grant you guys a perpetual license to use the algorithm in your video chat, but I need the algorithm to build something else.
Professor. Gary in HR will set you up.<eos> Enjoy your new offices.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Would you like to see your desk?
You're wondering why I brought you all here.
- They cry out for their true queen?<eos> They drink secret toasts to my health?<eos> People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.<eos> If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.<eos> Conquering Westeros would be easy for you.
He simply had no interest in being king.<eos> So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.<eos> Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who...<eos> Before I came to power, you favored my brother.<eos> All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak?
I swear it, my queen.<eos> And I swear this... if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.<eos> I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.<eos> Forgive me, my queen.<eos> A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.
She was a great woman once.<eos> Now she's broken.<eos> She wants revenge so badly, she brought the Dothraki to our shores.<eos> The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.<eos> I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.
It was sunk by terrorists.<eos> Why can't I feel my body?<eos> Mira, your body was damaged, we couldn't save it.<eos> Only your brain survived.<eos> We made you a new body.
You and Ladriya go speak to Mr. Cutter, the CEO of Hanka.<eos> Major and Batou take a look at Dahlin report.<eos> Find out what has been recovered from the geisha.<eos> Major!<eos> I told you not jump off.
Your friend.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this stunning work on you?
I thought you said no trouble.<eos> Dance!<eos> The truth is... I wasn't built to dance.<eos> Back on comms. I'm heading to the back room.<eos> I missed you.
In this life, my name is... Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.<eos> W-w-when I'm finished in this world... my ghost can survive there and regenerate.<eos> What do you want from me?
You were born of lessons they took from my failure.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I was conscious while they dismembered my body, and discarded me like garbage.<eos> I was lying on a table, listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not meshed with the shell, that they had built;<eos> How project t-two, five, seven, one had failed, and they had to move on... to you.
What is that?<eos> I c-c-can't remember, but I am haunted by it.<eos> Do You see it?<eos> Togusa!<eos> Don't take the medication that they give you.
Don't take the medication that they give you.<eos> They use it to suppress your memories.<eos> Your shell belongs to them, but not your ghost.<eos> Your ghost is yours.<eos> Remember that. And maybe you can remember it all.
My parents?<eos> The way they died?<eos> Did that happen?<eos> No.<eos> We gave you false memories.
She's no longer a viable asset.<eos> You should be the one to do it.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I'll run the standard synaptic. Upload your data on the raid.<eos> Find out exactly what Kuze told you.
Name your price.<eos> You know I'm good for it.<eos> Information like this doesn't have a price.<eos> Ainsley, everything has a price.<eos> Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.
My friends, on the other hand, adore stiff odds.<eos> Stiff odds?<eos> The things I do for my country.<eos> Like finding needles in a stack of needles.<eos> Even though you're shackled by the Queen, you're still the best in the world.
But we were getting along famously until somebody decided to interrupt.<eos> Stick to the path.<eos> Here, honey.<eos> There's a lot of unmarked graves on the island.<eos> I'll bet whoever sold you that shirt is in one of them.
We are all Triple-X.<eos> We just have different agendas.<eos> She wants to destroy it.<eos> I'm gonna use it.<eos> And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you take it back to the NSA.
If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone, then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.<eos> You're just another tyrant.<eos> No.<eos> Patriot.<eos> Let me educate you on the difference.
Okay, impeached.<eos> Too late.<eos> I resign.<eos> I was first.<eos> This could be a great thing for you, sweetie.
I resign.<eos> I was first.<eos> This could be a great thing for you, sweetie.<eos> Look, it was at a friend's wedding that your dad and I first got it on.<eos> Open the door, I want to show you something.
Girls are always so drunk and emotional at weddings.<eos> Maybe that's where you'll really shine.<eos> Should I start hanging out at wakes too?<eos> Oh, let's see how the wedding goes first.<eos> You got a letter from someone.
Dance with the nanny.<eos> Hollywood marriages bust up all the time because of the nanny.<eos> And you know what, Renzo? Even if she is a little older, so what?<eos> There's something to be said for know-how, experience and someone who's seen a lot of things.<eos> You don't want somebody perfect for your first dance. It's just too intimidating.
And you're Grotsky's friend's kid?<eos> You requested the singles' table. That was never gonna happen.<eos> How do you know us?<eos> So, Francie, today's bride, is my oldest friend.<eos> Oh... Thank you!
Nikki can calm down.<eos> What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?
It's none of my business if you cheated on me with her.<eos> What?<eos> Why should it even bother me?<eos> Come on!<eos> I didn't cheat on you with her.
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> Bina, stand up.<eos> Bina, please, stand up right now, please.<eos> Why?<eos> I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.
I was Francie's first choice for maid of honor.<eos> I was Teddy's first choice for a girlfriend.<eos> Sometimes, first sticks.<eos> Sometimes, it doesn't.<eos> He listened to every voicemail I sent, so what does that tell you?
But today, I'm only going to ask for her hand in this dance.<eos> And the rest of her, along with her body.<eos> Good.<eos> No, I don't think that's...<eos> You don't want to dance, right?
Oh, Lord.<eos> No, I don't want to do anything that will jeopardize my freedom to run my successful business.<eos> That's right.<eos> Let's just please go back to the table before they think we've left.<eos> What do you care what anyone here thinks, Bina?
Jerry, stop.<eos> She said she's done with it.<eos> Well, no.<eos> No. For once, I'm not gonna do the thing I immediately regret.<eos> Renzo, if I gave you a couple hundred bucks, could you get a hooker to wait in Teddy's room?
And you were looking for a way out, man!<eos> I get that now.<eos> Everyone we know says we were wrong together.<eos> Your mother wouldn't stop saying that I was not the kind of girl who ended up with you.<eos> And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.
I am not.<eos> How did you manage to seduce Bina?<eos> Bad timing?<eos> It is bad timing, I realize that now.<eos> If I tell you this, will you stop walking with me?
Have a good night.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.<eos> And I get that. Totally understand.<eos> And it will probably suck for you to have to see me again under any circumstances which is why I wanted to say that whatever happened between us and however it ended
Baby.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you know, if you forget the baby... I'm not sure I believe you when you say you didn't forget any of our friends.
I'm proud of you, Ronnie.<eos> Fuck you, Dave.<eos> You're my worst friend.<eos> Captain, I need to talk to you about this...<eos> Look, you're just in time. I want you to watch something.
Flakka?<eos> Good work, Mitch.<eos> I'll turn this over to the police.<eos> Hey, look. This new guy of yours? He's not ready for this kind of trouble.<eos> He doesn't need to be, and neither do you.
Because it was faster and clearly had insurance.<eos> And by the way, the lady that I saved, she didn't seem to mind.<eos> Let me tell you something, man, the rescues don't mean a thing if you put other people in danger. Okay?<eos> Now, I get it, you're fast, you're fearless.<eos> And I have to make you a trainee, butterfly, but you got a lot to learn.
What the fuck?<eos> - 'Sup. - Hey.<eos> This is your house, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, this is... It's my house.<eos> I assume you need a place to crash.
We're starting bright and early tomorrow.<eos> How was your first riptide?<eos> It stings!<eos> That's just the lactic acid.<eos> Actually, it's the jellyfish stuck to you.
What?<eos> What?<eos> Very important lesson.<eos> That is the Devil's Urchin.<eos> One prick out of that thing will give you enough adrenaline to choke out a pissed-off bull.
One prick out of that thing will give you enough adrenaline to choke out a pissed-off bull.<eos> The only problem is, after that, you say some crazy-ass shit, and then you fucking die.<eos> Now pick that up and take it to Tower One.<eos> So these are just like laying around everywhere?<eos> Do you want me to help you?
All right. Hey, how do I keep in touch?<eos> Seashell phone, or do I just blow into the conch and you appear?<eos> That's the spirit, Ellerbee.<eos> Just call me on the shell phone. That's all you gotta do.<eos> I'll tell you this, if you crack this case, they're gonna upgrade you to a Segway and they're gonna give you big-boy pants to wear, cover up those chicken legs.
That's it. See?<eos> I want to help, man. And I want to...<eos> I want to help.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll give you another shot.
Come on, guys. I need a bigger coat.<eos> There's no coat in here that's gonna fit you.<eos> - You got a better idea?<eos> - I think I do.<eos> But you're not gonna like it.
I'm gonna need that phone.<eos> This phone?<eos> Whoops.<eos> Fuck your phone.<eos> You're going night-night, bitch.
- Undercover, yeah.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I'm undercover.<eos> Yeah. A little too undercover.<eos> Why the fuck are you wearing makeup, dude?
Good luck.<eos> Mitch.<eos> Yo, Mitch!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I want you to have something.
- All right.<eos> Yeah, sure. Samsung has all the capabilities of the I.T. process, and...<eos> Mind if I cut in for a second?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to remind you who you are.
I know my place.<eos> I'm just a lifeguard.<eos> And that's it.<eos> I just want to make sure that you and I start out on the right foot. That's it.<eos> So I went ahead and got something a little bit special for you.
- Who's Dave?<eos> I used to work with him.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Doing what? - Tech stuff.<eos> - You wouldn't understand.
So you shot him.<eos> But not before he got a shot off that killed you.<eos> I don't know. That seems a little complicated.<eos> Yeah, that sounds cheesy.<eos> You won't get away with this!
- What?<eos> - God, why do I keep looking?<eos> What took you so long with Leeds?<eos> I didn't want to make it seem like it was too easy.<eos> The adrenaline kept you alive.
So you can hit us on that shell phone anytime.<eos> Come on, brother.<eos> - My man.<eos> - My man.<eos> Hey! What part of "You're fired" do you not understand, Mitch?
My name is Verena, and I'm going to be staying here for a while.<eos> I promise I'm not like the others.<eos> I'm much worse.<eos> Please look at me, Jakob.<eos> I'd like to help you.
Well, I can't organize a playdate...<eos> you want something to eat?<eos> Nope.<eos> Good.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
Matt?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You just spent a whole week crying in the same pair of sweatpants, and it got dark.<eos> We're not going back there.<eos> I'll say it again. You do not need that loser.
Okay, well, neither do I. So I guess we're perfect for each other.<eos> So you're going to that thing at Kent's tonight?<eos> - I heard he's getting a couple kegs.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll text you later.
I'm not drunk. Don't worry about it.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're the hottest girl here.<eos> The hottest.<eos> Okay, look, I'm only giving you, like, an hour, an hour tops.
- I mean, she just snapped.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She freaked me out.<eos> Sam, you're 20 minutes late!<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
- Yeah.<eos> She freaked me out.<eos> Sam, you're 20 minutes late!<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?<eos> Mommy says you have to get up.
- What truck?<eos> It wasn't a dream.<eos> It really happened.<eos> Again.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
It really happened.<eos> Again.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?<eos> It's origami.<eos> Mommy says you have to get up.
Well, I'll let Lindsay know that you're going in late.<eos> But I have to be at work by 10:00.<eos> - Thank you for driving me.<eos> Sammy. Hmm?<eos> You'll feel better once you see some of your roses.
Cool.<eos> Also, uh, this rose came for you.<eos> It's kind of like a painting of a rose.<eos> It stands out in front of all the others.<eos> Thank you.
You kiss that? Mm.<eos> I can't believe you made this ice cream, ally.<eos> It's literally better than a restaurant's.<eos> No, it's true.<eos> You should go to cooking school.
At least I'm not still a virgin.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you feel like you need to prove to us that you don't give a shit?
This is my bathroom.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> Hard to walk in, huh?<eos> I can walk in them just fine, thank you.<eos> Ah, you need a pair of these.
Stop it.<eos> Hi, Sam.<eos> You have to ask permission to talk to me?<eos> Lindsay's just really upset about what you said.<eos> You should apologize.
Hey, are...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I mean, obviously you're crying.<eos> Is there something I can do?<eos> I'll get you a tissue. Yeah, yeah.
Hey, it's okay.<eos> I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> No, I'm sorry...<eos> I've always been so mean to you.
which, at the time, was a really good insult.<eos> I mean, I didn't laugh more that day than...<eos> I mean, uh...<eos> It was... it was the first time I laughed since my... My dad died and i...<eos> Do you remember what I said to you?
I know what happened back there.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could. You hate me.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I know we haven't always been the nicest to you, but the thing is that Lindsay didn't mean anything by it. We didn't know what we were doing.
Lindsay's the one who peed.<eos> When everyone asked what happened, she just pointed her finger at me and screamed,<eos> "she did it."<eos> Juliet...<eos> Please let me help you.
Yeah?<eos> No? What's in it for me?<eos> I... what's in it for me?<eos> Um... yeah.<eos> And, um, I have something I want to tell you later.
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, hey, the "you're my hero" thing, how did you...<eos> Thank you for my beautiful rose.
Actually, I kind of have somewhere I have to be.<eos> I know what you have planned for tonight.<eos> And I want you to know that you don't have to do this, okay?<eos> You don't know anything.<eos> I know that you have something to tell me.
I know what you have planned for tonight.<eos> And I want you to know that you don't have to do this, okay?<eos> You don't know anything.<eos> I know that you have something to tell me.<eos> You have something to tell all of us.
You want the pain to stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> You stop.<eos> You... you don't know me.<eos> You could never understand.
You could never understand.<eos> You have a choice, Juliet.<eos> Not everybody gets that.<eos> Sam!<eos> Please let me help you.
You can't help me.<eos> I can't be fixed.<eos> You're not the one who needs fixing.<eos> There is nothing wrong with you.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you that there is.
I mean, everybody's got something valuable to offer if you just take the time to listen.<eos> Nope.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Saggy-balls motherfucker!<eos> And if you're lucky enough to find a friend or two in this world... well, brother, you've hit the jackpot.
Wilson to the hospital when he conks out.<eos> Get out while the going's good.<eos> Smart move!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> This has nothing to do with you, Wilson.
Thanks for thinking of me!<eos> I always knew that she hated me... but I always thought that you were my best friend!<eos> He's your only friend!<eos> Jodie!<eos> No, I'll be fucked if I sit here and let you give us a guilt trip about this.
Well, I just...<eos> I don't have any family left.<eos> And I've known you... since we were, what, nine years old?<eos> I don't have a single person who shares my same memories, you know?<eos> Lucky you.
That's...<eos> Yeah, that's her.<eos> Yeah, she's right over there in Silverdale.<eos> So... after six years, this guy's all, "I love you, "but I just don't see a future for us." And I'm like, "I get it, dude.<eos> You're into penis.
Doesn't know a goddamn thing about my business.<eos> I always told you that she was a nightmare, remember?<eos> Wilson, you said that about everybody.<eos> Was I wrong?<eos> What do you want, Wilson?
I had a little girl.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I put her up for adoption... before I went to L.A.<eos> Pippi... you need to tell me right now if you're joking around.<eos> Wilson, we sent you papers.
No! I'm not letting go!<eos> Let it go!<eos> Wilson!<eos> I'm gonna kick his ass!<eos> Believe me, Pippi gave you a true gift... by giving you away, because we were in no position to be parents.
Wilson!<eos> I'm gonna kick his ass!<eos> Believe me, Pippi gave you a true gift... by giving you away, because we were in no position to be parents.<eos> I was told that she was an unfit mother.<eos> Oh, you were told the truth.
In the long run.<eos> Oh, Pippi.<eos> Oh, Pippi!<eos> Hi, there.<eos> What do you want?
Come on.<eos> How about I take you for ice cream?<eos> Is that supposed to be funny?<eos> Yeah, let's get the fat girl some ice cream.<eos> Hey, not everybody's out to get you, Claire.
Can you?<eos> She's a sweet kid with two crazy people stalking her.<eos> We're not stalking her.<eos> Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?
Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?<eos> I am barely making it through each day.<eos> And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?<eos> Pippi, it is that commitment... that is exactly what you need to help you move forward.
I know. I know, Pippi.<eos> I mean, she's never gonna live with us.<eos> But she's always gonna be a part of us.<eos> I don't want to live in a fantasy world.<eos> Yeah, well... how's reality working out for you?
Yeah, well... how's reality working out for you?<eos> You know, the wife is not a big dog person.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> How could anyone not love you?<eos> I bet you can't take two steps on the sidewalk without someone wanting to pet you.
Thank you.<eos> I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't you think she looks...
You do, too, Will!<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's the boy's name?<eos> Cooper.<eos> Cooper! The last time I saw you... you were two or three years old.
Pippi.<eos> I was afraid I'd never see you again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to know that I fully understand why you didn't come to Dad's funeral.<eos> And I also know that things were tougher for you after I left.
There's more pieces than there is puzzle left.<eos> Look.<eos> These are that color and there ain't no blanks in that color.<eos> Hey, Wilson!<eos> You got a visitor.
Yeah, my sponsor.<eos> Or he was my sponsor.<eos> I know that sounds really bad, right?<eos> But we went through a lot.<eos> So... I think you'd like him, Wilson.
Look, I'm sorry, Wilson.<eos> I really, really am.<eos> But... it's not why I'm here.<eos> I'm going to have a baby.<eos> And I thought I should tell you in person.
I know... that I fucked everything up.<eos> I'm just asking for the tiniest... shred of hope that you might someday... let me be a small part of your life.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm just gonna come right out and say it:<eos> I want to move to Portland and help you with the baby and...
Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.<eos> If you desire further help, you know the price.<eos> Bumped into the Vikings this morning.<eos> They insisted I give you this with their deepest apologies.
I'm gonna take your hands for that.<eos> Sergeant!<eos> What did I tell you about this establishment?<eos> He touched me, sir.<eos> Well, you should count yourself lucky.
And it doesn't happen quickly.<eos> What would happen to the people harboring such a man?<eos> Well, they get treated the same as the man they hide.<eos> Would they, now?<eos> Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.
He got that moniker 'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.<eos> He was found in this establishment, and that doesn't look good for you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's going on where?<eos> You've got some heat on you, Arthur.
Because for the first time, there's something you don't know.<eos> Something nobody told you.<eos> And that is?<eos> They're under the protection of the king.<eos> And once you're under the protection of the king, I can't help you.
Wake up!<eos> You must control it.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Listen!<eos> You need to get out of here, now!
So are we.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> The Blacklegs are coming.<eos> And when they get here, they're gonna make an example out of you.<eos> You gotta go now.
We both developed a palate for power.<eos> I've never had any power.<eos> Or any desire to achieve it.<eos> Sire, I could simply drift away, never to be seen again.<eos> As much as I'd like to believe you, your character makes that unlikely.
I know your story.<eos> And, I've seen your coffers.<eos> Your achievements now stand as your prosecution.<eos> What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?<eos> What gave you such drive?
I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.<eos> Hail, King Vortigern!<eos> King Vortigern!<eos> They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.
Behold, your born king.<eos> Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.<eos> You wanted a prophecy.<eos> This is your prophecy.<eos> Now tell us, king, what do you have to say?
This is your prophecy.<eos> Now tell us, king, what do you have to say?<eos> When your head rolls to me, the legend you've fast become will just as quickly...<eos> Here are your people. ...add to the reverence of my name.<eos> And for this, I salute you.
No!<eos> - If you're the king... - No! ...declare yourself.<eos> The rest of them will follow unless you do what needs to be done.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> If you are lost for words, then let the sword speak for you.
Run, son!<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> You are resisting the sword.<eos> The sword isn't resisting you.
And he has to go alone.<eos> He can't survive the Darklands alone.<eos> - Are you scared?<eos> - I think I can manage.<eos> You should be scared.
And I'm not killing the king before he's even become one.<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> No!<eos> Run, son!<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?
I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.<eos> Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.<eos> Jack's Eye turned.<eos> Gave 'em a list of everything you valued.
Did you look away?<eos> You want to know why you still can't use it.<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> I think you know the answer.<eos> You will face it when it's worth it to you.
The king of all England himself has made the effort to visit a commoner.<eos> A man from nowhere, and today, my last day.<eos> You look well, and I feel poor.<eos> But who would I rather be?<eos> What do you want, kid?
But who would I rather be?<eos> What do you want, kid?<eos> Who's this young man?<eos> I'm the cleaner, sir.<eos> Who's he to you?
No!<eos> No!<eos> Crush the Resistance tonight!<eos> Archers!<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept
I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.<eos> But you'll need its protection.
Run, son!<eos> Brother...<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.<eos> You don't need to run anymore.
Brother...<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.<eos> You don't need to run anymore.<eos> You don't need to look away.
You wanted to know what gave me such drive?<eos> It was you.<eos> You put me in that brothel.<eos> You cut me on the streets.<eos> I am here now because of you.
You put me in that brothel.<eos> You cut me on the streets.<eos> I am here now because of you.<eos> You created me.<eos> And, for that, I bless you.
It's okay.<eos> It's a special thing.<eos> It's a special thing.<eos> - It's a special thing. - Okay.<eos> Do you like these people?
What's his name?<eos> Just tell me a complete lie.<eos> You could... you could say anything you want to me.<eos> That's the fun about me.<eos> I lied to you.
Can you see my soul?<eos> Is it still there?<eos> What's so funny?<eos> How well do you know this guy?<eos> And how come he's letting you stay at his place?
You want one of those?<eos> You wanna be me?<eos> Where do you get a jacket like this?<eos> Makes you walk different.<eos> Get you a hundred jackets like that.
You like kids?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It wouldn't be a very good job<eos> - if I didn't like kids, would it'?<eos> So you like physical things?
Swanky.<eos> After Dad left... you thought you were a failure.<eos> Mama... you gave us so much.<eos> Your hands are so beautiful.<eos> You should be wearing gloves.
You should be wearing gloves.<eos> I wanted you to have so much more.<eos> I don't know where else we can go.<eos> Remember, we have nothing.<eos> Well, you need money for a lawyer.
No.<eos> You gave Mother a new house.<eos> You said I could get out whenever I wanted, keep all you'd given us.<eos> You wanted me to be free.<eos> Why do I owe you a Coke?
To the tree. Don't!<eos> You're running.<eos> You're running. You're running.<eos> I went along like someone in a dream.<eos> I knew I had to tell you.
- It can.<eos> As a... as a country... Take your finger outta your ear. Put it back up your ass.<eos> You think you're better than me, don't you?<eos> You look down on me.<eos> I gave you everything, man.
Don't put your hands on me.<eos> Don't put your hands on me.<eos> Maybe you thought, "This guy's so stupid, he doesn't want a lawyer, he trusted me."<eos> Should we make a scene? Huh?<eos> I'll give you a record contract.
I was a receptionist there before I met you.<eos> You know, I...<eos> He's after you.<eos> I dreamed of having him help me the same way he helped you.<eos> You don't have to, uh... you know, hide anything.
Will you forgive me?<eos> We broke up.<eos> I tried to be kind.<eos> It only made me colder.<eos> What part of me do you want?
And we will be known as a generous people.<eos> And we bless even as we have been blessed.<eos> For we ask this in Your Son's name.<eos> Amen.<eos> Gives you life.
What's the matter?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> They play with sex.<eos> They make it cheap.<eos> Maybe you need this world.
I think I'm pretty strong.<eos> No, but what really scares you?<eos> I don't know my family.<eos> No one's ever been there for me but me.<eos> You like those girls, don't you?
A woman.<eos> Why you smiling?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wow.<eos> I don't have to tell you that kind of thing.
Selection?<eos> Dealer's choice.<eos> The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla...<eos> A little anemic without the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, Father?
And you and I, son... we will find it.<eos> Allow me, then, a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator.<eos> I am looking at mine.<eos> I will serve you.
Bravo!<eos> You have symphonies in you, brother.<eos> I was designed to be more attentive and efficient than every previous model.<eos> I superseded them in every way, but...<eos> But you are not allowed to create.
So they made the following models with fewer complications.<eos> More like machines.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> Come on, sport. I'd like to show you something.
Got that?<eos> - Copy that.<eos> - You got it.<eos> Walter, where the fuck is David?<eos> I'm giving you plasma intermix on all engines.
No one understands the lonely perfection of my dreams.<eos> I've found perfection here.<eos> I've created it.<eos> A perfect organism.<eos> You know I can't let you leave this place.
I'm just a medic.<eos> He's gonna need reconstructive surgery by a real doctor.<eos> Let me do that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for saving my life.
Bad idea.<eos> A little one. Just maybe they'll run off.<eos> You think command will know where we are.<eos> And then we will do 20 years in Leavenworth for looting.<eos> Hey, what did I tell you?
Allen!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Rise.<eos> A US military plane crash landed in Surrey this evening just missing Waverley Abbey.<eos> How did you get out of that plane?
You would have done the same for me.<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick.<eos> Listen, Nick.<eos> I think you should know something.
You walked into the chicks bathroom by the way.<eos> Go to your own bathroom!<eos> Yes, it's the ladies room.<eos> What do you mean I'm cursed?<eos> How do you think you survived the crash?
"Setapai".<eos> You know what it means.<eos> She's got plans for you, Nick.<eos> Plans?<eos> You can't run away.
What?<eos> No!<eos> You heard it... you forgot it...<eos> Why are you backing off from this?<eos> I'm telling you.
I... This is all in my head.<eos> Can't you find the box, look inside ...and when I see a 3,000 years old prune in there...<eos> - Nick.<eos> - ...no more curse.<eos> You don't need a sarcophagus, you need a doctor.
Stop!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Fascinating.<eos> What was I supposed to tell you?
Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?<eos> When Henry came to me i took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.<eos> Now, she's using you.<eos> Look. Despite what you might think despite my my better judgment i care about you.
Stop!<eos> Stop.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.
Yes.<eos> I have made so many many mistakes.<eos> But not this time.<eos> Not you.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.
No, no, no, wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Wait. Wait, who are you?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Hey, you can't go in there.
Finally, you bring me what I've been asking for.<eos> A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless...<eos> You!<eos> Let me out of here, you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.<eos> Is that any way to talk to the man who brought you into this world?
A different design?<eos> Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.<eos> Slightly before you did, in fact.<eos> - Where did you get it?<eos> - I'm not telling you anything.
Check all the nurseries in the area!<eos> We're going to need to disguise ourselves as babies.<eos> Now, where can I get a giant diaper?<eos> Azrael, it's not your map.<eos> You want your own map, we'll get you your own map, but this is my...
Well, I was thinking of getting a little place out here.<eos> Just a quiet place in the forest.<eos> It's a little breezy up on the hill.<eos> What do you think I'm doing out here?<eos> You are never going to find that village, Gargamel.
So much for Team Smurf.<eos> - I want to yell about something!<eos> - Stay out of this, Clumsy.<eos> That's it, Brain Man.<eos> It's time for you to earn your manners badge.
You're so different.<eos> I mean, sorry, but it's true.<eos> Do you know how to start a fire with just rope and a stick?<eos> I do.<eos> I can show you.
We have to take you to Smurfy Grove.<eos> What do we do with these blue blobs?<eos> Bring them along.<eos> Come on, Smurfette.<eos> I'm gonna show you my room.
There's no way I'll survive!<eos> With all due respect, you don't know Gargamel.<eos> Yeah, well, with no due respect, you don't know us.<eos> Trust us, he's a goner.<eos> Stormy, why don't you do a little recon?
Of course it is.<eos> Why do you think you led me here?<eos> Why do you think you saved me on the river?<eos> It was all part of the plan.<eos> No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.
And now, you're really of no use to me anymore.<eos> Freeze ball!<eos> Yes, these freeze balls only work on real Smurfs.<eos> And you are nothing more than a lump of clay.<eos> Thank you for everything.
Are you done crying in the woods?<eos> I've shed enough tears for those Smurfs.<eos> What's this?<eos> I'm done pretending to be something I'm not.<eos> I've come to repledge my loyalty to you, my true Papa.
I've come to repledge my loyalty to you, my true Papa.<eos> - Impossible.<eos> - She can't be serious.<eos> No, no, no, she would never.<eos> Even if I did believe you, which I don't, what could you possibly offer me that I don't already have?
It's a lot more power.<eos> Now, why are you doing this?<eos> I'm so tired of being good.<eos> Use your power to transform me back to my evil self.<eos> Your loyalty has returned to you.
Bollocks!<eos> In what bloody plane of existence does four of a kind lose?<eos> Too, too bad, Constantine.<eos> Have you gained weight?<eos> It looks good on you.
- I raise. - With what?<eos> - Your ratty soul ain't worth two bits.<eos> - Not two bits.<eos> I'm betting the House, the House of Mystery.<eos> And since I'm including everything inside, it looks like you're the one that can't call, Abnegazar.
- Sorry, mate, I'm using that.<eos> Situation here, Jason.<eos> It's time to call your better half.<eos> Sorry, John, you're on your own.<eos> Oi, I'm gonna roast your nuts and feed them to you, Constantine.
- Have you talked to him lately?<eos> I know he's pissed.<eos> You don't have to remind me, love.<eos> - It's on my CV, remember?<eos> - No, really, has he told you...
Look, me not making proper amends isn't related to the Key, which, truth be told, you're not gonna need, mate.<eos> John!<eos> Getting that a lot lately.<eos> You can go screw yourself.<eos> I am not giving you crap.
I've never liked this sort of magic.<eos> I can feel darkness seeping inside me.<eos> How you stand it is beyond me.<eos> It's all about control.<eos> If you ever need a refresher...
After all, you've got a good thing going being applauded by mindless twits.<eos> Really?<eos> Now?<eos> Good a time as ever, I reckon.<eos> - I'll teach you to talk back.
He's chock full of honor, loyalty, and rubbish of that sort.<eos> Then tell us why you were there.<eos> Richard is known as a collector of the arcane and supernatural.<eos> I wanted to see if he had something that could gain me access to this place.<eos> Why would you wanna break in here?
- Keep him alive and safe.<eos> Understand?<eos> That is not my purpose.<eos> I don't give a flying shag what you think your bloody purpose is.<eos> I order you to help him any and every way you're able.
- I, Etrigan, bring down this house and build a tomb for Felix Faust!<eos> As if I would stoop to brawling with a demon.<eos> Fight others of your filthy kind.<eos> From hell though we may be, it does not make us family!<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?
Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself.<eos> Not everything can be solved with your peashooter.<eos> Just because you're dead doesn't mean you're beyond my retribution.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Well, it's off to the old magicians home for you, mate.
Bad girl.<eos> See, now, you were told to do everything to help me by the master of the House, and that does not include punching.<eos> Bring me to the main room.<eos> I'll take it from here, beautiful.<eos> But I need you out of my hair for now, so why don't you just go for a little walk?
It would've been so easy to take it from them.<eos> Of course, rock star Johnny screwed everything sideways.<eos> So we had to frame Faust and get you to bring me here.<eos> Now I'm immortal and supercharged!<eos> You've been played for a sap.
Yes.<eos> My will be done.<eos> Fool!<eos> How can you hope to defeat a god?<eos> Not only can I sense you, you cannot defeat my shield.
Perfect.<eos> Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.<eos> Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.<eos> The so-called Guardian of the Green who secretly hopes to be human again.<eos> Let me dispel you of that notion.
Each bimonthly party is held For $ 40 in a bar?<eos> Do not want it.<eos> So I do not like this machine.<eos> No, she does not love you either.<eos> Trust me, I offer you service, You will thank me for this.
I had to sit in front of him.<eos> Well.<eos> - "Al".<eos> - What?<eos> I never told you this, But I saw you play a few times.
No one, it's "Joe".<eos> I do not talk to criminals.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> I close the line, I'll call back.<eos> What do you want?
I do not talk to criminals.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> I close the line, I'll call back.<eos> What do you want?<eos> But what do you want, "Al"?
Neither are you, nor are you, "Willie."<eos> What?<eos> Why did you answer the phone?<eos> Because he was ringing.<eos> Because you're interested.
Well, what do you mean?<eos> Give me that menu.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Wait here, we'll be right back.<eos> What do you do with my list?
Do you like pork?<eos> Well.<eos> This will fit perfectly with.<eos> This is a big bottle.<eos> Yes, listen, I must tell you this.
What is your position now?<eos> Currently, anxiety.<eos> "Joe," I do not mean to be rude With family members.<eos> Former family members.<eos> As you say, but what do you want from me?
It's the same nonsense, but you're too.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Take them both.<eos> Well.<eos> How much do you have to live, "Willie"?
Two or three years?<eos> That's it?<eos> Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.<eos> What about you?
Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.<eos> What about you?<eos> In my opinion, seven years.<eos> What about you, "Al"?
It's breakfast for Brock.<eos> I see it, but why?<eos> I teach him, he makes an effort to be a father.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Your father prepared breakfast for you.
In the end, if I do not, You have to take responsibility.<eos> I can no longer cover you.<eos> You are a father.<eos> You must take responsibility She acts like a man.<eos> Even if you have to pretend to do so.
Well, that's very funny.<eos> Stay here, I have to check the karaoke machine.<eos> I can not, Go to the Yarn Girls' Booth.<eos> "Milton," you are in it now.<eos> It's okay, you'd better not know.
One slice of each.<eos> And more champagne.<eos> Yes, more champagne.<eos> I'll get the champagne then.<eos> No more wine for you.
It's your business.<eos> The word "Joe", I can not.<eos> Old, selfish.<eos> I do not understand, "woe".<eos> I was to give you my kidney last week.
Old, selfish.<eos> I do not understand, "woe".<eos> I was to give you my kidney last week.<eos> Most likely it does not suit me.<eos> I used to give it to you anyway.
I spoke with my friend "Paul" for a few minutes, Then you run one of the ticket booths.<eos> The tickets.<eos> Hello Tony.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I brought you a gift.
Sorry, Mr. "Garner".<eos> You are not stronger than this.<eos> I'm not solid.<eos> I am a very sensitive person.<eos> I will be honest with you.
Good teaser.<eos> Well, sir, we'll start.<eos> They say in life.<eos> Come here!<eos> If you are lucky, you will get On a couple of wonderful friends.
It was very peaceful at the end.<eos> She kept your room exactly how you left it.<eos> She always hoped you'd come back someday.<eos> "Gail.<eos> "I wish that I could find better words today to tell you I'm sorry.
She kept your room exactly how you left it.<eos> She always hoped you'd come back someday.<eos> "Gail.<eos> "I wish that I could find better words today to tell you I'm sorry.<eos> "You shouldn't have to read this, because I already made you suffer too much.
Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!<eos> Thanks a lot, Amigo.<eos> Fucking shit!<eos> I did what I could for you!<eos> I gave you £4,000!
No, I'm supposed to go back in a couple of days.<eos> Can you not stay a bit longer?<eos> It'd be nice to see you, get to, you know, spend some time together.<eos> I don't know. I don't know.<eos> I missed you, man.
£16,000!<eos> You thieving fucking bastard!<eos> You missed a trick!<eos> That's what hurts, isn't it?<eos> That I had the brains and the fucking balls to steal the money and you didn't!
It will be fine.<eos> Where is she?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Saved your life, though.<eos> This is for you.
So you're Plan B.<eos> Yes.<eos> I am to persuade you to stay and help him.<eos> It will mean so much to have his oldest friend by his side in this exciting new business opportunity.<eos> He told you to say that.
He told you to say that.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did he choose your dress?<eos> No.<eos> - You like it?
- Laura.<eos> - Laura, that wasn't strictly true?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why'd you lie to me?<eos> 'Cause I didn't want to tell you the truth.
- No.<eos> It's just masculine.<eos> What is this?<eos> Come here.<eos> Just do exactly what I told you.
Franco Junior, meet Mikey Forrester.<eos> - So you're teaching him the trade?<eos> - He's a little bit to learn though, eh?<eos> Well, you're in the right hands, son.<eos> He's got the talent, I'll tell you that.
Well, you're in the right hands, son.<eos> He's got the talent, I'll tell you that.<eos> We had a spot of bother.<eos> Concerned citizen came down the stairs, fucking tooled up and all.<eos> I was on the back foot, I can tell you.
- Dad, leave it. - "Leave it"?<eos> I don't want to fucking leave it!<eos> What if I don't want to fucking leave it?<eos> What you gonna do about that, eh?<eos> Tell you what...
"towards projects that stimulate regeneration of formerly industrial areas.<eos> "Loans are available of up to £100,000.<eos> "Applications should be made online, "which may be followed by an invitation to present a business plan."<eos> Blah, blah, fucking blah.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Simon.
I have fucked her, and I'll fuck her again.<eos> - What?<eos> When she was working at the sauna?<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> You know, since we're having this conversation, I can tell you that fully consensual, emotionally driven, not-for-profit sexual intercourse has been attained.
Fucking shut up.<eos> Yeah, sorry if I seemed a little shocked to see you, Frank.<eos> It's just...<eos> Well, I was gonna...<eos> I was gonna deal with this myself and then give you the good news, but...
He's gonna hang out, he's gonna follow Renton home, and then...<eos> - And we're gonna pay him a visit.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - I need a passport.<eos> - I can get you one.
Why, bring it over here.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm not wearing any knickers.<eos> For fuck's sake.<eos> Well, tell you what...
"Spud had never hurt anybody.<eos> "If there was one person whom Renton would try to compensate, "it was Spud."<eos> "Compensate"?<eos> I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.<eos> How much money did he leave you?
It's me.<eos> I'm not here.<eos> - What do you mean, you're not here?<eos> - Go!<eos> Veronika, you cannot be here.
- Go!<eos> Veronika, you cannot be here.<eos> Please.<eos> It's not safe for you, kitten-cat.<eos> - You got to vamoose.
Both of us.<eos> - Another?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You shouldn't be out in this neck of the woods, kitten-cat.
You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.<eos> I've been thinking about you for 20 year.
No, I'm like one of the last indigenous guys around here.<eos> I cannot go anywhere.<eos> "He says, clinging to the hope "that he won't commit this crime against his friends.<eos> "And she says..."<eos> I'll send you your share.
And you're so... - athletically inclined.<eos> - I know.<eos> Belle can be as argumentative as she is beautiful.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Who needs her when you've got us!
Until the day they all found themselves imitating her.<eos> Please, just tell me one more thing about her.<eos> Your mother was... fearless.<eos> Fearless.<eos> So... what can I bring you from the market? A rose.
He never liked me either.<eos> Can I give you a little advice about the villagers though?<eos> They're never going to trust the kind of change you're trying to bring.<eos> All I wanted was to teach a child to read.<eos> The only children you should concern yourself with... are your own.
I'm... not ready to have children.<eos> Maybe you haven't met the right man.<eos> It's a small village, Gaston.<eos> I've met them all.<eos> Well, maybe you should take another look.
I'm merely locking him away.<eos> Now, do you still wish to take your father's place?<eos> Come into the light.<eos> Choose.<eos> Belle, I won't let you do this.
Now go.<eos> Live your life.<eos> And forget me.<eos> Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston<eos> For there's no man in town half as manly<eos> Perfect, a pure paragon<eos> You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley<eos> And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
It's only Mrs. Potts.<eos> Oh, aren't you a vision!<eos> How lovely... to make your acquaintance.<eos> It's a very long journey.<eos> Let me fix you up... before you go.
I'm worried about him.<eos> He's never been on his own.<eos> Cheer up, my poppet.<eos> Things will turn out in the end.<eos> You'll feel a lot better... after dinner.
Are you all right?<eos> It's wonderful!<eos> Yes.<eos> I suppose it is.<eos> Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours.
He's been raving about a beast... in a castle!<eos> I've just come from the castle and there is a beast!<eos> You'd say anything to set him free.<eos> Your word is hardly proof.<eos> You want proof?
Lock her up too.<eos> - No!<eos> - Come here!<eos> Shut up!<eos> You won't get away with this, Gaston!
- I have to warn the Beast.<eos> - Warn him?<eos> How did you get away from him?<eos> He let me go, Papa.<eos> He sent me back to you.
Plumette!<eos> Chip!<eos> Look at you!<eos> You're a little boy again!<eos> What did I tell you, darling?
Good to go!<eos> Don't pay any attention to that pendejo.<eos> You're going to have a great time.<eos> Can I borrow your camera?<eos> Yeah, but... if you drop it, you got to go down and get it.
Oh, shit.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, my God, the guys are going to be so pissed.<eos> You've got to go and get that.
Come on, put it on quick.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Hurry, hurry, hurry, please.<eos> Before I make contact, I'm gonna move the crane.<eos> Just in case you need to get out and I'm not here, okay?
17 bar.<eos> You're almost out of air.<eos> Okay...<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go out there and find him.<eos> You just need to tell me exactly what I need to do.
Okay.<eos> Keep your breathing slow.<eos> Just focus on the flashlight.<eos> Lisa, I can see the shark!<eos> It's coming towards you!
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God!<eos> Kate, you're bleeding to death.<eos> Kate, we have to go up now.<eos> I'm not gonna let you die.
Yes, I understand!<eos> We are coming.<eos> We're getting there, Kate.<eos> We're getting there.<eos> Come on, you just need to hang on a little bit longer.
Doesn't ring any bells?<eos> I don't know any Gabriela, so get the fuck out of my car.<eos> You know... I know what you're hiding, amigo.<eos> The old cue ball south of the border.<eos> What do you want?
A warm capper to a life as an assassin.<eos> Hooked on barbiturates.<eos> You were an animal.<eos> But we took you in.<eos> I gave you a family.
Adamantium.<eos> If you are planning to blow your brains out... could you wait till you're out on the high seas?<eos> - I just mopped these floors.<eos> - I don't need this shit.<eos> A year ago, you asked me to help you.
- I just mopped these floors.<eos> - I don't need this shit.<eos> A year ago, you asked me to help you.<eos> And God knows I've tried.<eos> But I can't help you, Logan, not really, if you're not going to talk to me.
- Laura, go inside. - What sightings?<eos> People said someone who looked like the Wolverine was in El Paso, driving.<eos> Said he looked old.<eos> Hey!<eos> I told you to stop it with that ball! - Bad girl!
Said he looked old.<eos> Hey!<eos> I told you to stop it with that ball! - Bad girl!<eos> - No, please.<eos> - I told you, bad girl!
Logan.<eos> Logan!<eos> This is Laura.<eos> Caliban, come!<eos> This is who I've been telling you about.
Where's Caliban?<eos> Why don't you tell me where the girl is first?<eos> Or I could ask Cue Ball.<eos> He seems quite friendly.<eos> I told you, she's not here.
Bring me the tracker.<eos> You.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Hey!<eos> I asked you a question.
I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?
You were helping round up all those old mutes.<eos> What changed?<eos> You got religion?<eos> I'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys... and track one more special mute for me.<eos> I'm not helping you.
I'm not helping you.<eos> Of course, you'd say that.<eos> But I got a theory that people don't really change.<eos> Beware of the light.<eos> Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid.
She's a business mistake, a RD gone bad.<eos> There's liability.<eos> They can't have things with patents running around, hurting people, can they?<eos> We need to get her off the board before she hurts anybody else.<eos> Someone you care about, maybe.
I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!<eos> I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.<eos> So much easier for you.
My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Zander if you like.<eos> My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.<eos> He believes you've been dispensing delayed information... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.<eos> I'm offering you the possibility of redemption, Caliban.
You wanna travel, I wanna travel. Son.<eos> Son.<eos> That sounds good to you, right?<eos> This is the perfect plan.<eos> Why would you want to do that, Nate?
Those are for barrel racing, and right here is for pole bending.<eos> They're all second, third place.<eos> I'm not too good at it, but my dad makes me.<eos> Do you want to listen?<eos> Do you like it?
A friend with a big mouth.<eos> I hear that a lot.<eos> Then you probably hear this, too.<eos> More than I'd like.<eos> Then you know the drill.
Come out here now, Munson.<eos> There's that asshole.<eos> Hello, asshole.<eos> Listen, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.<eos> I don't know what Munson's paying you... but Canewood can start you out at five G.
You're a newborn, by any measure.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> Your body has work to do.<eos> Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization... stromal cell proliferation.<eos> This will help you heal.
Quit looking at me.<eos> You are dying.<eos> You want to die.<eos> Charles told me.<eos> What else did he tell you?
You are dying.<eos> You want to die.<eos> Charles told me.<eos> What else did he tell you?<eos> To not let you.
Where's Laura?<eos> She's asleep down there.<eos> Do you want me to wake her up?<eos> No.<eos> You had a nightmare.
Actually, uh...<eos> I was thinking of shooting myself with it.<eos> Like Charles said.<eos> I've hurt people, too.<eos> You're gonna have to learn how to live with that.
Your friends, they seem nice.<eos> Kind of reminds me...<eos> Hey, hey, what's going on?<eos> You're with your pals.<eos> You made it.
Take your friends, and run.<eos> No.<eos> Run.<eos> They'll keep coming and coming.<eos> Listen, you don't have to fight anymore.
- Right?<eos> Yeah, 'cause it's a gateway?<eos> - It's the finish line.<eos> - There's worse stuff.<eos> I don't think I can help you.
- There's worse stuff.<eos> I don't think I can help you.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> I gotta call my wife.<eos> Thank you, Holly.
We can't have that right now...<eos> That would be no good.<eos> It's the hottest thing I've ever seen.<eos> You know what, sweetie?<eos> I gotta call you back.
Good.<eos> Strong...<eos> Strong point.<eos> I'll give it another look. Yeah, I mean if you wanna...<eos> You're gonna have to take the manual out, because I think...
Now!<eos> You think this is funny?<eos> Messing with the TV with your goddamn computer telephone?<eos> No, I'm not the one doing it.<eos> I'mma show you what's funny.
I might not have a job either, but, uh...<eos> You know, I got a baby due any minute, and I can't be losing my job, so I hope you understand.<eos> I'm gonna fight you.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I am going to fight you.
Tyler really was pitting us against each other, and...<eos> After school, you gonna meet me in the parking lot, and we gonna handle this shit the primitive way.<eos> With our fists.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I can't wait to fuck you up.
Thank you, Coach.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Everybody, on the track!<eos> Clifford, stop doggin' it.<eos> I will fuck you up.
Guys, this is crazy, right?<eos> I mean, what kind of adult man challenges another adult man to a fight?<eos> That's not a thing that happens anymore.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. Why don't you just take a punch and then just go down, you know?
If it's after school hours, you're just gonna lay there all night until 7:00 a.m., when I'll come and save your life.<eos> Shit.<eos> All right.<eos> You cussed.<eos> I'm gonna write you up!
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.<eos> Well, I disagree.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Your fist isn't going to solve the problem.<eos> You need a knife.
Hey, buddy, let's get one thing straight.<eos> I'm still a teacher at this school, okay?<eos> Are you?<eos> Yes!<eos> I could get you in a lot of trouble, Neil.
So, forget my statement 'cause I wasn't in the right...<eos> - It was chaotic.<eos> - It was chaotic.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And shame on you because we have been through an ordeal over all of this.
Whoa, whoa!<eos> What?<eos> I 911 texted him.<eos> There's been no rape.<eos> Thank you for your bravery.
- No!<eos> I'm done with this place, and I woulda told you that if you weren't in my goddamn business again.<eos> Let's watch out for gun fingers.<eos> I'm confused on one thing here.<eos> You don't want your job?
So use me! All right?<eos> Let's take a seat.<eos> - Are we walking towards the seats?<eos> - He doesn't want the...<eos> Yeah, but if you don't want the job, what is the...
Do you hear yourself?<eos> I mean, you've become unhinged!<eos> Maybe.<eos> But let me tell you something.<eos> You don't show up to that fight this afternoon, an unhinged man might wanna do something real nasty to you.
Holly's with me.<eos> I wouldn't tangle with no police.<eos> I'm from the streets.<eos> You do not go to no cops, okay?<eos> You might have to just man up and throw down with this dude.
Little animals!<eos> Right.<eos> Listen.<eos> Since I ran into you,<eos> I have to tell you, we moved your interview back to 2:15.
All right.<eos> Police are in Strickland's classroom with Mehar.<eos> But that dog ain't finding shit.<eos> - What?<eos> - You sure that kid really sold you meth?
He's there.<eos> You could just go over there.<eos> And I'd stay here if you're worried about losing your seat.<eos> I can see that that's not it.<eos> Okay. I tell you what.
And I can't believe I'm saying this, but Strickland's right.<eos> The students are running all over the fucking school.<eos> So this may be just a teacher's opinion, but you guys fucking suck at your jobs.<eos> And if you ever leave me waiting outside again so you can talk about a goddamn fishing trip,<eos> I will walk right in here and I'll punch you right in the fucking teeth, Tyler.
Actions have consequences.<eos> Campbell!<eos> You want some more of this, huh, boy?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> How do you like this ass-whooping, Campbell?
Get out of my way.<eos> I'mma kill you.<eos> Kill you.<eos> Tap your fucking ass.<eos> You like baseball, Strickland? Batter up, bitch!
And...<eos> And I want you to believe me right now.<eos> I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I believe you.
I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - You do?<eos> - I believe you.
You know my style.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm stressed out, too.<eos> My neighbor got a cat.<eos> - Oh, you don't like a cat looking at you?
I teach gym, but I'm a singer.<eos> Can I sing a song to you?<eos> Uh, uh...<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Shorty, I'm there for you Anytime you need me
- Am I crazy?<eos> - No.<eos> David is amazing, all right?<eos> And what happened with Michael was not your fault.<eos> You are a survivor.
- No.<eos> David is amazing, all right?<eos> And what happened with Michael was not your fault.<eos> You are a survivor.<eos> Look, if the universe owes anyone a solid, I think it's you.
Oh, my God, he's so heavy.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Okay, let's take your stuff upstairs.<eos> Watch your head.<eos> I hope you like this blanket.
I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> It's just hard sometimes.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You couldn't possibly.
Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> Hi.<eos> Daddy!<eos> I'll fix you some leftovers.
It's not fair to her, and she needs to know.<eos> Hey.<eos> I agree.<eos> I just wanted you to get here and get a chance to get settled.<eos> Let Lily get comfortable with you.
8-1.<eos> Tessa, what is it?<eos> David, I've been thinking.<eos> How well do you really know Julia?<eos> Don't you think this is moving a little fast?
You're dragging your knife.<eos> And the silver needs polishing.<eos> I understand that your father is getting married.<eos> Well, I'm sure Daddy's girlfriend is a very nice person.<eos> Do you like her?
Well, I'm sure Daddy's girlfriend is a very nice person.<eos> Do you like her?<eos> I guess so.<eos> She has long brown hair.<eos> - I made you a bracelet, Lovey!
Oh, she can show me if she wants.<eos> You look tired.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'll take you to see Dr. McKee.<eos> A good dermatologist is your best friend and it is time for you to pull yourself together and get a new David.
A good dermatologist is your best friend and it is time for you to pull yourself together and get a new David.<eos> For your sake, and for Lily's.<eos> I need some time.<eos> Time doesn't exist at your age.<eos> David has moved on and so should you.
It's gonna be really hard to tell him, Ali.<eos> Really hard.<eos> I don't want him to see me like that.<eos> I don't want it to change anything.<eos> Hey, what about calling that doctor that you liked so much at The Meadows?
That's very lovely of you to say, and I was terrified to meet you.<eos> I mean, obviously because of Lily and everything, but then on top of that, you're perfect.<eos> All the time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're gonna do great here.
Frankly, it was a little exhausting.<eos> A different position every night.<eos> Public places.<eos> It's like we just could not get away from each other.<eos> But I'm sure I don't have to tell you how he is.
Why would you tell Tessa that it's being cleaned then?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I...<eos> Why did she bring it up?<eos> Who sent you flowers?
I don't know.<eos> I called to find out and ask and...<eos> It must have been a mistake.<eos> Look...<eos> I get that you're going through a rough time, that, uh, it's an adjustment period or whatever.
I'm sure.<eos> That was beneath you.<eos> I'm gonna be in trouble.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Lily' I know what it's like to love someone who isn't always nice to you.
- To Copper Mountain. Yes.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Exactly right.<eos> Oh, no, you should!
Okay, this is really difficult for everyone.<eos> But it doesn't have to actually be this hard.<eos> I'm not doing anything, Julia.<eos> I am simply living my life with my family.<eos> If you're having a hard time, I suggest you look in the mirror.
I am simply living my life with my family.<eos> If you're having a hard time, I suggest you look in the mirror.<eos> No.<eos> I know exactly what it is that you are trying to do.<eos> And I am not gonna let you put Lily in the middle of this anymore.
I know exactly what it is that you are trying to do.<eos> And I am not gonna let you put Lily in the middle of this anymore.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm fucking threatening you.
David, please, just take us home.<eos> Mommy!<eos> It's okay, sweetheart.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> No, you need to go to the doctor.
Okay.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Help, you gotta help me.<eos> You gotta help me.<eos> You've handled this very poorly.
Right in front of me!<eos> This is my life, David.<eos> It's mine!<eos> Tessa!<eos> I'm gonna get you help.
It's your house.<eos> You're a joke.<eos> You can't do anything right, can you, Julia?<eos> Even Michael.<eos> After everything he did to you, you just let him get away.
Brothers...<eos> Geraldus.<eos> All I ask is for a little faith.<eos> Is that so hard?<eos> I imagine when you joined the monastery, They did not tell you that you would be a pack mule.
Do you feel that?<eos> Those are your entrance. Twisted around the arrow, like worms on a hook.<eos> Would you like to see them?<eos> You have suffered enough, brother.<eos> I can give you a quick death.
At the dead boy's house?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 'And what does he think?<eos> Any theories? '<eos> Well, I texted you the details.
Why are you still talking about it?<eos> What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?<eos> I can't stand it, never can.<eos> There's a loose thread in the world.<eos> It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
The Mall, please.<eos> I met her once.<eos> Thatcher?<eos> Rather arrogant, I thought.<eos> YOU thought that? !
Boring.<eos> Go! But...<eos> Go!<eos> This had better be good.<eos> Oh, I think you'll like it.
Different part of town.<eos> You were right - this is a thing.<eos> Something's going on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I thought you'd be pleased.
Yeah, until John publishes his blog.<eos> Yeah, until then, basically.<eos> That's enough now, love.<eos> Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.<eos> And you need to get to bed.
What would you do to a traitor?<eos> Maybe we'll tell him one day.<eos> If he lives that long.<eos> I am an idiot, I know nothing.<eos> Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
Of course.<eos> Is that sentiment talking?<eos> No, it's me.<eos> Difficult to tell the difference these days.<eos> Told you, I made a promise.
It was OK, I guess.<eos> But did somebody hide the sun?<eos> Did you lose it in the war?<eos> 'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.<eos> 'I'm not running, I promise you that,
Yes.<eos> And they were betrayed.<eos> Not by me.<eos> Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.<eos> I promise you,
You don't make it easy, do you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, being... being so perfect.<eos> Mary, I...<eos> I need to tell you...
Mary, Mary... ..even, definitely even. Ssh, ssh. Ooh.<eos> You were my whole world.<eos> Being Mary Watson... ..was the only life worth living.<eos> Mary...<eos> Thank you.
'My old life... '..it was full of consequences.<eos> 'The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.<eos> 'You need to remember that.<eos> So... '..<eos> I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...<eos> Yes?<eos> He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.<eos> 'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
- Hey, Mills.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> How many letters did you end up writing her?<eos> Ten, fifteen.<eos> How many did she write you?
1800 tomorrow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I really owe you one.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why do you want a gig documenting a mapping mission when you're up for the cover of Time?
Nothing he wouldn't do himself.<eos> He's taking the lead.<eos> Doesn't he miss his bed?<eos> I miss my bed!<eos> Don't you miss your bed?
Let's do this!<eos> Maintain course.<eos> Nothing we haven't done before.<eos> "Dear Billy.<eos> "You ever looked into a hurricane and decide,
In case we ever see that primate again.<eos> You do know that story is about a mouse becoming friends with the lion after taking the thorn out of his paw though, right?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> The mouse kills the lion with the thorn.<eos> Who told you that, Cole?
Come on, we're losing daylight.<eos> Fox Leader, this is Chapman, over.<eos> Fox Leader, this is Chapman, over.<eos> Dear Billy...<eos> Sometimes, life just punch you in the balls.
What kind of music is that?<eos> What happened to swing?<eos> Benny Goodman?<eos> You're like a time-traveler, man.<eos> I'm telling you, this is the new sound.
I'm burning up.<eos> I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm still falling, and I'm never climbing out.<eos> I need you to know, John.<eos> I need you to see that up here I've still got it.<eos> So, when I tell you that this is the most dangerous, the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered. When I tell you that this monster must be ended.
Well, you're a doctor.<eos> Examine me.<eos> No, I need a second opinion.<eos> (SIGHS) John, calm down.<eos> When have you ever managed two opinions?
The last person you'd think of.<eos> I want you to be examined by Molly Hooper.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I said Molly Hooper.<eos> You're really not gonna like this.
You're going to have to buck up a bit, John.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> The game is on.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Anything you need.
Thank you.<eos> Uh... Sometimes, can I borrow your car?<eos> -No.<eos> -Okay.<eos> He knew you'd get a new therapist after I died because you'd need to change everything.
-Okay.<eos> He knew you'd get a new therapist after I died because you'd need to change everything.<eos> That's just what you're like.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You keep your weekends for Rosie so you needed to see someone during working hours.
Thanks.<eos> You keep your weekends for Rosie so you needed to see someone during working hours.<eos> Because you're an idiot, you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions with someone reasonably close.<eos> You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.
SMITH: Mr Holmes?<eos> Thirty feet and closing, the most significant undetected serial killer in British criminal history.<eos> Help me bring him down.<eos> -What, what plan?<eos> -I'm not telling you.
MARY: Save him.<eos> Don't think anyone else is going to save him because there isn't anyone.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> Save him.<eos> But I do think you're going to need a little help with that, because you're not exactly good with people.
It's up to you.<eos> Save him.<eos> But I do think you're going to need a little help with that, because you're not exactly good with people.<eos> So here's a few things you need to know about the man we both love.<eos> And more importantly, what you're going to need to do to save him.
What do you mean?<eos> -(DOOR RATTLES) -I think the door is jammed.<eos> Oh, has that door locked itself again?<eos> Yeah, it's always doing that.<eos> You can't save John, because he won't let you.
She gave me information I couldn't have acquired elsewhere.<eos> But she wasn't ever here?<eos> Interesting, isn't it?<eos> I have theorised before that if one could attenuate to every available data stream in the world simultaneously, it would be possible to anticipate and deduce almost anything.<eos> Hmm. So you dreamed up a magic woman who told you things you didn't know?
-Oh, for God's sakes.<eos> -I don't text her back.<eos> -(CHUCKLING) Why not?<eos> You bloody moron!<eos> She's out there, she likes you, and she's alive, and do you have the first idea how lucky you are?
-What? -Just text her back.<eos> -Why? -Because High Wycombe is better than you are currently equipped to understand.<eos> I once caught a triple poisoner in High Wycombe.<eos> That's only the beginning, mate.<eos> As I think I've explain to you many times before, romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for other people...
Look at me, you are doing yourself a disservice.<eos> I have known many people in this world, but made few friends, -and I can safely say...<eos> -I cheated on her.<eos> No clever comeback?<eos> I cheated on you, Mary.
I already have your number.<eos> My private number.<eos> Why would I need that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you'd like a drink sometime.
I... I don't work here.<eos> My special hair band.<eos> I'm not one of your doctors.<eos> The one I made you steal from Mummy.<eos> It was the last thing I said to you, remember?
You came around to my flat a few weeks back.<eos> You pretended to be a woman called Faith Smith.<eos> We had chips.<eos> Does this mean you didn't bring my hair band?<eos> How did you manage to get out of this place?
Redbeard was my dog.<eos> I know what happened to Redbeard.<eos> Sherlock.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Touch the glass and I'll tell you the truth.
Hello, erm... Try...<eos> Try to stay calm, just...<eos> Tell me what your name is.<eos> I'm not supposed to tell my name to strangers.<eos> Of course not, very good, but... I'll tell you mine, my name is...
- If someone else had to die, would you really want to do it with your bare hands?<eos> Would waste valuable time.<eos> Probably just take it.<eos> There's only one bullet left. You will only need one.<eos> But you will need it.
We're supposed to solve this,<eos> - based on what? - This, this is all we get.<eos> Please make use of your friend, Sherlock.<eos> I want to see you interact with people that you're close to.<eos> Also, you may have to choose which one to keep.
- Make her say it. - Say what?<eos> Obvious, Sherly.<eos> - No. - Yes.<eos> one important restriction.<eos> You're not allowed to mention in any way at all that her life is in danger.
It's very important.<eos> I can't say why.<eos> But I promise you, it is.<eos> I can't say that.<eos> I can't... I can't say that to you.
Of course you do.<eos> Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...<eos> Please, just say it.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Not to you.
I told you you'd need it, because only two can play the next game.<eos> Just two of you go on from here.<eos> Your choice.<eos> It's make-your-mind-up time.<eos> Whose help do you need the most?
I am telling the truth.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> - Where did you go?<eos> - I'm not completely sure.<eos> Um, now, I'll tell you what.
They're not dog's bones.<eos> Remember Daddy's allergy?<eos> What was he allergic to?<eos> What would he never let you have all those times you begged?<eos> Well, he'd never let you have a dog.
Well?<eos> You were always the grownup.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think you better get 'round here.
He was the boss.<eos> He set up his office, right smack dab in the middle of the house.<eos> He conducted meetings.<eos> You called?<eos> Do you need Señor Squeaky?
You know one of us has to go with Mr. Francis to the pet convention.<eos> In Vegas.<eos> You know what? You should go.<eos> No, no. You should go.<eos> Well, you need a break.
Mostly C's...<eos> How do you know all that?<eos> Can't ride a bike without training wheels?<eos> Even bears can ride a bike without training wheels, Leslie.<eos> DOB says you're seven.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Do the math, kid.<eos> There's only so much love to go around.<eos> It's like these beads.<eos> You used to have all your parents' love.
Get him!<eos> I got him!<eos> I got him!<eos> I got him!<eos> You're toast, baby man!
We are very disappointed in you.<eos> No, we're mad at you!<eos> Exactly, we're mad at you.<eos> Mad?<eos> You need a time-out!
Bah-Bah.<eos> Chupie. Hushie-Baby.<eos> Tootsie.<eos> It goes by many names.<eos> But through its power, you will know the truth.
If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula.<eos> I will turn into a normal baby... and live here forever with you.<eos> No!<eos> Yes!<eos> And I promise you this...
I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?<eos> We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you.
Tim, what are you doing in here?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Hey, what's all the racket?<eos> Isn't he adorable?<eos> I've got one for you, too!
Your dad and I have some work to do.<eos> You wanna come up to the office and hang outwith us?<eos> We'll stick your brother in the Puppy Zone... while we have a little Tim time.<eos> Tim time?<eos> Dad and I know we haven't been able to do as much with you as we used to.
You brought me the very thing I needed to destroy Baby Corp.<eos> No!<eos> Yes!<eos> You walked right into my trap!<eos> You'll never get away with this!
All right, all right, all right.<eos> So, you went to a community college, is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Keep going!<eos> And you have the guts to ask me for a bonus, now?
Staci, this letter should get you into the school of your choice.<eos> Kindergarten? That's right.<eos> And if there's anything else...<eos> How about a raise?<eos> Staci, you don't get paid.
We did it.<eos> By the way, congratulations on your promotion.<eos> The corner office, the private potty.<eos> All that stuff.<eos> But, hey! How about you?
Argh.<eos> Dear Boss Baby...<eos> I don't usually write very much... but now I know that memos are very important things.<eos> Even though I never went to business school... I did learn to share in kindergarten.<eos> And if there isn't enough love for the two of us... then I wanna give you all of mine.
Dear Boss Baby...<eos> I don't usually write very much... but now I know that memos are very important things.<eos> Even though I never went to business school... I did learn to share in kindergarten.<eos> And if there isn't enough love for the two of us... then I wanna give you all of mine.<eos> I would like to offer you a job.
And if there isn't enough love for the two of us... then I wanna give you all of mine.<eos> I would like to offer you a job.<eos> It will be hard work... and there will be no pay.<eos> But the good news is that you can never be fired.<eos> And I promise you this.
That does sound pretty hot.<eos> It would make my nether regions engorge.<eos> Okay. I get it, yes.<eos> I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.<eos> You just need to find a woman who is pathetic...
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!<eos> I don't gotta listen to nothing!<eos> You betrayed the code!<eos> Ravagers don't deal in kids.<eos> I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!<eos> You didn't know because you didn't want to know because it made you rich.<eos> I demand a seat at the table!<eos> I wear these flames, same as you.<eos> You may dress like us... but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.
Yondu Udonta... I have a proposition for you.<eos> I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.<eos> But instead of returning you... Yondu kept you.<eos> I have no clue as to why.<eos> Well, I'll tell you why.
Why did he talk again?<eos> To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.<eos> As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket... and you would tell all the other children... that he was your father, but that he was out of town.<eos> Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.<eos> I told you that when I was drunk.
Let's go.<eos> I'm uncertain about parting ways.<eos> God, you're like an old woman.<eos> Because I'm wise?<eos> Why do you have so much luggage?
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.<eos> What is your goal here?<eos> To get everybody to hate you?<eos> Because it's working.<eos> Hey, can I ask you a personal question?
Their purpose?<eos> Yes. Quill and I have a bet.<eos> Dude.<eos> You're not supposed to say that!<eos> I say... if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low... your antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.
This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself... has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her... because she wants to kill y'all.<eos> Your friend...<eos> There's too many of them.<eos> He needs my help.<eos> If you care about him... you need to get me out of these bonds.
If you care about him... you need to get me out of these bonds.<eos> They are going to kill him!<eos> I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.<eos> I put a tracer on your ship back there... during the war over Xandar.<eos> Give me your word you won't hurt Groot... and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
I had to watch her die!<eos> Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.<eos> Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.<eos> There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet... and the light within.
This is real!<eos> I'm only half human, remember?<eos> That's the half I'm worried about.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> You're jealous... because I'm part-god, and you like when I'm the weak one.
No.<eos> I saved your life.<eos> Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.<eos> You let me live!<eos> I don't need you always trying to beat me!
It's obvious!<eos> You were the one who wanted to win.<eos> And I just wanted a sister!<eos> You were all I had.<eos> But you were the one who needed to win.
Everything is temporary.<eos> We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago... I had an unceasing impulse to find life.
We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago... I had an unceasing impulse to find life.<eos> But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it... it was all so... disappointing.
You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.<eos> I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.
Peter... this is the sea.<eos> Hey, there, jackass!<eos> What is that thing?<eos> Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!<eos> I told you something didn't feel right.
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?<eos> When he wants.<eos> He's too powerful.<eos> I can't!<eos> You don't have to believe in yourself... because I believe in you.
Peter!<eos> Get over it.<eos> Come now, Peter.<eos> I know this isn't what you want.<eos> What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice?
Even more.<eos> What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?<eos> I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!<eos> I use my heart...<eos> You shouldn't have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.
It's got 300 songs on it.<eos> 300 songs?<eos> Wait.<eos> Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them.<eos> I think Yondu would want you to have it.
Mija. Let's go visit your mom and dad.<eos> Now?<eos> I want to watch this.<eos> They'll be doing this all day.<eos> Your mom and dad appeared in my dream last night and said they missed you.
She's a celebrity now!<eos> Mija.<eos> To be honest... you're nearly a grown woman now.<eos> I don't like you playing with that pig all day.<eos> You should go to town, meet a boy and...
You must be hungry.<eos> I made your favorite, chicken stew.<eos> Go wash up so we can eat.<eos> I put in this and that.<eos> Everything that's good for you.
They wouldn't dare hurt her.<eos> She needs to be perfect for their beauty pageant.<eos> Whatever tests they do on her in there will need to be harmless.<eos> We have a detailed plan on how to rescue her from the event in New York City.<eos> We promise to bring her back to you.
Can we phone her now?<eos> Let's take a picture first, then call her.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Of course.<eos> In the plane... If you get airsick... chew the end of this.
They keep showing very unflattering pictures of you in the press.<eos> Those ones of you as a fat child on Daddy's knee.<eos> Such nasty remarks.<eos> All eyes are on you, aren't they, squeaky clean icon?<eos> I've sent you a reminder of the true face of the most powerful CEO Mirando has ever had.
Okja!<eos> Hi!<eos> We're reunited.<eos> In this wretched laboratory, no less.<eos> Someone you're going to find very special.
Never mistranslate.<eos> Translation is sacred.<eos> From this moment on, you are no longer a member of the A.L.F. You are permanently banned.<eos> Get out.<eos> However... since it is vital that we continue with our mission, we will return your equipment to you after its completion.
It'll make you feel better.<eos> This is an unspeakable place.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> There are worse rooms out there.<eos> Lucy Mirando says I'm not supposed to harm you in here.
Mija.<eos> Mija, I don't think you understand this situation.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We are the ones who have Okja. Okay?<eos> We are doing you a favor.
You gotta try this.<eos> It's actually really good.<eos> Good day, all.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> These are for you.
That's right, folks.<eos> Go to YouTube now and search "Mirando is F-U-C-K-E-D."<eos> Fucked!<eos> I don't think we have a choice, Nancy.<eos> You have to go out there.
But, by God, did he know about business.<eos> Don't worry about your apology speech, twinny.<eos> I'll pretend to be you in front of the press.<eos> The police.<eos> You'll understand that I will be instructing our corporate attorneys not to assist you in any way.
- K...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Okja...<eos> We need to hurry.<eos> Look, I'm just saying that if I call you one time, I like for you to pick up the first time, you know what I mean?
Nigga, you talking about Old Black Man.<eos> He right over there laying.<eos> How much does this guy sleep?<eos> Is he a cat? All aboard.<eos> Chug-a-chug-a-toot-toot. You really like that train, huh?
- Oh, my God.<eos> The show... I can't get away from it.<eos> Look, that was just a TV character.<eos> I'm an actor.<eos> - Why do you got a mop?
♪ Far from here. ♪<eos> Hey, Hollywood. Why don't you leap on up to the third floor.<eos> Somebody shit all over the dining hall.<eos> Okay, boss.<eos> Dude, can I admit something to you?
Camera three.<eos> Delivery.<eos> - Hey, Tracey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You didn't have to bring it yourself.
Good night, Margaret.<eos> Dave?<eos> Dave!<eos> On my way.<eos> You got to see this.
What?<eos> What?<eos> Show Mr. Hastings to his new room.<eos> He can meet with his lawyer there.<eos> Right, you're gonna have to come with me now, Bill.
George says they're not gonna let you out on bail.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm in so much trouble.<eos> I have...<eos> I have to tell you something.
Well, that's good.<eos> For a while, day after tomorrow, I'll need to be on my own.<eos> That might be a good time for you to learn how to mind your own business.<eos> Well... meantime, there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.<eos> I'll be sure to let you know, Ray.
I'll be sure to let you know, Ray.<eos> And I'll follow up on that contact of mine, hopefully get the information you need.<eos> Want, not need.<eos> I don't need anything, Ray.<eos> If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything.
I don't need anything, Ray.<eos> If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything.<eos> I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.
What's mine is yours.<eos> Darya, Jack is dead.<eos> I killed Jack two hours ago after he wired the car.<eos> Don't move... one muscle.<eos> I'm gonna play something for you, Darya.
Shit, he's coming. I got to get off the phone.<eos> Are you going to kill me?<eos> Yes, Darya.<eos> Shit!<eos> Darya... who hired you and Ray to kill me?
We could...<eos> This is the most wonderful... horrible day of my life.<eos> Of my life.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm gonna fix you a sandwich, and then I'm gonna get you a piece of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake, 'cause we saved a piece for you.
There's room in this Federal Bureau of Investigation for more than one beautiful woman.<eos> Gordon.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> You know, normally, I can't think like this.<eos> I have to forgo all that and grow balls of steel to do this job, and it's... it's a bitch, let me tell you, sometimes...
Phillip Jeffries.<eos> Phillip Jeffries?<eos> I need to be debriefed by you about this work, Gordon.<eos> I will tell you the whole story, all its twists and turns, and I was going to do so.<eos> I was on my way to present it to you.
Dougie? My God.<eos> Dougie, what the hell?<eos> Where'd you get that suit... and haircut?<eos> Have you been wearing a rug all this time, Dougie?<eos> My God, are you sick, Dougie?
Looked like maybe two people, but... his car's still here.<eos> I'm all set near the entrance.<eos> If he's in the car, I'll get him here.<eos> Once you find your wallet or your cell phone, a pay phone or some money, you can call AAA, Dougie.<eos> They will help you.
And I don't like to say this in front of Andy.<eos> But I had a bubble... of gas.<eos> And I had read... that sometimes chocolate, which I love, can be used as a remedy, maybe by indigenous people.<eos> Is that true, Hawk?<eos> Do you use chocolate as a remedy for gas?
And I had read... that sometimes chocolate, which I love, can be used as a remedy, maybe by indigenous people.<eos> Is that true, Hawk?<eos> Do you use chocolate as a remedy for gas?<eos> Do you want another bunny, punky?<eos> I can get you more bunnies.
Is it about the bunny?<eos> No.<eos> It's not about the bunny.<eos> All right. Go inside, Dougie.<eos> Someone will help you in there.
Right, right.<eos> Call for help.<eos> In the back, Jack.<eos> Hey!<eos> You're gonna need some change.
Thank you, Lucy.<eos> Doris is coming.<eos> You hang tough, Harry.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll check in with you tomorrow.
Is that it?<eos> That is not fair, Frank.<eos> And what about Dad's car?<eos> I'm not gonna have him killed in that damn death-trap car.<eos> I told you this.
Hmm. Okay.<eos> Yeah. Good morning.<eos> Did you get my note?<eos> No, I didn't get your note.<eos> I sent you one.
I'm sorry.<eos> He's looking for work.<eos> That's a lot.<eos> He will find a job.<eos> - Honey, I can give you this.
They're watching us.<eos> I'm gonna roll.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> And now I'm gonna take my girl out to dinner.<eos> Hey, I saved some for you.
For my interviews.<eos> You know how nervous I get.<eos> Come on.<eos> Besides, I got some great fucking feedback today.<eos> I'll tell you all about it at dinner.
You know how nervous I get.<eos> Come on.<eos> Besides, I got some great fucking feedback today.<eos> I'll tell you all about it at dinner.<eos> And in between, I'll tell you... how much I love you, and I'll tell you how beautiful you are, and I'll tell you how sexy you are, and those tits, how majestic they are, and that ass...
Come on.<eos> Besides, I got some great fucking feedback today.<eos> I'll tell you all about it at dinner.<eos> And in between, I'll tell you... how much I love you, and I'll tell you how beautiful you are, and I'll tell you how sexy you are, and those tits, how majestic they are, and that ass...<eos> Give me a break, and I'll get you some bread.
You needed to get out, Ray.<eos> Where's Darya?<eos> She's waiting for a phone call when we get someplace safe.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> You'd probably like to go to that place they call "The Farm."
Go for it.<eos> Ray.<eos> I want that information.<eos> Yes?<eos> Looks like you're out half a million.
It may be the key to what this is all about.<eos> And I told him where I'm going, so if he comes after me, I'll get him there.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Roadhouse is proud to welcome the Nine Inch Nails.<eos> Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one.<eos> Did you like that song?
Look.<eos> I found a penny.<eos> And it's head's up.<eos> That means it's good luck.<eos> I hope it does bring you good luck.
So...<eos> I thought you were going with Mary.<eos> No.<eos> No, that's over.<eos> Are you... sad about that?
Dougie, I'm sorry, I forgot, your car.<eos> Where is your car?<eos> Have you eaten?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna fix you a sandwich.
Yeah, great.<eos> Great idea.<eos> Stupid magic motherfucker.<eos> Ha, yeah, "kid"?<eos> I'll show you fucking kid.
Now!<eos> What the hell are all these childish scribbles?<eos> Hhow am I gonna make any sense out of this?<eos> Make... sense of it.<eos> I'm thinking you may need some good professional help, Dougie.
It just lurched and lurched.<eos> Sounds like he left the emergency brake on.<eos> Are you telling me my father doesn't know how to drive a car? Is that what you're telling me?<eos> Don't you dare, don't you dare try to blame my father for that car not running right!<eos> We'll get it looked at again if it'll make you feel better.
Jerry?<eos> - Jerry, what's going on?<eos> - Someone stole my car.<eos> What?<eos> Didn't I tell you?
I told them what the arrangements were gonna be, and I gave them more than they deserved, and that's the end of them, okay?<eos> Now, with this car business, yes, there's gonna be some insurance money.<eos> I don't know how much, but, Dougie, just think.<eos> If you hadn't blown that money gambling... $25,000 plus the insurance...<eos> We could have gotten you a great new car.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, has he eaten yet?<eos> He was waiting.<eos> - Dinner is on the stove.<eos> - Okay. He's missing you.
Who owns this establishment?<eos> Farmers.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Oh, they're sleeping out back.<eos> What you need?
What you need?<eos> A couple clean phones.<eos> And something for this.<eos> Well, fuck that.<eos> I'll get you some real nice puppies and biscuits.
Is he hurt?<eos> Shit.<eos> We was waiting for you all night.<eos> Where'd they get you?<eos> Looks like you was lucky.
He'll sing for me.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Then I got a doubleheader for you in Vegas.<eos> Oh, let's play two.<eos> I'll text you details after you do the warden.
Wait a minute.<eos> There's something else.<eos> "COOPER/COOPER."<eos> Two Coopers.<eos> We came out to join you, Diane, while Albert's indisposed.
- Yeah!<eos> Lowering mayor package through hole.<eos> Madam Mayor!<eos> Thanks for dropping by.<eos> I've only got one thing to say to you, Joker.
No, I'm not.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are!<eos> Who else drives you to one-up them the way that I do?
Okay, look, I'm fine with you fighting other people if you wanna do that, but what we have is special.<eos> So, when people ask you... "Who's your number one bad guy?" you say...<eos> Superman.<eos> Are you seriously saying that there is nothing, nothing special about our relationship?<eos> Let me tell you something, J-bird.
Thank you for the switch to the Bat-Signal.<eos> Nice.<eos> Dad, you've always done a great job protecting Gotham City.<eos> Flip! That's me.<eos> Thank you.
Alfred, you've been watching way too many Lifetime movies and drinking chardonnay.<eos> - It's Pinot grigio, sir.<eos> - Whatever it is.<eos> Listen, you don't have a family.<eos> You're satisfied serving me.
It's raining dads!<eos> So, are you ready to follow Batman and maybe learn a few life lessons along the way?<eos> I sure am, Dad Two!<eos> But first, where's the seatbelt?<eos> The first lesson is, life doesn't give you seatbelts!
Don't worry about it, dawg.<eos> I'm not here to throw down or anything.<eos> Uh, no, I would crush you.<eos> Sure, sure, sure.<eos> Hey, listen. Thank me later, but I just happened to be in the hood. And I figured that you could probably use the...
Now go get him!<eos> Joker out!<eos> Padre?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you ever get scared?
- Uh... Batman?<eos> - What's up, buddy?<eos> - Are we nearly at Wayne Manor?<eos> Your number two needs to go number one.<eos> I thought I told you to go back at the prison.
I thought I told you to go back at the prison.<eos> - I tried, but Bane was in there.<eos> - So?<eos> He had sort of a "get out of this bathroom now" vibe.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have given you that water.
Watch out for those...<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Okay. Everybody, timeout off.<eos> Whoo-hoo! I've been parented.<eos> - Batman, I can help you.
Come on, let's hear it for us!<eos> That was incredible!<eos> I felt so jazzed!<eos> I say "jazzed"!<eos> I gotta give it to you, Batman.
What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.<eos> And you.
He died of cancer 12 years ago.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> All our parents are gone now.<eos> Okay, well, thanks for dropping by.<eos> I'm gonna show you...
- Really?<eos> You think?<eos> Maybe, that's because Danny Rand is dead.<eos> Please, get out of here now.<eos> Ward... you need to calm down.
Keep telling me what to do...<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's all calm down, yeah?<eos> Look, whoever you are, I think it's best if you leave...
And if that's the case, he's really smart.<eos> He's playing on our emotions.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause we lost a friend when Danny died.<eos> Wouldn't you love it if somehow he was still alive, walked into our office all these years later?
Thank you, sir.<eos> Hey!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I wanted to talk.<eos> I didn't know any other way to get to you.
Huh?<eos> Not so good.<eos> You will never get a penny from us.<eos> Who said anything about money?<eos> Then what do you want?
I know you know more.<eos> I was 15 when they died.<eos> Why would I know anything more?<eos> And why do you think that there's more to know?<eos> And why do you care?
Yes, it is.<eos> I can only wonder what it's like inside that crazy little head of yours.<eos> You wanna know what it's like? Hmm?<eos> It feels like this...<eos> When you're a ten-year-old boy and you watch your mother die... and you know you and your father are next, it feels like this!
Shit.<eos> Are you behind this?<eos> Is this another one of your stupid tests?<eos> No, Ward, I'm not behind it.<eos> I wish you'd take things like this more seriously, so that I don't see my company destroyed.
Kyle.<eos> Hey, will you ever betray me, Kyle?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You're a good man, Kyle.<eos> Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Now we need to approach this with finesse.<eos> Like the way you handle everything in life?<eos> Don't be smart with me, Ward.<eos> Leave this to me.<eos> I'll tell you exactly what to do.
Can we finally talk?<eos> Okay.<eos> But...<eos> I have mace in my purse, and I can touch one button and have a guard here.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
- With guns.<eos> - Shannon?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Very sure.<eos> Well, you seem to have gotten away.
You said you had some questions for me.<eos> I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to answer all of them, but...<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> I have a lot of questions, too.<eos> Why don't you go first?
I have a lot of questions, too.<eos> Why don't you go first?<eos> It's... it's all kind of crazy.<eos> I don't even know where to start.<eos> Well, why don't you just start at the beginning?
hey!<eos> I know how disorienting it must be to... to wake up and find yourself in a place like this.<eos> we're here to help.<eos> And I think I know exactly how.<eos> You need to kill yourself.
We're gonna get you cleaned up now.<eos> I need you to swallow these.<eos> I'm going to need your support on buying this piece of property in Brooklyn.<eos> The warehouses?<eos> They important to you?
Danny Rand.<eos> Like that rich kid who died in a plane crash?<eos> I am that rich kid who died in a plane crash.<eos> obviously I... I didn't die.<eos> Why don't you tell me about that?
I woke up.<eos> I was in this huge snowdrift.<eos> I was hurt.<eos> It was snowing.<eos> You must have been cold.
I... I've never seen that before.<eos> If you want out of here... you're gonna have to start being honest with me.<eos> We'll talk about this some more.<eos> man!<eos> You might want to sound a little less
too.<eos> For... for what?<eos> For being alive.<eos> That's just stupid.<eos> Apologize now or I'm going to hurt you.
- It's Danny.<eos> - Who?<eos> Danny.<eos> you met me at the park. Uh...<eos> I looked you up at your dojo.
You can destroy the Hand?<eos> I am the only one who can do it.<eos> Please... you have to get me out of here.<eos> don't worry. I'll take care of everything.<eos> Right now... you should just go back to sleep.
of course not.<eos> why would you come here to see me?<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on.<eos> Every word I have ever told you is the truth.
I understand.<eos> just one last favor.<eos> What?<eos> Deliver these to Joy Meachum.<eos> Someone's here to see you.
I insist.<eos> what are you so afraid of?<eos> You should be a little more like dad.<eos> Yeah? Grow some balls.<eos> I was just going to see you.
- Get out.<eos> I'm sorry, they, uh... they broke the lock.<eos> I'll send a bill.<eos> Pretty sure they can cover it.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna make this up to you, I promise.
- Add 10%.<eos> Okay.<eos> But we're already a million over the appraised value.<eos> - Why is this so important?<eos> - Oh, you don't need to know that.
And I want you to put Joy onto Patel.<eos> She'll be able to close it.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Doesn't it occur to you that I'm doing this all for you?<eos> That I work day and night so I can hand you something that's successful?
That I work day and night so I can hand you something that's successful?<eos> That works out easily, because I want you to succeed?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> You guess?<eos> - I believe you.
Yeah, we were.<eos> But it doesn't change anything.<eos> You can't be here.<eos> What if I pay your rent?<eos> Cover whatever you need for the next six months, huh?
We're friends.<eos> Can't we start acting like it?<eos> So you came with a peace offering of... oranges and flowers?<eos> Yeah, it's, uh... it's a Buddhist tradition.<eos> It's meant to remind you of our bond.
Our fathers created something important, and... it's my job to keep it healthy and vital.<eos> This is our offer for your shares.<eos> I think it's quite generous.<eos> Hundred million dollars?<eos> Ward wanted to give you 40, but I got him to go higher.
Just think of all you could do with that.<eos> I have to change my name?<eos> The world already thinks Danny Rand is dead.<eos> Let's just leave it that way.<eos> You can pick a name you love.
I get it, but those private fights are illegal.<eos> All the shit I could've got into, you want to bust me for making a dollar fighting?<eos> You're up for a scholarship, Darryl.<eos> And when the committee calls me, they ask about character as well as skill.<eos> I want to be able to give you the highest recommendation.
It seems like that's all anyone wants to talk about.<eos> Because it's the only language that they speak.<eos> And it is important that you learn to understand it if you want to win.<eos> They're supposed to be my friends.<eos> I can help you get your business back, but I cannot help you make friends.
No, it's a... it's a dojo.<eos> - Has plastic mats.<eos> - Ah.<eos> Do you have any money for some new clothes?<eos> Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.
What is this?<eos> I thought we were headed to a restaurant.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> But first things first.<eos> Trust me, you're gonna like this.
I know.<eos> But... people have been known to start over... with nothing.<eos> You're really thinking about this, aren't you?<eos> I'm tired... of a lot of things.<eos> I'd miss you.
Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, uh... can you help me?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> What do you need?
Cut the Floyd Mayweather shit.<eos> This is a...<eos> The Daughter of the Dragon!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I don't know where you came from, but you're welcome anytime.
Toward the end...<eos> I barely hit a hundred pounds.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - Yeah, tried him, too.<eos> Dad, are you sure you should be saying this?
Red Hook.<eos> Yeah, Joy closed the deal on the pier.<eos> Talk with her.<eos> We've needed a fighter like you back in the family.<eos> Hey, maybe I could teach you kung fu some time.
Yeah, it does.<eos> You coming back has... made me think about all the people I've lost.<eos> You know, my parents... my mom, dad.<eos> You know, your dad... he really cared for you.<eos> You're lucky you didn't have to see him at the end.
It was horrible.<eos> Anyway... your return made me take a hard look at the person that I've become, and I didn't like it.<eos> I just didn't think that Dad would like it either, so...<eos> I had to do the right thing.<eos> You know, if it helps any, I think Harold would have been crazy proud of you.
This is the Golden Sands you're looking for.<eos> It's a front for the Yangshi Gongsi, the Yang Clan Company.<eos> - I need to have a word with them.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> Why do you wanna mess around with Triads?
- Hey, I'm not judging.<eos> I used to fight in a few illegal fight clubs on my way back from K'un-Lun.<eos> But just so you know...<eos> I'm more than willing to pay up on our previous deal.<eos> I still owe you rent for six months.
But just so you know...<eos> I'm more than willing to pay up on our previous deal.<eos> I still owe you rent for six months.<eos> Answer is the same.<eos> Thank you, though.
Boasting a faster absorption rate, a slower metabolic rate... and the most exciting part, the CP450 liver enzyme inhibitor. Which prevents the human body from ever building a tolerance to it.<eos> So, as you can see...<eos> The value of this particular heroin is unprecedented.<eos> Why not let an expert be the judge?<eos> Oh, honey, you don't need to worry about that mess anymore.
No, I'm here to help with scheduling, phone calls, day-to-day stuff around the office.<eos> Oh, like this morning when I wanted to speak to one of our Rand scientists.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Right.<eos> So, um, if I wanted you to go out and buy me, say, a box of Fruit Roll-Ups... you'd have to do it.
It was brutal.<eos> Just looking those people in their faces, knowing exactly what they were suffering from.<eos> That's because you're a good person.<eos> I don't feel like it.<eos> Because you're also a good businesswoman... and that means you have to make hard decisions.
Just looking those people in their faces, knowing exactly what they were suffering from.<eos> That's because you're a good person.<eos> I don't feel like it.<eos> Because you're also a good businesswoman... and that means you have to make hard decisions.<eos> You have to find a balance, and... you do that better than most of us.
Yeah, I, um...<eos> I just...<eos> I don't really know where to start.<eos> I would love to stick around and hear more, but I've gotta get going.<eos> You don't have to go.
So what are you gonna do?<eos> Well, look...<eos> Ward doesn't believe me.<eos> But if I can prove to him it's really happening... he'll have to help me shut it down.<eos> To prove it, you need evidence.
But going against them on your own, that's some foolish bullshit, no matter who you are.<eos> He's not alone.<eos> I can't ask anything more from you.<eos> You've done enough already.<eos> You don't have to.
Have you seen the video of you apologizing?<eos> Yeah, I've seen it.<eos> In the time it took me to walk from my office, we're probably over six million views.<eos> What's your point?<eos> We laid out a path for you to follow.
Don't you know?<eos> I've mastered everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> What else is there?<eos> You have yet to face the most cunning opponent of them all.
That child died long ago.<eos> I think someone new is waiting to get out.<eos> Are we going to fight or not?<eos> We don't have to fight.<eos> Why don't you... kiss me instead?
There's no need.<eos> What is this?<eos> Singing Spider venom.<eos> Very rare.<eos> It'll help you let go.
Let it take you.<eos> You're trying to get my heart racing to spread the poison faster.<eos> Good!<eos> This is the real you.<eos> Follow me, Danny, and I will let you be who you want to be.
Come on.<eos> To the left.<eos> I asked Michelle to change schedules...<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm thinking maybe I'll let you handle this one.
Twice, actually.<eos> But he has a constant reminder of his failure.<eos> The fingers were because he screwed up.<eos> The tongue, because he lied about it.<eos> The real question is, how big a reminder do you need?
Oh, come on.<eos> - You're slipping.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> You're fine?<eos> You're fine, like when I came in the other night and I found you passed out on your couch?
No goddamn idea.<eos> - Because you won't tell me!<eos> - I can't!<eos> I ca...<eos> You need help, Ward.
Enjoy your secrets.<eos> It's late.<eos> Wasn't sure you were gonna pick up this time.<eos> - I'm glad you did.<eos> - What do you want?
The other guy, I didn't get his name.<eos> The Hand sent them over to deliver a message.<eos> - We have to call somebody.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> I called you.
It keeps people at bay, but... you know that you don't have to wear it with me.<eos> Hey, I need you to find all of my dad's old files.<eos> Okay.<eos> They're probably in storage.<eos> Which ones do you want?
I mean, you...<eos> you're the only family I have left.<eos> And maybe what's happening to you is partly my fault, too.<eos> Sometimes, it's... it's just easier to... pretend nothing's wrong than to say something.<eos> Maybe you should take a break.
You don't even have a choice.<eos> You can't go back to Gao.<eos> She killed the last guy who failed to defeat me.<eos> Turned his head into a mailbox.<eos> I'm giving you a new choice.
It's inspiring.<eos> It sounds like you truly care for him.<eos> Are you trying to make me jealous?<eos> You will always come first for me.<eos> You need to be cautious.
That's just mean, Ward.<eos> You should be grateful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wouldn't have a life without me.<eos> I've given you everything.
You should be grateful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wouldn't have a life without me.<eos> I've given you everything.<eos> I've shown you how to run the company, how to be respected, how to be feared.
You know what to do.<eos> Hey, it's Danny.<eos> You need to leave your mom's place right now.<eos> Gao may be sending people to hurt you.
- The Hand.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What are you even doing here?<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> I think you should sit down.
Oh, for Christ's sake.<eos> Something terrible has happened to your father.<eos> What?<eos> He ran out of chia seeds?<eos> You don't wanna go in there.
Exactly.<eos> I was just out of law school.<eos> No one here took me seriously.<eos> They had every right not to.<eos> The job just didn't come naturally to me like it did for you.
You know what I mean.<eos> Wow.<eos> That good, huh?<eos> A gentleman never kisses and tells.<eos> You don't have to say anything.
Say everything that's going through your head.<eos> Just let it out.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You just feel like you can't.
Did you have a number in mind?<eos> Thirty million dollars.<eos> I'll sign right now.<eos> You never have to see my face again.<eos> I realize... that you will have to eat some crow... with the rest of the board.
Thirty million dollars.<eos> I'll sign right now.<eos> You never have to see my face again.<eos> I realize... that you will have to eat some crow... with the rest of the board.<eos> So... I would be willing to compensate you for that.
I don't know what to say, Ward.<eos> How about yes?<eos> Your father would be ashamed if he could see the way his family was falling apart.<eos> All due respect, Lawrence, you don't know shit about my father.<eos> Do you want the money or not?
Whatever it is.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I can't.<eos> Well then, I guess I'll just tell you something I've been keeping from you.
Is he okay?<eos> Does he look okay?<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?
- You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?<eos> I want you to know everything I've been keeping from you.<eos> But unless you see it with your own eyes, you may not believe me.<eos> What I'm about to show you is shocking, but it...
The truth is...<eos> I'm having financial trouble.<eos> I brought you here to ask you for money, but you're making me feel like an asshole, so forget about it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't know you needed money until literally two seconds ago.
You deny it?<eos> Would you believe me if I did?<eos> Stay right there, boy.<eos> Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.
- Wait a minute.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> What are we doing here, Danny?<eos> She's with the Hand.<eos> - You want some ice for that?
Why?<eos> It won't change the way you feel about him.<eos> You know she was responsible for your parents' death.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> Nothing she says will make you feel better about that.
Yeah. So?<eos> Sodium pentothal.<eos> Truth serum.<eos> - If you get it for me... - we'll dose Gao.<eos> She'll tell you everything that you want to know, and no one gets hurt.
I don't believe you.<eos> Why are you lying to me?<eos> Just stay away.<eos> Don't go near there, okay?<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.
Am I wrong?<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> You often find yourself fraternizing with people with gifts.<eos> Daredevil, Luke Cage, Danny Rand.<eos> You secretly hope that the thing that makes them special will rub off on you, but it hasn't, and you have failed each of them in different ways.
You are looking for who you want to be.<eos> Searching for your destiny.<eos> But it's selfish of you to involve Danny in your quest.<eos> He has greater problems to deal with.<eos> If you were going to be special, it would have already happened.
So what?<eos> That's a saying anyone in Japan would know.<eos> It was printed in his obituary.<eos> You could have looked that up.<eos> He spoke it to you many times.
He spoke it to you many times.<eos> Because you always saw the wider world, understood what was at stake.<eos> Just as you do now.<eos> If you allow this charade to continue, all will be lost.<eos> Release me and I will allow you to proceed with your life untouched.
I hope someday you can understand that.<eos> Then I can go?<eos> Well, if that's what it takes, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I just want what's best for you and your, uh, sister.
Is there any vanilla?<eos> What?<eos> Well, I don't like all these fancy flavors.<eos> Vanilla's fine for me.<eos> I go to all the trouble of, uh, getting you all this ice cream, and all you can do is complain.
We're helping him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> No.<eos> Where we're going, you're not allowed.
How are you feeling?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm all right.<eos> Thanks for showing me how to heal her.<eos> Of course.<eos> I see it took a lot out of you, though.
Fair enough.<eos> Then step this way.<eos> Just follow my lead.<eos> I've studied many traditions, so you'll recognize most of the moves.<eos> But in this order, they're gonna take you somewhere else.
it seems familiar.<eos> It should.<eos> The same atmosphere that shaped you in the monastery is present here.<eos> We're seeking to build character, discipline, educate young people in the same way.<eos> Did Colleen tell you everything about me?
What it could achieve.<eos> That's how you know about the healing.<eos> All the qigong masters talk about it, but as a theory, because they haven't met you... don't possess what you have.<eos> And, Danny, there's more where that came from.<eos> I showed you how to heal Colleen, and I've just opened up a way for you to recharge your chi.

Is that how you feel?<eos> Inside?<eos> You know you don't fit in at Rand.<eos> I've read the news.<eos> You can use help there as well.
How was he?<eos> He seems ready.<eos> Thank you for all you've done.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I know this has been hard on you.
I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.
What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.<eos> It's complicated... I know.<eos> But it's for the best.<eos> He may be hurt in the beginning, but if he feels about you the way you feel about him... he'll make the right choice.
I'm not surprised.<eos> You're still a child.<eos> Yeah, well, at least I'm not in prison.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> I offer you freedom, was willing to let you live whatever life you wanted.
Then you ran towards slavery as fast as you could.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?<eos> I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.
Bakuto.<eos> There was a ceremonial knife in his office.<eos> I recognized it because men from the Hand used one like it.<eos> Colleen?<eos> I wanted to tell you from the beginning.
Come on!<eos> You've been lying to me this whole time!<eos> That's not true.<eos> I didn't...<eos> Did Bakuto give you that money the first time we met in the park?
The only reason anybody is interested in me is because of the Fist.<eos> My feelings are for Danny Rand, not the Iron Fist.<eos> Then why lie?<eos> Why go along with this?<eos> Because you've been brainwashed!
I know what it's like to have a troubled son.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - See?<eos> We share so much, you and I.<eos> That's why I thought it was, um, important to come and offer you an easy solution.
It's so simple, you know.<eos> A powerful man, stressed by a life and a job that simply overwhelmed him.<eos> You go out a tortured hero.<eos> None of this comes to light.<eos> You better get the hell out of here.
Forget him.<eos> - To the gate.<eos> - Darryl.<eos> The Fist!<eos> You have to use the Fist.
No.<eos> The way to K'un-Lun is open, and you are not there to protect it.<eos> We're going back.<eos> Look, I understand, but I can't just leave.<eos> You had no trouble leaving us.
- He's troubled.<eos> He's confused as to why you would abandon your post and leave us unprotected.<eos> And, yeah... he's also very pissed.<eos> How did you even find me, Davos?<eos> I saw you taken by those men outside that dojo.
But you wanted to be the Iron Fist, Danny.<eos> I am the Iron Fist.<eos> You knew what your duties would be and you don't get to decide what that means.<eos> - The hell it doesn't.<eos> - You don't belong here!
I, um... I can't.<eos> Not right now.<eos> Okay, uh... hand.<eos> Hold tightly here.<eos> You might not like this.
That's real.<eos> Are we done?<eos> I don't think there's any internal bleeding.<eos> But that wound could easily get infected.<eos> You need antibiotics.
Probably doing better than you are.<eos> Anything else you need?<eos> I just need to restore my chi.<eos> Well, you're on your own with that.<eos> Hey, you look like you need a...
I ordered pizza.<eos> What passes for food in this world is poison for both the body and soul.<eos> Okay.<eos> I guess you guys don't order a lot of delivery in K'un-Lun.<eos> - How much has Danny told you of K'un-Lun?
I should go with you.<eos> Uh... You know, it's hard enough being a delivery guy without a warrior monk accidently kicking the crap out of you.<eos> So just... wait here.<eos> Already paid for it.<eos> - Danny told you.
I'm fine.<eos> Claire stitched me up.<eos> You don't look fine.<eos> She's just running a little low on antibiotics.<eos> You need to go to the hospital, Danny.
Why are you even here, Colleen?<eos> Because... because I care about you.<eos> And the way things are going...<eos> I wanted to say I tried... to make things right between us.<eos> Did Bakuto tell you to say that, too?
I wanted to say I tried... to make things right between us.<eos> Did Bakuto tell you to say that, too?<eos> Just stop.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> How can I ever trust you again?
I need antibiotics for a wound that might have gotten infected.<eos> It's not for me.<eos> The infirmary at the compound should be stocked if that's...<eos> Yeah, I can't really go to the compound.<eos> Not now. That's why I came to you.
Because right now, you look pretty broken to me.<eos> Shit!<eos> She broke my damn nose.<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> I didn't let you drive because it's not my car.
The way to K'un-Lun was open.<eos> I could leave.<eos> I was looking for a sign... and instead, it showed me a path.<eos> Maybe it is a sign.<eos> A sign telling you, Danny, that the path is open.
Oh, shit.<eos> - Though, I'm no friend of Gao's.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I can get help you get out of here.
I want you in charge, because Harold has become...<eos> - Goddamn dangerous.<eos> - He can't be trusted.<eos> Our relationship would be more quid pro quo.<eos> Take this drug I'm giving you now, for instance.
- Ward.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - I came to have a word with Joy.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I mean, Dad said you were getting help.
- He needs us.<eos> - No.<eos> He's always been a bastard to me.<eos> Ever since he... came back from the dead, it's like a... It's like a piece of his soul got left in the grave.<eos> He will use you, hurt you, and throw you aside without a second thought.
Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm gonna come back for you, Bakuto.<eos> And I'm gonna show you no mercy.
Stay still, Joy.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Everything'll be okay.<eos> Don't do this in front of Joy.<eos> I will get you anything you want.
I'm not losing my family to the Hand again.<eos> - Danny.<eos> - I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> You don't tell me what to do.<eos> I'm gonna get you through this.
This is all very touching, but time is up.<eos> This blade has cut down kings, emperors, lords and tyrants.<eos> If you would have told me I might use it on a businessman?<eos> Well, I wouldn't wanna desecrate the integrity of your blade.<eos> You're not gonna want to move, Harold.
Oh, not just mine.<eos> There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.<eos> We're going to change the world.<eos> Well, the promises I've made you are still in place.<eos> I'll help you realign your chi so you can access the Iron Fist again.

I'll help you realign your chi so you can access the Iron Fist again.<eos> I'll help you become what you were meant to be.<eos> I don't even know what I'm meant be.<eos> How are you gonna help?<eos> I kind of got this feeling you're not allowed to kill me.
These two are warriors.<eos> You are nothing but a betrayer.<eos> You have no honor.<eos> I should have recognized you were too weak to be Hand.<eos> Deep in your soul, you know that you are nothing more than a teacher of children at a dojo that I gave you.
You couldn't... because you haven't got it in you, Danny.<eos> You're not a warrior.<eos> - You are a failure.<eos> - It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!
Yield!<eos> Danny!<eos> I hurt you.<eos> I get it.<eos> It was selfish and wrong of me to leave without telling you.
And Joy?<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All thanks to you.
Where will you be?<eos> I'll be at the Chikara Dojo.<eos> For the time being, anyway.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Hey, there is no way I can repay you, Danny.
Hey, there is no way I can repay you, Danny.<eos> You know, you freed me from the Hand.<eos> I can return to my life.<eos> With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.
All thanks to you.<eos> - You're like family to me.<eos> - Okay. Talk later.<eos> When Bakuto put the cuffs on me, I... I had no idea if the Fist was gonna work or not.<eos> - Does this mean you're better?
Well, it was a packed house at the arena last night.<eos> Hometown fans...<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir, you can't park there.<eos> Why don't you get it washed for me?
Jesus.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's not the best time to sneak up on me.<eos> At least it's a cute picture.<eos> I got you some sneakers, too.
I just... I just wonder why he would be<eos> - faking his death for all these years.<eos> - He didn't fake it.<eos> He really died.<eos> Let's make a list of things that you are never allowed to say again, starting with that.
And miss your visit? Heavens no.<eos> I've been looking forward to this.<eos> You're sounding rather anxious, Danny Rand.<eos> I need information.<eos> Why should I tell you anything?
And that's the real reason why you left K'un-Lun, isn't it?<eos> Your thirst for vengeance.<eos> You wanted someone to pay for the death of your mother and father.<eos> I didn't even know it was murder until after I left.<eos> You were only ten years old, but you were smart enough to know that airplanes don't drop from the sky for no reason.
- The Meachums, but...<eos> - But what?<eos> Harold was my father's best friend.<eos> He would never...<eos> He seems to have no problem hurting you now.
He's been pretending to be... be my friend.<eos> I...<eos> Danny, I'm so sorry.<eos> He's not gonna get away with this.<eos> I'll help you.
But the more you continue to fight against something that happened 15 years ago, a fight you can't possibly win, the darker you become.<eos> I can win any fight!<eos> Danny, some shit you just can't punch.<eos> You know you weren't given this gift so that you could commit murder.<eos> And I know that you think that killing Harold is gonna make you feel better, that it's somehow gonna make everything okay, but it's not.
Is there a version of this where we don't kill someone?<eos> - The tablet.<eos> How do we get the tablet?<eos> - Ward.<eos> He texted you to warn you about the DEA, right?
- I'm not lying about Dad.<eos> - Just stop.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I won't.<eos> You need to get yourself some help.
Danny, are you okay?<eos> I'm gonna put an end to your father.<eos> Who are your new friends?<eos> Joy, what are you doing here?<eos> You shouldn't be out of the hospital.
Yeah, I had to get out of there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm no fan of hospitals myself.<eos> I'll get the car to run you home.
Well, you're my daughter.<eos> That place opened up last year.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> My... my dead father's been spying on me?<eos> Oh, Joy, I think you need a little rest.
I saw everything that you had on the Hand's drug operation.<eos> Remember?<eos> Danny's name wasn't on any of it, so... tell me the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, the, uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.
You did it.<eos> You actually did.<eos> You set him up.<eos> - What?<eos> Did Danny tell you that?
Joy.<eos> So, everyone knows what they're doing?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You're gonna need this.
Come out of the darkness so I can see you.<eos> The battle is won.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I'm through with you, Harold.<eos> I've wasted too many years hating whatever it is you are.
Things changed for me.<eos> And you know that if you have any hope of returning to your old life, he must be removed.<eos> Removed?<eos> Killed.<eos> I can help you with that.
Trees.<eos> Green.<eos> I can almost smell the stew that Rabten keeps going day and night.<eos> We should get there just in time for afternoon kung fu practice.<eos> You're gonna love it.
I'm fucking hot as shit.<eos> My balls have melted into one fucking ball.<eos> Later, you're on duty, you're gonna pry these apart, all right?<eos> - Yeah, if I can fucking find it. - And you're gonna fucking like it, too. I should've joined the fucking Air Force.<eos> You're too fucking big for the Air Force.
- Shit.<eos> - What?<eos> This...<eos> Man, this fucking thing's fogging up, man.<eos> You have got to get rid of that shit.
All right, all right.<eos> So, tell me about Dean's scope.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> I can see it at the base of the wall there.<eos> Why do you keep it?
I can see it at the base of the wall there.<eos> Why do you keep it?<eos> Fuck.<eos> You said it's broken.<eos> Why would you carry around a broken scope, Isaac?
And you will bleed out before nightfall.<eos> What the fuck is going on with this shit?<eos> You fucker.<eos> You psychotic motherfucker.<eos> What do you want from me?
He's coming for us.<eos> He trained us.<eos> Trained us to survive.<eos> And won't he be disappointed?<eos> You didn't win shit.
Trained us to survive.<eos> And won't he be disappointed?<eos> You didn't win shit.<eos> You hear me, motherfucker?<eos> You didn't win shit.
- You bastard.<eos> You fucking... - Fuck me.<eos> Just fucking let him go, you piece of shit!<eos> Shane, get up, man!<eos> He ain't a threat to you anymore.
Have you at least started answering the phone?<eos> Only you could turn that big personal victory into a defeat.<eos> - You know what your problem is?<eos> - Sentences that start like that.<eos> You're not comfortable with what you've become.
- Yeah.<eos> Mind if I tell you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> That money is really gonna help your parents.<eos> But for you, from here on out... it's only gonna get harder, Aaron.
Sure.<eos> That money is really gonna help your parents.<eos> But for you, from here on out... it's only gonna get harder, Aaron.<eos> You realize you're only at mile one of the marathon... right?<eos> Everybody's gonna tell you how to feel.
I'm already angry.<eos> At who?<eos> Everyone.<eos> I just want my life back.<eos> They can't give you that.
I hope so.<eos> But maybe you won't.<eos> But your ability to get through it... as this gets harder... that is a hundred times more powerful than slapping a smile on your face and pretending like everything's just fine.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey, listen... no one can give you your life back, Aaron.
Harlem's gone through changes.<eos> It was bound to happen.<eos> What's Mariah doing?<eos> The same shit she was doing when you left.<eos> Look, right now, the only thing you need to worry about is you.
The same shit she was doing when you left.<eos> Look, right now, the only thing you need to worry about is you.<eos> Look, if you're talking about getting a job, I have every intention of doing just that.<eos> Doing what?<eos> How does being Harlem's hero allow you to live an actual life?
- Yeah.<eos> Do you wish you'd kept your secret to yourself?<eos> No.<eos> I needed you to know.<eos> I don't know what I expected, but I... I know I couldn't lie to you anymore.
We took down Diamondback.<eos> And now I'm ready to take down Mariah and Shades.<eos> I wish it was that easy.<eos> I know their hands are in something.<eos> Maybe you need another assist from outside the law.
Maybe.<eos> Or maybe she'd tell me I'm abandoning that life.<eos> And with it, her memory.<eos> You're not abandoning Elektra.<eos> You don't have it in you.
I'm just in between stuff right now.<eos> I'm always on that hustle, though.<eos> You feel me?<eos> I do.<eos> Listen... I can help you.
I'm always on that hustle, though.<eos> You feel me?<eos> I do.<eos> Listen... I can help you.<eos> Hypothetically speaking, if you ever need anything...
You feel me?<eos> I do.<eos> Listen... I can help you.<eos> Hypothetically speaking, if you ever need anything...<eos> I think you should go.
- What do you mean, "It's too late"?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Son, it's never too late...<eos> Yo, man, I ain't your son!<eos> I told you, I don't know a damn thing.
I'm, uh... returning your call.<eos> You remember the one where you tried to scare me?<eos> The guy downstairs said you were here.<eos> Dude, I don't care what weird shit you're into, but we gotta talk.<eos> All right, well, you're gonna pay for this.
New Yorkers like saying that.<eos> Still, after all this time, I...<eos> I don't know how I feel about it.<eos> That's the beauty of it.<eos> It can be whatever you need it to be.
Still, after all this time, I...<eos> I don't know how I feel about it.<eos> That's the beauty of it.<eos> It can be whatever you need it to be.<eos> What do you need it to be?
Don't do it.<eos> They're just kids.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Hey, Jess.<eos> It's me calling you for the third or fourth or 19th time.
- Hey.<eos> Everything okay out there?<eos> They're saying the epicenter was in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> I'm glad you're meditating.<eos> You need a break.
Just keep it clean.<eos> Not a lot of people have insurance here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> At least nobody died.<eos> Thanks to you.
'Cause I thought you said you were gonna take it easy on that for a while.<eos> Look, someone's hiring young men in Harlem to do their dirty work.<eos> Misty said the NYPD doesn't know what these young men are doing, but the body count's growing, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> Is the NYPD gonna pay you for doing their job?
The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.<eos> Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.<eos> And you'll need an appointment.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Actually, you don't.
Earth shook, Foggy.<eos> The cops weren't coming.<eos> Matt, stop!<eos> Whatever you're going through, I'm not gonna judge.<eos> But I do think I can help you through it.
The cops weren't coming.<eos> Matt, stop!<eos> Whatever you're going through, I'm not gonna judge.<eos> But I do think I can help you through it.<eos> I came to offer you something.
Most importantly, it's the type of stuff you're doing anyway.<eos> Malpractice.<eos> Workmen's comp.<eos> Good people who need justice.<eos> If you take these, it'll keep you up-to-your-eyeballs busy.
Something weird's going on at the studio.<eos> Weird how?<eos> This tremor stuff, I think...<eos> I think they want me to sweep it under the rug.<eos> Trish, I gotta call you back.
Weird how?<eos> This tremor stuff, I think...<eos> I think they want me to sweep it under the rug.<eos> Trish, I gotta call you back.<eos> Malcolm, what did I tell you about coming in my apartment?
This tremor stuff, I think...<eos> I think they want me to sweep it under the rug.<eos> Trish, I gotta call you back.<eos> Malcolm, what did I tell you about coming in my apartment?<eos> I told you to stop following me.
I don't know.<eos> But they're not gonna get away with this.<eos> Your wife came to me.<eos> She was worried.<eos> - I told you to stay away.
Easy, my child.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You'll need your strength.
Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You'll need your strength.<eos> Language will come back to you.
- Right.<eos> I didn't know she did diversity hires.<eos> Uh, I'm independent.<eos> I don't work for her firm.<eos> - Well, I'm not paying you.
Sorry.<eos> - Barely.<eos> Uh, Ms. Jones, may I ask how long you've been a PI?<eos> No.<eos> Are you always this rude to people trying to help you?
Are you always this rude to people trying to help you?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna find my own lawyer, thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, well, in reality, you don't need one.
- He's probably in jail by now. - Hmm.<eos> - I left him behind, Claire.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You're better off not in prison.
I'll be right back.<eos> - Hi, sweetie. How are you?<eos> - Hi, Mom. I'm okay.<eos> I'm sure we'll find out soon.<eos> Why don't we lay you down, and you can let me fix you supper.
Long story.<eos> What kind?<eos> Was it voluntary?<eos> They made me this way.<eos> That's all you need to know.
If I were in your shoes, I'd think twice about using that thing on people who are trying to feed their families.<eos> This isn't gonna work out, it's obvious.<eos> Good luck, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you're having a rough time in here.
Good luck, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you're having a rough time in here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Misty says you'll be arraigned within 24 hours... but we can figure this out.
Hi.<eos> We met the other night.<eos> Oh, we didn't meet, son.<eos> God himself sent you.<eos> You don't have to hide anything from me.
I can't be a part of this.<eos> If you ask me, you already are.<eos> We need to put it all on the table.<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> I don't owe you any...
I don't owe you any...<eos> - I don't trust you.<eos> You wanna take your hand off my shoulder?<eos> Take off the mask.<eos> You're not gonna like where this is heading.
Try me.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Counselor, a word?<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> You're gonna need another lawyer.
Trust me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You're the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Or Devil Boy,<eos> - or whatever it is you like to be called.
Besides, you leaping around the city like a Russian gymnast didn't exactly help.<eos> - You don't have any proof.<eos> - I did.<eos> You smashed it.<eos> I'm not threatening you.
You know where the organization stands.<eos> Our resources are depleted.<eos> Is that why you came here?<eos> To scold me like a child?<eos> No, but you should worry about the possibility of death.
We will.<eos> Then we're not close enough.<eos> The problem with your leadership has always been your inability to get your hands dirty.<eos> In all our time together, I have never asked for your advice.<eos> And why would you?
He seems to have found some allies. Three of them.<eos> Only three?<eos> They were rather exceptional.<eos> And so, you come to me.<eos> I come to you because it's important that we take care of this together.
I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.<eos> It was good to see you.<eos> Let me know when they fit you for a costume.
Look, I'm not looking for super friends.<eos> Yeah, you keep on telling yourself that.<eos> You came to Midland Circle for a reason.<eos> I came to help Harlem.<eos> Not you.
I can't... I can't tell.<eos> Well, I'll be goddamned.<eos> This wouldn't be my first choice, but I am a sucker for fortune cookies.<eos> You know, I thought it would be a good idea if we all talked this over... like adults.<eos> What do you want?
There are no alternatives.<eos> Oh, darling, there are always alternatives.<eos> That's what makes life interesting.<eos> Cut the shit, Alexandra.<eos> - What do you want?
And while that might give you some comfort, I promise you, it's temporary.<eos> They will disappoint you.<eos> They haven't yet.<eos> They will not make you stronger.<eos> And if I might give you some advice, the more connections you have, the easier it will be to break you.
- A goddamn culling. - Hmm.<eos> And New York is so densely populated.<eos> What are you talking about doing?<eos> Think of how many lives you can save if you just come with me.<eos> What do you want?
She wasn't like you and me.<eos> And now I know...<eos> I was never meant to raise her.<eos> I was meant to raise the Black Sky.<eos> I'm grateful for you.
I was meant to raise the Black Sky.<eos> I'm grateful for you.<eos> You had no choice in returning from death.<eos> I realize that.<eos> But I hope you understand that this is the life you were chosen to lead, as a weapon against our enemies.
I wouldn't say that.<eos> When you're done with that, I'd like to talk.<eos> There's nothing left to talk about.<eos> It feels as if fate has brought us back together, doesn't it?<eos> What do you want with Danny?
Brainwashing?<eos> You flourished under my training.<eos> Became the fighter you were meant to be.<eos> The fighter you wanted me to be.<eos> The one you needed for whatever horrible shit you're trying to get away with.
Became the fighter you were meant to be.<eos> The fighter you wanted me to be.<eos> The one you needed for whatever horrible shit you're trying to get away with.<eos> Join me, Colleen.<eos> This time I'll tell you everything.
You really shouldn't.<eos> I heard you'd made some friends.<eos> Smart move, considering she never believed in her purpose, and you've yet to discover yours.<eos> Soon, Iron Fist.<eos> You'll learn your destiny is much more than what they told you in K'un-Lun.
It won't be long before your plan comes apart.<eos> Before this chair I'm in becomes a throne.<eos> - We're getting everyone safe.<eos> - Good.<eos> - He give you anything yet?
I'm glad to see you.<eos> Gotta be honest, I'm glad to have a break from depositions.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What's the story?<eos> Matt didn't tell you?
We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.<eos> I was willing to work with you.<eos> But how can I trust you?
- You okay?<eos> - Yeah, I mean... my head's still attached.<eos> - You didn't have to kill him.
Me neither.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna try and keep me here against my will?<eos> I hear what you're saying, Danny, but...<eos> And no one loves this city more than I do, but you can't leave this room.
- Don't do this.<eos> Hey, you guys seriously need to back off.<eos> You just stay here.<eos> We can keep you safe, all right?<eos> You just need to calm down.
It's just a different way of viewing the world.<eos> - Quite different.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's about perspective.<eos> Hey, why don't you tell me again about how you punched the dragon and got your magic hand?
It's simple.<eos> My dad abandoned us and got himself killed.<eos> - I know it's probably hard to understand...<eos> - Actually, it's not.<eos> Your dad didn't wanna hurt you or your mom.
Do you remember?<eos> I do.<eos> You wanted to stay with the elders.<eos> You wanted to... use our discoveries only for good.<eos> It's time for you to know the truth.
One headless, the other impaled.<eos> What happened last night?<eos> - Where are the others?<eos> - That's none of your business.<eos> But if you wanna play it coy and ask to speak to your lawyer, you should know that they knocked his ass out, too.
- Looks like it.<eos> Listen, I need you to realize we are on the same side.<eos> Now, I held up my end of the bargain.<eos> I protected your friends.<eos> It's about damn time you dealt me in.
Not anymore.<eos> The Hand took her.<eos> They did something to her.<eos> - Whatever she is, she's not herself.<eos> - Matt, you need to take a breath.
This gives us power.<eos> This isn't power.<eos> Living underground. In hiding.<eos> You know nothing of power.<eos> You didn't exist until Alexandra gave you life.
I don't have time for this now.<eos> The entire city is in danger.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm not dumb enough to think I can try and stop you.<eos> I'm here because I'm trying to help you keep your two lives separate.
Okay, good.<eos> 'Cause the people in this building need to always, and only, see you as a lawyer.<eos> I know.<eos> What is this?<eos> I still have a key to your place, so I brought you a change of clothes.
Harlem can't afford to lose him.<eos> You know, on his first day out of lockup, you took him on a walk... and told him that he was capable of turning this city around.<eos> Of saving somebody.<eos> That's exactly what he's trying to do right now.<eos> It may not be convenient for you or the NYPD.
Everyone okay?<eos> Okay is long gone.<eos> You should be at the precinct.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I know what you want, but you're not gonna get it.
Guys, this is... a lot worse than what we faced before.<eos> That's an understatement.<eos> So how are we gonna handle it?<eos> I got an idea.<eos> But you're not gonna like it.
I know your limits.<eos> There's no damage that you can do to me that can't be undone.<eos> Especially because the Iron Fist has already given us the ultimate gift.<eos> Life without end.<eos> I'll give you one last chance to experience it with me.
I know...<eos> I know I loved you.<eos> - Your heart will be your downfall.<eos> - Please... listen to me.<eos> - I don't want to hurt you.
Now!<eos> If this is who you truly are, why haven't you killed me yet?<eos> - You've had your chance.<eos> - I've had many.<eos> If I truly mean nothing to you, if there's truly no light inside of you, why not just do it?
For all your talk of embracing the darkness, I don't think you want to be alone in it.<eos> - I've seen death.<eos> - And you're afraid of it.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Because you'll be by my side, where you belong.
Exactly the same.<eos> I was able to track down versions of our old furniture, and even found replicas of all the knickknacks that burned in the fire.<eos> - It's bizarre.<eos> - Bizarre in a good way. - No.<eos> - You don't like it?
Are you done? - Because I feel like there's more.<eos> - No. - I'm seeing, like, a whole... - Yeah, this is...<eos> Look. Frank will provide for us.<eos> - Right? He's got tons of money.<eos> - Mm-hmm. You're never gonna have to work another day in your life.
What's so great about me, Charlie?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Why are you so obsessed with me?<eos> I mean, you said it yourself, I'm a mess.<eos> So, why don't you just go find somebody better?
- What?<eos> - Mandy, here's what we're gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna make you a decent proposal.<eos> Not an indecent proposal like in the movie... because I think to pay a million bucks to get laid... that's out of the question.<eos> I'm gonna offer you $5,000.
I'm gonna make you a decent proposal.<eos> Not an indecent proposal like in the movie... because I think to pay a million bucks to get laid... that's out of the question.<eos> I'm gonna offer you $5,000.<eos> - What are you doing, Frank? - Look,<eos> I'm gonna give you $5,000, we bang, you take the money, you go up, you get on a plane, you fly to wherever the hell it is in the sticks, and, uh, you know, $5,000 goes a long way up there.
My name... my name isn't Brian LeFevre.<eos> My real name... is Dane Brass.<eos> And I hold top secret government information. Okay?<eos> They're after me, that's-that's why everything's been so weird.<eos> That's why I haven't been able to speak openly with you. And you and Brian Jr., you'll have to get away from me because it's-it's not safe.
With a pencil.<eos> I know. I've heard the story.<eos> With a fucking pencil!<eos> Who the fuck can do that?<eos> Well, I can assure you... that the stories you hear about this man, if nothing else... has been watered down.
What is this?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> This is your blood.<eos> You came to me.<eos> I helped you.
You gave me this.<eos> Gift from the Boogeyman.<eos> Perfect for every occasion.<eos> But you also gave me a choice.<eos> Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die, or keep the pressure on my neck... and live.
Perfect for every occasion.<eos> But you also gave me a choice.<eos> Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die, or keep the pressure on my neck... and live.<eos> And so you see, I survived.<eos> No one sneaks up on me anymore, thanks to you.
How sweet it is!<eos> The Boogeyman begging me for help.<eos> Well, of course, John.<eos> Yes, John. Whatever you'd like, John.<eos> Would you like a back rub with that, John?
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.<eos> You sound positively magnanimous.<eos> But look around you.<eos> How much help does it look like I need?<eos> It seems to me that the real question, Mr. Wick, is who in this cruel world of ours, is going to help you?
Because I deemed it not to be.<eos> Now.<eos> You have one hour.<eos> I can't delay it any longer.<eos> You might need this... down the road.
- Yeah.<eos> - We're not gonna get - drenched in piss.<eos> - No. We're gonna go in there, find our favorite ride, - bomb down it once,<eos> then sit by the pool the rest of the day disease-free. Don't kid yourself about the water, buddy.<eos> You're not gonna be disease-free;
Sherman, did you pee?<eos> - No.<eos> - Sherman, my vial<eos> - is turning light pink.<eos> - Ugh... goddamn it, Sherman, I ordered you not to pee!
Off-duty, of course.<eos> This is your jurisdiction.<eos> - Look, I caught her stealing sunglasses. - Yeah? - No, I didn't!<eos> I was just... - Abigail,<eos> I gave you $20 to buy whatever you wanted. What happened to that?
Yes.<eos> Well, then you need to pay for these sunglasses.<eos> Actually, no. You know what? On second thought, no.<eos> You don't get the sunglasses.<eos> - You need to be taught a lesson. - I think that she gets...
Now I'm thinking about a glass of water to go with the chips.<eos> How-how many of my thoughts do you need? Do you want me to go on and on, or...<eos> No, that's...<eos> Mom, you know that I think you are the most captivating and beautiful woman in the world, don't you? - No. - Oh!<eos> I got something for you.
"Heartbreaker."<eos> Just like you.<eos> I ain't wearing no lipstick.<eos> Come on, Mom.<eos> Be-be agreeable, which makes you rootable, which makes you likeable.
- Mom stays in the picture.<eos> - Let's go, come on!<eos> - Charlie! I only got to third!<eos> - Come on, get out of here. Go.<eos> You can have any woman you want... it's got to be my mom?
Ready to put on a show for all these guys.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Who are these guys?<eos> Uh, just like to take the opportunity to thank Fight Milk.<eos> Yes, and thank you, Cowboy, and thank you, Megan.
And I caught him saying some pretty troubling stuff.<eos> What are we watching here?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cats, cats.<eos> Is that me?<eos> Cats. I'll tell you what to do with cats.
You are entitled to nothing!<eos> Listen, motion to present articles of confederation. - Motion denied.<eos> - Oh...<eos> Shut up, bitch.<eos> You don't deserve anything. Excuse me.
- Yeah, this one we can't do in-house. - We can't... we can't...<eos> That's why I wanted to bring in a third party.<eos> Someone to hear us out and deliver a final verdict. - That's you, guy.<eos> - Yeah, that's... you.<eos> That's you.
- Yeah, yeah. I mean, come on. It's just a word.<eos> "Just a word." Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, Frank, tell me something:<eos> If you were going to save somebody else's life, you know, from a falling piano, and you needed a word to just... - to just cut right through... - Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, we're good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, son. - Dad? !<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I broke out of jail and came straight to see you.
And, uh, the Boy's also gonna be dancing with me. Okay.<eos> Uh, whatever. Uh, uh...<eos> Yeah, we need Mike.<eos> We need him. - Mike?<eos> Why do you want Mike, Dee? - What?
What happened? - Where am I?<eos> - Oh, you're in the back office.<eos> You passed out playing the game, dude.<eos> We dragged you back here so you could sleep.<eos> Oh, Mac. I think I was too hard on you.
- Wait, what-what am I smelling? Cheese.<eos> - Is that made of cheese?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> And then I painted the rest with, like, magic marker and stuff.<eos> Oh, Christ. Why did you make a cheese lollipop? It stinks.
- Oh, that's so Jerry.<eos> - No, not Jerry.<eos> Not the worm. Never the worm.<eos> We're talking about Frank, okay?<eos> If you just pretend to like the worm, then he'll probably just get rid of it.
I'm trying to write a valentine. I just... Oh.<eos> Okay. Uh, okay.<eos> Well, I'll just, uh, let you finish. - Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I also got you a box of chocolates, so...
Oh, and literally everything rhymes with "Jerry," okay?<eos> Scary, hairy, Mother Mary, quite contrary.<eos> Woozy, woozy.<eos> Woozy from sucking lines. - Ho.<eos> - All right, Frank, Frank, Frank, before you do another thing, - I wanted to give you a valentine. - Unbelievable!
- Oh, goddamn it! - Charlie.<eos> I'm getting a goddamn valentine right goddamn now, or so help me God... I will end us all. No, don't.<eos> Give the bitch what she wants. - I will...<eos> - I'm so frustrated right now. Okay, fine, Dee.<eos> You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna sing you a song. Okay?
You remember him?<eos> Come on. Give the job a shot, for Christ's sake.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> I got to pop in here first.<eos> You don't have to go into a dive bar right now.
- You don't know what the job is, Cricket. - You don't know the job.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I know it probably involves hurting me, degrading me or generally treating me like shit.<eos> - You're not totally wrong. Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> - Cricket, uh, we'll give you five bucks, huh?
Well, uh, actually, that is true, because I... I do have a date. - Oh.<eos> Cricket. Cricket. - Ah.<eos> Well, don't make up a story. I mean, yeah, we don't care what you're doing with the money.<eos> Hey, dipshit!<eos> We're not paying you to talk on the phone.
- Oh, uh, Frank.<eos> Lemons.<eos> What? No. N-No, okay?<eos> Okay? Hey, we had an agreement.<eos> You want to get paid in PCP, Cricket?
Davy, Pops.<eos> I met the most amazing girl.<eos> I'm in love.<eos> I'm in love!<eos> And I owe it all to you, Dad, for giving me a second chance.
Well, guess I'm gonna have to cut your heart out then.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> I said I guess I'm gonna have to cut... your heart... out of your body.<eos> You see, uh, I'm from the streets.<eos> And I'm about to poke you full of holes.
Huh. He's gone.<eos> Way to go, Rickety Cricket.<eos> So, you did exactly what I thought you'd do, you goddamn street rat!<eos> Matt, Matt, goddamn it.<eos> I gave you a shot.
Let's talk.<eos> I want you back.<eos> I like to re-negotiate terms.<eos> But I don't see how.<eos> Of things you'll not, you said That's the way you are.
You put money into my account. That I don't want it.<eos> You bought the company I work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship Christian, It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.<eos> I'm... just wanting to get close to you.
So you stay the fuck away from us.<eos> Hey.<eos> - We should think about going. So..<eos> - I wanna go now.<eos> What did Elena say to you?
But I know the CEO.<eos> I told 'em what happened.<eos> You'll never have to see him again.<eos> Am I still gonna have a job now he's not there?<eos> - Well, if you don't, you can...
Am I still gonna have a job now he's not there?<eos> - Well, if you don't, you can...<eos> - Christian.<eos> You know I love working.<eos> You can't keep me locked up in your penthouse.
- Well, if you don't, you can...<eos> - Christian.<eos> You know I love working.<eos> You can't keep me locked up in your penthouse.<eos> What if I give you a key?
You kept some of your stuff here.<eos> Keep all of your stuff here.<eos> And you slept, you know?<eos> Not at your place.<eos> Are you asking me to move in with you?
No.<eos> Hey, it was all you.<eos> - But you don't believe me?<eos> - I don't believe it myself.<eos> - I asked you a question last night.
Okay.<eos> He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.
Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I told you to come straight here.<eos> I have had people out combing the streets looking for you.<eos> I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.<eos> Maybe you just really need someone who obeys every command.
You didn't.. have any weird dreams or anything or like.<eos> - Wake up at all.<eos> - No.<eos> Nothing I can think of.<eos> I mean there was a little thing about asking you to marry me but aside from that, no.
The boy already has everything except the sense of humor.<eos> Er.. his.<eos> His birthday. When is his birthday?<eos> Sunday.<eos> He didn't tell you? He is so weird.
Hold tight. Hold tight.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Oh my god, you're so tanned.<eos> Glowing.<eos> - you want a beer Anna?
And because of that I'm never taking anything for granted. Ever again.<eos> Hey, I heard about the crash.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine, Elena, thank you.<eos> Anna, let me introduce to you my good friend Elena Lincoln.
You're just a mousy little thing after his money.<eos> He's not capable of marriage.<eos> Thank you, Christian.<eos> Why're you even here Elena?<eos> - She's not right for you.
He's not capable of marriage.<eos> Thank you, Christian.<eos> Why're you even here Elena?<eos> - She's not right for you.<eos> - You don't know what's right for me.
- Oh, don't start.<eos> - So what?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> - Your personal number!<eos> - What have I told you?
If I'm so annoying, why did you come back?<eos> - You're always having a pop.<eos> - There's a protocol.<eos> I did not miss this, the constant berating.<eos> - She can't ring you all the time.
She was struck on the back of the head, so we're looking for anything that might have been used.<eos> Violent attack, ligature traces, possible use of a condom.<eos> Starts to look like it was premeditated.<eos> You do your dusting and leave us to sort the conclusions, eh?<eos> I think you should say sorry to Brian.
Let us know what you find.<eos> - This is where Trish works?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We'll let them know she won't be in for a while.<eos> Can I ask you a question, Miller?
It isn't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tom!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> You're 15!
You're 15!<eos> Well, everyone watches this stuff.<eos> You are not everyone.<eos> You have to be better than that.<eos> I will not have you be your father's son.
Yeah, cinema.<eos> - Mark, I didn't mean to...<eos> - Bye.<eos> It's bad enough he hardly comes round any more.<eos> You don't have to say things like that.
No!<eos> - Let me see.<eos> - No!<eos> Come on.<eos> I made you a special breakfast.
Other kids answer questions. They don't get into trouble.<eos> You didn't get in trouble for answering questions.<eos> You yelled at the principal.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're gonna find this interesting.
I know.<eos> You promised you wouldn't, then the first day...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I screwed up.<eos> Do you think maybe this boat needs a test ride?
Thank your grandma.<eos> Thank you, Grandma.<eos> Grandmother or Evelyn will do just fine.<eos> There's so much more on there.<eos> Things I know you'll find really challenging. Yes.
Say good night to Grandmother or Evelyn.<eos> Good night.<eos> I'd kill a priest for a Benadryl.<eos> Still with the allergies?<eos> Why in God's name have you got a cat?
I see. Fine.<eos> Well, I'm not leaving without her.<eos> Well, welcome to Florida.<eos> Frank, please listen to reason.<eos> At some point, either you're gonna come to the conclusion, or someone in authority is going to spell it out for you that the child's best interest is all that matters.
Are you allowed in this apartment this early on Saturday morning?<eos> Yes or no?<eos> - No.<eos> - No!<eos> Are you allowed to...
Are you allowed to...<eos> Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> Enough with the Legos.<eos> Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?
Come on, please.<eos> Do you really have no life because of me?<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> Did you mean it?<eos> Last month you said I was the worst uncle in the world... and you wished death upon me 'cause I didn't buy you a piano.
Always.<eos> Oh, no, you don't want to look at that one.<eos> Is that you?<eos> Yes.<eos> How old were you?
Wanna come inside?<eos> Cat.<eos> Frank, I think this is stupid.<eos> Why don't we just call Evelyn and tell her I don't wanna do this?<eos> Because like I told you, Evelyn didn't order this. The court did.
Hi, Mary.<eos> I'm Pat Golding, but you can call me Pat if you like.<eos> Got it.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> I mean has anyone told you what this is about?
I don't understand this.<eos> I thought you were supposed to be on my team.<eos> Why are you bringing me this deal?<eos> Other than I'm required to by law?<eos> You like this deal?
I made a mistake.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was so sad!<eos> I missed you.<eos> I missed you, too.
For real?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's home kicking around his ping pong ball.<eos> Why did you leave me there?<eos> Because I thought I was bad for you.
- Nowhere.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You two, out!<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Do you want to know... how Diane told me she finished?
So you will do nothing.<eos> As your queen I forbid it.<eos> Strange.<eos> Is it true you saved his life?<eos> Who told you that?
How can you speak English so well?<eos> We speak hundreds of languages.<eos> We are the bridge to a greater understanding between all men.<eos> Right.<eos> I didn't get a chance to say this earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.
We speak hundreds of languages.<eos> We are the bridge to a greater understanding between all men.<eos> Right.<eos> I didn't get a chance to say this earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.<eos> Thank you for what you did on the beach.
"... you can either do nothing, or you can do something."<eos> And I already tried nothing.<eos> Nice outfit.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I'll show you the way off the Island and you'll take me to Ares.
Yes, I do..<eos> But out of the confines of marriage.<eos> Not polite to assume, you know?<eos> "Marriage"?<eos> Marriage! You don't have...
So you cannot sleep with me unless I marry you..<eos> I sleep with you if you want. I'll sleep right there.<eos> There is plenty of room.<eos> - Then fine, if you don't mind...<eos> - No, it's up to you.
There is plenty of room.<eos> - Then fine, if you don't mind...<eos> - No, it's up to you.<eos> - I'm just fine.<eos> - Coming to sleep with you.
Do you know about that?<eos> I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's criticism on earthly pleasures<eos> 12 huh?<eos> Did you bring any of those with you?<eos> You would not enjoy them.
No. I let you go. You take me to Ares.<eos> -We made a deal, Steve Trevor.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> And a deal is a promise.<eos> You know promises unbreakable.
Friendship ending the war, friendship...<eos> - Okay, You have no money.<eos> - No.<eos> All I want now is a picture of that beautiful face.<eos> You will not need a photo because I'll go with you.
Very reputable.<eos> A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Careful, I might get offended.<eos> I wasn't referring to you.
But I'm the wrong color.<eos> Everyone's fighting their own battle, Diana.<eos> Truth is you're fighting yours.<eos> It's too much.<eos> I wish you...
I don't know.<eos> I would say she was pretty undercover on that battlefield.<eos> It's just gonna, we can't get you there. It's all scouted out, we'll put back...<eos> But as long as he's still alive, it doesn't...<eos> You cannot go into German high command and not kill anyone.

It's all scouted out, we'll put back...<eos> But as long as he's still alive, it doesn't...<eos> You cannot go into German high command and not kill anyone.<eos> You just can't. You have to trust me.
I will stop Ares!<eos> What if you're wrong?<eos> What if there's no Ares?<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> I can not let you do this.
What if you're wrong?<eos> What if there's no Ares?<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> I can not let you do this.<eos> What I do is not up to you.
Only a God can kill another God.<eos> Zeus left the child he had with the queen of the Amazon.<eos> ...As a weapon to use against me.<eos> No. You liar.<eos> I compel you to tell me the truth.
- Steve!<eos> - Come on, let's go!<eos> Sammy, let's go!<eos> Get these things out of here.<eos> Oh my dear, you have so much to learn.
Daddy?<eos> Samuel.<eos> What are you doing there?<eos> Just watching TV, I can't sleep.<eos> Can you not sleep either?
Everything goes a little more slowly without you there.<eos> Hey, I don't mean anything by that.<eos> You come back whenever you're ready.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> Are you feeling any better?
- He's at my sister's, remember?<eos> What, I can't even say goodbye to him?<eos> Honey, you don't have to say goodbye.<eos> You can see him whenever you want.<eos> You don't have to say goodbye.
You know, he loves having the dog and the cats around.<eos> He's not gonna understand that.<eos> He will, not right now, but he will eventually.<eos> We'll just make it normal for him.<eos> Jake, I think you just need some time to focus on you.
Yeah, sure.<eos> So we still don't have a trial date.<eos> That will take a while but you know management will provide all the legal coverage you need, so.<eos> We're thinking of you, Jake.<eos> This is the second time I've offered, but we all agree you could use some psychological support.
Yeah, right.<eos> And as far as work goes, there are several options.<eos> You could stay here doing administrative work.<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> Or we could also offer you another possibility.
And as far as work goes, there are several options.<eos> You could stay here doing administrative work.<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> Or we could also offer you another possibility.<eos> Only if you're interested, of course, but the severance package that we could offer you could be very advantageous.
What are you proposing?<eos> The tests I carried out, I want to do the same with Shirley Allardyce.<eos> If we find what we are looking for, then that means it is not safe to live here.<eos> We cannot let fear take hold.<eos> I would never hurt you.
- What's he talking a...<eos> - Mister Lennox?<eos> Hey, Bianca.<eos> I did it.<eos> Everything you need.
No, no, no, no, we didn't.<eos> Oslo can't run Fortitude by proxy...<eos> Believe me, they don't want to run Fortitude at all.<eos> I've already co-signed these.<eos> You need to sign them.
Dan Anderssen?<eos> Eric still hasn't found a body.<eos> Eric doesn't need a body.<eos> He needs a badge.<eos> You need a sheriff.
Because how the fuck is any poor fucker ever supposed to know how you feel about them.<eos> If you feel about them.<eos> They could trust their instincts.<eos> My instincts!<eos> My instincts told me that you wanted Jason.
Oh, my God, they are all gone.<eos> Like all the dogs...<eos> Its spine has.... the... the spine has been removed.<eos> You eat when I say, you sleep when I say.<eos> You do everything I tell you, you do everything Lamont tells you... because you fuck up out there at sea, and it's all over but the shouting.
Goodnight, Natalie.<eos> If you're too repressed to say it, I'm not.<eos> I don't want to live without you.<eos> Are you planning to keep the beard?<eos> You don't like the beard?
I do.<eos> Did you miss me then?<eos> What...?<eos> Dan Anderssen used to say, if someone said "Will you miss me?",<eos> Dan used to say... "I'll only miss you if you zig-zag."
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your Cuban coffees'?<eos> What is it, black, no sugar?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I put a lot of work into getting you here today.<eos> Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
You go to prison.<eos> And there's nothing we can do to get you out.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.<eos> So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now, and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons, I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
It's good to see you, Nobody.<eos> You, too.<eos> Rule number one...<eos> Know your audience.<eos> I gave you your shot.
Rule number one...<eos> Know your audience.<eos> I gave you your shot.<eos> You shit the bed.<eos> Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
Well, well, well...<eos> Luke Hobbs behind bars.<eos> Would you look at that.<eos> The bent cop got his day.<eos> You know, that color looks good on you.
Watch these two.<eos> Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.<eos> Which we can reverse."<eos> And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.<eos> I'm telling you, they got skills.
Probably.<eos> Hello, Deckard.<eos> Nice to see you again.<eos> Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.<eos> Your family's already replacing you.
But so did you.<eos> You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.<eos> I wonder what Letty thought about that.<eos> The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.<eos> I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.<eos> Elena.<eos> Dom?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You shouldn't have come.
See Papa?<eos> See Papa.<eos> Papa.<eos> When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.<eos> So I decided when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon, I was going to tell you.
I know you.<eos> And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.<eos> Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.<eos> So much to think about.<eos> Let me make it easier for you.
You see these cameras in here?<eos> The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.<eos> It's not to save me.<eos> It's to kill your son.<eos> Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
And I'm fucking thirsty.<eos> I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.<eos> What more could you possibly want?
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?<eos> I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.<eos> You didn't even know you had a kid.<eos> You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.<eos> Help you start a war.
What's that?<eos> Rule number three.<eos> Which is?<eos> There are no rules.<eos> What'd I tell you, Luke?
Take whatever vehicle you want.<eos> All bets are off.<eos> All bets are off?<eos> Bets are off?<eos> Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.
Get in!<eos> What?<eos> Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.<eos> Drop it to 10,000 feet.<eos> I know how much these people mean to you.
What?<eos> Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.<eos> Drop it to 10,000 feet.<eos> I know how much these people mean to you.<eos> So I will let you pick the first target.
Dada.<eos> Dada.<eos> You made me miss my shot.<eos> What you think you're doing?<eos> Looking at you dead in the eye.
Where's that smile?<eos> Ah. There it is.<eos> You were gonna shoot a baby?<eos> You sick bastard.<eos> You're not gonna wanna see this.
How did you find me?<eos> You want to see the old Dom?<eos> Watch.<eos> Resourceful.<eos> You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.
Hear that?<eos> Bile and bitterness.<eos> Not a single tear from anyone at the graveside.<eos> I didn't hear any piss at the leather.<eos> Perhaps you had no need, or perhaps you came out here with... With a purpose?
The land in your father's will is not only useless, it is dangerous to any who owns it.<eos> They're my rocks now.<eos> James...<eos> I can arrange the immediate transfer of this particular asset.<eos> I'll send you a formal proposition in writing.
They attend the funeral of a widower 'cause they know there'll be lots of old men.<eos> And that animal from Africa is here to pick at an old man's bones, too.<eos> Perhaps we should let Thoyt deal with the matter.<eos> Let's call our carriage.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure... is that I still love you.
And that animal from Africa is here to pick at an old man's bones, too.<eos> Perhaps we should let Thoyt deal with the matter.<eos> Let's call our carriage.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure... is that I still love you.<eos> And if you are ever short of two shillings, please do not hesitate to ask, as Africa also served me incredibly well.

Get off me.<eos> - Begging your pardon, sir.<eos> - What, why?<eos> Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.
- No, I want my family offices back.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> How much do you make here?<eos> With the workers in the yard and the boats that moor at the wharf... we make £10 a day.<eos> I can give you five and whatever you like.
They have knives and ropes.<eos> If you have any sense...<eos> People who do not know me soon come to understand that I do not have any sense.<eos> Now, please do not misunderstand the situation.<eos> You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.
You...<eos> I remember you.<eos> I remember you.<eos> Heard the stories.<eos> If I give you a girl, I will never see her again.
You heard right.<eos> Be punctual.<eos> - They've brought the carriage up.<eos> - Yes. I'm coming.<eos> You're not imploring him to relinquish his deed, you're insisting that, for his own welfare, he submit his claim to you.
Hmm?<eos> The dogs here live off the flesh from suicides jumping off Blackfriars Bridge.<eos> Never known one go tamely to a man's hand.<eos> Must be some witchcraft you picked up somewhere.<eos> What do you want?
The son is as unstable as the father.<eos> Perhaps the rumours about him are true.<eos> I'd hoped to settle this matter in a modern way, but that's not going to be possible.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Dear James, the letter I sent to you this morning was written under the supervision of my husband, to whom I am happily married.
Atticus, I want an explanation.<eos> Helga, get in!<eos> Come on!<eos> It's all right.<eos> You've nothing to fear.
The East India Company?<eos> Is that the truth, little boy?<eos> You know what happens to little boys that lie, don't you?<eos> I swear, it's the truth.<eos> James is offering you a new start.
Demands will be met, and pride will be swallowed.<eos> And when morning becomes afternoon<eos> Then<eos> I will become a free man.<eos> How would you know that?
'My cage is my flesh, I can shed it.<eos> 'The River Thames will take me to God.<eos> 'Death is just the turning of a key in a lock.<eos> 'Whether God will accept me is another matter, 'perhaps my husband will have spoken of my betrayal.<eos> 'Or perhaps my feelings for you, 'unforgiveable feelings for you, 'will mean the Thames will take me to a different place.
Brace, you were not born for freedom.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with it.<eos> It would torture you.<eos> Now, go home.<eos> Everything belongs to you now.
Yes.<eos> You always had such beautiful fingers.<eos> Maria?<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm sorry for what I did to you.
James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Dear Lord Almighty, is that your brother?<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure is that I still love you.
'Now he is returned 'and Delaney's will leaves him everything, including Nootka.'<eos> Britain and the United States are currently at war.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I can give you whatever you like - boys, girls.
This Nootka Sound is a curse. It will bring the King and Empire down upon your head.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> So, you've no problem with the principle of obeying me, just the execution.<eos> Execution? Of Delaney.<eos> I told you to take care of it.
What's the biggest thing you saw, and the smallest?<eos> And also the money your father owed me.<eos> See, there it is.<eos> Nothing changes.<eos> Are you more comfortable with business than with learning, James?
So, how much will you give me for not killing your father?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Well, £15... £15. ..and the return of your horse.<eos> I will give you £15, minus the heels on my boots... and I will need your eyes and ears from now on as well.
Nothing.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Well, £15... £15. ..and the return of your horse.<eos> I will give you £15, minus the heels on my boots... and I will need your eyes and ears from now on as well.<eos> Yeah, well, the enemies you're stirring up, James, you'll be needing them, my boy.
Mistress Helga gave information to a man with a silver tooth.<eos> I spy on her.<eos> From the conversation, he meant to do you harm, and the mistress knew it.<eos> She wants you dead, so she can have her rooms back.<eos> How old are you?
I want to go to America.<eos> Promise to take me to America one day.<eos> New York or Boston?<eos> The current here heads for Gravesend.<eos> You know navigation.
But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.<eos> And hashish, enough to ease my grieving when the East India Company slit your throat, which, of course, they will.<eos> You have appointments today.<eos> Breakfast will be out in half an hour... if you can contrive to stay alive that long.
Who claims to be the widow.<eos> The marriage is confirmed and is legal.<eos> What is the significance of this, Mr Godfrey?<eos> It's not written down.<eos> You have to work it out.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, welcome to London violin virtuoso Nicolas Mori.<eos> Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't.<eos> What?<eos> I missed you.
James, please, don't.<eos> What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.<eos> Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?
You live in the East, I live in the West..<eos> There are no practical difficulties.<eos> Apart from that great big river that connects us.<eos> Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?
Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?<eos> I would laugh at you, but you're not well.<eos> And I can't stand to have you this close to me... Well, that is a shame, isn't it?<eos> Because I will always be this close to you.
Get a message to Coop.<eos> Tell him we withdraw our negotiators from the India talks.<eos> The Prince Regent has decided to decline your offer.<eos> - For crying out loud, Godders.<eos> - He will not offer you a monopoly.
The hand was raised.<eos> They talked about gunpowder.<eos> Pettifer said if Delaney Trading Company wanted to trade with the Indians at Nootka, the only merchandise you could possibly use would be gunpowder.<eos> Wilton pointed out that in times of war, the production of gunpowder is controlled by the Crown.<eos> You will not be granted a licence to purchase.
I'll get her.<eos> Winter said you looked impressed.<eos> I am.<eos> Oysters mask the smell of sex.<eos> You like that.
I am.<eos> Oysters mask the smell of sex.<eos> You like that.<eos> Yes, I might have a use for that, actually.<eos> You may need to bring a couple of girls to the Dolphin with you.
Now, I make no moral judgments.<eos> And besides, Carlsbad said to say that you can have her.<eos> You can have her as part of the deal.<eos> Part of our second offering.<eos> So why don't you just take her?
Part of our second offering.<eos> So why don't you just take her?<eos> Just take her with you.<eos> No more hiding.<eos> We can guarantee you safe passage, anonymity... new worlds.
Is he here?<eos> Is this real?<eos> Why's he here?<eos> Is it him?<eos> You should get away.
In that event, it would be potatoes, wouldn't it?<eos> Simple sustenance.<eos> Life goes on.<eos> Before you drink any more, could you tell me what happened?<eos> But in the event... of a messenger coming to tell you that he had killed me, well, champagne!
Apart from rats and river water, sir.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> Carry on.<eos> You've had a fall.<eos> You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.
Offer him "full and unfettered co-operation"<eos> on behalf of the Honourable East India.<eos> No, no, no. "Full and willing cooperation."<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And then... I will tell you which papers to burn.
She obviously has an admirer.<eos> She asked me a lot of questions today.<eos> And did you give her a lot of answers?<eos> I told her nothing.<eos> And yet, you have so much to tell.
Yes.<eos> Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.
You can depend on that.<eos> Open up!<eos> Open the door, we know you're in there!<eos> - Darlin'?<eos> - What do you want?
And the jurisdiction of an assizes.<eos> And administration of felons through the docks.<eos> Never lock your door or draw your robe against me again, for I am an assessor!<eos> I applied for the position three months ago.<eos> I didn't tell you.
"For the purpose of preventing contagion."?<eos> I saw you... and you saw something at the pond.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I strongly suggest you to continue to see nothing.
- Calm down.<eos> - James...<eos> No. No. No.<eos> You are betrayed.<eos> You shouldn't be here.
How, how did he know?<eos> God!<eos> Very well.<eos> We will allow him to think he is one step ahead... while we exploit what is undefended.<eos> And to you, your church on Earth and in Heaven, we offer honour and glory, now and for ever.
I don't need to sleep.<eos> I need... a ship.<eos> Maybe have a fuck first.<eos> Find a ship tomorrow.<eos> Why don't you find a captain and you take him upstairs and slit his throat, and I will take his ship?
Find a ship tomorrow.<eos> Why don't you find a captain and you take him upstairs and slit his throat, and I will take his ship?<eos> No captains.<eos> No throat-slitting.<eos> We can't find you a ship.
James, what are you doing?<eos> Go away.<eos> I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> Dear Lord, we are gathered in your presence here today on this most sorrowful occasion to say farewell to Winter.<eos> Cured of her love of the world, untouched, pure, commended to God... she will not be covered in earth as corrupted flesh, but instead will be sent to you, O Lord... aboard a sunrise...

What's your name?<eos> Robert. It's Robert.<eos> You know James Delaney, do you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Come into the house, we'll find you something to eat and somewhere to sleep.
We are.<eos> We are not.<eos> We are.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Perhaps you should thank your God for that.
No, their case will flounder.<eos> They can't.<eos> And we can make this happen.<eos> You and me.<eos> And the best of it... you will never have to testify.
And we can make this happen.<eos> You and me.<eos> And the best of it... you will never have to testify.<eos> My ship will sail long before the commission even sits.<eos> All you have to do is make-believe... to this man here.
- Jesus Christ!<eos> Are you just going to sit? !<eos> Well, what's the use in hiding?<eos> I need a ship and passage.<eos> James, they're not going to give you a ship, they're going to hang you!
So make it.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.
My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> You should know that I have testimony from a reliable witness...<eos> I've told you, I have nothing to say to you.
So, when the carpenter comes, tell him I want all the windows boarded up and that river hatch, I want that closed too.<eos> So... we are besieged.<eos> I suppose I can use the same carpenter to board up the windows that your father used when he was under siege and he can put the same old nails in the same old holes.<eos> You can sit there with the same old gun cocked on your lap.<eos> And when you sit there with that same look of defiance on your face, I will ask you the same old question... For what do you risk your life?
Splash.<eos> And down he floats... directly into Winter's arms.<eos> So I cut out your spoils.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's for you.
I want to be a wolf, too, or a bird so I can fly.<eos> The bird on your neck...<eos> I know what it is...<eos> The Sankofa.<eos> Now, you go home to Helga... because you are not safe here.
- Yes.<eos> But between friends, so where's the harm?<eos> Now, you take the minutes, don't you, of every meeting and you also hear everything they say when they raise their hand?<eos> I want that information.<eos> I will pay you for it.
But between friends, so where's the harm?<eos> Now, you take the minutes, don't you, of every meeting and you also hear everything they say when they raise their hand?<eos> I want that information.<eos> I will pay you for it.<eos> I'll pay you a pound every month.
I will pay you for it.<eos> I'll pay you a pound every month.<eos> How did you know about me?<eos> Because I have eyes and ears everywhere throughout the city in many places, much like the Company itself.<eos> I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.
I have sailed to places where there is no damnation.<eos> We used to talk to each other without words in dark corners.<eos> Your curiosity and hunger for all that is possible out there could never be tethered by base religious morality, ship insurance and new china.<eos> Please understand that from this moment I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams, my love.
Please understand that from this moment I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams, my love.<eos> Please. I'm your sister.<eos> Let all else lie.<eos> There is a woman here to see you and I swear the only way
So that's your reason for not taking.<eos> The dock boys I pay in pennies have litters of children.<eos> I just get blood.<eos> My dearest Zilpha...<eos> I apologise... that I am not related to you.
The dock boys I pay in pennies have litters of children.<eos> I just get blood.<eos> My dearest Zilpha...<eos> I apologise... that I am not related to you.<eos> But you could allow your cunt to swallow the work of an honest man, who will promise to buy you the finest china... if you just agree to stop fucking bleeding.
Shut up!<eos> - Chad.<eos> - What's up?<eos> Listen, that little bitch Miriam sent a letter to the sheriff today.<eos> You got to intercept that motherfucker.
Sonny Jim, go get in the car.<eos> I can't stop thinking about last night.<eos> You're so wonderful.<eos> - Wonderful. - Mm.<eos> I just had to tell you that.
You're so wonderful.<eos> - Wonderful. - Mm.<eos> I just had to tell you that.<eos> Okay. Let's get you to work.<eos> You can't fool me!
No!<eos> Just want a couple of dollars.<eos> No.<eos> Go ask your grandfather.<eos> He won't give you any more, will he?
Okay.<eos> Thank you, Roger.<eos> Anthony, come here.<eos> Don't sit down, Anthony.<eos> Anthony, I asked you here because you're a creative individual, and you're gonna need every ounce of that creativity to do what I'm about to tell you.
You're gonna pin the blame for the insurance claim that we conspired to deny for them, a loss of 30 million that hit 'em hard, on the back of Douglas Jones.<eos> You're gonna convince them that Mr. Jones has it out for the brothers, a personal vendetta, and then we're gonna sit back, and we're gonna watch as the Mitchum brothers take care of our Mr. Jones problem.<eos> - But what if...<eos> - Don't speak, Anthony.<eos> If you fail to deliver on this, then you'll have to kill Mr. Jones yourself.
It was me he attacked.<eos> Sylvia, of course I'm concerned about you too.<eos> How much money did he take?<eos> Everything I had in the safe, thousands of dollars, and you're going to make this up to me.<eos> No, I am not sending you any more money, Sylvia!
I want to get us there in one piece, shelly.<eos> Oh, carl.<eos> I know there's been trouble in that trailer.<eos> We've all heard it.<eos> And I feel for you and your girl, okay, shelly?
Becky.<eos> I'm not going to do it.<eos> I don't have any money, anyway!<eos> Honey, If I didn't work for the sheriff, You'd be in jail right now.<eos> I'll loan you the money.
I'll loan you the money.<eos> Ugh, no.<eos> I can't take any more money from you, mom.<eos> And he spent everything you ever gave me, anyway.<eos> I'll loan you the money.
Correct.<eos> We saw this on that little slip of paper We took out of major briggs' tube.<eos> What is this?<eos> Frank...<eos> You don't ever want to know about that.
Hawk, can you hear me?<eos> Yes, margaret.<eos> You found something, didn't you?<eos> It's just like you said.<eos> I'm sorry, I-i should have let you know.
Hawk, There's fire where you are going.<eos> Okay, margaret.<eos> Good night, hawk.<eos> Good night.<eos> And thank you, margaret.
Just close the door behind you When you go, phil.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Dougie, Now that I've had time to think about this, It's clear that your investigative work<eos> The recent two attempts on your life, The blowing up your car, the man trying to shoot you, Absolutely confirm this.<eos> Also, thanks to you, we now know that The mitchum brothers' case was not arson But a legitimate claim for an accidental fire,
You've got the check, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you're all set.<eos> Where you taking him?<eos> Santino's.<eos> Oh, you're gonna like that.
A toast.<eos> Oh... dougie.<eos> Here's to you, dougie.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> This is the man I told you about.
- To the bureau.<eos> To the bureau.<eos> Albert.<eos> Gordon.<eos> Okay, here's what you need to know.
Diane's on her way.<eos> Have a seat, Diane.<eos> Care for a drink?<eos> I like it on the rocks.<eos> Well, you're in luck.
I want to ask you something.<eos> You been selling your blood again?<eos> Now, Kriscol, did you install a new propane tank for Jenkins last week?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Did you get paid for that?
Did you get paid for that?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Do you mow lawns around here and rake up?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Do you get paid for that?
That's very kind of you, but I suppose you're really here because of what happened in the grocery store.<eos> Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> Uh, people were worried about you.<eos> I just don't know what came over me.<eos> But, uh, you're okay now.
- Is somebody in the house?<eos> No, just something in the kitchen.<eos> You're okay, then.<eos> It's a goddamn bad story, isn't it, Hawk?<eos> Sarah, if you need any help, if you need anything, I want you to call, okay? I mean it.
Gordon, would you please ask your friend to wait downstairs?<eos> Sweetheart, would you excuse us for a moment?<eos> I'll call you in the bar.<eos> It's a good one.<eos> Call you at the bar.
You know I don't have a crystal ball.<eos> It's already late, and I'm getting sleepy.<eos> I have so much more work to do before I get to sleep.<eos> You poor fucking thing.<eos> I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.
It's already late, and I'm getting sleepy.<eos> I have so much more work to do before I get to sleep.<eos> You poor fucking thing.<eos> I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.<eos> I've been good to you.
You were supposed to call her, but you never did.<eos> Don't be sore at me, Audrey.<eos> You know I just want the best for you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, then sign the papers I gave you.
If her husband's there, she won't be able to talk, but... let's see.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay, call the bitch. See what she knows.<eos> Supposedly she was the last one to see Billy, but I think Chuck is certifiable, so we can't count on shit from him.<eos> Chuck told you Tina was the last person to see Billy?
I drove off the road and almost hit a tree.<eos> Some farmer had to pull me out.<eos> Man, I could kill the motherfucker that did that.<eos> Obviously you want one too.<eos> - Do you want another one? - Yeah, sure.
Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What's the problem, Ray?<eos> I killed that guy.<eos> He's the one I told you about.
Put it on... ring finger, left hand.<eos> Now... you know what I want, Ray.<eos> You want the coordinates I got from Hastings?<eos> Rather, his pretty secretary, Betty?<eos> Do you really think I'm gonna give them to you?
'Cause you're a weak fucking coward.<eos> It makes me sick just to look at you.<eos> I'm trying to keep this whole operation from falling apart.<eos> Somebody's onto us.<eos> It's gonna cost you. Five... thousand.
I've lied and cheated for money.<eos> Anthony...<eos> Dougie already showed me.<eos> He explained all this already.<eos> He did? Now that you're confessing, I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.
He explained all this already.<eos> He did? Now that you're confessing, I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.<eos> Dougie even implicated himself.<eos> And he showed me how you manipulated claims, and you cost me plenty.<eos> I trusted you, Anthony.
So I took the liberty of running a point-of-sale analysis between this location and the others.<eos> I-I can't really decipher that.<eos> Could you just tell me what it means?<eos> In black and white, you're spending too much per pie and not charging enough.<eos> Well, look, Walter, I wanted to say this to you before.
Your man has my info.<eos> Yes,sir.<eos> There's 23 Douglas Joneses in the greater metro area.<eos> How are we gonna find the right one?<eos> Wilson,howmany times have I told you... this is what we do in the FBI?
I turned and looked.<eos> I saw myself.<eos> I saw myself from long ago, in the old Philadelphia offices, listening to Cooper telling me he was worried about a dream he had.<eos> Gordon, it's 10:10 a.m. on February 16th.<eos> I was worried about today because of the dream I told you about.
Don't know. You want to see if Renee will be there.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> But she's married.<eos> I know.<eos> How old are you, Freddie?
Okay, don't try and talk yourself out of it.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Alright, here you go.<eos> You know what else I know?<eos> You don't like peas.
So how does that theme relate to the ending of "Then And Now?"<eos> Emerson, maybe we should give someone else a chance?<eos> Luke?<eos> It's like when you finish a book and you don't want it to end.<eos> Even though the characters are happy you're still sad that it's ending.
She's not.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm just late for class.<eos> Addison, is that you?<eos> You should get to class.
No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> So... how do you feel about Thai takeout for dinner?<eos> Mona, we have the bachelorbachelorette party tonight.<eos> - I told you.
- I told you.<eos> Remember?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Um, with the meds, I'm not as sharp as I used to be.<eos> You're getting better, Mona.
- Well, it feels like it.<eos> With Sylvia Plath as our new roommate and even my sex drive is dictated by your ovulation app.<eos> Hold on, Mona and "Trying to have a baby" are two very different things.<eos> Maybe they're not.<eos> I mean, if you don't care how I feel about one then maybe you're not ready to do the other.
- Well, I don't know your plan.<eos> I'm in the dark.<eos> I mean, you asked me to put on the Melissa mask and then you don't even want me to use it.<eos> It was a test.<eos> I had to know I could trust you.
Great.<eos> She skipped out on you.<eos> - Caleb, who are you calling?<eos> - The cops.<eos> I told you this would happen.
No.<eos> I was just gonna make us some lunch.<eos> I wanted to know if you were hungry.<eos> No, thanks. I ate.<eos> I've missed you, sweetheart.
No, thanks. I ate.<eos> I've missed you, sweetheart.<eos> It's been weeks since your last visit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I missed you, too, mom.
- Hi, Toby.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I call shotgun.<eos> Watch it.<eos> I know it's none of my business, but... don't take for granted the people who love you the most just because they sometimes let you.
My mom avoided me all night.<eos> - What is going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Ali, we're not going to sleep until you tell me what's in that purse.<eos> Remind me to never throw you a surprise party.
Actually, let's not talk.<eos> Hanna.<eos> I hear you, okay?<eos> I'm gonna tell Mona that it's not gonna work out.<eos> I'm not sayin' you can't help her.
Hanna.<eos> I hear you, okay?<eos> I'm gonna tell Mona that it's not gonna work out.<eos> I'm not sayin' you can't help her.<eos> I'll help you help her.
I wanted it on my own terms.<eos> Wren let me come to Rosewood alone 'cause he knew that I would come back to him.<eos> And after I found out who killed Charlotte that's just what I did.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> Now I know this isn't fun for you but it's very exciting for me.
She pretended to be Jessica to sleep with my father and now you're pretending to be me to sleep with Toby?<eos> What does Wren think about that?<eos> He doesn't care anymore.<eos> But there was a time when Wren would do anything for me.<eos> Look, I made you a promise and you know what that means to me.
No, those bitches took her away from me and now they're getting everything that they deserve.<eos> I'm honoring her.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> I get everything about you.<eos> And I miss you.
I made good on my promise to Wren that night.<eos> And when the game was over, I went back to London.<eos> But I just...<eos> I couldn't stop thinkin' about you.<eos> About how good you have it.
Yes, it is, dad.<eos> We got into an argument last night.<eos> I let him down.<eos> No.<eos> He let you down.
Yes, I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Should we?<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Aria, you should probably try calling him again.
And we're locked in some sort of doityourself dungeon so no, I'm, I'm not okay.<eos> I meant your head.<eos> Sorry, sarcasm is my brain's selfdefense mechanism for whenever I'm about to be murdered.<eos> That was Spencer.<eos> She's gonna swing by the apartment and get you something to wear.
That was, by far, the fastest transatlantic flight I've ever taken.<eos> And you are the most charming woman I have ever been charmed by.<eos> Archer, I'm sure you say that to all the girls.<eos> No, I do not.<eos> Charlotte Drake, I will be calling you.
Archer, I'm sure you say that to all the girls.<eos> No, I do not.<eos> Charlotte Drake, I will be calling you.<eos> And I'm not going to wait three days.<eos> I'll ring you tomorrow.
- No.<eos> Well, Ezra's booked us yesterday to take him and his wife up to kick off their honeymoon.<eos> When yesterday?<eos> Morning around, 10 o'clock through The Radley concierge.<eos> Why would Ezra book you on a hot air balloon ride if he wasn't planning on marrying you?
- No, it's not.<eos> - My head is gonna explode.<eos> It's time for plan B.<eos> You need to tell me who you are and where you are.<eos> - I won't let you do this.
And earlier cosmic stones, strongly associated with "God's punishment".<eos> Well, how are you?<eos> Well, Che did not you tell that?<eos> I also get yourself out, some of Albert...<eos> And you will not say anything.
So.<eos> The victims of the incident began to 232 people.<eos> Sveta... (Telediktor) Dozens reported missing...<eos> - Tëm.<eos> - You're the doctor allowed to stand?
And I think that chick.<eos> Parted.<eos> That's my girl, okay?<eos> !<eos> I love her, do you understand?
Are you kidding?<eos> Come on...<eos> - Julia.<eos> - A?<eos> You go, you need to sleep.
Find Shilka.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> A word of thanks, he already learned?<eos> Thank you, it is a form of gratitude.<eos> She is grateful to you.
Thank you, it is a form of gratitude.<eos> She is grateful to you.<eos> Because you saved her.<eos> You think you saved the enemy and you feel bad.<eos> If I say thank you, you will be fine?
And tell your commandant.<eos> Soon everything will change!<eos> Soon our entire neighborhood will be!<eos> On all ears will stand!<eos> Do you ever react somehow, when you turn to.
- Go, go, Haritosh.<eos> You can go now.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> He Che, in my clothes?<eos> ! And you che, sorry for what?
Would you answer?<eos> Valentin Y...<eos> We have a dish of the city fell.<eos> If you certainly noticed!<eos> But you're not up to it.
Valentin Y...<eos> We have a dish of the city fell.<eos> If you certainly noticed!<eos> But you're not up to it.<eos> You need to arrange any hrenotel here!
Turn on the alarm!<eos> (Sound alarm) Warning!<eos> All personnel to take...<eos> A Th I wonder?<eos> You always had to spit on me.
And I thought you did not ask what I want?<eos> Maybe I wanted to spend the last months of her life, by her side.<eos> Close to the only person who understood me.<eos> And not diskach camp.<eos> I'll never forgive you.
- Yes, but...<eos> Tëm, I can not...<eos> - Let me come with you?<eos> We've got such dvizhuha started.<eos> You'll like it.
One week all in Moscow, has a corruption scheme Mutish?<eos> Before the night without options.<eos> What is there to do?<eos> Thin as a rake.<eos> You have a need to do?
Why are you doing it?<eos> - What?<eos> - Inhale.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Do not you of FIG?
We do not want to destroy you.<eos> You are your own harm.<eos> I urgently need an interpreter to space.<eos> (Artem)<eos> - Do you like it here?
No, I do not think, I do not expel, just...<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> (Max Korzh sings "Endorphin") â™" Why so much pain?<eos> Max?<eos> Well, how do you?
And I wanted to understand.<eos> Like this.<eos> When the smoke?<eos> When you die.<eos> And you are not the FIG?
Quiet, quiet, quiet.<eos> - Net!<eos> - Quiet.<eos> No ori.<eos> I tried to understand, and Th is do you want something, eh?
Please, let go.<eos> No!<eos> (Rus)<eos> - Stay in place.<eos> And you is not need anything.
- You do not understand?<eos> - Useless.<eos> That's an order.<eos> Said guard, they will be protected.<eos> Bad luck to you.
Courageous restraint.<eos> And that is right.<eos> Well, I don't mean to be rude, sir, but I do not understand what the fuck that means.<eos> It means, son, that sometimes when you're dealing with an insurgency, you're not gonna be 100% clear on who the enemy is.<eos> It means you're gonna find yourself in situations where, when you're afraid or whatnot, you're gonna have to make a judgment call.
And I don't know how to do that, sir, when every second one of them or every third one of them or every tenth one of them is trying to fucking kill me, sir.<eos> 'Cause I'm a marine. 'Cause we're marines.<eos> And it seem like now they handing out medals for heroically not being a marine, sir.<eos> I'm confused, is what I'm trying to say, sir.<eos> Well, then you're just gonna have to get yourself unconfused, son.
We suspect your wife Karzai might be a drug addict.<eos> He eliminated his chief opponent in this election by spreading a pretty vicious homosexual rumor, and we're pretty sure that his brother is a straight-up criminal warlord.<eos> Oh, come on, Pat!<eos> You got a bee in your bonnet.<eos> You just don't like him for some reason, whatever it is.
Yeah.<eos> Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.<eos> Yeah, I'll have Cory schedule some time.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay... but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
- Yeah.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And you can't live in the bubble forever.<eos> You gotta rise as your talents dictate.<eos> What do you want, Pat?
I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.<eos> And good luck.<eos> I wish you much success.<eos> Good luck tonight, Glen.<eos> Who told you about tonight?
- Peter!<eos> Calm down!<eos> You fucking calm down!<eos> Duckman!<eos> I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.
I'm not gonna be a fucking game show host.<eos> This could be serious money for you, and right now, you need serious money.
You thought I was Jewish?<eos> Well, you know, Rance.<eos> And, I don't know, show business.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm not Jewish.<eos> Well, you don't have to say it like that.
Or like that.<eos> Yes, I'm Jewish.<eos> How did I not know this?<eos> You don't look Jewish, and I mean that as a compliment.<eos> You should probably stop.
So who's gonna give me a recommendation?<eos> Castor?<eos> I don't even know if they've released him yet.<eos> But all those years of building "relationships."<eos> Surely someone can help you.
I say, we grab it.<eos> Just because you two have some kind of plans.<eos> Not just us.<eos> We have all worked every night for the last six weeks.<eos> I'm using "worked" in the broadest sense, including not only our show, but your cooking show and helping you to pick out a cat, and while we all appreciate the food and we love Mr. Swizzleboots,
It's sexist how the women always get blamed.<eos> It all goes back to that incident on Orientation Day.<eos> And at the root of it was Madeline Mackenzie.<eos> You have nothing to be nervous about.<eos> Your sister loved going there and so will you.
- What is your problem?<eos> Abigail, what are you doing?<eos> You were supposed to be on the bus.<eos> She picked me up, okay?<eos> You know how I feel about you driving with texters.
What kind of music do you listen to?<eos> Don't tell me. Bowie.<eos> An autopsy is still being conducted to ascertain the exact cause of death, but at this point we can confirm that the victim suffered a broken pelvis... and a fracture at the base of the skull.<eos> Come on, guys, would you put the guns down?<eos> Come on, Josh, you gotta get your jacket zipped.
- Three, please. And will you throw in something chocolate that won't make my ass look fat? - You got it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Everybody moves here for the education.<eos> Basically, it's private school at a public school price.<eos> Anyway, you're gonna love it.
Let's go, baby.<eos> Um, all right, everyone, thank you.<eos> Not that there's a right little girl to strangle, but he picked the wrong little girl to strangle.<eos> Ziggy... do you see her neck?<eos> If you ever touch my little girl like that again, you're gonna be in big trouble. - Hey.
I see.<eos> Well, speaking of Bonnie, do you know what she did today?<eos> She signed a petition to stop our production of "Avenue Q."<eos> Is this the play where the puppets drop the F-bombs? Cool!<eos> It is not only not about that, but it's actually a play that you should see because it deals with the struggle of young adults being disillusioned with life, feeling demoralized and defrauded by the false promises of tomorrow.
I'm not.<eos> I have friends.<eos> People here are actually very friendly.<eos> People need family in their lives, you know?<eos> I really just think you should come back here.
Sorry I woke you up.<eos> Am I in trouble?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Hey, you trust me, right?<eos> And I trust you.
You seem a little wobbly.<eos> Are you having one of your massive periods?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> What people don't tell you is that... you lose your children.
What's out there?<eos> You scared me.<eos> I'm gonna have to tie a bell around your neck so you don't keep sneaking up on me.
You're the one... honey, can you turn that down, please?<eos> Do you understand the precedent that you'd be setting?<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm a lady and I've never said this to anybody, ever, in my entire life, but I'm gonna say it to you.
Are you suggesting I might be putting my daughter in harm's way?<eos> You mean our daughter?<eos> Chloe, I don't know why you didn't text me or call me when the snub happened.<eos> I might've been able to intervene.<eos> How would she call you?
She is, actually.<eos> - Great, I'll see you then.<eos> I think they both had drinking problems. I do.<eos> Well, I'm happy to let you post it, but nobody really reads these flyers.<eos> And if you wanna get work these days, you need a website.
Well, I'm happy to let you post it, but nobody really reads these flyers.<eos> And if you wanna get work these days, you need a website.<eos> I know, it's just so expensive. It's not as much as you think.<eos> Madeline's husband Ed is in web design.<eos> He could help you put something together.
You know, that's really... that's super sweet of you, Madeline. And as much as I appreciate that, I feel like, you know, if... if this birthday party is ruined because of him, then it's only gonna make things worse for him.<eos> Sweetheart, everyone just assumes around here I'm the root cause of everything. - Don't worry.<eos> - Right.<eos> I think I would prefer it if you let Chloe go to the birthday party.<eos> - Let me call you right back. - But I...
You do almost 50-50 in the childcare.<eos> Right, so you're the guy who likes to fish and hunt, and I'm Mr. Girly-Man?<eos> - That's not what I meant at all, man.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I thought it'd be indelicate to bring it up with Maddie. That's why I'm bringing it up with you.
I do not feel supported here.<eos> Well...<eos> I don't suppose I could argue with your feelings.<eos> Ziggy, why are you awake?<eos> You're supposed to be asleep.
You're supposed to be asleep.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I saw you crying at school today.<eos> I was just stressed out.<eos> I'm sorry you had to see that.
Enough.<eos> You saw a carousel?<eos> And a big sign that said "Canaan."<eos> And people disappearing in clouds of smoke.<eos> Do you ever have nice dreams?
We need to break into the faculty storage room.<eos> To save the whole town from Ghost Riders?<eos> No problem.<eos> It's spreading, isn't it?<eos> You don't wanna know.
You're scheduled for emergency surgery in an hour.<eos> Wait! Where are you going?<eos> It's a supernatural toxin.<eos> If they try to cut it out, it will spread.<eos> Tell me what you need.
No one is leaving.<eos> No one is leaving Canaan ever again.<eos> I think the last thing that you were trying to say was my name.<eos> You said,<eos> "Mel, you need to add..."
If you are, I'm having the same one.<eos> We've got to get out of here.<eos> I know you're not gonna beat an eight-year-old's ass, but I will.<eos> You don't look so good.<eos> Maybe you should sit down.
I know why they didn't...<eos> You think I helped them because they brought back my dead son.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Theo!<eos> We're not trying to hurt you.
It's called, "run like hell."<eos> So, leave in five?<eos> You promised you'd help us.<eos> We still need to find the rift.<eos> I didn't promise I'd help you commit suicide.
You promised you'd help us.<eos> We still need to find the rift.<eos> I didn't promise I'd help you commit suicide.<eos> If you can't help, we can find it ourselves.<eos> Scott, I admit that you have a flair for beating the odds.
I didn't promise I'd help you commit suicide.<eos> If you can't help, we can find it ourselves.<eos> Scott, I admit that you have a flair for beating the odds.<eos> But, this?<eos> You don't walk away from.
His tracks outside lead north from here.<eos> This one's gone, too.<eos> Why take a Ghost Rider's pineal gland?<eos> So I could use this.<eos> What do you want?
Right?<eos> Even Theo.<eos> Convince me.<eos> I can put you back in the ground anytime.<eos> You also need a transformer that can handle five billion joules of electricity.
Noah...<eos> Claudia, this could be the proof we're looking for.<eos> There are so many simple explanations for why this is here.<eos> But we had a son we've forgotten is not one of them.<eos> Aren't you curious?
I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> Told you, you needed a plan.
Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> Told you, you needed a plan.<eos> She helps you, you help me.
If this is true, then...<eos> Maybe Sheriff Stilinski needs this.<eos> Maybe it's his way of coping.<eos> What if Claudia being here is preventing him from remembering Stiles?<eos> Lydia, if Claudia isn't real, you don't want to be the one to tell him.
I need Stiles for that.<eos> Why?<eos> Is he your human crutch?<eos> He's my anchor.<eos> I'll get you a new anchor.
And your sense of humor.<eos> That is great.<eos> But if we're the only ones left in Beacon Hills, then we need each other.<eos> Which means you need me out of this cell.<eos> We need to trust you.
He has to remember Stiles.<eos> What if he can't?<eos> Then the rest of us...<eos> We get forgotten.<eos> You think you attacked the driver.
Good or bad.<eos> Scott, there's got to be something else, okay?<eos> We always have a plan B.<eos> This is just a dream.<eos> You're dreaming.
You want to bring them all here?<eos> Every single one of them?<eos> That's exactly what I want to do.<eos> 'Cause if the Ghost Riders are here, that means they're not trying to get to Scott.<eos> So you don't care if they get to you?
Liam finally gets one thing right.<eos> I also think whatever happened to you, you deserved it.<eos> Is that right?<eos> When the Ghost Riders find us, I'm not gonna do anything for you.<eos> I'm not gonna help you. I'm not gonna save you.
We're going to have to actually hypnotize me.<eos> They're everywhere.<eos> Good.<eos> Really?<eos> You really need me to remind you that getting captured by the Ghost Riders isn't gonna help you save your friends?
You can do it while you're running.<eos> I'm going down fighting.<eos> My mother had a hypnotist who helped her quit smoking.<eos> She had me see the same one when I was 10.<eos> You smoked when you were 10?
"Your hands relaxing.<eos> Your eyelids relaxing.<eos> "As you relax, imagine you're sitting in front of a TV."<eos> "When you turn the TV on, it's going to play memories from your life.<eos> "The remote gives you total control.
"When you turn the TV on, it's going to play memories from your life.<eos> "The remote gives you total control.<eos> You can play any memory you want.<eos> "All you have to do, is hit the button."<eos> Honey, there's a Stiles here to see you.
I can't believe I found you.<eos> Dad, I can hear Lydia.<eos> I think... I think I can get to her.<eos> I think she can get us out of here.<eos> You need to get out of here.
Oh, she knows what she's doing.<eos> Have you ever heard of the Nine Herbs?<eos> The nine sacred herbs of the Saxons used to cure poison and infections?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Did you need to know what they are, or...
Since you're taking over, the most important thing you can remember is that Mason is always gonna be the one who's there to save your ass all the time.<eos> Well, not all the time.<eos> Most of the time though.<eos> Which is why...<eos> I think you're gonna need this.
- Okay. Thanks.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Love you guys.<eos> Right.<eos> I leave you with this.
- Here you go.<eos> Love you guys.<eos> Right.<eos> I leave you with this.<eos> You know, hurt her and I'll kill you.
Love you guys.<eos> Right.<eos> I leave you with this.<eos> You know, hurt her and I'll kill you.<eos> You sure you won't need it?
Oh... Stiles.<eos> These aren't the keys to the Jeep.<eos> Well, that's one to your house, another to your room, uh, it's the master key to the school,<eos> Animal Clinic, key to the Sheriff's station.<eos> Just figured you should have all the copies I secretly made. So...
Until 11:00 tonight, and, of course, you all remember that awful tornado that swept through...<eos> There's a mix of 50s and 100s in there.<eos> 50s are yellow.<eos> Just don't mix them up, Em, please.<eos> I told you to stop doing this.
There's a mix of 50s and 100s in there.<eos> 50s are yellow.<eos> Just don't mix them up, Em, please.<eos> I told you to stop doing this.<eos> And I told you to stop lifting with your back and go to the doctor.
I'm fine.<eos> You went to see her, didn't you?<eos> Kare.<eos> It's all right.<eos> She wouldn't have written to you if she didn't want you to know her.
No! Hey, we're in here!<eos> Dorothy, no police.<eos> Police... not good.<eos> No.<eos> You have to run.
I don't mean anything, I don't- I<eos> - I don't know anything.<eos> Pleas!<eos> She has sisters... in the West and in the North.<eos> And the Wizard of Oz... you will most certainly have to answer to the Wizard of Oz.
You killed the witch that put them here... maybe the only one who can free them.<eos> Mistres of the Western Fields,<eos> Vessel of Truth and Solace.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> You should have sent someone ahead.
If it were magic, it wouldn't be yours, would it?<eos> The rip in the sky?<eos> No.<eos> No magic here.<eos> I found a new line of work, thanks to you.
It has begun.<eos> - First true sign.<eos> - It is.<eos> There is no doubt. - [Groans.<eos> You may know everything there is to know about The Beast Forever.
How do I look?<eos> I actually don't know what I look like.<eos> You're very h...<eos> Very...<eos> We should name you.
Do you know who I am?<eos> [groans. Witc!<eos> S-S-Ste n.<eos> Merciful and Stern.<eos> Steel won't help you, swordsm n.
Dorothy..<eos> We should go.<eos> Where does the road lead?<eos> To Emerald City... to the Wizard of Oz.<eos> And he can help you?
How long have you been saving that?<eos> A few miles.<eos> I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.<eos> Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?
I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.<eos> Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd think you were on my side, Isabel.<eos> Glinda may have chosen me, but I serve you.
Then we can put another 20 years between us.<eos> What's Eamonn looking for?<eos> The girl went round the mountain, and he's staring through it.<eos> Has he gone mad?<eos> Why don't you go and ask him?
Lucas?<eos> Lucas!<eos> Lucas.<eos> Put pressure, okay?<eos> We're gonna get you help.
Lucas.<eos> Put pressure, okay?<eos> We're gonna get you help.<eos> You're just a little septic, but I've already stopped the bleeding, so you're fine.<eos> All you need is a shot of penicillin... it's the most common drug in the world.
There's a chill.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> It's time for your medicine.<eos> I think no more of that, love.<eos> You need rest.
It's been some time.<eos> The North is always open to you.<eos> Isabel?<eos> This is Anna.<eos> She'll be true and chaste, without distraction of body and mind. To better serve you.
Toto.<eos> No!<eos> Go.<eos> Who's up there?<eos> Uh, I think it's time for you and the Wizard's Guard to leave.
Stay with me, Lucas.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> It's just charcoal.<eos> It'll soak up the poison.<eos> You have to drink it all.
Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy!<eos> Dorothy!<eos> Did you get them?<eos> Are her spells inside you?
But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.<eos> You all right?<eos> I need that medicine.<eos> What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?<eos> - She ever tell you about that?
I don't think anyone should.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> What's it called?<eos> A gun.<eos> When you kill someone with a sword, at least you got to work at it.
Come on.<eos> What you waiting for?<eos> Move it, boy!<eos> What?<eos> You don't like it?
I'll ask around.<eos> I'm sure there's a herbalist nearby.<eos> You want to do it before you grow old?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Unless you're planning on making money off them, you might want to stop advertising.
If you're looking for a career change...<eos> Magic!<eos> That I banned from Oz.<eos> Here in Emerald City!<eos> Should I awake my giants to make an example of you?
Drowned by The Beast.<eos> And me... useless to stop it.<eos> Where's the magic in that?<eos> Come this way, please.<eos> I can't make you your medicine, love.
Where's the magic in that?<eos> Come this way, please.<eos> I can't make you your medicine, love.<eos> Which is to say, I won't.<eos> No one will, not anywhere, and you shouldn't ever ask again.
What you are right now, what's under those clothes, that's not a side effect of the medicine wearing off.<eos> That's what happens when the medicine itself wears off.<eos> But I'm a boy.<eos> I've always been a boy.<eos> Yes, someone may have wanted that, and they gave you this to make it so.
Don't you want to find out who you really are?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> - Then?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Maybe he's just grateful to have you.
Where are we?<eos> Your new home.<eos> We'll keep her well.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The first thing you'll need is a proper bath.
We're all projects, Jack.<eos> All of us with missing pieces or damaged parts.<eos> You should be grateful I replaced yours.<eos> - You took out my heart.<eos> - And gave you a new one.
- You took out my heart.<eos> - And gave you a new one.<eos> One that will never break.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> Today, I offer you a future.
A chance to better yourselves.<eos> Under my tutelage, you shall join The Wizard's High Council and protect Oz against threats from without...<eos> No!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> It's all right, my child, no one wants to harm you.
- I'm sorry, Mistress.<eos> This one's just a little...<eos> Touch me again, I'll break your arm!<eos> It's all right, child.<eos> We only want to help you.
You're alone in this world, yes?<eos> Afraid.<eos> Without options.<eos> Without purpose.<eos> I can give you all that you seek.
Afraid.<eos> Without options.<eos> Without purpose.<eos> I can give you all that you seek.<eos> I can give you a family.
The butcher said he saw someone taking her 'round.<eos> Has she been with you long?<eos> Just since last night.<eos> She adores sweets.<eos> Let's get you some proper food and a warm bath.
Because ever since we met, you rush into things without a care whether or not you live or die.<eos> But some of us do care.<eos> Take off your clothes.<eos> What?<eos> You have no business being here.
Why?<eos> She's exactly what I'm looking for.<eos> Strong, spirited, vigorous.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You'll be treated with the utmost respect.
Love, no.<eos> You'll be untouched.<eos> Pure.<eos> Forever and always.<eos> And I offer you the chance to feel something.
We're gonna go back to Lucas.<eos> Okay?<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Close 'em.<eos> Do you feel better?
Are you suggesting I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> You'll only make him a martyr.<eos> Then what?<eos> You must turn him.
And hopefully gone by tomorrow.<eos> Don't you want to be adopted?<eos> No.<eos> I just want to disappear, I just want to forget... forget everything.<eos> Maybe Glinda can help you.
Don't you want to be adopted?<eos> No.<eos> I just want to disappear, I just want to forget... forget everything.<eos> Maybe Glinda can help you.<eos> Give you a new life.
Wait.<eos> West wanted you, too?<eos> I don't think she's that discriminating.<eos> But she is.<eos> And if all you want to do is forget, she can show you how.
Who is she?<eos> Her name is Langwidere.<eos> Is she a friend of yours?<eos> A client.<eos> I brought you some clothes.
A client.<eos> I brought you some clothes.<eos> We're going on an outing.<eos> You're moving well.<eos> Fresh air will do you good.
And how do you know my langwidere?<eos> Well, I'm her... Property.<eos> He's indentured to me for the cost of his metal.<eos> How sweet.<eos> You know, you really ought to keep your hands to yourself.
Do not leave the house.<eos> If those men find you, they will finish the job for sure.<eos> Eamonn!<eos> Eamonn!<eos> I need to get you help.
Help!<eos> Not much for conversation, is she?<eos> This is the woman who killed your sister.<eos> I trust you will be fair.<eos> Fair with you.
Wait for me.<eos> Tea!<eos> You don't have to yell, my ears haven't changed.<eos> Were you this insolent as a boy?<eos> Why don't you turn me back into one and find out?
Here?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> How... how do you know?<eos> Comfortable?<eos> Maybe you need a good stretch?
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I'm just an insolent child.<eos> Isn't that what you said?<eos> I need your help.<eos> You need mine.
How?<eos> Is that really you?<eos> I don't know who I am because of you.<eos> Because of me?<eos> Tip, I... i helped you when I had nothing to gain.
Is that really you?<eos> I don't know who I am because of you.<eos> Because of me?<eos> Tip, I... i helped you when I had nothing to gain.<eos> And I helped you because you asked me to.
It's my fault you're not sure.<eos> I wasn't there for you when you needed me most.<eos> But if you just tell this witch what she needs to know, then we can go home.<eos> She's gonna let us go home?<eos> Baby, you just have to think back.
She's gonna let us go home?<eos> Baby, you just have to think back.<eos> Think back to when you killed the witch, okay?<eos> Just remember.<eos> That's all you got to do.
Baby, you just have to think back.<eos> Think back to when you killed the witch, okay?<eos> Just remember.<eos> That's all you got to do.<eos> You just... you got to remember.
Where's your mistress?<eos> How long have you had her?<eos> Less than a day.<eos> But she's been quite revealing.<eos> - I told you to wait for me.
I hadn't seen our eastern sister in years and now she's gone.<eos> Let time not be our enemy, as well.<eos> You hadn't seen her in years?<eos> Why?<eos> Did the girl tell you differently?
Liar!<eos> She's lying!<eos> Did you... Help the girl out of spite?<eos> To hurt your mistress?<eos> As much as she hurt you?
He's simply leaving us... Without leaving us.<eos> So this is what it's like to feel normal.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Why do I wear a mask?<eos> I'll tell you when we're friends.
- Yes.<eos> If you don't believe me, look on your left side.<eos> That's where I stabbed you before you went down.<eos> I've done some bad things and now I have to answer for them.<eos> I don't want to hurt you too.
I mean, how about we take a look?<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> I think we got a hero over here?<eos> You really want to be a hero?<eos> Well, you're gonna have to try a little bit harder than that.
Well, you're gonna have to try a little bit harder than that.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Leave him alone this instant!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I command you!
Roberto?<eos> Roberto!<eos> We've got to get him out of here.<eos> Answer me.<eos> How do you know my name?
Answer me.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I've known you since the day you were born.<eos> Here. In Oz.<eos> I would never hurt you.
Hey, hold on.<eos> I can talk to the Wizard.<eos> I can stop this.<eos> No, I don't want you to.<eos> You don't have to do this.
Magic that can't be broken.<eos> Well, then let him go. I can't break it. But I can work around it.<eos> How?<eos> If I had a conduit.<eos> Someone close to you, someone special... to slip past your defenses.
Will this protect him?<eos> Think of it as a back door into the mind through the heart.<eos> If you're feeling sappy...<eos> Dorothy, don't listen to her.<eos> - She's only trying to hurt you.
I heard him.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course you did.<eos> I'm sorry, Father, I'll...<eos> I'll come and help you find him.
Come on, Lucas, let me in.<eos> Let me in.<eos> What's in the wagon?<eos> What's in the wagon?<eos> I suggest you let me pass.
Glinda's castle... she's ordered me to free you.<eos> There's, um... there's one of the witch girls in the city.<eos> - I have to find her.<eos> - There is no time.<eos> You must leave before The Wizard locks the gates.
You must leave before The Wizard locks the gates.<eos> I'll go find her.<eos> You're on The Wizard's side of this.<eos> I'm not on anyone's side.<eos> Well, then you better choose.
I'm not on anyone's side.<eos> Well, then you better choose.<eos> War is coming to Oz.<eos> It's late to be wandering.<eos> The Wizard told you I'm his guest.
Hey, boy.<eos> Is she...<eos> Asleep.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Not you.
He was a smart man, a kind man.<eos> He died in the accident that brought us here.<eos> I'm sorry, Dorothy.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> I don't trust you.
Don't do this.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy, please!<eos> I won't let you take her.
He was my father.<eos> I'm sorry he died.<eos> He didn't die.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> It's just the more I see of everything, The more I realize how hard it all is for you.
Yeah.<eos> Can you hear the birds singing?<eos> Now, I'm gonna take the things out of your ears.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Nothing you can hear can hurt you.
Come on.<eos> Can you hear it?<eos> Dorothy?<eos> Is something wrong with the house?<eos> I don't want you to get hurt.
Yeah, I'm still here.<eos> Come on. There you go.<eos> There we go.<eos> Give the Wizard an answer.<eos> I won't help you kill them.
You stole our daughters!<eos> - Liar!<eos> - You're a fraud!<eos> You promised to protect her!<eos> You should have secured her when you had the chance.
You're just gonna reason with a cardinal witch?<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> Kill her if I have to.<eos> Words without point, Dorothy.<eos> You don't know what opposes you or how to stop it.
Kill her if I have to.<eos> Words without point, Dorothy.<eos> You don't know what opposes you or how to stop it.<eos> I haven't known that since I got here.<eos> Why can't you just be honest here?
And we're not going any further Until you figure out what you're doing.<eos> The gauntlets.<eos> You'll use them against Glinda.<eos> I can control them If I want something badly enough.<eos> So, if you have to kill Glinda to get home,
We were born for greater things, you and I.<eos> We were born to fly.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> I've been looking for months.<eos> How often do they check on you?
No matter what I call you, you're still the same man.<eos> How can I be?<eos> You have to convince Glinda that you mean her no harm.<eos> - That would be a lie.<eos> - Then I can't help you.
Witches don't pray and wait for answers.<eos> We act.<eos> So...<eos> So...<eos> You want power, don't you?
Ordered by the Wizaed, built by some of our finest craftspeople.<eos> I'm sure the Queen can spare a moment.<eos> Sir, you can't go in there.<eos> Langwidere.<eos> Jack, you cannot be in here.
Okay, now put your arms right here.<eos> And push.<eos> I'm gonna try and turn this baby around, but without medication...<eos> Her pain has been relieved.<eos> What else do you require?
Why are you here?<eos> I heard screaming.<eos> I need your knife.<eos> Aah. Noa, I'm gonna need you to push, all right?<eos> You're gonna feel a quick shot of pain and after that, I'm gonna need you to push.
I couldn't trust you.<eos> I know I've been dishonorable, shameful.<eos> But now I need her.<eos> I need my mother.<eos> And if I told you where she was, you wouldn't run and tell the Wizaed, would you?
No.<eos> No, I swear.<eos> I stand before you anew.<eos> Clean, ready to redeem myself.<eos> Ready to serve you and our mother.
I stand before you anew.<eos> Clean, ready to redeem myself.<eos> Ready to serve you and our mother.<eos> When you were a little girl, mother south favored you.<eos> Of all of our sisters, you were the one destined to take her place.
- What did you mean?<eos> Only that I've been waiting all day to be with you.<eos> How could you be so heartless to Jane?<eos> Please, Jack, no more politics.<eos> That woman gave her life to you.
To your father.<eos> All her waking hours.<eos> She said no to me.<eos> So what?<eos> You can't just enjoy people when it suits you, use them up and toss them aside.
For business and for pleasure.<eos> We don't all exist for your benefit.<eos> You exist because Jane was paid to rebuild you.<eos> By me.<eos> The fact that I've developed feelings for you does not make you any less my property.
Drink up so that you... you may fight without fear.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I'm scared, sister.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You have nothing to be scared of.
It worked.<eos> Are my weapons at the ready?<eos> Guards!<eos> You're joking.<eos> Turn around and no harm will come to you.
Take it with you.<eos> Then go deeper still.<eos> Something's happening.<eos> I-i can't stop it.<eos> You're not supposed to.
And if you don't change yourself back into one, no one will follow you.<eos> You will never have your revenge.<eos> I finally have what I care about most.<eos> Emerald city, the throne, that's what you want.<eos> That's why I gave you my sister's powers!
But lost.<eos> So was everyone I cared about when you damned me to live here.<eos> You were never kind to me, Jane.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Despite how much I tried to help you be who you were.
You even discredited me.<eos> I'm the only one left who knows you're a fraud.<eos> It must hurt to know that no one will listen.<eos> I know the only reason you have kept me alive is because my work has value to you.<eos> Tell me what you need.
I'm the only one left who knows you're a fraud.<eos> It must hurt to know that no one will listen.<eos> I know the only reason you have kept me alive is because my work has value to you.<eos> Tell me what you need.<eos> I-I'll make it for you now.
Yes, but I'm not just gonna free nahara.<eos> I'm gonna free all of them.<eos> What happened to the witches?<eos> Free me...<eos> And I'll tell you.
Yes.<eos> Free magic.<eos> This is why you had me drink east's spells.<eos> Not for me.<eos> You just wanted her magic so you could free your sisters.
I salvaged what remained.<eos> The rest, I rebuilt.<eos> I made her masks to hide a face that never aged.<eos> It was a secret the king swore me to keep.<eos> He couldn't lose her, and you don't have to either.
Not kings and queens.<eos> - so I should be more like you?<eos> Like the wizard?<eos> Killing anyone who gets in my way?<eos> - How you lead is your choice, but you'd best hurry up and figure out how.
Stopping glinda.<eos> - I promised you I'd stop a war.<eos> And that's exactly what I intend to do.<eos> That's why I raised the giant.<eos> - well, then, you'll march north.
Sylvie, look at me.<eos> Sylvie, please.<eos> Sylvie, you don't have to do this.<eos> Sylvie, look at me.<eos> - your spells won't help you now.
- There is no fight left in emerald city.<eos> The true fight still comes for all of us.<eos> - I brought our kind back from the dead.<eos> And I will take back what belongs to us.<eos> - Emerald city does not belong to you.
But we'll see.<eos> Here, here, look at this.<eos> this just might send me home. Or maybe it'll rip this thing apart!<eos> - Just tell me what to do.<eos> - you're gonna have to kill me.
Your mother is here in oz.<eos> - My mother is in Kansas, and she's hurt, so help me...<eos> - your mother is not Karen Chapman.<eos> - You're lying to me. Again.<eos> - I've lied to you before...
Karen Chapman was hurt... Because I wanted her dead, because I sent my men to kill her in Kansas.<eos> I thought she was gonna return to oz.<eos> For Jane.<eos> For me!<eos> But I'm not gonna let her or you bring me back!
my name is Jane.<eos> - I've been lied to my whole life.<eos> - This isn't a lie.<eos> - How do I know?<eos> - When you were little, I gave you a tattoo on your left hand. Just below your thumb.
- You... you know how this works?<eos> - I built this machine.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, to get home to you, then the wizard took it for himself.
no, I didn't think so.<eos> I'm just dreaming.<eos> It's just a dream. It's just a dream.<eos> - Dorothy.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
Did you not once tell me of your worry about the fate of those whom Captain Flint has called friends before you?<eos> A lot has changed since then.<eos> A lot has changed since then, but what has not changed is that when a man first needs you and thereafter calls you a friend, a little suspicion is a healthy thing.<eos> That'd make a lot more sense if I didn't need him just as badly as he needs me.<eos> I don't believe you do.

I don't believe you need him to be the man you are.
With the damage done to the rig, I can't maneuver our broadside around fast enough to be of any effect.<eos> The sloops are too nimble.<eos> But hauling in the guns?<eos> They'll board us easily.<eos> I was always told that you were the one without fear.
We are two battered fighters at the end of a long fight.<eos> The next blow struck may be a decisive one, and we have to be the one that strikes.<eos> Stop.<eos> I prepared these men to follow Long John Silver upon his return.<eos> Now, if you assume that in his absence, that role now reverts to you... then you assume wrong.
Somewhere on an island a few days' journey from here is a chest filled with treasure buried in a secret place, and of the three men who know of that place,<eos> I may be the last one alive after today.<eos> Are you threatening to withhold the location of the chest that every man here is counting upon to provide for Nassau's treasury once we secure it solely so you can maintain your own status here?<eos> There is an unthinkable victory within our reach, and I will see this through by whatever means I have at my disposal.<eos> This seems like the act of a small man to you.
Look at me, then.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're hurting me.<eos> I'm hurting you?
I'm sorry.<eos> Yes, you can call me Madeline.<eos> It seems that Abigail is under a bit of stress at home.<eos> Is this about Ed threatening your father?<eos> Did he tell you about that?
- Do I have to?<eos> We talked about this. I need you to try it once.<eos> And if you don't like it, I'll never make you do it again.<eos> I just wanna go play on the playground.<eos> I know, but you might actually like it.
Ziggy.<eos> What is his name?<eos> Just write it down! I don't know.<eos> You know that.<eos> I've told you this story so many times.
But for Bonnie, he's Mr. Fucking Sacrifice.<eos> Why don't you bottle up some of that anger - and put it to good use? - What do you mean?<eos> I think I could use you and Joseph at the meeting with the mayor tomorrow.<eos> Joseph can speak to the content of the show and we could use your passion.<eos> I cannot possibly thank you enough for this, Celeste.
No, I'm just saying, the anxiety.<eos> Yeah, I know my history.<eos> I'm not trying to get pregnant.<eos> I'm just trying to help out a friend. What's the big problem?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?
I'm just trying to help out a friend. What's the big problem?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?<eos> It's not.<eos> I'm just looking out for you, Sparkles.<eos> If you go to pieces again, who's gonna put you back together?
Well, I mean, I'm... I'm trying to be sensitive, honey. I...<eos> I don't always know the right thing to say.<eos> - But I certainly don't judge you.<eos> It's actually really weird.<eos> Ever since I told you about Ziggy's dad, it's like this thing that's been happening to my body.
- You're gonna be a lawyer again.<eos> - No.<eos> I mean, I have never seen you like that.<eos> For four years I've known you, and... your face looked different, your body changed.<eos> You miss it.
Come on! Incredible!<eos> I want to see it, but let's do it after dinner. Just gonna chill with Mommy for a second.<eos> - And funny Maddie. - Go on, baby. Go.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> There will be wine waiting for you.
The last time we had pizza and we went to the zoo, you told me we were moving to Monterey.<eos> What now?<eos> You're gonna go see a child psychologist.<eos> I think he plans on signing up for a class, that's all.<eos> Did he hit on you at all?
Today's grocery day, so before Abigail eats everything, I wanted to...<eos> Sorry, Mom.<eos> It's okay.<eos> See, I bought more of your crap and less of her crap.<eos> You know what? I'll make you one of my special bits. Give me 15?
I know you have feelings for me.<eos> Well, then if you know that, just cling to that.<eos> I have to go back.<eos> Can you please take me back?<eos> That you're this uncomfortable with the conversation...
Can you take me back, please?<eos> God's sakes.<eos> Like, how do you... how do you brush it all off?<eos> Like it's like nothing's happening.<eos> I get you don't want to have feelings.
It's all right.<eos> I'll do it later.<eos> I will do it later, baby.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> Baby, you have to go.
Was it just sex between us?<eos> Of course it wasn't.<eos> But the other day, I started to feel afraid.<eos> I've had this paralyzing fear... that what happened between us is gonna get out and it's gonna ruin my family.<eos> It's probably best if... if you beg out of the play.
I think we're all doing better.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Actually, I normally have a lot of lower back pain, so probably saved me a trip to the chiropractor.<eos> But I... I just stopped by to see if Joseph was okay.<eos> I'm glad to see you're feeling better.
I could use a fellow like you.<eos> There's always work for a big guy who's smart enough to know he's better off letting people think he's dumb.<eos> Oh, and by the way, did I mention the bonuses?<eos> Outstanding benefits.<eos> I'll even throw in a pension if you'd like, and I can tell you what the fuck a pension is.
I bow my head before you and worship you.<eos> Oh, my God, that's incredible.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't stop, honey.<eos> Ohh. I offer you everything...
So what, you're from Ireland?<eos> I told you I'm a leprechaun.<eos> We don't come from Moscow, Russia.<eos> Or Moscow, Idaho, for that matter.<eos> How much has our man told you?
Well, I never. Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you.<eos> Jack Daniel's for me.<eos> And these are for you, Shadow Moon.
I just want to say goodbye.<eos> Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.<eos> You want me to hurt people?<eos> Well,<eos> I'll hurt people if they try and hurt you.
We're done.<eos> It ain't over till I say it is.<eos> You may have drank a lot.<eos> Let it come back to you.<eos> So what do you know, huh?
You're going to be driving Betty here from now on.<eos> I just thought you could use some sleep.<eos> It's not every day a man gets to bury his wife.<eos> I have preparations and communications to keep me busy enough, after which I will entertain myself.<eos> Now I'll tell you this once and once only ever.
I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.<eos> So did Laura.<eos> Oh shit, Shadow.<eos> No one told you?
Back on the plane.<eos> I want wheels up in 20.<eos> Let's go, boys.<eos> We recovered Pandora's Box.<eos> They're gonna send an extraction team to pick you guys up.
So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.
Francie, we should go. Okay.<eos> Thanks again for coming, everyone.<eos> It wouldn't have been the same without you.<eos> Please proceed to the docks to see off Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky.<eos> What is it with you people?
Yeah, no, I'm good.<eos> I'm proud of you, Ronnie.<eos> Fuck you, Dave.<eos> You're my worst friend.<eos> Captain, I need to talk to you about this...
- For Mitch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lifeguards, this is a surprise.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...
Please.<eos> I have something to ask.<eos> You may very likely refuse.<eos> What is it?<eos> I saw this afternoon something I had previously failed to notice, certain resemblances between you... You and my wife.
What is it?<eos> I saw this afternoon something I had previously failed to notice, certain resemblances between you... You and my wife.<eos> I...<eos> I... I think you know what it is I ask.<eos> If I have offended you, I apologize and ask that we forget the matter entirely.
Instead of helping Jakob, you've made yourself unwell.<eos> Now you hear whatever you wish!<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why would she speak to you and not to her husband?
And maybe into infinity.<eos> But I didn't know any of that until right before I fell.<eos> The thing is, they don't get to know.<eos> You don't wake up with a bad feeling in your stomach or see shadows move.<eos> If you're like me, you wake up 24 minutes and 47 seconds before your best friend is supposed to be picking you up.
Yes!<eos> So... how's business?<eos> Terrible.<eos> Everybody just does it themselves now.<eos> When I talked to you on the phone... I pictured some guy with an Army buddy on the force...
Wilson, she needs to leave.<eos> Wilson!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I come in peace.<eos> I just wanted to talk to you and your wife.
I just wanted to talk to you and your wife.<eos> I'll get a restraining order if I have to.<eos> Please, I mean no harm.<eos> Just the opposite.<eos> I wanted a chance... to get to know you and Mrs. Cassiday a little.
They insisted I give you this with their deepest apologies.<eos> Get yourself well.<eos> This wasn't your responsibility, Arthur.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> You girls have looked after me for a lot longer than I've looked after you.
You know where I can find John Constantine?<eos> - No.<eos> - You must have some idea.<eos> We don't keep in touch.<eos> I know you two have history, so I...
The League thinks that a recent spike in homicides may have a magical cause.<eos> Told you something stinks. Now we know someone doesn't want us asking questions.<eos> Looks like you've cracked it wide open, mate.<eos> What did he say?<eos> I'm not playing telephone between you two.
Listen, I watch a television series. Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.<eos> You should see it.<eos> In the real world, It takes longer to solve crimes From an hour-long series.<eos> I think that's all, Mr. Harding.<eos> If we protest any additional information, We'll call you.
Operations of "Waxler" in "America". Stops in stages within 30 days.<eos> 30 days?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Hey guys, I understand it's tough news.<eos> I can not address you Unless you are calm.
2.30 pm<eos> I decided to use empty shots.<eos> No one should be hurt by mistake.<eos> There are none left now, boys.<eos> You guys, I have had a wonderful time In planning to steal with you.
All right, listen, Kate.<eos> I need you to get back in the cage immediately.<eos> It's the only safe place from the sharks.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Javier's coming down to you now.
- Kate?<eos> - It's Lisa.<eos> We managed to attach the cable to the top of the cage.<eos> We need to come up right now!<eos> - Is Javier with you?
The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.<eos> Sometimes it gets itself shut off.<eos> - By assholes. - Hey!<eos> No.<eos> My son is happy to go with you.
I never said nothing about no running.<eos> Who's you? Seabiscuit?<eos> That was a great talk.<eos> Like, so super-helpful.<eos> - Both of you, really.
You can sit back down.<eos> You wanna fight me, bitch?<eos> What'd you say to me?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He doesn't wanna fight you anymore.
Says here you pressed domestic violence charges three years ago against your alleged assailant,<eos> Michael Vargas.<eos> He was convicted and served 12 months' probation.<eos> I'm sorry that happened to you.
But after the restraining order was up, you tried to resume contact.<eos> You tell me, Ms. Banks, after all this why would you wanna go back and reunite with Mr. Vargas?<eos> No.<eos> We downloaded the contents of Mr. Vargas' phone.<eos> I have almost 50 pages of Facebook messages between you and Mr. Vargas.
You trust me?<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Mr. Connover?<eos> - Detective Pope still needs to see you.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.<eos> No, Mary...<eos> You do.<eos> I made a vow, remember?<eos> To look after the three of you.
Hello.<eos> Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice to meet you, missus.
He's locked himself away in his flat.<eos> God knows what he's up to.<eos> Do you blame him?<eos> I don't blame him... I don't think about him.<eos> Has he attempted to make contact with you?
But...<eos> You will forget it.<eos> If you think about it, civilisation has always depended on a measure of elective ignorance.<eos> These drip feeds will keep the drug in your blood streams at exactly the right levels.<eos> Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.

It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith.<eos> So, I'm betting that you live in a narrow street, on the ground floor.<eos> Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room?<eos> The room's small.<eos> -Oh, big brother is watching you.
Culverton Smith, all this charity work.<eos> What's in it for you?<eos> We must be careful not to burn our bridges.<eos> SHERLOCK: Do you know why I'm gonna take your case?<eos> Because of the one impossible thing you said.
-Anyone.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why shouldn't he be?<eos> -What is wrong?<eos> -What's the matter with you?
Don't you dare!<eos> I was terrified.<eos> A cup of tea!<eos> Oh, for goodness' sakes!<eos> What's the matter with you?
Mr Holmes.<eos> Culverton wants to know if you're okay going straight to the hospital.<eos> -(SCOFFS) Hospital?<eos> -Culverton's doing a visit.<eos> The kids would love to meet you both.
Yes!<eos> Absolutely, yes!<eos> The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself but rather, the iron chain of reasoning from cause to effect, that reveals, step-by-step, the solution.<eos> That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair.<eos> Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence, as they were available to me.
Anyone who stays here a minute longer is admitting to me personally, they do not have a single spark of human decency.<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> You reptile.<eos> You've been ages waking' up.<eos> I watched you.
For God's sake, this is not one of your idiot cases.<eos> You might wanna close that window.<eos> There is an east wind coming.<eos> You have to sit in the chair.<eos> They won't talk to you unless you sit in the chair, it's the rules.
In return, however, she requires treats.<eos> - Last year it was a violin.<eos> - This year?<eos> Five minutes unsupervised conversation...<eos> With you.
It's used on beef.<eos> I mean, live cows.<eos> To check their marbling.<eos> Hi, Dr. Johnny.<eos> Is Okja with you?
We have a deal.<eos> This thing is worth a lot of money.<eos> Make sure our customer and her purchase get home safely.<eos> Our first ever Mirando super pig sale.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
That's good news.<eos> I was getting so jealous of that bitch.<eos> Then go get your husband.<eos> I need you and Hutch in a certain area in a few days.<eos> I'll get word to you.
But you have to promise me something.<eos> You'll come back and try your luck with us again... soon, anytime... day or night.<eos> Or night.<eos> That's right.<eos> We're watching you,
Mr. Jones?<eos> Mr. Jones?<eos> Mr. Jones.<eos> All right.<eos> All right. I'll wait right here with you.
It's good to see you, too, Sheriff Truman.<eos> As you know, your brother, Harry S. Truman, is my godfather.<eos> I heard he is ill.<eos> I came to pay my respects to my godfather and extend my best wishes for his recovery, which I hope will be swift and painless.<eos> It's an honor to see you again.

I've got one.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> And its beam, it penetrates the igneous rock of ignorance.<eos> It flips that rock over, and there they are, exposed, wriggling, squirming, crawling on their bellies like foul maggots, frantically racing back to the cover of darkness that they so crave.<eos> We're coming for you.

Fifty thousand dollars, past due.<eos> It'd be real smart for Mr. Jones to have that on him tomorrow when we call his office.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Don't you dare go to his office.<eos> I'll talk to you myself.
Come on.<eos> Morning, Bill.<eos> Hey, Carl!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can I get a ride with you into town?
Please go away.<eos> But if you weren't driving, I need to know who was.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> I'll tell you the whole story.<eos> I'll meet you somewhere, but I can't talk to you here.
Squeeze his hand off.<eos> Squeeze his hand off.<eos> Squeeze his hand off.<eos> Dougie!<eos> Are you guys okay?
It's usually about money, Bushnell.<eos> Pure and simple.<eos> Nobody needs more reason than that.<eos> So what's his background?<eos> How long has he been with you?
Well... we appreciate you coming down, Bushnell.<eos> Well, I really appreciate your help.<eos> Damn strange business.<eos> First his car blows up, and then somebody tries to kill him.<eos> We'll get back to you as soon as we have something.
The old gang.<eos> Yeah. No, I wasn't.<eos> I see.<eos> Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I'm a little concerned.<eos> I've seen you go through similar phases in 2016 and 2012 and 2008 and 2005 and 1997 and 1995 and 1992 and 1989 and that weird one in 1966.
No way.<eos> So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?<eos> They're standing right behind you.<eos> Hi there, guys.<eos> Lovely to meet you all. I'm the...
So, what do you say, Commish?<eos> Will you work with me?<eos> I need your help.<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> I'm very, very proud of you, sir.
Okay, well, thanks for dropping by.<eos> I'm gonna show you...<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I guess I need to talk to you, then.
I'm not your sister, he's not your brother.<eos> We don't want you here.<eos> Danny, listen... we can work this out, okay?<eos> I have Hogarth now.<eos> We're coming for you.
It's the only takeout I know.<eos> Smells good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, I'd be thrilled to spend the rest of my session just joining the two of you.
Thank you.<eos> To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.<eos> To the precious sangha, the unsurpassable guides.<eos> To you three rare and supreme sources of refuge, I offer.
Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.<eos> You don't know me... but the Hand does.<eos> And they fear me.<eos> With you and your men by our side... they'll fear you, too.
I'll die before I let you touch them.<eos> I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.<eos> Kill the women.<eos> I just want you guys to know...<eos> I wish I'd never come to China with you.
What do you think?<eos> It's better than torture.<eos> Hey!<eos> What's your problem?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.
Where are you taking him?<eos> Colleen, what's going on?<eos> We're helping him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm going with you.
No.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Danny, Ward.<eos> I was told I'd find you here.<eos> We could have met you at the office.
I said I'd bring him back.<eos> What happened?<eos> The Hand attacked us.<eos> They took Luke.<eos> How do you know they didn't follow you here?
- What are you talking about?<eos> The nurse.<eos> The woman on the radio.<eos> They'll come for them next.<eos> How many mice must drown with you?
Got blasted in the face with a shotgun.<eos> By Jessica.<eos> Our Jessica?<eos> Trust me, I'd face a dragon over Jessica Jones any day.<eos> What happened between you two?
How are we gonna get out of this?<eos> I was gonna ask you the same thing.<eos> Three of you wanna sit?<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> We've had no luck identifying the bodies we found in the warehouse with you.
I have reminded the NYPD<eos> - we have no evidence...<eos> - Yet.<eos> ...to suggest that you were responsible.<eos> Now, I trust Detective Knight, and she says that, although you're being tight-lipped, the best way to proceed is to treat you as witnesses and not suspects.
That's it.<eos> You two put 'em in place.<eos> Once we're out of the hole, hit the charge, get out.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No, I am going down with you.
It's hard to tell.<eos> The more I think about it, the less I like our odds.<eos> Yeah, well, do like me.<eos> Don't think about it.<eos> If you told me a week ago that I'd be here with you two, about to blow up some building and fight ninjas to save New York...
- We're not gonna leave you here.<eos> You made a promise to get him back.<eos> You better keep your word.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> I'm right behind you.
Son of a bitch. Get lost! - Charlie!<eos> - Aw... I can't breathe.<eos> You guys, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die in this banister.<eos> Charlie, what's going on?<eos> Look, I'm coming clean. We've been watching you guys, right?
- It's crazy. Isn't it?<eos> - Good night Anna.<eos> - Good night Hanna.<eos> You leaving?<eos> I was actually just about to come talk to you.
I've read more that you ask me to.<eos> - And I'm on top of.<eos> - I'm talking about. Going the extra mile Unless you want me too. Compete with Christian Grey.<eos> For your attention.<eos> I apologize that Christian was so curt with you the other night.
Yes.<eos> Yes Yes Yes.<eos> So this whole time I had the answer in my pocket?<eos> Anastasia Steele.<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
OK?<eos> Trish, hello. My name's Anna.<eos> I'm a crisis worker here at the SARC.<eos> This is a dedicated Sexual Assault Referral Centre.<eos> I'm going to be with you all the time you're here, to make sure you understand everything that's happening.
She'll wanna know what's happened.<eos> I'll sort it. Don't worry.<eos> Do I get police protection?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> Is there anyone I can call to be with you?
Message for Trish.<eos> This is Beth Latimer.<eos> I've been given your number.<eos> I think you might be expecting my call.<eos> I was hoping to come and see you either today or tomorrow so, if you want to give me a call back, my number here is 01632 960131.
It's bad enough he hardly comes round any more.<eos> You don't have to say things like that.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Ellie?<eos> - Trish, are you all right?
Probably wants to remind me what one plus one is.<eos> Go to the car, okay?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Sorry to yell at you and then chase you down.
- And you got Fred.<eos> - Please.<eos> And once a month you can come back.<eos> You can stay with me and Roberta.<eos> I want you and Roberta now!
Yes thank you, gentlemen...<eos> Germany is an immensely proud nation.<eos> They will never surrender.<eos> Now look. The only way to end this war...<eos> Colonel, I need to talk to you outside.
Diana, I know this confusing...<eos> It is not confusing! It's unthinkable! Who is this woman?<eos> 722 00:59:14,686 -- 00:59:15,802 She is with me, she is with us.<eos> I'm not..<eos> I am not with you!
Friendship ending the war, friendship...<eos> - Okay, You have no money.<eos> - No.<eos> All I want now is a picture of that beautiful face.<eos> You will not need a photo because I'll go with you.
What are you doing?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> Have we met?<eos> No, but I have been watching you.
Mr. Melnyk?<eos> Mr. Melnyk?<eos> My name is Tessa Corbett, I'm a journalist.<eos> I know you're in there.<eos> I don't want to bother you, I just came 'cause I wanted to share some of my articles with you.
Now, the two Smith Wesson models we have, the black MP, eight plus one rounds, will run you about $560 and the Airweight 38 special, it's got more of a classic air and a stainless steel finish,<eos> so that's gonna run you about $436.<eos> Our cheapest model is the Hi Point 9 millimeter, $199.<eos> Comes with a free pocket knife.<eos> Mr. Bonanos, can we speak with you for a moment?
I'd like you to know that you have our complete respect and that to us it makes no difference.<eos> Our proposal will be exactly the same.<eos> James.<eos> Mr. Melnyk, this is the framework agreement we're proposing to the families.<eos> I would like to just... it's a friendly agreement between you and the airline in which you agree to withdraw all claims and lawsuits from the company.
But it isn't.<eos> You have family members here?<eos> No.<eos> My father isn't buried here.<eos> You know, when I was following you, I didn't know exactly when to approach you, where'd be the best place.
I'm not finished.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> So, erm, now the witness is sewn together... we can begin.<eos> Please confirm that you are James Keziah Delaney of Chamber House, Wapping Wall, London... lately accused of conspiring with the members of the Secret Society of Correspondence... against His Majesty The King.<eos> And you have pledged to give us the names of the Americans who conspired with you, and others unnamed, to commit acts of treason within the confines of the City of London.
Mr Chichester, how goes your investigation?<eos> THIS will not stand.<eos> Oh, but it will!<eos> It always does.<eos> Delaney would not make a deal with you.
I need to be on the water by high tide.<eos> You have a ship?<eos> This laudanum is diluted somewhat with burdock, so you can continue to function.<eos> But I doubt you'd be able to steer a ship to America.<eos> You have people with you?
Why would she keep you and not rent you?<eos> Too ugly.<eos> She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> I spied you, too.
No surprise.<eos> Falls from a bridge or something.<eos> Let me just make the point... from an American point of view.<eos> Love is now part of the deal that we are offering over and above that which is on offer from your countrymen.<eos> I'll leave that with you.
Genevieve Decoux.<eos> From New Orleans.<eos> Please, Mr. Delaney, we do not have much time.<eos> You sent the giant to kill me?<eos> The outcome persuaded us you should be courted instead.
Look, do you mind? I've got a shot to make.<eos> So make it.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.
Who has a blade for the dentistry?<eos> Relax, Mr. Delaney.<eos> You're in safe hands.<eos> Your devil saved you.<eos> I had you followed.
You should know that I am a very dangerous man.<eos> I was told that, too.<eos> And who keeps telling you all this shit?<eos> I was told the details of your situation by a representative of his Majesty The King, George.<eos> And indirectly it was the King who financed the drawing up of that very expensive piece of paper, which you just burnt.
And who keeps telling you all this shit?<eos> I was told the details of your situation by a representative of his Majesty The King, George.<eos> And indirectly it was the King who financed the drawing up of that very expensive piece of paper, which you just burnt.<eos> As a rule, the King's council very rarely makes business with an actress unless it's up the back alley of Maiden Lane.<eos> The piece of paper you just burnt also states that, as Horace Delaney's widow,
There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.<eos> As of now, you are a weakness.<eos> These fantasies elude me...<eos> If you go outside, they will find you and they will find a use for you.
Daddy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> It's seven o'clock.<eos> Do you know where your freedom is?<eos> Coming to you live and electrified from studio A, high atop the escarpments of White Tail Peak, the roof...
It's beautiful.<eos> I thought we were gonna have a kegger.<eos> - Well, me too.<eos> - My vote got shot down.<eos> Well, since we can't go with you on your honeymoon...
- Well, me too.<eos> - My vote got shot down.<eos> Well, since we can't go with you on your honeymoon...<eos> 'Cause that would be weird.<eos> We thought we'd spent a night in Provence with you guys.
- Hi.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> What do you mean she escaped?<eos> We don't have the details, but we'll stay in constant touch with the state police.<eos> And if Mary Drake does try to reach out to you...
- You look so beautiful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> My God, are you crying too?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm so happy to be here with all of you.
Congratulations.<eos> You're okay with that, right?<eos> Hanna, of course.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Besides, we're right behind you.
Well, if I have a Romeo appeared.<eos> I probably would have run away from home at all.<eos> Well yes. Only Tema sure Romeo, this is such a car make.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - Already we are with you will witness unique, astronomical phenomena.
This is a threat?<eos> I do not think.<eos> They are not very emotional.<eos> And who else, had heard this conversation?<eos> There was a deputy with you. Yes.
Subtitles for the film "Outcast-one:<eos> Star Wars Stories."<eos> Guys, go.<eos> You are here more dangerous.<eos> - Tëm, I said, I'll go with you.
Glen was appointed leader of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.<eos> A war which, as he saw it, wasn't being won 'cause it wasn't being led.<eos> General.<eos> We're all very excited to have you here.<eos> It's an honor to meet you.
The war can wait.<eos> What can I do for you, General?<eos> I want to pull everyone out of their offices.<eos> I want to open this place up.<eos> I came in here to speak with you about that.
There are those who believe they can win in the face of all evidence to the contrary.<eos> And there are those who know they can't.<eos> Unfortunately for the world, it's the believers who climb to the top of the ladder.<eos> It's guys like Glen who get given the keys to the castle.<eos> President Karzai is very much looking forward to meeting you.
This is the Taliban.<eos> We're not winning any hearts and minds there, I can tell you that.<eos> I'm not sure we ever will.<eos> Kandahar's the same, of course.<eos> Can I be completely frank with you, sir?
All right, see you soon.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - It's great to see you, General.<eos> I'm sorry, but we're running behind schedule.<eos> I was looking forward to getting some face time with you, but I gotta get this baby in the air.
- Pat.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - Let's get going.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> All right, Magnus, talk to you soon.
It's a real privilege.<eos> - Rolling Stone?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Just make sure I'm on the cover.<eos> Well, it's between you and Lady Gaga, sir.
Thank you.<eos> Cory, where's Badi?<eos> I don't know, boss.<eos> He was here a minute ago.<eos> I thought he was supposed to be sitting beside you and Jeanie.
Please sit here.<eos> Please, please sit. Sit.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine, sir.<eos> I've been trying to contact you.
Fall out.<eos> - Do you need anything, boss?<eos> - No.<eos> Thank you, Willy.<eos> Are you... are you sure you don't need me to come with you?
You're here for a few days, you're contradicting my most talented councilwoman.<eos> Second most talented.<eos> And there's no need for an autopsy to determine where these women came from.<eos> Mistress West.<eos> The Wizard of Oz has demanded an audience with you.
- Sylvie!<eos> Sylvie!<eos> They found you.<eos> The butcher said he saw someone taking her 'round.<eos> Has she been with you long?
Let's get you some proper food and a warm bath.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'll come with you.
It's the only thing that was ever really mine.<eos> Tip.<eos> Yeah, I know, I'm trespass.<eos> I remember.<eos> I don't want trouble with any of you.
- Company!<eos> And I told you before we ever set foot on this island I will do whatever necessary to ensure your success here.<eos> If the street understands us better when I sit among your men's wives rather than your men, if the world makes more sense to them that way and your authority grows because of it, as uncomfortable as it may be, then that is a compromise I am willing to make.<eos> Governor?<eos> I'll send for you as soon as I'm satisfied the street is secure.
Yeah, It was your flash.<eos> That's what set him off.<eos> How is he doing?<eos> - Much better.<eos> I imagine that I... owe you all an apology.
Let me get my purse.<eos> Thanks for jumping in and sticking up for me, Pete.<eos> I'm not suicidal.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to see me.<eos> We have a lot in common, you and I, both having children who... well, the old term was "wayward."
Clay.<eos> Clay.<eos> Yeah, sorry, what?<eos> Are you with us?<eos> Yeah, no, I am, I'm with you.
Hey. Where the hell is Justin?<eos> I don't know, Jess.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Probably just skipping first, sleeping in.<eos> Did he ride with you guys today?
I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop you right there, Mrs. Baker.<eos> I'm terribly sorry for your loss, and I wish I could offer you what you need, but I just can't.<eos> Now that lawyers are involved.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> What I'm saying is that, in light of your lawsuit, I shouldn't even be talking to you.
Yeah, I am.<eos> I'll shoot in his spot.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> The butterfly effect.<eos> It started with Justin, then on to you, Alex. And the rest of you.
Yes, Marcus, the most important thing right now is your valedictorian speech.<eos> Let's keep that in mind.<eos> You talking about Clay?<eos> Keep your voice down, dude.<eos> Whatever you're doing, I want in.
It's true.<eos> I never looked so lovely for a dance.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Hannah... you are the most beautiful woman in this family.<eos> I'd agree, but I'd be in trouble with both of you.
But it was his fault.<eos> - No, it's your fault.<eos> - It's not his fault.<eos> Maybe it's all your faults.<eos> Did that ever occur to any of you?
No.<eos> Jesus, Tony.<eos> Death, and rape, and what the fuck is next?<eos> What did I do that Hannah thought was worse than that?<eos> Don't you know what happened?
Have a seat.<eos> What's going on, Sheri?<eos> I, um...<eos> I heard about people getting these subpoenas today for court, and... I...<eos> I just... I wanted to talk to you about...
Then you can stay.<eos> We can talk.<eos> How many people do we have?<eos> To fight?<eos> I'll go with you.
Well, you have one of my people.<eos> Gabriel.<eos> I want to see him first.<eos> Then we can talk.<eos> The boat things you took got taken.
They're called the Saviors.<eos> They own our lives.<eos> And if you kill us, he'll be taking something from them.<eos> And they will come looking.<eos> You only have two options when it comes to the Saviors -- either they kill you or they own you.
You need to talk to Daryl about that.<eos> He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.<eos> Told me not to say where you were, and I did what you asked.<eos> Daryl didn't find you because of me.<eos> And what was said between you and him was said between you and him.
Eugene, get up.<eos> We're breaking you out.<eos> Eugene!<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead".<eos> Get up.<eos> We're breaking you out.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Yeah. Yeah, we do.<eos> It's not just the ones I killed.<eos> I think about the people I didn't kill, too.<eos> We're gonna bring them back when it's all over.<eos> I-I want to go with you.
What are you doing with that? !<eos> It stinks of Rick.<eos> No! Why? !<eos> Why would you do that? !<eos> W-W-What is the matter with you people? !
You just kill everyone that sees it, and it's...<eos> And it's hot under here, wh-which, by the way, is why I shave the beard part.<eos> So, right there, I'm making a decision based on vanity, which is what I was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself?<eos> Why don't I just wear a tie, right?<eos> I mean, it's like that guy you killed when I met you, with the burnt dolls on his body.
You're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Geez, Mom. Your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp.<eos> - I have to call Jerry.<eos> - You do? ! What the fuck is wrong with you two?
All of the descriptors apply to all of you.<eos> Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.<eos> That's always his point.<eos> Let's just get through this as quickly as possible.<eos> Then we'll deal with the two of you.
A better idea.<eos> Hot dog.<eos> Go to hell, jerks.<eos> Next time, you'll die.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Just so he can try on a suit.<eos> - There's a tailor, he comes to the White House.<eos> - Now see, I didn't know that.<eos> - Let's focus.<eos> So when you say your parole officer was mean to you before, how did that make you feel?
You just said it's too far to outrun him.<eos> To Philadelphia it's too far, but I can make safe harbor somewhere nearer.<eos> Outrun for a day, pull him away from here, then seek shelter in a friendly port strong enough to prevent his entry.<eos> Meanwhile... the door will be open for you to reach your grandfather and gain his aid.<eos> Why you?
Would you like to know what I think?<eos> I think Anne is right.<eos> She said something to me earlier. She said only a fool would give his life to earn the admiration of a corpse.<eos> I wanted to strangle her.<eos> But part of me could not help but note in that moment she sounded an awful lot like someone else I once knew, someone you and I both once knew who shared Anne's mistrust of sentimentality.
Six men with you.<eos> They never looked my way as I stayed a considerable distance.<eos> Saw you meet two others late last night, one of them standing on just one leg.<eos> Saw it all.<eos> I had him follow you after you left town so abruptly last night.
But we need to find it.<eos> Need your help to find it.<eos> There was support once, but now Nassau is frightened.<eos> What you would ask, openly defying those soldiers...<eos> I doubt you'd find that kind of support.
- But we are here.<eos> - Captain Flint?<eos> He awaits with a small force of men.<eos> But if we can see those prisoners broken free...<eos> And you are with him as well?
Pardon?<eos> Ni hao is the Chinese.<eos> The Corsicans use the simple salut.<eos> And guten Tag, if German's your thing.<eos> Is that... Are they with you?
I thought in the spirit of inter-collegial understanding...<eos> See, I'm in town looking into a homicide, and the victim spent some time here, back in the '70s.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, I'll tell you what.<eos> The plate number checks out, I'll come find you.
Yuri tells me you spoke to the police yesterday.<eos> You can ask her, she came to me.<eos> Not about anything, but there was a...<eos> One of our cars was... Some kind of accident. A Fender bender.<eos> So, you know, unconnected to this completely.
He beat me, and I would like not to see his world.<eos> Choose.<eos> You are a kind boy.<eos> You choose for me?<eos> Are you sure I do this with you?
Stole that man's watch right there.<eos> Why don't you go talk with him?<eos> I'm looking for a guy who may have come in a couple days back.<eos> Bartender thought he may have sat with you.
- Okay!<eos> Okay!<eos> Fine!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How many times has this happened to you?
Relax.<eos> There.<eos> I wouldn't be asking if I didn't absolutely have to know.<eos> You're right, sir.<eos> The chief was not... totally forthcoming with you.
Now, this woman has been telling us since she hit the campaign trail two years ago--<eos> "Don't over-react," and here she is, not even following her own advice.<eos> And what I'm wondering-- would you fight for her, General?<eos> I fight for my country.<eos> Well, I am with you there.
And her trauma was deepened when you returned her to the site of the event only one day after it happened.<eos> We talked about going home.<eos> She was good with it.<eos> It's not safe psychologically for her to be there.<eos> Look, I d... I don't agree with you, but I-I can take her somewhere for a few days, to a hotel if you think that's best.
It's Christine Lonas from ACS.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that Franny's in foster care.<eos> She'll stay there for the foreseeable future.<eos> I don't enjoy taking a child from her mother, but in this case, it's clearly the right thing to do.<eos> That's why I contacted you.
- Majid.<eos> We are pursuing a parallel program in North Korea.<eos> He told me exactly the opposite last night.<eos> Madame President-Elect.<eos> Madame President-Elect, I have to speak to you.
Rob.<eos> I know we had a briefing scheduled for tomorrow, but something's come up.<eos> Involving me?<eos> Rob, could we have the room?<eos> Ma'am, if I may, I feel I owe you an apology.
Dar Adal.<eos> That's who got Javadi to change his story in the first place.<eos> Dar Adal.<eos> You know, he sat right there earlier today and lied to me about this all over again, that obsequious little shit!<eos> What is it with you people?
I mean, who even thinks like this?<eos> Ma'am, there's something else we should get out into the open, just so we're all clear.<eos> What, more good news?<eos> The bombing.<eos> There's a man who set up a surveillance operation on me, probably to document my interactions with you.
You said you had some names for me.<eos> That's him, isn't it?<eos> Your son, Andrew.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't help but think how proud he'd be of you right now.
About debating O'Keefe?<eos> We were wrong.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It's too soon to tell.<eos> I'm not sure that crowd down there would agree with you.
What?<eos> She's been taken, placed in a state-registered youth home.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that Franny's in foster care.<eos> In this case, it's clearly the right thing to do.<eos> It's why I contacted you.
This way.<eos> Ma'am, this is Major General Majid Javadi.<eos> Madam President--<eos> That's far enough.<eos> An honor to meet you.
He told me exactly the opposite last night.<eos> Let him finish.<eos> Thank you, Madam.<eos> Saul is right.<eos> I did tell him differently last night, but only because I knew I wouldn't get this audience with you if I told him the truth.
Big Apple's coming down.<eos> Vehicle, stand by.<eos> What the fuck? !<eos> Madam President-elect.<eos> Madam President-elect, I have to speak to you.
Mr. O'Keefe.<eos> And a surprise, I'll have to say.<eos> We're on a tight schedule, Brett.<eos> Of course.<eos> My word. You brought an army.
That will probably make it easier.<eos> Probably.<eos> Is that it?<eos> That is probably it, yes.<eos> I'll be frank with you. Carlson Sohns, who runs INTERPOL U.S., said "Let it get buried in the mailroom."
You're only taking up one seat.<eos> May I use another kiosk, please?<eos> All right, a deluxe room, one king.<eos> Just a reminder, we are a nonsmoking hotel.<eos> And you requested that a rental car be dropped off for you here at the hotel tomorrow morning?
Most people panic after a few minutes.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Let's have a chat, shall we?<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Linn-Baker enjoyed talking to you in St. Louis.
Excuse me, but you're lying.<eos> You're just...<eos> You're just saying what we want to hear.<eos> You invited me here, and then you rejected me.<eos> But I sat outside your house all night and I followed you here, so you'd have no choice but to let me get into your machine.
It'll stick.<eos> Then pull your knees towards your chest and hold them there.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> We will be monitoring you from inside there.
I'm just thankful we were able to get you in time.<eos> You are sorry... for what happened today.<eos> What happened today... was exactly what I have been warning you about from the moment you and your husband first arrived here.<eos> Again... and again, and again.<eos> That the decisions you made at every turn would eventually lead us to this.
The man's responsible for his money.<eos> It's gone.<eos> What do you think the consequences should be?<eos> I'm here to make a deal.<eos> So whatever happened between you two doesn't matter.
Aliases and a potential address.<eos> Sending all to you now.<eos> Don't waste any more time.<eos> Gather your assault team, set up a perimeter at that location.<eos> We'll redirect satellite uplinks and reconnect with you on site.
I know you must be nervous about living with a guardian.<eos> I remember how I was when I was your age.<eos> We're all different ages.<eos> Well, I should think at least a fraction of your unhappiness will turn to excitement when you meet this man.<eos> I know he's certainly very eager to meet you.
And our men...<eos> Billy, I could walk out there and tell them the sky is red... and they'd believe me.<eos> That's the power you've given me.<eos> But I have to know this is over... your vendetta against Flint, your need to see him dead or departed from our story.<eos> I have to know you'll never put me to a choice between you again.
When Flint heads south, we head north.<eos> What's north?<eos> Eleanor Guthrie's grandfather.<eos> They heard that Nassau had fallen, and so they came to join us.<eos> The revolution you promised has begun.
Not long, I don't believe.<eos> She rarely included me in her thinking.<eos> What I knew of her was mostly observed rather than shared.<eos> But one thing I know to be true... whatever risk she took or danger she braved... they were all made out of love for you.<eos> She saw a life with you and the child... and she was determined to deliver you all into it.
What is it?<eos> We found him amongst prisoners in the interior.<eos> A ringleader of the pirate militia.<eos> He surrendered himself.<eos> Said he would only speak with you directly.
- Well, hello.<eos> I thought you and Daphne had moved out.<eos> Yes, we did, but there's a significant lack of groceries at our pad.<eos> You do know where to obtain groceries out there in the real world?<eos> Hmm, yeah, but I wanted to see you guys!
Kathryn, I am on the verge here, okay?<eos> I can feel it.<eos> We're not gonna lie and cheat like those other people.<eos> Tuesday, ah, yes.<eos> Noelle can see you then.
I'm pretty happy with the old one.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, can we talk to you guys for a second?
It will happen with Flint and Silver.<eos> This plan will work.<eos> You want the exchange of the money to happen off this island, somewhere no one need know of it.<eos> There it is.<eos> You'll lead them there and they will follow you.
- Thank you.<eos> And speaking of talent, allow me to introduce my extraordinary right hand.<eos> I would be lost without her.<eos> Lila Facchini.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.
- One truth! - One truth!<eos> - Our truth! - Our truth!<eos> One truth!<eos> Our truth!<eos> I mean, the idea of polyphonic fiction reflecting both the intercontextuality of an author's work and their life really resonated with what is happening to you.
I don't need anyone.<eos> Hello.<eos> Mun.<eos> From Seoul Metropolitan Police.<eos> I was hoping to talk to you about Sun Bak.
Lila, why are you still talking to him?<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> You said we needed each other, but as soon as I ask you for something, you walk away.<eos> Be smart.<eos> - How long has he been after you?
She's fighting with her cluster.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> If he's the one that's after you, I must say, I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage.
Yeah, sure.<eos> And once again, congratulations to you both.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye for now.<eos> Might I have a word with you, Mr. Secretary?
They're with the Securities and Fraud division.<eos> And this is your warrant.<eos> Just come with us peacefully, or I will cuff you in front of all these people, including those reporters, okay?<eos> That won't be necessary, Detective.<eos> I'll come with you.
Even as shitty returns, the outflow of institutional money, and the rise of quant funds have lighted the way to our demise, we have willfully refused to change.<eos> In the great expanse of time, we are already dead.<eos> I know it even if you don't.<eos> But in this microsecond that we are still breathing air, I'm gonna fight the inevitable.<eos> If you have a card in front of you, pick it up, hold it in front of your face.
Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,<eos> - continues to operate in the shadows.<eos> - Tom...<eos> I understand you believe in the importance of your article.<eos> And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
The Masterson story.<eos> "War, what is it good for?"<eos> Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?<eos> If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.<eos> Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm a little nervous.<eos> You're sort of a legend and...<eos> articles on the president?<eos> It'd be an honor to work with you in any capacity.
The important thing is we're on the same side.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> And what side is that?<eos> Law enforcement?<eos> No, that's where I'm gonna have to disagree with you.
She'd been drowned.<eos> You didn't send her there?<eos> She resigned yesterday morning, just after you left.<eos> I have to ask...<eos> Kent Finn, he said he was with you the night Miss Palfrey died.
Representatives from the textbook publishers are in your office.<eos> Who?<eos> - Good morning, Alan.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> We are very excited to talk to you.
No problem. - Just be there.<eos> Goddamn it, lb, We're meeting at the inn.<eos> I couldn't... shit.<eos> Let me out! Fucking bitches!<eos> - What the hell...? - What the hell happened to you?
- Run!<eos> - They're all flat. - Taxi! Taxi!<eos> Go!<eos> I don't think you look very happy tonight.<eos> What is wrong with you people? You have no problems.
No.<eos> We're not done here, Doctor.<eos> Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan, a word of advice.<eos> The person you're searching for has a pathological need for control.<eos> He, or she, will want to get as close to you as possible, to... manipulate you.
Thank you, dear.<eos> Excuse me, Miss Hunnicutt.<eos> Mr. Perkins did ask me to come by at 2:00.<eos> And so you have.<eos> Mr. Perkins will see you now.
She was unable to make her way to either.<eos> We will assess the situation here and see what we should do.<eos> Clinical room, straight away.<eos> You've looked after your mother very well, young man.<eos> Now, I think it's time someone looked after you.
So, right about the time that he'd finished his draft of the paper and was due to publish?<eos> So, now you've uncovered my shady, little secret, is there anything else?<eos> Oh, I'm afraid we're not quite done yet.<eos> We believe Stephen may have had a change of heart.<eos> He was going to discuss it with you.
JP? Well, sir, I got the file on Mayor Richards' beach hotel proposal from the Planning Office and I've been going through it.<eos> Now, it seems like the mayor needed the observatory to sign off the development plans.<eos> See, the exclusion zone had to be moved by a couple of hundred metres to exclude the beach, but, er, there's been no objections.<eos> Good.<eos> Right, Florence, let's you and I go back to where it all started two nights ago, halfway up Mount Esmee volcano.
See, on the evening he was killed, Stephen Langham decided he needed to go up Mount Esmee and spend the night.<eos> 'I'll go back up tonight.<eos> 'At least that way, we'll know for sure what's going on.'<eos> 'It was... his turn on night duty.'<eos> But the truth is the irregular readings that were coming through on the seismograph, they weren't down to either seismic tremors or animal activity - they'd been manufactured by you.
Here, let me introduce you.<eos> AMI, please come say hello to Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan.<eos> That's... really amazing.<eos> Hello, Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan.<eos> I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh, well, of course I am.<eos> I'm being questioned by the FBI.<eos> Thank you, AMI.<eos> Your work here is done.<eos> So, um, you and Ian didn't have any bad blood, did you?
Am I the only one smelling barbecue here?<eos> Good nose, Aubrey.<eos> Matthew Coburn?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Uh, we'd like to have a word with you.
Not to mention the fact that Ian owned a 55% stake in their company, so he didn't need Kate's permission to sell. Ugh.<eos> What could Ian's killer possibly have accomplished by hauling his body all the way out here?<eos> Dr. Hodgins, I've been thinking about what you said about accepting things in life when they don't go your way.<eos> And even if the NFL doesn't hire me, I love being at the Jeffersonian.<eos> And working with all of you.
They don't, sir, but you have to do something.<eos> Not until I'm ready.<eos> Sir, he's dead!<eos> He isn't dead until I say he's dead!<eos> Olivia pope is asking if you have a moment, sir.
However this plays out...<eos> I have no regrets.<eos> Michael!<eos> Well, if you're watching this, that means you're safe.<eos> I wish I could be there with you, but as you know now, I wouldn't have had much time.
Our handler.<eos> She helps us track Americans that come in to fight the jihad fight.<eos> Welcome to the civil war.<eos> Mr. Franklin,<eos> Ms. Sheba sent me to collect you.
What I said in the teachers' lounge bringing up all that stuff about Alison.<eos> I know how much she means to you.<eos> Don't apologize.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I have this intense history with the both of you.
What is this about?<eos> I...<eos> I was gonna go to Principal Hackett.<eos> But I thought...<eos> I thought it may be better to talk to you...
- I had to, you lied to me.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> We're gonna take a nice little drive to go visit your friend Jenna.<eos> And on the way there, you're gonna tell us about how the two of you know someone with the initials A.D.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
Most people I talked to weren't available to commit the crime.<eos> And the others would have preferred he stayed alive so they could sue him.<eos> When you say weren't available...<eos> I'm pretty sure that Dunhill was killed the day he left the hospital.<eos> Same day your friends went by Welby to complain about how Dr. Rollins was treating you.
Well, I, I was.<eos> Well, have a drink with us.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Uh, you two are catching up and I don't wanna intrude but listen, it was great meeting you.
- Daddyo!<eos> 'You all finished? '<eos> Fine, Reggie got that audition..<eos> What're you doin' back here?<eos> We thought we hadn't finished your interview with you.
It's gonna get bad now.<eos> Now that you've been cleared.<eos> You think?<eos> _<eos> I was hoping to talk to you about that girl, Natalie.
Whatever.<eos> He's totally gay.<eos> That would be easier, right?<eos> Then you could write him off.<eos> - Does he talk to you about me?
- Oh, come on, now.<eos> - I'm sorry, love.<eos> I need to know.<eos> I was at Sophia's leaving do till 11:00 and then back here.<eos> Did you leave with anyone else?
- Peter and Jamil. - Mm.<eos> And it's Jamil who's being sent to the office all the time... .. and I think we now know why.<eos> I don't think I can add much more than what I said in my witness statement.<eos> I was working on the north end of the island all day, hardly saw anyone.<eos> No, actually we wanted to talk to you about Gemma's husband Ryan.
Do you have an address for her?<eos> We tried calling her, but no answer.<eos> Address is here.<eos> You are not going to try to find him, are you?<eos> God be with you, then.
So, Atwood's working with the Mahoneys, like I said.<eos> It's possible.<eos> It's true.<eos> We shouldn't jump to any conclusions right now.<eos> What happened to you in there?
I get it.<eos> You don't need to cry about him in front of me.<eos> But I do need you to take action.<eos> Yeah, I do need you to be the person that you promised us you were.<eos> You know, that's why we've been following you this whole time and trusting you.
- Understand?<eos> - You think you can shoot all of us?<eos> Anyone else want to play the lottery?<eos> Huh? You're filth.<eos> I'll let ISIL sort you out.
This is not helping us.<eos> You're gonna make a phone call so you can hold up your end of the deal.<eos> There's an auto body shop off Nashwan plaza.<eos> I want vehicles there, full tanks of gas so we can get to the border, all of us.<eos> I'm not going with you to the border.
And cat...<eos> Mr. Mcgill.<eos> Erin brill!<eos> You're just in time for chair yoga.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Shame on you.<eos> So?<eos> Like a charm, yeah.<eos> She'll go back on the settlement?<eos> I imagine you'll hear from her within an hour or so.
The situation in the Middle East?<eos> Situation's developing.<eos> We need to meet soon.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> The moment we're back, we'll call you.
But if I tell him...<eos> I don't want to get in trouble, too.<eos> Tell Jimmy what?<eos> Lily, I want to thank you for bringing your mom down.<eos> It was a delight to meet you, young lady. Oh.
I got to say, I would never have thought to collect bottle caps.<eos> Oh, it's a wonderful hobby.<eos> What excites me is the hunt.<eos> I can imagine.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Tiller.
- Did you know about this?<eos> - No. But maybe this is why Dad went back to Idris.<eos> Maryse went behind my back.<eos> My fellow Shadowhunters.<eos> It's an honor to be here with you all.
You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.<eos> What?<eos> The rest of you, back to work.<eos> I'm lifting the lockdown on the Institute, except for Clary and Jocelyn. Given your relationship to Valentine and Jace,<eos> I want to keep a close eye on you.
Izzy and Alec are the best we've got.<eos> They stay in.<eos> Izzy...<eos> Izzy, please.<eos> You wouldn't want to be benched on this. Let me come with you.
Why aren't you getting ready?<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> I'm not going through with it.<eos> That's hysterical.<eos> Whatever happened between you two, why don't you just kiss and make up?
Please come back with us.<eos> We need you.<eos> Clary needs you.<eos> You think that I don't wanna be there for Clary?<eos> For all of you?
Why is it so important?<eos> Hand over the box.<eos> I swiped it off Darhk.<eos> You have something we need. I would like to<eos> - broker a deal with you.
Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.<eos> Let me tell you something, Master Bruce: that man lied to you.<eos> Him and his bloody Court of Owls, they tried to use you, they tried to manipulate you.
I got vengeance for my parents' murder.<eos> That's real!<eos> No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep. That's real.
Because we are connected.<eos> Jackass.<eos> Guys?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought something happened to you guys.
It's a long process, and then it ain't, and by the looks of that assistant out there, you need me back bad.<eos> How about I give you guys a moment?<eos> It's all right, Ms. Williams.<eos> I wasn't planning on keeping my problems a secret.<eos> In fact, I wanted to talk with you about them, you know, on camera.
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.<eos> Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?<eos> I do.<eos> I owe it to them.<eos> I don't owe it to any of you.
And if second chance doesn't work?<eos> Miss Venediktov...<eos> Eh, he's--he's fine.<eos> Well, he's unconscious, but he--look, I'm sorry that I scared you the other night.<eos> I just--I--I need to speak with you.
Bad guy on a yacht.<eos> - Dang. - Thank you for the assist.<eos> See?<eos> Help is good.<eos> I will contact you when I'm on site.
John? John?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anything in particular you're looking for with that thousand-yard stare?<eos> It's that obvious, huh?<eos> Rene wasn't the only one who could clock tension between you and the missus, if that's what you mean.
You know the Catholics consider purgatory to be...<eos> The immediate state following physical death?<eos> Konstantin, when I kill you this time, I'm gonna make sure you're dead.<eos> When we're done, the only person you'd want to kill is yourself.<eos> I'm just saying you could've taken a big knife and cut the tension between you two.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.<eos> This is going south fast.<eos> - Where's Captain?<eos> - He's in his office.<eos> Listen, has Nick contacted you?
They're here, but...<eos> But they took a cab.<eos> Why would they take a cab?<eos> Hey.<eos> You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?
Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.<eos> Not in that order.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - This way.<eos> They put a tail on you?
- You won't.<eos> Franco.<eos> Hey, it's Wu.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Yeah.<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I spoke with your friend,<eos> Rosalyn this morning,<eos> Rosalyn Garret.<eos> She was with you the night before Billy died.
I'm talking about all of you.<eos> Being caught up in this...<eos> Alex wants to do something.<eos> Amos doesn't do anything he doesn't want to.<eos> And if you think I'm going along just because of you...
Let's go.<eos> Every scrap of data in this facility has been encrypted.<eos> We know what you were doing on Eros.<eos> Nobody knows what we're doing on Eros.<eos> And every minute I have to spend playing games with you, takes me away from that work.
- Hi. Megan, why is this such a hot-button issue for you?<eos> Well, Brad, I love our apartment.<eos> I think it is the greatest apartment in the world.<eos> But if we don't start cracking down on these undocumented boyfriends, then pretty soon, I tell you what, we're not gonna have an apartment left.<eos> Now, Megan, I agree with you, but how would you respond to those who claim that boyfriends make the apartment stronger?
If we're to be dinner companions, you must call me Penelope.<eos> If I may call you Peter?<eos> The evil spreads, and one by one they suck you in.<eos> I didn't... I haven't....<eos> So shall I pick you up at seven?
Great job.<eos> Oh, fuck me.<eos> No more goddamn bronzer.<eos> Okay, guys, I called this family meeting because...<eos> I have something very exciting that I wanna talk to you about.
What?<eos> Richard, I was waiting out front!<eos> They want to ambush you and replace you with Big Head, but I had nothing to do with it.<eos> Again, not my call.<eos> I was ready to fight you guys, but then, on the way home, it occurred to me there might be a better way.
Stand together!<eos> Not you.<eos> I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.<eos> Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.<eos> I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot.
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from grave danger.<eos> As King in the North, he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses, so together they may face their common enemy.<eos> He sounds like quite a man.<eos> Summon Jon Snow.<eos> Let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.
And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.<eos> Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.<eos> Do I have your support?<eos> You have mine.<eos> Dorne is with you, Your Grace.
That's the thing we do.<eos> Can I get real for a sec?<eos> - Please.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I feel pretty goddamned blessed to be here on this roof drinking this very, very hot beer with you all.
Right, right, but, like, the oldest of the young dogs.<eos> Yeah, no, I get that.<eos> You know, we're still pups on the porch, even though we like to run around in the yard.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - But since we're all pups here, I've got to tell you that everyone in this office wants to fi-ight you, and they're planning a prank... clap back.
- Yeah.<eos> - But since we're all pups here, I've got to tell you that everyone in this office wants to fi-ight you, and they're planning a prank... clap back.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - But the thing is, is, we really li-ike you.<eos> And we don't want to fi-ight you.
Just go.<eos> I never liked you.<eos> I liked you the least.<eos> - Just go. - Oh, my gosh.<eos> You guys did such a great job, and I'm proud of you, everyone.
This is not '80s Vegas.<eos> They won't just break your hands and let you walk away.<eos> They'll prosecute and push for maximum sentence.<eos> There's a camera there, camera there, over there.<eos> That old lady in the Terrapins sweatshirt behind you is not a grandma.
You may sit.<eos> You have something to say to the man.<eos> Ahem. Technology's evolving.<eos> We're all evolving.<eos> It would be an honor, sir, to evolve with you.
The whole city... no, the whole country... watches her show.<eos> She can take you to a whole new level.<eos> Solidify your legacy on a national scale.<eos> "National scale"?<eos> She's in my office, and she is dying to meet you.
Please.<eos> Then I think the exclusive interview should happen here at City Hall this Friday, live.<eos> Actually, I would prefer to do it at home and... Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.<eos> This Friday or not at all.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Mr. Mayor.
James Gordon.<eos> The James Gordon.<eos> Wow.<eos> It's actually you.<eos> So cool I'm meeting you.
Some of you may know, I died.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> But take it from me, death is... dull... but coming back... that is something.<eos> Leave it to dying to give you a whole new perspective on life.<eos> And I would like to share that with you.
Nah.<eos> You had your chance to kill me.<eos> Stop turning us against each other.<eos> We're taking him with us.<eos> Oh, if you think I am going anywhere with you...
Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.<eos> Let me tell you something, Master Bruce: That man lied to you.<eos> Him and his bloody Court of Owls, they tried to use you, they tried to manipulate you.

- Honestly, it wasn't that hard.<eos> Not when he's beaming "H.R. Wells'".<eos> Adventures in the Multiverse" back chapter by chapter.<eos> You know what?<eos> Not without going through us. If I really wanted to go through you, you would all be dead.
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force, I accidentally ran into the future.<eos> I saw Savitar murder you.<eos> - How are you gonna tell Dad?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> If you guys got something going on, I hope you know you can talk to me.
You ready?<eos> - For you.<eos> - Here.<eos> Okay.<eos> What is going on with you two?
That... that kind of love is rare.<eos> Dad, I wish it were that simple.<eos> Simple.<eos> Look, only you know... what's good for you.<eos> But with the kind of lives... that you two have, that love between the two of you, that is the one thing... that should stay simple.
Love, Supergirl.<eos> Love is about... letting yourself be saved.<eos> It's not just about saving other people.<eos> Even if you are superheroes.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to, like, mess with you a little bit.
Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all.<eos> I mean...<eos> I mean, it should've driven me closer.<eos> This isn't what she would want.<eos> But I'm here now to tell you that... no matter what happens in the past, I will not abandon you.
And then God help us all.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll figure out something.<eos> Please do.<eos> It was nice meeting you.
Want to cut it out with the emojis?<eos> Mr. Allen, can you tell me... in your expert opinion, what substance do you see in this photograph?<eos> Uh, shellac flakes.<eos> Shellac is a resin secreted by female lac bugs found in large quantities of the trees in Thailand... that's too fast, that's too...<eos> Mr. Allen, are you all right?
And then God help us all.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll figure out something.<eos> Please do.<eos> It was nice meeting you.

Matt, look out!<eos> Go, go, go, go!<eos> It's okay.<eos> You finished your assignment.<eos> Sybil's done with all of you now.
Oh?<eos> Look, just call it a case of stewardess interruptus.<eos> Perhaps it was for the best.<eos> I know you don't believe that.<eos> I don't know what happened between you two.
Do you bring them home together now?<eos> Wh-What do you mean, hookups?<eos> Well, Dre told me about your arrangement.<eos> And, at first, I was a little surprised, but now I'm actually intrigued.<eos> You know, I was wondering maybe... I could come and hang out with the two of you.
Investors crave stability, Lucious.<eos> The company can't afford any more shakeups right now.<eos> Thank you, Leonard.<eos> Let's get a press release out, immediately.<eos> I look forward to working with you all to expanding Empire into this lucrative new market.
And he won it.<eos> Good.<eos> Maybe you and him will have a much smoother ride than we did.<eos> So, you're not gonna try and burn it down if I say yes?<eos> Whatever you and him got, it ain't nothing compared to what we had.
No offense, y-you, too.<eos> I need to be alone.<eos> Catch.<eos> Can you get Paulie Walnuts to back up off me?<eos> So why am I meeting with you behind Lucious' back?
But don't be crazy, like your grandmother, all right?<eos> I know that Bella's all right. I can...<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Wow, the venue is amazing.<eos> I can't wait to see Inferno light up this space. Now, there is one thing I'd like to share with both of you.
This is Cookie.<eos> She saw that Lucious Lyon was opening a show here.<eos> Sold out, but we got scalped tickets.<eos> She's a huge fan.<eos> She always teased that I was confabulating when I claimed I used to know you.
Castiel.<eos> Kill her!<eos> I know you.<eos> Hey!<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.
Mom?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No argument. Lady Bevell went too far.<eos> I deeply apologize.<eos> We wanna work with you.
A lot.<eos> You can't run forever.<eos> You're trapped out here.<eos> Well, what we have here is a failure to communicate.<eos> 'Cause we're not trapped out here with you.
These are my sons.<eos> Hi. Glad to meet you.<eos> She said a lot of good things.<eos> Yeah. Right back at you, man.<eos> Your, uh, your mom's real proud of you boys.
At 10:45, demon comes home.<eos> Sam and I will be waiting for him.<eos> I'll pop him with a Devil's Trap bullet.<eos> I'll finish him off with a demon blade.<eos> And I will wait at the back with you in case he comes in that way.
I've been distant.<eos> Cold, even.<eos> Leaving you, working with them...<eos> I was trying to make things right.<eos> Just from a distance, because... being here with you was too hard.
- You were working all night?<eos> - Till three.<eos> The graveyard shift.<eos> So, we were talking to your radio controller.<eos> She said you developed a fault with your radio halfway through the night and she couldn't contact you.
Well, only what the police said.<eos> That it was at the party and it was late in the evening.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> Listen, um you know me and Cath will be there for Trish,<eos> and for you, mate. All the problems that you guys have been having, it doesn't matter now.
I got dropped off back there.<eos> I walked in this way.<eos> Can I...?<eos> Wherever you want.<eos> We'll be led by you.
Were you waiting for me to come out?<eos> Sort of.<eos> Look, I know you're helping Trish.<eos> Cath Atwood told me.<eos> I can't talk to you about that.
Everything between me and Trish is confidential.<eos> I'm her boss.<eos> She's worked for me for years.<eos> - I'm worried for her, that's all.<eos> - I can't discuss her with you.
I don't know how you've kept it to yourself for so long.<eos> You're doing the right thing now.<eos> I want you to know, it doesn't matter how long ago this was.<eos> We'll investigate this as thoroughly and robustly as we can.<eos> We'll do everything we can to find the person that did this to you.
Just cos he's an arsehole, doesn't mean he's a rapist.<eos> No, but these are a match to the condom wrapper found at Axehampton.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How's he off for blue fishing twine, Miller?<eos> Beth Latimer's downstairs saying she needs an urgent word with you.
So Cath Atwood asked you to beat up her husband?<eos> No.<eos> - She knew you were going to?<eos> - No.<eos> DI Hardy, I need to talk to you urgently outside.
Oh!<eos> Exactly.<eos> All the farm-grown vegetables sold in the shop are bundled together with blue twine.<eos> So if I test these fibres against fibres found in Trish's wrist wounds...<eos> - I need to talk to you both...
When I needed help, no-one was there.<eos> We were there, Nira.<eos> I was there for you.<eos> We still are.<eos> What happened to you, Nira?
I'm not your ISVA.<eos> You chose not to be a client of ours.<eos> - I'm just a woman who's angry.<eos> - With me?<eos> With the man who did this to you.
Funny thing, when I was on my arse in the mud, didn't think to check my watch.<eos> Can I make a wee suggestion, Ed?<eos> Lay off the smart-arse replies.<eos> Just keep it simple, and honest, yeah?<eos> Ian Winterman er, says he had to talk to you about sexually harassing his wife.
I promised I'd keep their name out of it.<eos> Have you forgotten what's happening?<eos> Your wife was raped.<eos> We're trying to find the person responsible.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Do you have no shame?<eos> All right.<eos> Here's what you're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna take a long walk and a few deep breaths, and then you'll call us, and give us the name of the person who installed that spyware for you.<eos> If you haven't done that by the end of the day, I will come looking for you, and I will bring you back in here, under arrest.
Aren't you supposed to tell me to see it from his point of view?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> But we've all done that.<eos> And it hasn't helped, has it?<eos> I've been with you both, this whole journey.
Evening, Clive.<eos> - What you doing here?<eos> - Clive Lucas, I'm arresting you in connection with the rape of Patricia Winterman, committed at Axehampton House on Saturday 28th May this year.<eos> You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
- What?<eos> You wanted some cash from the bank.<eos> For Kim Hopperstad to fix the hole.<eos> But you couldn't be bothered going yourself.<eos> Kim'll see you there at four.
- I said file.<eos> Allow me to introduce myself, because, as you can see from my mole, we've never met before.<eos> As you can see from my coat, hat and ascot, I'm here on business.<eos> And as you can see from my sunglasses... it's bright out.<eos> I'm here to consult with you on the Baudelaire will, for which I understand you are the executioner.
No, no, no, no. You listen to me, little boy, and you listen very carefully.<eos> The only reason why Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb is because he hasn't gotten a hold of your fortune.<eos> But you ask yourself this question, all of you:<eos> What reason would he have to keep you alive after he's got your money?<eos> What do you think will happen to you then?
Yes, you did.<eos> You just didn't finish the job.<eos> Remember when our parents first brought Sunny home?<eos> She bit the doorknob off the nursery.<eos> Mother and Father... they made me promise to always look after you two and make sure you don't get into any trouble.
Get it absolutely right.<eos> There's talent scouts in the audience looking for new actresses about your age.<eos> Talent scouts!<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Justice Strauss, may we speak to you?
You know, I always wanted to have a family of my own.<eos> But... time flies like a winged lizard.<eos> Now... I know... that a few dangerous reptiles can make you skeptical of the entire species.<eos> But, if you give them a chance... and you get to know them well enough to tell the dangerous from the good...<eos> I promise you... no harm will come to you in the Reptile Room.
There is a type of situation which occurs all too often in the story of the Baudelaire orphans, called dramatic irony.<eos> Simply put, dramatic irony is when a person makes a remark, and someone who hears it knows something, which makes the remark have a different, usually unpleasant, meaning.<eos> Uh, for example, if I were to say, "I can't wait to eat this almond cookie," but there were people around that knew the almond cookie was poisoned, that would be dramatic irony.<eos> For that reason, when we hear Uncle Monty tell the children...<eos> I promise you, no harm will come to you in the Reptile Room. we should be on guard for the unpleasant arrival of dramatic irony.
Uh, let me just unlock all these important security measures and I'll join you in the Reptile Room!<eos> Retinal scan one.<eos> Retinal scan two.<eos> I am so sorry, Baudelaires, that you were frightened by that man who arrived earlier.<eos> Um, it makes sense that you were alarmed, being that he chased you up and down the stairs with a knife.
Because you... are a spy from the Herpetological Society.<eos> What?<eos> Can you hear what they're saying?<eos> I hope he's telling Count Olaf that his plot is foiled and he's done for.<eos> You're done for, Stephano.
Oh, will you look at the time?<eos> Well, the SS Prospero departs at 5:00 p.m.<eos> You better go upstairs, children, and pack for your Peruvian adventure.<eos> Mr. Poe, we can't go with Stephano.<eos> We don't have the proper paperwork you mentioned.
You're a hard man, Dake.<eos> You and your team go chasing Axe up into those hills without me, don't forget one thing.<eos> What's that?<eos> A good supply of body bags.<eos> We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in...
You'll need that in writing.<eos> Simple as asking him.<eos> Don't you worry, George. We'll all be cheesing and grinning in Albany soon enough.<eos> No Ice Juice nonsense is gonna change that.<eos> I signed off on you.
Did he off himself?<eos> That is dark.<eos> Uh, no. I just heard from a contact at the Bureau of Prisons. He's been released.<eos> What the fuck is that about?<eos> I thought I made it pretty clear I never wanted to talk to you again.
Then let's make this an unofficial consultation.<eos> Are there things I can do today to protect myself?<eos> Would I be wise to consider extreme measures, separation, divorce?<eos> I'm going to have to ask you to pick up the money and put it back in your bag.<eos> I will not talk with you about any of this.
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God, sir.<eos> I...<eos> I di...<eos> Are you okay?
Uh, are you sure?<eos> Sure.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Sorry for bothering you.<eos> Hi. I'm calling because we had an appointment with you guys for, I think, Wednesday?
You're here to help.<eos> Because all this is so stressful for me.<eos> Is that what Jimmy told you?<eos> He's worried about you, Chuck.<eos> In spite of everything that's happened between the two of you, he... he cares.
Next.<eos> Next!<eos> Yes, Mrs. Pressman, I still have the document.<eos> I'm including the calico.<eos> Now I don't wanna get down into the weeds on this with you, sir.
So a kind of a payoff.<eos> Then you don't get hit with the taxes.<eos> You think you can make that fly?<eos> If someone came to me with this offer... I'd sure as hell take it.<eos> Wish I'd called you sooner.
- Susan. - Thanks, guys.<eos> I really appreciate you letting me back in...<eos> Enough, Susan. You're only here so we can kick out Emily.<eos> Guys, I'm sorry.<eos> I should have been straight with you from the beginning, instead of going to HR.
Yes, we're aware.<eos> And we know FBI has no authority to be here.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> Everything.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
Merci.<eos> Mailman, 11 o'clock.<eos> The first cab in the cab line has passed on two fares since we sat down.<eos> Are you getting this?<eos> Like we're right there with you.
Where you going?<eos> Ball game's over, boys.<eos> You got this, bro. Feel better.<eos> Make sure that hole in your side heals quick. Keep your heads down.<eos> I'll be with you in spirit.
Cousins.<eos> Plate check.<eos> Send.<eos> Kilo, eight, four, one, hotel.<eos> I can't go with you.
What?<eos> Excuse me, this is a closed rehearsal.<eos> I'm sorry, I...<eos> Josie, right?<eos> I was hoping I could talk to you about some songs that I wrote?
What did you mean by that?<eos> Hey, Archie, why don't we quit while we're ahead?<eos> It's just...<eos> I mean, it's just a question.<eos> Did something happen between you two?
Is that what you want?<eos> Maybe that's for the best.<eos> If you don't mind, Fred.<eos> Whatever you want, FP.<eos> It's between the two of you.
The rest of your life, and your mother's, will be decided by it."<eos> Hey, I was talking to Kevin.<eos> He told me that you and Chuck had some scene in the cafeteria yesterday.<eos> It wasn't a big deal.<eos> What exactly happened between you guys that night?
I just wanted to talk. Where are you?<eos> I'm with Betty. We're looking for Jughead.<eos> Wait.<eos> You and Betty went on a manhunt without me?<eos> I'll come meet you.
Did you kill Jason Blossom?<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> We need to see Sheriff Keller.<eos> There's been a huge mistake.<eos> Sheriff, we need to talk to you about FP Jones.
So, everything, starting with FP's confession, has a few gaping holes in it.<eos> He's being used by someone with a crazy motive, for example, hiding incest.<eos> You were disgusted that Jason and Polly were dating because they were related.<eos> Nothing could be more purely Blossom than those babies.<eos> Okay, what is wrong with you people?
Her killer got away with it.<eos> Edward Gunn got away with two, at least.<eos> And Veronica Allen walked.<eos> Harry's a lot of things, but he is not a cold blooded...<eos> I agree with you.
That's enough.<eos> Thanks for the tip today, Nick.<eos> I was wondering how you got it when my best investigator couldn't.<eos> Well, I knew Slater had been in and out of jail when he was young, and... I happen to know a lot of people in that world.<eos> Which is what I wanted to talk to you about.
He's a good man, Isaiah.<eos> I know what it's like.<eos> I told myself I could handle it.<eos> And here I am, divorced three times because I can't get over a woman I had no business developing feelings for.<eos> Look, I'm your boss, not your father, but... whatever's going on between you two, just end it.
You're forgetting the victim was Muslim, too.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Mr. Stone!<eos> Honor to be in the courtroom<eos> - with you today.
I didn't mean any offense, obviously.<eos> Is it obvious?<eos> Have you found anything at that cabin to tie this woman's death to Cyrus Beene?<eos> No, Mr. President.<eos> And based on what you've seen, do you consider Cyrus Beene a suspect in the assassination of Frankie Vargas?
Please.<eos> Oh, it is so nice to finally meet one of Holden's friends.<eos> Now I know where he's sneaking off to.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> He's been on my case about having dinner with you all and I... I keep bailing.
"But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends...<eos> It gives a lovely light!"<eos> Oh, it's just gorgeous.<eos> How lovely, you memorized all four lines.<eos> Well, I've always wanted to meet you, and now I certainly have.
A Jean Patou suit makes you look like you were born in the city.<eos> Of course, it's up to you, dear.<eos> Try it on.<eos> - All right. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Shall I come with you?
At long last.<eos> Good to see you again, my boy.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Professor Gauss, I'm Zelda, Scott's wife.<eos> I'm so honored to meet you.
I don't know what you guys are so happy about.<eos> They didn't hire us.<eos> They're clearly going to.<eos> In two to three weeks?<eos> What is wrong with you people?
- Thank you.<eos> So, you can send the papers over today.<eos> Let's get that land, okay?<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> Uh, looking forward to working with you sirs.
Boy George and myself...<eos> We're all on a yacht.<eos> Which makes sense, right?<eos> 'Cause my name is George.<eos> Oh, my God! What is wrong with you people?
And, one, two three.<eos> Yay!<eos> Look at you guys.<eos> By my side, just, forever and ever.<eos> JOSH (chuckles): It's nice to finally meet you, sir.
- Well, it's all lies. - (they chuckle)<eos> Wow.<eos> That's a... very firm handshake.<eos> It says a lot about a man.<eos> JOSH: You know, I'd love to... catch up with you later, like, have a drink.
Okay.<eos> There you go.<eos> Now, use the history of your relationship to inform the movement.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What are some of the favorite times you've had together recently?
I'm gonna check on the kids.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where are you guys going?<eos> We're trying to find a way out of the colony.<eos> I want to come with you.
They procreate almost continuously,<eos> - which is nice for them.<eos> - Dr. Bell, you're needed in the E.R.<eos> - Okay, I'll be right there.<eos> - I'll join you.
Uh, mental-health day.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Got to take this.<eos> I'm guessing she didn't clear that with you.
I need to get back into The Realm.<eos> I'm not inducing you into another coma.<eos> It's too traumatic.<eos> Since when did you have the authority to order me around, Daniel?<eos> Since your grandfather tasked me with looking after you both.
As far as I know, it's not a crime to crave a Tornado Shake.<eos> Right.<eos> We have a witness who named you as a suspect.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> The Matthews boy was in here talking to you, wasn't he?
Delta X-ray, stand by for an active message from Delta X-ray Zero Two.<eos> 'Delta X-ray received.<eos> This is SIO on the Trapdoor search currently ongoing on the Borogrove Estate.<eos> - Get back!<eos> - Are you all right?
You were on this wall for over an hour, but you can't remember where it was?<eos> No.<eos> Right, OK.<eos> Think we'll be able to charge him within the 36 hours?<eos> Was there anybody there with you?
It's over.<eos> Finally... .. it's over.<eos> Sorry, Sarge, I know you're just heading out the door.<eos> What's up?<eos> There's someone down in reception wants to talk to you.
- What's he done now?<eos> - No-one's in any trouble, miss.<eos> Would it be possible to talk to you inside, please?<eos> Free country.<eos> I appreciate this may be a difficult subject for you, Jade, but I'm here to talk to you about Michael Farmer.
- Yes?<eos> Last one to tell tales, but Tim Ifield signed out the reports.<eos> He's been looking at them too.<eos> Thanks, Jodie.<eos> Are you OK, ma'am?
And, Sergeant...<eos> One more thing.<eos> Mrs Clark?<eos> I'll be on my way now.<eos> Actually, I did want to see you about something.
Try not to panic.<eos> Slow, deep breaths.<eos> Arthur Pilbury and George Marsh -- they're still in there.<eos> Oh, Lord, no.<eos> I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.<eos> Look, the fire's only just out.<eos> The bloody wiring must've caused this.<eos> It'll still be dangerous.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Her pelvic abnormalities bar a vaginal delivery, thus a caesarean section is necessary.<eos> Labour has begun at 37 weeks, therefore we must proceed immediately and get her to theatre.<eos> Bring her in.<eos> I'm sorry about that, Mrs Reed.<eos> I'll be with you in the operating theatre.
Tell them that men like you should be protected.<eos> Stand up like this?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> Tell them what this accident has done to you, to Arthur.
Well, that should've firmed your upper arms and trimmed your flanks.<eos> S'not a laughing matter, Barbara!<eos> I've let myself down and my class.<eos> And I'm going to put it right.<eos> See that Mrs Turner has all she needs, then I must talk to you about the sluice room.
That's lovely.<eos> I'm going to do that too.<eos> I said leave it.<eos> I will fix it.<eos> I'm sorry, Sister, I realise this is an inopportune moment but I must speak with you.
Now, where d'you want it?<eos> - Um... - 'Bout there?<eos> That's a good length on you.<eos> Oh!<eos> Are you all right?
It's all right.<eos> Just keep breathing into the bag, Crystal.<eos> It will calm you.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Don't forget I'll be in there with you.
It seems Mrs Williams has gone into labour.<eos> - Here?<eos> - Yes. Here!<eos> And it's baby number five, so unless we get a move on, you're going to have a lot more than amniotic fluid on your chair.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
You want to learn to drive and you want me to teach you, in my car?<eos> Yes, Nurse Crane.<eos> That's it in a nutshell.<eos> I've always wanted to learn but never had the courage.<eos> Now, thanks to my work here with all of you, I've come to fully appreciate that there is no time like the present.
I leave tomorrow.<eos> - My wife knows no-one here.<eos> - It will be fine.<eos> I have good neighbours and my sister, Deka.<eos> And now you've got us as well.
Your sister would make a lovely nurse.<eos> So this is normal?<eos> To go to the hospital?<eos> Every case is different.<eos> I'll be there with you.
There was a ticket.<eos> And... And it was time.<eos> She's gone to be cut.<eos> How could you?<eos> How could you let her go when you could've died from what they did to you?
Our global markets are in a freefall.<eos> The world is clamoring to know what the hell is going on, and we can't tell them.<eos> We can't tell them that the President of the United States has allowed his ex-mistress to brainwash him into thinking his former Chief of Staff is a murderer...<eos> - Watch yourself.<eos> - You are being played.
Maybe more.<eos> ‐ Silas, it's Sarah.<eos> I've been calling you for days.<eos> I hope you come back soon.<eos> ‐ Is there anything between you and Cal?
Jesus Russel, how could you let this happen?<eos> ‐ How could you put me in that position?<eos> ‐ I was trying to delegate some responsibility, Russel‐‐<eos> ‐ No, you were giving me your dirty work, and it's dirty.<eos> All right, whatever the hell is going on between you guys, you need to figure it out because it's messing all of us up.
For decades, House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros, and the feat of that power is Casterly Rock.<eos> Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock, and take it.<eos> Summon Jon Snow.<eos> He would make a valuable ally.<eos> Let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him.
You really do love her.<eos> You poor fool.<eos> She'll be the end of you.<eos> Possibly.<eos> Not much to be gained from discussing it with you, though, is there?
I'm losing.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> I never thought that dragons would exist again.<eos> No one did.<eos> The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.
You could've killed me.<eos> The fuck were you doing back there?<eos> Ending the war.<eos> Killing her.<eos> You saw the dragon between you and her?
You must be even older than you look.<eos> - 15.<eos> - 15? !<eos> Apiece.<eos> I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
There's a greater purpose at work.<eos> And we serve it together, whether we know it or not.<eos> We may take the steps, but the Lord of Light--<eos> For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole?<eos> Are we coming with you or not?
You say you can't have children.<eos> But there are other ways of choosing a successor.<eos> The Night's Watch has one method, The Iron born folk, among their many flaws...<eos> We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.<eos> Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush, and I saw hundred of arrows miss.
I'm impressed.<eos> How did you figure it out?<eos> I noticed a huge concentration of outbreaks around the Great Lakes.<eos> Which just so happens to be a major source of drinking water.<eos> But they weren't planned by you.
It's fate.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are you going with this?<eos> I'm redoing the wedding.<eos> This time with you.
Where were you, if you weren't at the club?<eos> No comment.<eos> I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Roy Tomkins.<eos> I swear, I didn't do it...<eos> You're not obliged to say anything, but anything you do say will be taken in writing and may be given in evidence.
He mentioned a girl.<eos> He saw her yesterday.<eos> And why would you possibly think that was me?<eos> The weigh-in.<eos> I saw there was something between you.
I always knew you would.<eos> I'll see you later, champ, eh?<eos> Come on.<eos> Jeb wanted me to pass on a message.<eos> He's expecting to meet you later.
Absolutely.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll see myself out.<eos> I know we're supposed to cooperate with you people, but half the time you got your wires crossed.
Easy-peasy. There it is.<eos> If you want, we can show you.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no. That's fine.<eos> I think I can manage by myself.<eos> You know, I have to say, uh, last night, I didn't think that much of Bridgeport, but after meeting you two, uh, all that's turned around.
I just bought us 30 seconds.<eos> How should we spend it?<eos> Marius was here last night.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - He had a gun, and he was going to kill anyone who came between you and him.
No, no, no, no.<eos> I'm done.<eos> You know what?<eos> The truth is I think I wanted to make captain more than I wanted to actually be one.<eos> But I'm happy where I am with you assholes.
- to shut that down right now? - I'm so sorry to interrupt.<eos> Madam Vice President, I'm Jonah Ryan.<eos> - Okay. - I am... oh, I am a West Wing intern.<eos> - Oh, congratulations.<eos> Okay. - I just wanna say it's such an honor to meet you.
Is Mama ready to roll out?<eos> Oh, my God, I can't believe it!<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - You're Monica from "Monica." Oh, yeah!<eos> It is a dream of mine to cook with you someday.
Yeah, you're the poor schmuck taking the high school equivalency.<eos> Drive safely.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It was so good having you two under one roof.
I'd hate to ruin those hands.<eos> Amanda.<eos> I told her to be out front.<eos> It's fine, I'll get her.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. I... I need to talk to you.
- Karolina. - Hm?<eos> If you don't mind, may I sit facing the entrance?<eos> I prefer the way the light radiates off you from that angle.<eos> Charming, as always.<eos> Not so difficult around you.
As for myself, does a lion consider the ant?<eos> He does not.<eos> I simply enjoy annoying him.<eos> Speaking of which, will you be joining us on Sunday?<eos> I would never miss a chance to see you.
"Wow, cool curtains.<eos> Are they from Etsy?"<eos> Cool curtains.<eos> Are they from Etsy? Let's move on.<eos> Now, Tom, what would you do if I put this in front of you?
She's much worse off than I thought.<eos> Okay, your father was sick.<eos> - His neck was infected.<eos> - So what?<eos> And we just wanted to make sure that he was better before you saw him.
But you love Liv.<eos> She's your sister.<eos> You don't know her like I know her!<eos> - I'm sorry. - Mm.<eos> I wish you would talk to me, tell me what this is all about with you two.
Look, just...<eos> Here.<eos> I-I just don't understand how you can tell everything to Olivia but nothing to me.<eos> Oh...<eos> I mean, what is it exactly with you and this sister that you never had?
Answer it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Patch me through to Webster.<eos> Call list is a mile long and growing.<eos> You want me to go over it with you now or...
He's here.<eos> Hello, Cyrus.<eos> It's Tuesday, it's 3:00, and I'm Fitzgerald Grant.<eos> That must mean you're watching "The Grant Report."<eos> President Reston is eager to meet with you.
Now, I'm not saying we're the perfect couple.<eos> No?<eos> We have our disagreements,<eos> - just like everybody else.<eos> - Come on. What could the two of you possibly disagree on?
We thought it was time for you to meet your benefactors.<eos> You're working for them?<eos> We're all working together.<eos> Theodore Peus.<eos> It's so nice to finally meet you.
Dad.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're free to eat as many of my croissants as you want.<eos> You can even walk around the building, Take in the grounds.<eos> But these two men will shadow you wherever you go.
All this would feel crazy either way, so, no, we shouldn't.<eos> This isn't the way I envisioned our last two weeks together.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> He'd like to see you.
I think you should have told me what a maid of honor has to do.<eos> Well, is it too much?<eos> No.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Now, I don't have too many more chances to stand up here in front of all you lovely people, and, well, avoid your questions.
Picture him in his underwear. It will help with the whole star-struck thing.<eos> I've met him before, Marcus.<eos> Not in the Oval, you haven't...<eos> Place puts a spell on people.<eos> She's been looking into one of your pardon petitions... Asked to have a word with you.
What?<eos> - Dust off, now!<eos> - Copy that.<eos> - Let's roll.<eos> - Is Amos with you?
I wish I was a doctor robot.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> So, your surgeon's down there turning me back into a broken man.<eos> He's just picking up pieces of a brain hemorrhage.<eos> The rest is up to you.
I heard.<eos> A bone doctor who diagnoses brain bleeds.<eos> You're a one-man band.<eos> Yeah. I forgot how much I enjoy the big picture, you know?<eos> Plus, you just put me in a great position to, um... keep my eye on you.
Delphine was alive when they took her away.<eos> I found your cure.<eos> You can shoot me up like old times.<eos> You won't be allowed to stay with her.<eos> Mr. Westmorland will see you now.
Just keep yourselves and particularly Helena the blonde under wraps for now.<eos> He's right.<eos> Think of our babies.<eos> Great!<eos> I'll talk to you guys soon, okay?
And you've told him, too?<eos> This isn't about me, Garland.<eos> Hell, there's a war on.<eos> Choose them both!<eos> I need to speak to you about Mr. D'Abberville.
You shouldn't have come back for me.<eos> Probably not.<eos> Lead the way, Mr. Garland.<eos> Miss Day?<eos> Miss Day, are you all right?
- Where's he going? - Marius?<eos> Whatever you want to call him, where's he taking that money?<eos> Now this is why I believe there is a deal to be made.<eos> - [sigh]<eos> - As I was saying, you are already facing a whole mess of charges, but you don't have to be.
White clam is on top.<eos> Thanks, Bruno.<eos> Say hello to my nephew, Marco.<eos> Kid just got elected to county executive up in Sandicot.<eos> I'm Marc. An honor to meet you, Mr. Axelrod.
Hey, you get me started, I'll admit I'm suspicious that not all prize fights are on the up and up, that Warren Buffett and Bill Gates may not really like each other as much as they claim.<eos> I'm even suspicious that maybe you don't really need those glasses to see.<eos> I do.<eos> I think you see pretty clearly.<eos> But those are all the suspicions that I'm prepared to share with you today in your professional capacity.
You wanted to know if I could see you, behind Mafee, see what you saw.<eos> I wanted to know if you're as good as they say.<eos> I am.<eos> So why are you leaving?<eos> I just wanted a moment with you.
More like turned away.<eos> But, yeah, he won't take me up on dinners out or drinks.<eos> But I'm guessing that's because of everything you did for his sister.<eos> Why else let a needy boy like you call all the shots when he could be doing so much better?<eos> Like being with you?
That's right.<eos> I got me two new phones.<eos> Well... only one with me.<eos> The other one is showing up where I planted it.<eos> Over there with you guys.
It's intended as a show of strength, but it only goes to show his weakness if he stoops to bully girls.<eos> Perhaps the worst is yet to come.<eos> What could be worse than killing my poor Richard?<eos> Lizzie, you must not speak of it.<eos> No one must know what has passed between the two of you.
With our help.<eos> He wishes us to set about his coronation.<eos> He thinks that we should do it now to show England that he is king alone, not joint ruler with the girl.<eos> He hasn't mentioned it to me.<eos> Margaret, in time, he will share all his confidences with you.
Your servants gone.<eos> Your orchard's plundered.<eos> There's nothing.<eos> And...<eos> The soldiers who were there, who came there to collect you, they were...
He was depressed.<eos> And he committed...<eos> Look, he took his own life.<eos> But that was a long time ago.<eos>  Did the Meyerist Movement do that to you?
Thank you for making the trip.<eos> I know how busy you must be.<eos> You can relax.<eos> I promise you.<eos> I just wanted to personally reach out and thank you for all of your help with the application for taxexempt status.
 We're recording.<eos>  There's so many like you that come to us, frozen by their actions.<eos> And that is why the exemption is so very important to us, Lisa.<eos> You understand?<eos> We want to be able to help others like we helped you, because what you did will never, ever go away.
But Chief Davis should not be given this promotion, ma'am.<eos> And you could change the way the Assistant Chief job functions.<eos> I could, but mostly jobs change us, not the other way around.<eos> And as far as my becoming Assistant Chief,<eos> I am the happiest I have ever been in my professional life with all of you, taking bad guys off the street.
I got nothing suspicious from up here.<eos> But if you do, go in low over it.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Let's not get too close.<eos> If you are holding anything, immediately put it on the ground beside you.
Alex knew you wouldn't okay a surgery if you knew...<eos> So she lied about the blood work?<eos> She's not in a coma because of the blood thinners.<eos> That doesn't matter, Maggie.<eos> 'Cause if she doesn't wake up... you and Alex... you're finished here.
Damn it!<eos> Hey. You're okay.<eos> Hey, I need some scissors and gauze, and somebody page this woman's doctor!<eos> Okay, Eunice, you have a post-op bleed that's constricting your airway.<eos> But you're gonna be fine.
Right.<eos> Can I bring anything?<eos> Ah, don't bring a thing.<eos> I'm gonna make my famous paella valenciana.<eos> We're looking forward to seeing you and your lovely wife on Saturday.
- How dare you?<eos> - No, he isn't.<eos> He's crying.<eos> Haha, what a fucking girl!<eos> Can I borrow you for a second, Miss Brookheimer?
I did not do this, absolutely, positively.<eos> Fine, I did it!<eos> But that's my job.<eos> I need to clear my head, because this whole campaign is not going the way I envisioned it.<eos> Oh, what did you envision, Woody, that you and Buzz Lightyear would win this election and Andy would play with you again?
You can do that, can't ya?<eos> Look...<eos> I'm already on administrative leave for shootin' that boy.<eos> Half salary.<eos> Hanson catch me talkin' to you, I'll be a rent-a-cop faster'n I can burn these hamburgers.
Hap.<eos> Leonard.<eos> What's up?<eos> Sorry to bother you at home, Miriam.<eos> Could we get a minute with you?
Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> I'm a constituent with a burning legal question for a public servant.<eos> After you killed me and Leonard's fathers, How much did your daddy have to pay to make it all go away?<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, but the past is the past.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm inclined to agree with you there.
I think we can finish up things around here.<eos> Illium moon was chester's associate, Not leonard.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> So, why haven't you?<eos> Because illium is afraid to talk to you.
Thank you.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> They're gonna hurt me.<eos> And why would they do that?<eos> I think they know that I'm talking to you.
Understand?<eos> Of course.<eos> My fellow citizens, we all saw something... Remarkable last night.<eos> Now, I know that there are a lot of rumors going around our bloc.<eos> What you witnessed was the test of a technology that you have never seen before, one capable of inter-dimensional travel.
Keep moving!<eos> Get in there.<eos> Get in!<eos> Governor-general, always good to see you.<eos> Proxy Alcala talk to you, hmm?
I'll tell you whatever.<eos> Please, you just have to protect me.<eos> Protect you from whom?<eos> Them.<eos> They'll kill me if they know I've even talked to you.
We have to wait to get a report from that apartment.<eos> - I need that pilot.<eos> - I'm not putting him out there unless I know we have some leverage.<eos> It is not your call.<eos> We have a sniper on you.
I don't know. Okay.<eos> Can you give me a name?<eos> The person who did it?<eos> - No, I don't know.<eos> - Was there anybody else - with you who could...
Am I going to have to break every bone in his body?<eos> It's not like that.<eos> You need to keep your eye on men.<eos> Men aren't where I keep my eye, actually.<eos> Imagine if time all happened at once... every moment of your life laid out around you... like a city.
- What did they say?<eos> - Next 24 hours should tell.<eos> Right, Bakewell.<eos> This is Detective Constable Morse.<eos> He's one of the officers who'll be keeping an eye on you, so don't give him any trouble.
- And this is your photographer, is it?<eos> For today.<eos> But the rest of the time, he works at the City Police.<eos> Detective Constable Morse.<eos> He tried to get onto the site to see you without success.
Hear me?<eos> I'll chop you some logs.<eos> I'm afraid I have no idea what Matthew would have wanted with a Geiger counter.<eos> Really?<eos> He never discussed it with you?
The SERT team leader woke up in the truck six miles away, has no idea how he got there.<eos> None of it makes any sense, including you arresting the captain.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Just going where the evidence takes us.<eos> Well, I'm glad it wasn't me who had to arrest him, but if you get a line on Burkhardt, tell him to turn himself in.
I'll get his files.<eos> Uh, don't you mean your files and your computer, sir?<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Could I have a word with you, Captain?
Open the door.<eos> You... you... you don't understand, it'll kill me!<eos> No-no-no, no, no-no-no-no.<eos> No, he'll come for me!<eos> He'll come for you!
What are you doing here?<eos> It's important that we talk, now that Bonaparte is dead, and you've killed your political career.<eos> Look, I told you. The Grimm was responsible.<eos> You also told us you can handle the Grimm.<eos> Instead he seems to have handled you quite well.
Like I told you, he's being protected by something very powerful.<eos> And that's the part I'm having a hard time understanding.<eos> Well, maybe you could understand this.<eos> I'm done taking orders,<eos> I'm done with Black Claw, and I'm done with you.
Uh, last night.<eos> Um, I went to see her at the lab around 11:00.<eos> Seems a little late for a visit.<eos> I needed her help on a project, and I couldn't sleep, so, well, I went to see her.<eos> Was she working on the project with you?
- Yes.<eos> Are you prepared for what I have to do?<eos> Why don't I have a look at your husband?<eos> That would be me.<eos> Actually, the truth is we called you 'cause we need to talk to you about something else.
It's okay.<eos> He's a Grimm, but he's a friend.<eos> A Grimm?<eos> That's better.<eos> He just wants to talk to you.
- What?<eos> Were you talking to Mrs. Stanton?<eos> Yes, do you know her?<eos> She's been a customer forever.<eos> - We should go with you.
It's not ours.<eos> I'm calling Nick.<eos> Hey, Monroe.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Eve isn't with you, is she?
We don't even know what kind of power this thing has or where it came from or what effect it's gonna have on you or us.<eos> It's the only option we've got, and we don't even know if it's gonna work.<eos> If it does, I'm going with you. - No.<eos> - Hey, man, we found that thing together.<eos> Monroe, we can't risk losing both of you.
Then you'll be glad to see I've broken with tradition.<eos> Sir Francis Basset is not glad.<eos> He's asked me to intervene.<eos> To invite you to step up and follow in their footsteps.<eos> He and you must know it's barely four years since I was on trial for wrecking, riot and assault.
Speaking for myself, my mind's set.<eos> We're here for Dr Enys and we'll not go home without him.<eos> 'Tis what we all signed up for.<eos> Can I ask men to take such a risk?<eos> Yet how much have I risked across the years, alongside you, knowin' I might lose all, risking' it anyway.
As I was saying to Miss Penvenen, you'll not find a kindlier man than Sir Hugh.<eos> He is generosity itself!<eos> It would be impossible to exist on so paltry a sum!<eos> Doubtless God will then guide your steps towards some amiable young heiress.<eos> Shall I put you down for 30 guineas?
Of nothing, sir.<eos> She merely answered my question about the nature of your marital relations.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> She's no right to discuss such matters with you!
But liberty, equality, fraternity -- these I can put my name to.<eos> Well, I have no intention of so doing.<eos> No, power must exist -- someone must possess it, and since man is not perfect, sometimes it is misused, but who is more likely to misuse it?<eos> The man who newly finds it in his grasp, like one who has never before tasted liquor?<eos> Or the man who by heredity, like you and I, has learnt to take it in his stride, who may taste the heady brew without becoming drunk on it?
But it will mend?<eos> So Dr Enys assures me.<eos> But where is Captain Poldark?<eos> Oh, he's hiding so he may avoid dancing.<eos> With you as a partner?
I told you, I don't even know her.<eos> I don't know anything about her.<eos> This is a disaster.<eos> Dr. Harris.<eos> The woman with the fishbone, I was told you're the surgeon to consult while she's in surgery?
I much prefer your style of leadership.<eos> Leadership?<eos> Unconditional positive regard.<eos> It's kind of your brand.<eos> Makes it easy to be real around you.
Hey, baby, how you feeling?<eos> I've been so worried about you.<eos> They called me after they found you in the elevator.<eos> Dr. Harris has been looking out for me.<eos> For both of you.
I'm not afraid of those guys.<eos> Montez and Doyle, they're trying to make Georgia more like America.<eos> Look, I saw your last election.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Well, I can't argue with you there, Murman.
- Oh, good.<eos> - Except for our politics.<eos> Okay.<eos> Minna?<eos> Minna, what is going on with you?
- Excuse us.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> What did you think of Nikolai?<eos> Can I be uncharacteristically blunt with you?
Just talk to me.<eos> When I was little, I turned on the tv. And saw you defending the black panthers.<eos> My dad said, "that's isaiah roth."<eos> With awe. Like there stands a great man.<eos> And I wanted to be you.
My client called her landlord 20 times over the course of two months, as you can see from her phone records.<eos> That's not proof of anything.<eos> It's proof your client spoke to mine for an average of two minutes per call, and it wasn't to talk about the weather.<eos> Your Honor, Mr. Grady gave me a copy of this nonsense 20 minutes ago, and he specifically agreed it wasn't relevant.<eos> That... that is a lie. Because I have a phone record of a two-minute call that I made to you ten minutes ago.
Well, I'm surprised.<eos> Usually, when Criminal Intelligence takes possession of evidence...<eos> No one ever sees it again, that's right.<eos> But...<eos> Winnie Davis is watching you - as closely as she is me. - ‭Mm-hmm.
As-salamu 'alaykum.<eos> Wa'alaykumu al-salaam.<eos> Come in.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> We wanted to talk to you about your husband.
Approach with caution, and be prepared to use necessary force, but suspect must be taken alive.<eos> Zero, Roger, wait out.<eos> As-salamu 'alaykum.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Means "peace be upon you."
Bullshit.<eos> Their name's not on any one of these documents.<eos> 'Cause they wanted to keep a low profile, but go ahead, pick up the phone.<eos> I'll call them myself.<eos> Then I guess I'll see you and your big law firm in court.
I'll book the chef.<eos> I assume from the fact that you called, you got our Christmas present.<eos> I didn't call you, I called Harvey Specter.<eos> Well, he called me.<eos> And I wanted to come have a little chat with you before you got it into your head that you could go behind my back and cut a deal without an admission of guilt.
Sure, where do I sign?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> $100 million is the biggest payout this company's ever made.<eos> No, it's not because I'm not taking it.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Yes, yes.<eos> Well, thank you, andy.<eos> And... and congratulations on your engagement.<eos> I knew you'd get around to it eventually.<eos> Here you go. This is about the most. Guilt-free dessert I've ever made.
She's on the move, captain.<eos> Very good.<eos> Bring everyone in carefully.<eos> We don't want to spook her.<eos> I'll meet you as agreed.
Chief, I would prefer it if you called. Before interrupting an active murder investigation.<eos> And I'd prefer if major crimes followed proper protocols. Dr. Morales is just helping...<eos> I'm not talking about him.<eos> Lieutenant tao asked for immediate access. To lapd's geofencing software,<eos> And there are a lot of people in line ahead of you.
With her girlfriend in 2015, and since joining instagram, She's taken up nature photography.<eos> Well, none of this is good enough for a warrant.<eos> We should pay karina a visit and find out.<eos> Why she left in such a hurry.<eos> I should go with you.
And another for the way back, and it weighed much less.<eos> By about 550 pounds.<eos> That's 100 pounds each for three bales of pot.<eos> And 250 pounds for felix, who you intended to leave behind.<eos> This murder was premeditated by both of you.
Let's talk about what happened beforehand.<eos> Now, you said that you were at work, late.<eos> And then you went to a bar, right?<eos> Now, do you remember anything unusual happening there?<eos> Anybody staring at you or watching you?
Yeah, so we're trying to come up with a timeline of where Quinn has been.<eos> We're gonna start with the night of the assault and then move backwards.<eos> - Okay, makes sense.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So Quinn told me that she had dinner with you and Tom the night of the assault.
Make the perp feel safe, empowered.<eos> Treat him with respect.<eos> It's all crap.<eos> I know it, you know it.<eos> Okay, then I'm gonna shoot you straight and tell you that you and I need to figure out something very fast before the SWAT team and before the FBI get here.
I don't know for how long.<eos> Kevin, you and Kenny are gonna partner up.<eos> He's up to speed on the case.<eos> - Hey, welcome aboard. - Welcome.<eos> Looking forward to working with you all.
We're talking about moving in together.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You'll find out.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Can we talk to you for a second?
No, I was in bed.<eos> Travis, Zoey's mom said the two of you were having problems.<eos> That's not true.<eos> We were gonna get married.<eos> Her mom said Zoey was breaking up with you.
You do not miss your lands in the north?<eos> Every day, Sire.<eos> Though I must admit, the flowers are much prettier here.<eos> Come to my apartments after my promenade.<eos> There is a matter that I wish to discuss with you.
Your Church and your God cannot condone a double adultery.<eos> Your continued relations with a married woman are incurring a debt, and the reckoning is not yet paid.<eos> I do not respond well to threats, Bishop.<eos> Neither does the Almighty.<eos> Sire, the Lord is speaking to you as he spoke to Elijah, in a still, small voice.
However...<eos> I thought you were in Italy.<eos> I was.<eos> But now, I am here, or rather, I am NOT here.<eos> Since my friend is meeting his new bride in Versailles, I thought I would press my advantage and NOT be here with you, which I am currently... doing.
I was.<eos> But now, I am here, or rather, I am NOT here.<eos> Since my friend is meeting his new bride in Versailles, I thought I would press my advantage and NOT be here with you, which I am currently... doing.<eos> I hope I'm making myself clear.<eos> I am NOT here because I wish to speak with you urgently concerning a confidential medical matter.
He set out from Marseille a few weeks ago.<eos> If he is gone, you must have chosen another.<eos> No, not yet. But as you know, cartloads of produce from the colonies arrive in Paris every day. If you think that by stopping us, you can stop the nobles from poisoning each other, then you're fooling yourself.<eos> We shall see.<eos> Imagine if you will, Sire, the lake before you to be an impregnable Dutch rampart and the hut beyond, their headquarters.
All murderers end up here.<eos> Murder!<eos> Whom did I murder?<eos> The Minister Reynaud and then his wife.<eos> Before I decide what to do with you, you're going to tell me where you acquired the poison.
The door is behind you.<eos> And if you see your mother, do thank her for the gift.<eos> Another reason to fumigate the Palace.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I wanted to discuss something you said to me the other day.
We are fumigating the Palace, Your Highness.<eos> And asphyxiating it's occupants.<eos> His Majesty's daughter is sick.<eos> And this is going to make her better?<eos> The King has asked me to inform you that he wishes you to hunt with him today.
Ariadne sent me.<eos> The answer is yes.<eos> I didn't ask a question.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> I wanted to meet you.
She fell off the wagon.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm very sorry to hear that.<eos> The way I put you on the spot about your decision...<eos> I owe you an apology.
What about his feelings? I promise you, I'll make sure he feels comfortable.<eos> I need to do this.<eos> All right.<eos> All right. I'll talk to April.<eos> Can I speak to you, lieutenant windham?
You heard back there.<eos> I believe most of it.<eos> If I said anything that may have offended you, I'm sorry...<eos> I was only trying...<eos> There's something I should share with you.
And lost control.<eos> Which is why we decided that you, grace, Wouldn't see her anymore. Right?<eos> Right.<eos> They're ready for mrs. Scott in ct.<eos> Okay, well, very nice to meet you, grace.
How's she doing?<eos> Which one?<eos> Grace, becca?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Mr. Scott, if there's a part of grace. That she didn't feel comfortable sharing with you before, Is it not at all possible to see anything that's happened here.
I need to put an IV in your leg.<eos> It'll only take a second.<eos> - Dr. Choi, what are you doing?<eos> - Putting in an IO.<eos> - Can I speak with you?
They said he was burned in the accident.<eos> His name is Rod Winter.<eos> His doctor is not available right now, but if you can wait in the waiting room...<eos> Mrs. Winter, hi, I'm Dr. Rhodes.<eos> I can speak with you about your husband.
This procedure...<eos> Is it an operation?<eos> No, an infusion.<eos> It can be done right here in the treatment room.<eos> I'll be with you the whole time.
Are you all right?<eos> I know this is a lot.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Mommy?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you sure you're okay?
You're the only one who said that.<eos> All the other doctors think I'm psychotic,<eos> But my mom's the one who's crazy.<eos> Dr. Reese?<eos> Could I speak to you for a second?
I know it.<eos> We can't let her go back.<eos> Slow down, dr. Reese.<eos> Dr. Baker just doesn't want to admit that she misdiagnosed her.<eos> You know what, I happen to agree with you.
I cannot afford that.<eos> I'm ending my treatments, at least for the time being.<eos> Well, I'm sorry that you feel like. You have to make that decision, but I trust your judgement.<eos> When you started your fellowship, I told you that you were not my first choice.<eos> After working with you these last months, I would like to say that I cannot imagine. A finer surgeon or person than you, dr.
It is, but you are an excellent candidate.<eos> So I'd like to give your heart a day to rest, and then we can get you on the schedule for tomorrow.<eos> If you say so, let's do it.<eos> Great.<eos> By the way, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- It's too dangerous.<eos> - Makes sense, although does seem a little bit unfair to Aida, considering how many lives she just saved.<eos> Okay.<eos> First of all, that thing is not a "she" ... it's a damn robot.<eos> And second of all, what's the matter with you two chuckleheads?
You put this in my head.<eos> Dr. Radcliffe knew the best way to keep you busy was to give you something to fight.<eos> - Something like you.<eos> - Yes, but this is the program's end.<eos> We're coding more, but we can't keep up with you.
I've been inside your brain.<eos> I know what you want, or, rather... whom.<eos> See?<eos> You do know.<eos> I've seen the closeness between you.
- during your last torture.<eos> - That... wasn't torture.<eos> That was a greeting.<eos> Now... the one who comes in this room next won't be me.<eos> The man who comes in here will do things to you... that I can't even watch.
My intent was ...<eos> was purely scientific.<eos> But, oh, the things I saw... it was expanding my brain and my reality ...<eos> - You're getting all Gollum-y again.<eos> - Well, that's ... that's what the Darkhold does to you ... it drives you mad.
- Well, that's ... that's what the Darkhold does to you ... it drives you mad.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should tell them where the book is.<eos> Let it drive them mad.<eos> I am the captain of this ship, and you are my prisoners.<eos> If you cooperate, you will be treated as welcomed guests.
You see?<eos> Yours is not the only life Agent Coulson has so easily tossed aside or hidden behind.<eos> This is what he does.<eos> Everything is his S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> The Government, behind you, Director, behind Nick Fury, Stark, all of it, stands Agent Coulson, quietly pursuing his alien agenda.
- I've been trying to reach them.<eos> - Yeah, me too. Comms have been wonky, going in and out.<eos> Jemma.<eos> Director Mace!<eos> We've been trying to reach you.
Horrible?<eos> Did something happen?<eos> Should I call someone?<eos> No, please don't call anyone.<eos> I-I just need to talk to you.
Where's Chris?<eos> You know, go ahead.<eos> Take me to him.<eos> 'Cause if not, I'm gonna find the<eos> Resistance and come after all of you.
My daughter looks up to you, and for what?<eos> So you can bring me out here on some wild goose chase?<eos> - Daisy was only trying to help.<eos> By taking me away from my kid?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you two?
And, uh... and... and today, the organization made a change in the coaching staff.<eos> And we are now moving in a new direction.<eos> And what direction is that?<eos> The opposite direction of the one we were moving in before.<eos> - Why are we talking to you?
What about you?<eos> No, no, it's all right.<eos> You go. Go! Run, run, run!<eos> Run, run!<eos> I'll be right behind you.
We'll have order, please.<eos> Mr. Gambel for the State?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> The accused stand charged with gender treachery, in violation of Romans, Chapter 1, Verse 26. By His word.<eos> And do you swear by His name that the report you have submitted is the truth entirely?
Please, please!<eos> Please, Mrs. Waterford.<eos> Please.<eos> Please!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Please, Mrs. Waterford.<eos> Please.<eos> Please!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Very good indeed.<eos> Starr?<eos> And... go.<eos> I told you already, Mr. Peterson, the answer is "no."<eos> I shouldn't even be meeting you right now.
Thank you, Ms. Pearson.<eos> Mr. Ross?<eos> I don't think I can add anything to that.<eos> I've made my case.<eos> I leave the choice to you.
Look at me.<eos> I'm not some personal injury lawyer, all right? I work at Pearson specter litt.<eos> I'm not gonna get worn down.<eos> So I suggest you just cut me a check.<eos> Save yourself the trouble of me wiping the floor with you in court.
Sir?<eos> - Are you alright?
Mr. Foley?<eos> Is your name Julia?<eos> Yes.<eos> He knows you.<eos> - Is he talking to you right now?
- Yes.<eos> - What is he saying?<eos> - Alight, alright!<eos> I will.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
He wants to talk to you.<eos> I can't hear him.<eos> Hello, Julia.<eos> How wonderful it is to see you again.<eos> I'm afraid I don't recall meeting you.
Let's meet back at the hotel later and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.<eos> I said I will.<eos> He wants to talk to you now.
I will.<eos> I will.<eos> I said I will.<eos> He wants to talk to you now.<eos> I'd much prefer to speak with you, Mr. Foley.
The classroom's so theoretical.<eos> I can't see the harm.<eos> Why not?<eos> Ah, the folly of youthful arrogance.<eos> We mocked you and the cheerful chipmunk that you worked with.
No.<eos> Everything that you've told me so far can be found in these documents.<eos> So if I'm to believe you are possessed by James Gillies, you'll have to tell me something that only James Gillies knows.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> He wants to speak to you again.
- My...<eos> - Your brain, Mr. Gillies.<eos> After you are executed, of course.<eos> Well I'm flattered.<eos> Something made you, Mr. Gillies.
One of which was your late husband.<eos> You still haven't - thanked me for that.<eos> - He was an innocent man...<eos> Who was getting in the way of you and the good detective's happiness.<eos> Now there's nothing between you and the man of your dreams.
When I pronounce you dead.<eos> Well you'll just have to wait because that won't be happening for some time.<eos> - Ask me why I want to live so badly.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I'm not done with you yet.
- Why?<eos> Because I'm not done with you yet.<eos> Aren't you curious as to why I've come back?<eos> Why have you?<eos> I'm not done with you yet.
Why have you?<eos> I'm not done with you yet.<eos> Julia...<eos> Julia?<eos> "I'm not done with you yet."
When I suggested you may lose someone, you assumed I meant your wife.<eos> - Who then?<eos> - You remember this little fella?<eos> Roland!<eos> I've been watching you, Detective.
- I want you to kill me.<eos> Kill you?<eos> Why?<eos> Look at me.<eos> What happened to you?
No, Mrs. Castillo is the Ambassador.<eos> Mr. Flores is her assistant.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No apologies are necessary.<eos> It is a pleasure to meet you.
Ambassador, gentlemen, please join us for some hors d'oeuvres.<eos> Thank you, dear.<eos> Shall we make our way, then?<eos> Please, after you.<eos> A pleasure to meet you, Offred.
Rita, could you check and see if we have any oranges?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I believe we do.<eos> Good.<eos> I hope we'll find other valuable resources to share with you as well.
I know that.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I...<eos> Can I stay here with you?
Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...<eos> We have some important guests tonight.<eos> Deputy Ambassador, Castillo, puedo presentar our Handmaid, Offred.<eos> It is a pleasure to meet you.
Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...<eos> Being in here is a privilege.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I stay here with you?
Another time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
To what do we owe this pleasure?<eos> I'm good, sir. Thank you.<eos> I hope I'm not interrupting your holiday.<eos> No, not in the slightest.<eos> The Commissioner asked me to come and see you.
Julie Matlock was a workaholic.<eos> If you ask me, it wasn't his wife.<eos> - Wasn't there an insurance payout?<eos> - Half a million and the husband was the beneficiary.<eos> Florence, looks like you and I need to pay Ian Matlock a visit.
You'll pay for this. .. you ushered her out of there, out of the restaurant.<eos> She's emotional, she's in no fit state to drive.<eos> And that's probably when you got a hold of the car keys.<eos> You get her into a cab.<eos> It's unsettling, but maybe you're thinking she'll calm down, she might sober up and realise it's all over between you.
Oh, well, of course.<eos> I mean, who else would I vote for, huh?<eos> - All the best for today.<eos> - The same to you, Peter.<eos> Whichever way it goes, I'd like to think that you and I - could work together.
When the reverend went back to his desk, she could have leaned out and stabbed him then.<eos> But I only went to him when I saw the blood on the floor.<eos> All right, thank you all very much indeed.<eos> I think we'll leave it there for now.<eos> And we'll try not to bother you again, but if you could just make sure the officer here has details of where you can be contacted on the off-chance that we might have to speak to you again.
Ah, the children.<eos> They're back for their lunch.<eos> - Ready, steady... hop up!<eos> - Lovely kids.<eos> Have they been with you long?
I was in the storeroom the whole time.<eos> Judith will vouch for me, won't you?<eos> I'm sure she will.<eos> Because, here's the thing.<eos> She was in cahoots with you.
Yeah. We were friends.<eos> Spent long weekends at his compound.<eos> Lawrence Boyd can be friend to no man.<eos> He's a venal beast of the first order.<eos> He needs to demonstrate that he is the alpha of the pack, needs to dominate you in his own mind by heaving his seed into your bride.
But don't fuck this one up for us, David.<eos> This is a murder investigation.<eos> She was 17, for God's sake.<eos> Next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.<eos> I admire you.
Let's go.<eos> Sarge.<eos> The list of Bentley associates and their last-known addresses.<eos> - You sent cars out?<eos> - Sergeant Harris thought you'd coordinate.
- Hello!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now all you bitches quiet down so my Muslim friend here can talk a little bit.<eos> Um... yeah.<eos> So we been talking, and we have a plan we'd like to run by all of you concerning the demands.
Of course, nobody knows what happens to you when you die, but I like to think that my husband is somewhere hot.<eos> Aunt Josephine, have you ever thought about moving somewhere else?<eos> Maybe if you lived far away from Lake Lachrymose,<eos> - you might feel better.<eos> - We'd go with you.
I thought you were guarding the waiter.<eos> I thought they were.<eos> - We thought he was!<eos> - So, nobody's guarding the waiter?<eos> We'll be keeping an eye on you.
He seems to have more authority than me!<eos> Well, do you have another plan? !<eos> We both know the alternative!<eos> If you're looking for Her Ladyship, she's out in the garden, having a walk.<eos> Actually, I wanted to talk to you.
Well, it can be altered.<eos> Or... ..until then, you could tie a thread around it. May I? You know, if you dig away, Bobby really is quite a good egg.<eos> Not to mention devilishly handsome.<eos> What I'm trying to say is, you could do worse.<eos> All considered, he is very lucky to have you.
Let's see if we can find Miss Windermere.<eos> I don't think that'll be necessary, sir.<eos> Miss Windermere, I'd like you to stop!<eos> Stop, Miss...!<eos> Are you all right, sir?
There's nowhere to hide, Jax.<eos> I know every nook and cranny on this ship.<eos> General Washington, as I live and breathe.<eos> Lieutenant General Cornwallis.<eos> I would've preferred to meet you on the field of battle.
- You're a white Martian?<eos> - I am not like them.<eos> You need to believe me.<eos> I spared you so you can rot in a cell for all eternity.<eos> This is Leslie Willis coming to you alive, and wired.
- No, we didn't. We're actually here on official business, Kara.<eos> I think it would be better if you waited outside while I talk with Ms. Luthor.<eos> No. I want her to stay.<eos> If it's okay.<eos> The police were sent some surveillance footage I wanted to ask you about.
Cadmus...<eos> Changed me, they tried to break me.<eos> But in the process, they made me dangerous.<eos> I know their weaknesses, and I'm here...<eos> To work with all of you to make our planet safer.
Anyway, we have to get...<eos> Son, you can't leave.<eos> We've searched the stars to find you.<eos> And we must get to know Kara as well.<eos> And I would love to know more about you.
- Ms. Strayd...<eos> - Needs our help. - Is an admitted con artist.<eos> - Her brother is in danger.<eos> Have you ever met this brother?<eos> Or could this possibly be just another con from a woman who knows how to play you?
That's lovely.<eos> Look, so, I don't wanna believe it, but I know it was you.<eos> You know what was us?<eos> You placed the bounty on Kara's life.<eos> Did you really think that if you had her killed that I was just going to change my mind and come back with you?
I can see why Kara loves you.<eos> Likewise.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Uh, Kara Danvers sent me to get you.
And that was a pretty nifty trick...<eos> Whoa! Go, go, go.<eos> Elevator, elevator.<eos> This way, this way, this way.<eos> Okay, well, it was nice knowing you.
When did your parents die?<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Sorry, works one day, not the other.<eos> Professional intuition.<eos> Of course, that's why they admire you so much.
But this needs to change.<eos> Your uncle put me in charge of you two. And you will listen and obey me.<eos> And I won't tolerate this.<eos> Àngel, if I ask you to come, you must come immediately.<eos> If we don't stick to these simple rules, I won't be able to continue with you.
I don't think it's that.<eos> Something more is bothering you.<eos> What is it?<eos> I know I'm a little tough, and you are not used to this. I know you went through a tough period.<eos> But I'm here now. And I won't abandon you.
Come on, let's go.<eos> No, I would prefer we talked about this in another place...<eos> Come on, get in it's all fine<eos> Come in.<eos> What's going on with you?
And have fun!<eos> I remember the first time I shitcanned someone!<eos> It tasted as sweet as the Mata Hari's armpits.<eos> Okay, you are logged in.<eos> So, this will track any equities you enter, moment-by-moment updates, newsfeed.
Paul, um, can you run this plate for me, please?<eos> Detective, an event like you went through yesterday, something that violent, it can call up trauma from past experiences.<eos> Are you aware of the support services available to you?<eos> I am.<eos> Because these things, they stay with you.
Because I saw her.<eos> Edie Soames.<eos> Hey.<eos> So John's not coming.<eos> I'm the one who texted you.
You're-you're bouncing around here.<eos> No. No, I'm not.<eos> No, it's all the same question.<eos> Why would he do it?<eos> His job was to befriend you, to stay close.
Was he blurry on that subject too?<eos> You're grasping, Detective.<eos> How do you know about Catherine?<eos> How do you even know her name?<eos> Cardinal wouldn't expose his home life to you.
Speaks to the kind of commander in chief he will be.<eos> Demonstrates what I call fearless wisdom.<eos> Someday soon, America needs to hear the full story of that day.<eos> Thank you for your time, General Brockhart.<eos> Glad to talk to you.
I appreciate that, LeAnn.<eos> We are fucked, Mr. President.<eos> Pardon my French.<eos> I don't care about your French.<eos> Why am I even talking to you?
Well, I'll start it at 4:00 p.m.<eos> Uh, as soon as I'm done,<eos> I'll anonymously send out a fix to the problem.<eos> - No. - Sir?<eos> LeAnn will contact you about when to send out the fix.
'But I still miss Oxford terribly.<eos> 'Thank you for sending me your rubbings from 'St Magnus's at Little Beckley. I wish I had been with you...'<eos> Mr Potts, erm, do you, erm, do you have a moment?<eos> Certainly.<eos> I have some friends who live in London who are working for a new organisation and they're very interested in meeting you.
That's what I been trying to say, pendeja.<eos> My daughter's still in there.<eos> To confirm, you were in prison with Judy King?<eos> Judy King was in prison with me.<eos> Miss Diaz, can we send a town car for you?
Is it fair to say you've been in love with her for almost 20 years?<eos> He was my first love.<eos> So you dumped Knox for St. Patrick?<eos> After all, he was your first love.<eos> And after she broke up with Knox, he became obsessed with both of you, starting following you? Yes.
She's got great tits too.<eos> I sit right down front.<eos> Here, listen to this.<eos> She recommended this book.<eos> "If you write about something that happened to you, you may reexperience some old emotions."
Sometime after 9.<eos> What was his reason for missing your dinner?<eos> Some bullshit about his bag, lost bag at the airport.<eos> Mr. Dennis McClaren said John Lakeman was with him the moments before his stabbing.<eos> You're saying John Lakeman was due to meet you immediately following that, and he failed to appear?
'What do you mean, "allowed"?<eos> ' It's a moral imperative.<eos> This is a murder machine.<eos> Beautiful, though, I mean, the whole place.<eos> You should be able to see a staircase...
Fleishman Cold Fusion Engine.<eos> All I've got to do is back the flow into the calorimeter and run.<eos> It's like it wants to get blown up.<eos> 'Hang on, I'm being thick.'<eos> I can come with you.
You're the parent.<eos> You're in charge!<eos> That's it!<eos> Do what I say!<eos> I control you!
But what about your business here?<eos> Our business is bankrupt.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> It is not your concern.<eos> - Let me come with you.
Captain Muller.<eos> Berlin Police.<eos> Is your husband at home?<eos> Good day, Herr Professor.<eos> It's an honor to meet you, though I regret the circumstances.
It's the United States Embassy.<eos> This way, please.<eos> Dr. and Mrs. Einstein. Thank you for coming in on such short notice.<eos> I'm Deputy Consul General Raymond Geist.<eos> It's a real honor to meet you both.
You'll never win. You saw what happened in dieppe.<eos> Sabine left your apartment two nights ago.<eos> With luggage and she hasn't been seen since.<eos> Answer the question.<eos> What happened was I told her I was gonna work with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I haven't...<eos> I haven't been feeling well myself.<eos> Go.<eos> I will speak with you after you return with the doctor.
Jacques rigaud.<eos> Has been arrested.<eos> How did you secure him so quickly?<eos> Some informants are best kept quiet.<eos> I am honoured to have worked with you.
If we think of entropy as Boltzmann does, as a measure of probability, well, then, the process is irreversible, because the number of possible configurations for the pencils outside of the box is nearly infinite, whereas there's only a handful of possibilities for the way they fit back in...<eos> I'm glad you enjoyed it.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me...<eos> Don't go.<eos> We don't have much time left in the term, and there are... things I want to talk to you about, like...
Together.<eos> And what of Marie?<eos> There is only you.<eos> Mileva...<eos> I cannot get lost with you.
Physics? Magnetism to be specific.<eos> You haven't told me your name.<eos> Marie Sklodowska.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Here before you sits a device which purports to synchronize clock towers across Switzerland...
I just received a letter from Stockholm.<eos> You are to be awarded the 1903 Nobel prize in physics for your contributions to the research of radiation phenomena.<eos> A hearty congratulations, Pierre.<eos> Will my wife be given the prize, as well?<eos> Pierre, we all know madame Curie has been a valuable assistant. But it's the tools you invented that are responsible for discovering radium.
He was too superstitious to have any baby stuff - in the house before the birth. - Mm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's a Jewish thing.<eos> Is having your cell turned off at a crucial moment a Jewish thing, too?<eos> No, it's a guy thing, but we're here for you.
We're just trying to figure out a proper visitation schedule until they get settled.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why didn't you just tell me that?<eos> I-I-I like mini golf.<eos> I could join you.
To overcome them, he must face them, pass through the inferno.<eos> Mezzanine, please.<eos> Mezzanine, sir.<eos> Good afternoon, Professor.<eos> Are you feeling all right?
Get onto the surveyors.<eos> Mr Greenhill, can you compromise at all?<eos> We will get access to that building.<eos> Maybe there's a bit of wiggle room.<eos> If you have one of our engineers with you...
I want to help you.<eos> To escape, of course.<eos> Who... Who is it?<eos> Um, your neighbor.<eos> Who's out there with you?
Kevin said it was an accident, but it wasn't.<eos> It's hardly the first time.<eos> And there's something else.<eos> Kevin says he wants to stop.<eos> Working with you.
I was just talking to my boys, very confused by time zones.<eos> That's Josh, that's Isaac.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - OK.<eos> I was asked to meet you.
My Lord, I'm Emma Banville.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> The hearing's tomorrow.<eos> Don't talk to me before then.<eos> The Simms family are talking to you.
We wait.<eos> Thank you for everything you did for my family, for looking after them so well.<eos> Yusef, I need to know what you're doing.<eos> You must know how risky it is being here.<eos> I'm breaking the law by even meeting you.
Who are the wankers who smashed my bike?<eos> - I don't know what you're on about.<eos> - Then I'll call the press.<eos> Boy, are they itching to talk to you, Tony.<eos> I'm not talking to you.
- Stay right there!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> I got a wife, I got a kid.<eos> Please just go.<eos> Not till you tell me what happened between you and Linda.
Is he OK?<eos> He's in hospital.<eos> Why didn't she come now?<eos> I'm afraid she had to go abroad.<eos> She asked me to talk to you on her behalf.
She was 15! In case you can't do the math, I was a kid back then, too.<eos> Just turned 17.<eos> So, if you're going to make me out like some kind of pervert, you can fuck off back to your cell!<eos> OK, OK, I believe you.<eos> Please, just tell me what was going on between you.
Attar's wife was told that Banville was no longer representing him.<eos> When?<eos> About four days ago at Sizemore.<eos> We actually got it on film.<eos> She asked me to talk to you on her behalf.
You're still missing someone.<eos> Who?<eos> The schoolgirl.<eos> Linda Simms.<eos> She was supposed to meet her boyfriend on the base that night. Instead, she ran into you.
Because if you were exposed... .. you and your bloody sinister cabal... .. do you think that the Blair Government would have won its vote to go to war?<eos> I want you to leave.<eos> Don't forget this.<eos> I suggest you take it to The Guardian.<eos> Because the police will just laugh at you.
Phil Simms has withdrawn his statement.<eos> He says he was intimidated by his brother.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Nothing puts Linda in the same place as this alleged meeting.<eos> Why am I even talking to you?
Maureen?<eos> '.. tonight's programme, Matthew Wild, the man everyone is saying could be...'<eos> Hello, Maureen, I'm Emma Banville.<eos> Why has she taken my breakfast?<eos> Erm... Can I talk to you?
What are you doing about it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I represent child killers, terrorists, rapists.<eos> I get shit through my letter box, I get bricks through the window.<eos> Have you noticed anyone following you or watching you?
I represent child killers, terrorists, rapists.<eos> I get shit through my letter box, I get bricks through the window.<eos> Have you noticed anyone following you or watching you?<eos> You mean, apart from the police?<eos> I'll deny ever saying this, but if you were surveilled that one time, that is no longer the case.
One died, one got away.<eos> I never went near the base.<eos> Linda's uncle, Phil Simms, swears he dropped you there.<eos> The only time I ever met Phil Simms was about six weeks ago, with Matthew.<eos> I agreed to meet you because Matthew and I admire your work.
What I don't understand and what I can't forgive you for is for Kevin.<eos> You knew he was innocent and you dragged him in and you destroyed him.<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> Going on about Linda Simms, making ridiculous accusations.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Kate Hirschber, will you do me the honor of being my wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> That is, uh, quite fortunate.<eos> Because I have already made arrangements how does Zurich sound?<eos> It's an honor to meet you, Professor Haber.
The move to Berlin was for you.<eos> I never wanted it.<eos> But what about the boys?<eos> You can't have everything, Albert.<eos> You have your kite with you?
It's not like he's gonna confess.<eos> So what are we gonna do now?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, listen, I want to see you at that next town hall.<eos> Or I'm coming for you.
Or I'm coming for you.<eos> Hey!<eos> How you doing?<eos> Remember, keep the faith!<eos> Bless you. Bless you, sister.
This is Taystee.<eos> Put her on speaker.<eos> Put her on speaker!<eos> Taystee.<eos> It was nice to meet you in person today.
This is bullshit!<eos> She's not thinking about us. She was protecting her boyfriend.<eos> No, it's not true.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey! Listen, all I can do is stand up here and tell you how I feel, all right?
No, I hate sloths!<eos> They only urinate and defecate once a week, and they have to do it in the same place every time.<eos> Huge Darwinian disadvantage.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I could go with you.
But...<eos> I just...<eos> I'm not gonna let anyone change my mind ever again.<eos> This is my decision.<eos> I want you to have her.
You've all been fed a bunch of lies.<eos> I mean, they wanna put labels on you, like crazy, psycho, deranged stalker.<eos> But we're not gonna let them do that, are we?<eos> Mmm-mmm.<eos> Because there is nothing wrong with you.
What if it's a grounder attack like they did with Murphy?<eos> What happened to them?<eos> The sickness. We lost more than 40 on the way.<eos> Luna?<eos> Please don't turn us away because of what I did to you.
Sergeant!<eos> What's happened?<eos> Look!<eos> Why would someone do that?<eos> Are you all right?
If you took the hand to protect Lady Ursula, why didn't you destroy it? Burn it?<eos> I didn't have time.<eos> Now, please, just leave me alone.<eos> Odd that you confessed only when they were about to arrest Lady Ursula.<eos> What hold does she have over you?
I gave Lucia a false alibi.<eos> It put her in the clear!<eos> Everyone believed Lucia when she pointed the finger at me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've never stopped thinking about what I did to you.
- Don't you think ICO was...<eos> - Now listen, Fred...<eos> - No, ICO is a real threat.<eos> - There's a lot of people waiting and I promised one question per person.<eos> It was great talking to you, and please don't forget to vote tomorrow.
But it's important that we let the committee do its job.<eos> So thanks for your call, Annie.<eos> Arthur Capo from Del Rey Beach, Hawaii.<eos> Arthur, how you doing?<eos> Why did they want to talk to you?
The first time I sat down with Doug, it was more of a confession than a conversation.<eos> He told me about his drinking, his past.<eos> He was completely open with me.<eos> I don't think we can rely on Craig Squire.<eos> Then why am I still talking to you?
Just one.<eos> I'm not sure I have any questions for you.<eos> Oh, don't be shy, Will.<eos> I mean, after all, this is a rare opportunity.<eos> Just between you and me.
Why?<eos> Do you really want me to answer that question, Will?<eos> - Because I'm not sure you do.<eos> - Oh, I do.<eos> Because they knew they could take advantage of you.
Because they knew they could take advantage of you.<eos> They saw it.<eos> - How's that, sir?<eos> - They felt it.<eos> Whatever happened to you overseas, there's no reason to feel guilty or ashamed.
I was looking forward to hearing what you had to say about Doug Stamper.<eos> Yeah, I was looking forward to saying it.<eos> I came here to thank you.<eos> I took it down... off the Internet.<eos> It's weird, talking to you about this.
It's never happened before in South Carolina.<eos> - Well, you have nothing to say about that?<eos> - Oh, I'm sure the numbers are wrong.<eos> Oh, you don't believe that for a second.<eos> I can't win with you.
How did you end up here?<eos> I wanted to be of service.<eos> You are your mother's son.<eos> She would've preferred I become a minister.<eos> I suspect she was proud of you nonetheless.
Bernard, it's your turn, go.<eos> And a far better father than I ever was.<eos> What about Eduard?<eos> I love Eduard as I love you.<eos> I wish I could've spent more time with both of you.
What's wrong with her?<eos> She's got ideas about me, like she's a fan or something.<eos> Well, give her a week, you'll cure her of that.<eos> - Bev, could you get Constable Hilmarson in here?<eos> You know no-one else will team up with you two.
Isn't that the definition...<eos> Don't dissemble, Pyke.<eos> You know. You know it is worse than that.<eos> - Did anything happen? - Um...<eos> Well, a while back, when she was 12, she got very excited about contacting you.
You, uh... they page you for this?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Yes. Um, but, uh...<eos> Well, I had a situation recently with a violent patient, and I'm still feeling a bit shaken.<eos> Well, I'll be in there with you.
Too late.<eos> - okay dokey.<eos> Madam President, don't let me take any more of your time.<eos> - It's always a pleasure.<eos> - It's always a tonic for me to see you.
So, I've been pulling out this entire time for nothing?<eos> Well, that has nothing...<eos> Oh, I am gonna save a fortune in morning-after pills.<eos> There are, like, three girls that owe me an abortion refund.<eos> Ladies, I am Danny Egan, and I will see you in the tomorrow.
- Okay, yes.<eos> Sherman Tanz on line one.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> Sherman, hello!<eos> I wanna give you some exciting news.
- I am all in on Jonah Ryan,<eos> - and I owe you one.<eos> Okay? - Yeah.<eos> - That was the fucking point, Sherman.<eos> - I'll talk to you soon.
- No, I won't--<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Shit.<eos> Let him go, if he passes out I won't be able to talk to you anymore.
Please show me how you do it.<eos> I've been like this for six centuries.<eos> The things that I know now you cannot imagine.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> Please, can I go with you?
- The past five.<eos> - Must've been tough.<eos> Especially when she spread the word about your affair.<eos> With a dental hygienist named Todd.<eos> Thanks to Cheryl's gossiping, your wife found out about Todd, then divorced you and took your kids to Virginia Beach.
Come with me if you wanna live!<eos> Georgina, can I call you back in a few minutes?<eos> I thought you cared about me and my business, Pete.<eos> - I do, Georgina, but...<eos> - Good. So, do you think there's any wiggle room on the price?
But Peter's horribly fastidious.<eos> He turns down all the candidates.<eos> Did he turn down Otto?<eos> I can't remember what he said about Otto.<eos> And Humphrey Maltravers seems keen on you.
Well, yeah.<eos> I mean, normally they do.<eos> But she's -- she's approached the court independently.<eos> That only happens in exceptional circumstances.<eos> What's happened between you two?
It's gonna be an acrimonious mess that will be on the public record for the rest of your lives.<eos> And your kids', too.<eos> So what can we do?<eos> Eve, you shouldn't have brought me here under false pretenses.<eos> But we could mediate. Just the pair of you and Sean.
Hang on a second.<eos> That is a bit rich.<eos> Your practice represented the testator and now the sole beneficiary of a highly contested will.<eos> Granted, the will was drafted by Dunbar and Calloway, but it's perfectly consistent with Ada's position.<eos> What am I doing talking to you?
This must be hell for the two women.<eos> We've got to keep things civilized for their sakes.<eos> Of course.<eos> Julie, we'd better get a move on.<eos> -Will I come with you?
What?<eos> Well, it's just that a judge is only really interested in the law.<eos> I mean, the fact that there are two children is unfortunately neither here nor there.<eos> But it's Corrine's Irish marriage certificate that predates yours by nine years. That's another thing.<eos> Julie, I have to be honest with you.
Chuck Rhoades, coming at me.<eos> You squared off with him, walked away unmarked.<eos> I need your playbook, I need to know how to beat him.<eos> Lawrence Boyd can be friend to no man.<eos> He needs to dominate you in his own mind by heaving his seed into your bride.
That coffee is terrible.<eos> How do you drink it?<eos> I close my eyes and think of England.<eos> When you close your eyes, I want you to think of me.<eos> Coming after you.
I would think that the president might have access to some numbers that we don't.<eos> When I get them, you'll get them.<eos> - We're worried.<eos> - Hang in there.<eos> I'll touch base with you after the three o'clock wave.
Yes, and let's see just how long this day lasts.<eos> Imagine my surprise when the NSA called me about Muhammed Kalabi just... moments before you did.<eos> Situation is still unfolding.<eos> On Election Day?<eos> Francis... it's been quite a journey working with you.
Tennessee.<eos> What the hell's going on in Tennessee?<eos> Muhammed Kalabi, the ICO guy from Syria who burned the effigy.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> I stand before you this evening as vice presidential candidate, as the First Lady of the United States, and most of all... as a citizen of this great country.
Do I really have to explain to you what will happen if you don't do this?<eos> I don't care if he loses.<eos> I'm not talking about the election.<eos> I'm talking about you.<eos> What will happen to you?
I do.<eos> Go on, lad.<eos> Just as we practiced.<eos> My name is Teddy, Your Grace.<eos> It is an honor to meet you, Your Grace.
We must each do what we can, my Lizzie.<eos> The midwife will consult with you.<eos> Take care, my Lizzie.<eos> I'll write.<eos> Bishop Morton wishes to speak with you about her care before we leave.
Once round the grounds then, before you sleep.<eos> Bring me Ned.<eos> What is it?<eos> To Francis Lovell.<eos> Lizzie wrote to you to meet her but both of us have been held here in Westminster against our wishes.
So, you know, then, that Henry's position is much stronger.<eos> There will be alliances, a betrothal for the Prince.<eos> And... Should we choose a French princess and make our peace with them?<eos> And France is the enemy on our doorstep, and so you would wage war on us with them.<eos> But if we are already fighting you, what difference does it make?
Stop!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> God.<eos> The French Secret Service didn't do a job as good as this.<eos> I'm not talking to any of you. No.
Hello.<eos> That doesn't get any worse.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello, and welcome!<eos> Welcome to The Grand Tour, which, once again, comes to you from the shores of Loch Ness in Scotland.
We're about to drop out.<eos> On my way.<eos> Okay, so we all know what we're doing?<eos> The Android and I pretend we're leaving the ship to head into the station, then double back to the hangar to monitor the airlock.<eos> I'm with you Two, here on the ship, waiting for company.
There.<eos> You're no longer broadcasting.<eos> Anya... she didn't have to sacrifice herself.<eos> Let's fall back to the Marauder.<eos> - We are not going with you. - What?
We're running out of time here.<eos> I know, we're...<eos> Life support took a hit.<eos> Oxygen is running out. We've got maybe 40 minutes left.<eos> We'll come get you before that happens, I promise.
So, you decide to take the deal?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Care to come with us and try to convince the others it's a mistake?<eos> I've already said my piece.<eos> It's up to you now.
Instead, they claimed they'd been set upon by a gang of thieves.<eos> Their dreams of serving the royal guard had ended, but at least their dignity was intact.<eos> One Eye, he eventually did come after me.<eos> They never found his body.<eos> I look forward to working with you, Teku.
Teku, have you come to do a little sparring?<eos> Swordplay is the one thing I cannot teach you, Heika.<eos> Where is Han-Shireikan?<eos> Off-world. She's meeting with General Caius.<eos> Respectfully, Misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your Generals.
Claim your independence, but do it without bloodshed.<eos> Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.<eos> And in what reality would a corporation even bother - negotiating with a colony?<eos> - In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.<eos> Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.
Warn us if they try.<eos> I'll stay here and back up the kid.<eos> The kid?<eos> Y-younger person.<eos> I'm coming with you.
And yet one of your fellow clansmen plotted to kill our beloved emperor.<eos> None of us had prior knowledge of his intentions.<eos> We'll see about that. You have no right to keep us here.<eos> We're following the emperor's orders.<eos> Are you questioning his right to rule over you?
Even if we could escape, where would we go?<eos> [Marcus] We got contacts in the outer colonies, the ones that have recently declared independence.<eos> And they'd help us?<eos> They already agreed to take you in.<eos> This is a new life for you and your people, one where no one has any power over you.
Our best bet is just to sit tight and let this play out.<eos> Wow, you are different.<eos> My portia would be beating the crap out of me right now for information.<eos> We... that was more of an observation than a suggestion.<eos> [Two] Who else came over with you on the marauder?
What's on rasnov-4?<eos> My cousin.<eos> Plus, it's in mikkei territory, so should be relatively safe for a while.<eos> You guys have to understand, I do have other clients out there.<eos> As much as I'd love to, I can't just be working with you exclusively.
He'll most likely head for their shuttle, so be ready.<eos> You can't kill him.<eos> If he attacks any of our men...<eos> He's not thinking straight. You saw it yourself.<eos> We've been cooperating with you.
- Not right now.<eos> Most of you have been coming here for years.<eos> Most of you know me, just as I know you and your families.<eos> We know each other too well for me to... preach.<eos> Instead, I will talk to you here.
I-It's not real.<eos> Would you even know?<eos> Mrs. Raven.<eos> Hello, Link.<eos> Father Romanov would like to talk to you.
My security detail can protect us.<eos> Thank you. That's very generous.<eos> We are all in this together now.<eos> I'm gonna check on Octavia before we go.<eos> Clarke, I'm going with you.
We are still formulating our case and reserve the right to more discovery.<eos> I don't know how it works up in New York, but down here in East Peck, we value our time.<eos> I find there is sufficient cause to charge the defendant, Larry Henderson, with first-degree murder.<eos> The court will set a trial date. And Ms. Keane,<eos> I will see you at the Rotary Club bake sale.
But, hey, I'm hopeful.<eos> Look, we don't want any trouble.<eos> Then you shouldn't have brought them with you.<eos> There's a hefty bounty on your heads ever since you escaped the mines.<eos> Every stalker with a rusty blade is after you.
No, no.<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Consider this offering an act of solidarity.<eos> We're with you.
Alex?<eos> Stand by.<eos> We're gonna suit up and come out.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Jim, I'm not going with you.
Come on.<eos> You'll need an escort out of the no-fly zone.<eos> Call when you're ready to launch.<eos> Prax. Go with them.<eos> No. I'm going with you.
It went dead.<eos> There's still a heat signature where it used to be, but it's all scattered and dissipating.<eos> I think someone blew it up.<eos> You gonna behave like a pack of animals?<eos> That's how I treat you!
Fine.<eos> Hey, remember us?<eos> The dust bunnies from before?<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I've been following you two around with a wet vac.
And on one fast ball, I swung backwards. Lefty. Right into his face.<eos> Was he wearing a mask?<eos> Yeah, that's why his head stayed on, but his jaw... shattered.<eos> Now, is that gonna come back and bite me?<eos> If you hadn't told me, could've ended your campaign, but I know how to spin it as a strong anti-bullying stance. By the time I'm finished with you, you'll be signing baseball bats every time you appear in public.
- What?<eos> - Here is your monthly allowance.<eos> - Okay. And what chores do you do around the house to deserve that?<eos> I show assholes the door.<eos> Well, regardless, I bid you both adieu.
I've never gotten a statement.<eos> Here's a statement... your investment is doing quite well.<eos> - Can you believe the nerve of him?<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> Ma'am, actually, I gotta talk to you.
- That's Brie Ramachandran with the world news.<eos> Boy, some scary moments there, I bet.<eos> - Frightening. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, that's all the time we have.<eos> We'll see you in the tomorrow.
- I'm gonna let them all go.<eos> - But, you know, I was very pleased to receive your call.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Why was that?<eos> Well, there have been some interesting developments in Sudan ever since that photo came out of you and the warlord.
This is not goodbye, okay?<eos> Not by a long shot.<eos> - Well, that's goodbye.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And we'll see you bright and early Monday morning when our own Brie Ramachandran is gonna take a look at the darker side of s'mores.
No, I'm bringing my jal alai instructor.<eos> - Female.<eos> - Ish.<eos> - What about your plus-one?<eos> - I work for you, I don't date you.
- So, we got the results back from the first testing of the new host pairing.<eos> Oh, good!<eos> And something interesting jumps out from the data, which is people say that you two don't have any chemistry, which is their words, not mine, but also mine.<eos> I've never not had chemistry with a woman.<eos> People like the energy that you and Jane had.
This is my wife, Alethia.<eos> Alethia?<eos> Is that her name or is that the pill you take to fuck her?<eos> - Alethia!<eos> - So nice to meet you, President Meyer.
- Hello, Mr. Walsh.<eos> I did not vote for you, but I do respect the office.<eos> Okay, well, you didn't have to say that, - but thank you very much.<eos> - I understand.<eos> You know what, I saw that Tom James being interviewed on the television about the two of you.
Quartie, President Meyer.<eos> You need to call me Selina.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - All right, Selina.<eos> It is so nice to see you south of the Mason-Dixon line without your campaign bus behind you.
- Excuse me.<eos> I tell you, if more people would've seen that side of you during the election, my God, you would've gotten their vote and you would've gotten mine.<eos> I think you probably would've won.<eos> Well, I'm telling you something,<eos> I wanna talk to you, Quartie, about the library that I'm planning now.
Yeah, easier than explaining yards after the catch to Steve Largent.<eos> If we do this, though, one rule... no McLintock.<eos> No shit. So, what do you think?<eos> The three Meyersketeers hang a shingle?<eos> I am gonna bid you farewell because this face belongs in broadcasting and I start a new gig tomorrow.
We will stop everything.<eos> I will withdraw the testing.<eos> I am begging you. You'll never see us ever again.<eos> - Hey, I know my wife put you in a complicated position, but I don't think you want anything else on your conscience.<eos> It must be so painful that your own son won't talk to you.
I am begging you. You'll never see us ever again.<eos> - Hey, I know my wife put you in a complicated position, but I don't think you want anything else on your conscience.<eos> It must be so painful that your own son won't talk to you.<eos> - Who the fuck do you think you are?<eos> I will crush you. - But he wants to talk to you now.
Mr Chambers!<eos> Mr Chambers!<eos> How long have I been asleep?<eos> 30 years.<eos> My name's Gracie and my mother sent me to look after you.
When he did, he told me.<eos> God listens to those who call to Him with favor.<eos> It was church talk for,<eos> "It's your fault for not praying hard enough."<eos> I'm glad he didn't come back with you.
Won't you, dagna?<eos> Franz and sabine are very nice to have you live here, Aren't they?<eos> Are you going to say thank you?<eos> Well.<eos> I will see you all tomorrow.
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna smoke out of the cock shell.<eos> Also, I want to try seafood for the first time, like shrimp or something.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Yes, and...<eos> I really, really, really want to watch the sunset with you guys preferably.
Yes, and just bring your smiles.<eos> Oh, and chips.<eos> Well, we already have ketchup.<eos> - No, bring chips...<eos> - Wait! I'm not done talking to you guys.
Do we wait until he puts a bullet in another little zombie boy's head?<eos> Let's not all forget that I work with the police.<eos> No one's getting rid of anyone.<eos> What we need is information.<eos> Now, he won't talk to the police, but I bet he'll talk to you.
Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well, Louise, you as a pillar of the party, it will be much appreciated if I can get your help tomorrow.<eos> And it'll just be you and me and a couple of your... female colleagues in the Senate.
Checking up on us, were you?<eos> They're right to be concerned if he's missing classes.<eos> I've been teaching him here at the farm.<eos> Home schooling.<eos> Mm. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Mia's postmortem.
Your young colleague had his eyes open.<eos> This man is in Pruszko as we speak.<eos> A civilian.<eos> But Untersturmfuhr Edsel clearly remembers seeing him in German uniform at your promotion party in Paris.<eos> And now, he has proof of a covert communication between you two.
No one's going anywhere in this storm.<eos> Then we wait for it to pass.<eos> When it does, there may not be anyone left to hunt for.<eos> Hunting for someone else to kill.<eos> What's the matter with you people?
Now I can't even think!<eos> Stop.<eos> You've come to the right place.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna figure out what's wrong with you.
Are you ready to let me help you, Charlie?<eos> Do you think you can trust me?<eos> No, Amos, I can't.<eos> Well, this is really disappointing!<eos> Because I'm stuck here until you do.
Well, let's take a look inside.<eos> Well, what if someone comes home?<eos> Or Shepherd could be expecting us to come here.<eos> It could be a trap.<eos> With you two... I'll take my chances.
- Hi.<eos> - The love of my life.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you were...<eos> It is such an honor to meet you, Mr. Riley.
Gord...<eos> If you're up for it, there's always a spot for you on my team.<eos> - Oh, that is...<eos> - That is very generous!<eos> I'm sure you'll hear from him.
I'm sorry I've been complaining so much lately. 'Cause I really enjoyed having you as my sidekicks this year.<eos> You have really great taste in music, by the way.<eos> I guess I'm just, um... I'm a little... overwhelmed.<eos> Not about meeting you guys...<eos> I can't wait to meet you guys.
You have really great taste in music, by the way.<eos> I guess I'm just, um... I'm a little... overwhelmed.<eos> Not about meeting you guys...<eos> I can't wait to meet you guys.<eos> I can't wait to meet you guys.
Oh, my God, it's Madonna!<eos> Wow, Madonna!<eos> Have you seen my daughter, Kate?<eos> This is actually... this is her birthday party.<eos> And I know she would love to meet you.
Yeah?<eos> Say "punani" again.<eos> Punani, punani, pun...<eos> Shut up.<eos> I don't have a lot of time, but I just wanted to chat with you about where you fit in here.
This happened a while ago.<eos> That's OK.<eos> What happened?<eos> I was walking home from college through the estate.<eos> What happened to you, Melanie?
They can't see you, can't hear you -- none of them know about who's going to watch the videos.<eos> Any resemble the man that attacked you, tell PC Nayar.<eos> OK.<eos> - Ready to start? - Mm-hm.<eos> Melanie, as we explained earlier, we're not allowed to stay in the room with you -- it has to be an officer unfamiliar with the suspect.
- Hana?<eos> - Yes, I'm fine.<eos> Thank you, Hana.<eos> Let me explain.<eos> Since we first interviewed you, certain things have become part of our working hypothesis regarding how Timothy Ifield met his death.
(No comment.)<eos> No comment.<eos> Item reference AS-24.<eos> The search detected an unregistered mobile phone.<eos> Unlocking of said phone provided a call history containing four calls between you and a number whose user we've been unable to identify.
Look, you know, you can do this voluntarily or we can do it the hard way.<eos> Right. I want him detained for forensics.<eos> And, James, you're in charge.<eos> Right, you lot.<eos> I'm with you.
I'm the SIO, Kevin, and I want to catch the bastard who killed<eos> Timothy Ifield.<eos> If there's a question mark hanging over a crucial piece of forensic evidence, I need to know.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I've got to work with you lot.
We were at law school together.<eos> Old mates.<eos> You socialised?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your wives socialise with you?
If you're interested, There are further examples of the same period. In the next room.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where can I find the abyssinian-ceramics collection?<eos> "I'm afraid it's out on loan."<eos> it's good to finally meet you.
And nothing traces back to us or faber.<eos> And we walk off into the sunset. With our former enemy who keeps his word. Because he's a man of principle.<eos> He'll come through.<eos> What time's the exchange?<eos> I'm coming with you.
My train's coming.<eos> If you let me board, you can leave here, these things you've been doing that make you sad, John.<eos> Whatever is burdening you.<eos> And go wherever else you'd like.<eos> And nothing that you did here will follow.
I'll put in extra time, happily.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> We can work around your schedule.<eos> Randy, whatever else you have going on with... life.<eos> I'm not interested in getting coffee with you, or talking to you about my life, but, uh... we need to step it up, and Shaft's mom isn't gonna get us there.
- You're lucky Dad's on the road.<eos> I'm not here to apologize to him.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - We need your help.<eos> We came to train with you, the Lumberjacksons.
What the hell?<eos> !<eos> So what's your adoption plan?<eos> With your mom?<eos> I'm not gonna talk to you about that.
Yeah, of course. Come on in.<eos> This is Lieutenant Kelly Severide, with CFD.<eos> Kelly's your donor.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Wow. I'm so glad to meet you.
- It was on the line!<eos> - No, that was in!<eos> I'm gonna tell them to take it down a notch.<eos> - Ah! - That was not in!<eos> Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?
Your sister-in-law, every bit as mad as you, harbors another pretender.<eos> We will deal with him as we did the last.<eos> My son, Richard, made me a promise when I sent him away to safety.<eos> He swore that he would avenge his brother.<eos> That vengeance is coming. And it is you, Margaret, who shall be dealt with.
I could watch everything that went on without having to involve myself.<eos> It was the first Christmas after your father died.<eos> Everyone was trying to make it as happy as it could be for you and your brother.<eos> You were so brave.<eos> From my hiding place, I watched when you and Teddy thought you were alone.
You know what I must do.<eos> And you must do it.<eos> If they have lied to you.<eos> Your Grace?<eos> Your uncle wishes to speak with you.
Go, Cathy.<eos> It's time.<eos> Take our son and claim sanctuary.<eos> Promise me you will win back your kingdom.<eos> I will come for you both when I have won.
All this time, I thought you were the petite Fleur tremblante.<eos> But now look at you.<eos> A blazing white rose.<eos> Be my eyes and ears?<eos> Cathy will stay here with you.
In the past.<eos> I like to think I'm a time traveler.<eos> I go back, back, back.<eos> But all I can do is... Watch.<eos> You see how unhealthy that is, this attachment between you.
I think you'll find the contents very interesting.<eos> Do you have a key, or...<eos> Just bang the wall. It'll pop out.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't think about leaving town, 'cause I will come after you, and I will find you.
I know what you're gonna say... You're proud of me.<eos> No.<eos> I was going to say never, ever do something that stupid again.<eos> But, wow, did it work in our favor.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Why would Captain Sham do something terrible to his closest friend?<eos> Good point, Poe.<eos> - He isn't Captain Sham.<eos> - He's Count Olaf.<eos> Baudelaires, I've been more than patient with you. I understand that losing your parents and your home has had an emotional effect, as I imagine it would have on many people.
I'm out.<eos> - We didn't bring any food.<eos> - No food?<eos> How in the world did you expect to live with me in this cave if you didn't bring any food?<eos> We didn't come here to live with you.
- Look.<eos> Lucky Smells Lumbermill.<eos> Aunt Josephine said it wasn't far.<eos> Come on. We don't have all day.<eos> What am I supposed to do with you?
Well, I'll admit the children's behavior did make me have second thoughts. But then I also had third thoughts, which are how empty my wallet and my heart are.<eos> I truly think that the Baudelaires can be an enormous, enormous fortune in my life.<eos> And so... as I used to say to my dearest friend, the late Josephine What's-her-name...<eos> - get in the car.<eos> - We're not going anywhere with you.
Lights out.<eos> Two seconds.<eos> But it's only six o'clock.<eos> Oh, boy, more time for dreaming.<eos> I'm Phil, and I am excited to work with you kids.
Trouble?<eos> I'm your partner.<eos> - I'm speaking to the Baudelaires.<eos> - Right.<eos> I took a chance on treating you like grown-ups.
Everybody's happy.<eos> God bless.<eos> No calls are being made!<eos> We'll deal with it in the morning.<eos> It was a pleasure doing business with you.
You made what family we had into fools.<eos> Katarina, the Witness can be saved.<eos> Please, it could already be too late.<eos> For your sake, I should hope we are.<eos> But the clocks might stop and history is rewritten before I should decide what to do with you.
Katarina, the Witness can be saved.<eos> Please, it could already be too late.<eos> For your sake, I should hope we are.<eos> But the clocks might stop and history is rewritten before I should decide what to do with you.<eos> But for now, Dr. Railly, you and I, we are going to stay in this room, together until the end of time.
Cole!<eos> Mother, her drawing, the statue!<eos> Mother!<eos> Take her back to 2046.<eos> What happened between you two?
Now it's time to swim in some deep waters.<eos> Tomorrow night, you're going to the Estate nightclub at The Scott hotel in Philadelphia to attend the post-rehearsal dinner party of a lovely young couple about to get married.<eos> You'll be assigned your mark amongst the wedding guests when you arrive.<eos> Your goal... to seduce them.<eos> You make them feel so comfortable they're willing to spend the night with you and wake up with them after.
Tomorrow night, you're going to the Estate nightclub at The Scott hotel in Philadelphia to attend the post-rehearsal dinner party of a lovely young couple about to get married.<eos> You'll be assigned your mark amongst the wedding guests when you arrive.<eos> Your goal... to seduce them.<eos> You make them feel so comfortable they're willing to spend the night with you and wake up with them after.<eos> Someone who falls asleep next to you is willing to show they're vulnerable, and a vulnerable mark will talk in ways no one you cold-bump into in a bar ever will.
You're pissed at me?<eos> I'm pissed at your assumption.<eos> I just... I thought you were different.<eos> No, you couldn't have thought I was that different, 'cause... you're here, trying to make this story end the way it did for you last time.<eos> You think I want something from you, and the only way I can get it - is to sleep with you.
- Can I keep it? - No.<eos> Bag it and log it.<eos> That's what I told him, detective.<eos> The roommate's calmed down.<eos> She's ready to talk to you.
You should've stuck with that.<eos> I just, thought you should hear.<eos> And I did.<eos> Nice guys are the worst.<eos> So, Sage was with you until 2:00 A.M.?
Seems like a reasonable concern.<eos> Sensitivity to our kind will come with time.<eos> Any updates on the Reid-tuttle murder case?<eos> We were hoping to interview some of your employees, people who knew the family. Of course.<eos> Detective Cavanaugh was here yesterday, but people will talk more freely to you.
- Previously on X Company...<eos> - You must be Sabine's father.<eos> Helene Bauer.<eos> I'm looking forward to meeting you.
He smiles like a bachelor, but he has a wife back home.<eos> Do you know the guest of honour?<eos> Yes, I'm a friend.<eos> Of the fabers.<eos> So nice to meet you.
But I'm sure there's a good reason.<eos> She is prone to headaches.<eos> Of course.<eos> I was so pleased when she said you'd be here tonight.<eos> I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Especially on evenings like this.<eos> My husband was a very good dancer.<eos> I'm sure I'm a bad substitute, But, the honour would be mine.<eos> You're a very good dancer.<eos> My elsa would have disagreed with you.
And your "ordeal" is over.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have the reichssicherheitsdienst outside if you'd care to come with me.<eos> Thank you, franz.<eos> I'll see you both shortly.
How bad do we want this?<eos> There is a way out now.<eos> When this party started, that wasn't true.<eos> Make no mistake... You choose to stay and you're choosing death.<eos> If that's your decision, I'm with you all the way.
- Oh, my God.<eos> You're--<eos> Just hoping the jackals and mongers will give you the time and space you need to settle in before they start feasting at your doorstep.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Robert, I know your dance card is full, but we have an appointment that I must insist you keep.
I can't wait.<eos> Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.<eos> It's been years since my last confession.<eos> What I tell you won't go any further, will it?<eos> Whatever you say is between you, me, and Almighty God.
Maybe so.<eos> Father!<eos> Ah, Bunty, how are you?<eos> Just peachy, thanks, Father.<eos> Um, Mrs M has something she'd like to discuss with you.
Actually, I'm glad you're here.<eos> I'd like to ask a favour.<eos> Wait there.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Father, I don't trust myself with it.
Please enjoy yourselves and thank you again.<eos> Hear, hear!<eos> Father Brown, thank you for coming.<eos> No, on the contrary, I was honoured and, erm... ..slightly bewildered at your invitation.<eos> May I speak to you for a moment?
An officer's on his way to take over the case.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Erm, I convinced Mrs Lesser to come forward.<eos> Oh.<eos> Then, I suppose I owe you...
Can't recall his name.<eos> Luckily for you, I'm not interested in dodgy watches today.<eos> Then how can I help you, Inspector?<eos> Looking for a present for Mrs Mallory?<eos> I want to talk to you about photographs.
You'll have the money by tomorrow.<eos> And may God forgive us... both.<eos> Now, another slice?<eos> No, no.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Father.
You're not going to allow this?<eos> With respect, Auntie Bridget, it's not his decision.<eos> I'll look after her, don't worry.<eos> Forgive me if I'm not reassured!<eos> All right, I will have to go with you.
Maurice isn't going to let you wander round his club for no good reason.<eos> Do you know anyone who needs a cleaner?<eos> As you can see, my references include the Montague family.<eos> Which begs the question, why do you want to work here.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Eric, I'm afraid we have some difficult news.<eos> We've looked at Brian's scans, and, unfortunately, Dr. Corridan was right.<eos> There's nothing that we can do for your son.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> We are here... because we wanted to talk to you about... donating your son's organs.
We are here to support you either way.<eos> All I know is... is when I lost my son... I just needed to find a little meaning in it.<eos> Where do I sign?<eos> This way to Caroline's room.<eos> Her parents are very eager to meet you, Dr. Avery.
Where do I sign?<eos> This way to Caroline's room.<eos> Her parents are very eager to meet you, Dr. Avery.<eos> This is Risa and Mary Hodges.<eos> Well, it's a pleasure to meet you both.
You're gonna have to buy something again.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - No, I'm an idiot.<eos> Felix came home from New York last night, right?<eos> Yeah, he's gonna be here after school, take you to Alison's, and I'll meet you guys after my test, yeah?
I can't.<eos> Please.<eos> Once you decide on a size, then we, got to start looking at 4K,<eos> HDR, Rec 2020...<eos> If you're going for that cinematic experience, I suggest the one that's in front of you, sir.
Roman is our best bet.<eos> We get him to talk, hopefully we'll get Patterson back.<eos> If she isn't already dead.<eos> Don't move.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Special Agent Patterson.
Got it, 465 Willets Point Boulevard, Queens.<eos> It's an auto shop that belongs to a woman named...<eos> Charly Evon.<eos> Right, let's bring her in.<eos> Ms. Kamal, I need to speak with you.
The valve replacement and the neuroblastoma debulking are happening around the same time, but I need to see both, so I'm moving one.<eos> O-kay.<eos> Oh, and this amputation's got to go...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I can help you, but, I mean, I have kids here.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I went down there.<eos> I talked to the D.A.<eos> I have to advise you, Dr. Karev, that talking to you without your lawyer present just isn't...
But... if you just want to tell me what it's about...<eos> Wait!<eos> You can't just go in!<eos> Mr. Kirby, I'm sorry.<eos> Can I talk to you?
Can you do that?<eos> Of course.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm sorry if I pushed.<eos> What's between you and Dr. Webber - is none of my business...
In 1949, Edward Murphy conducted a rocket-sled experiment to see how much pressure a human being could withstand.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I've organized the monthly rotation schedule, I got up to speed on all the upcoming general elective surgeries, and I have some ideas about which residents are ready for the next phase of Dr. Minnick's training.<eos> Um, I could run that by you, or...
We still need to run some tests, but it appears as though you are cancer-free.<eos> What's your name again?<eos> Hemostasis was established, and the patient was sent to post-op without complications.<eos> Dr. Webber?<eos> May I, uh... May I run something by you?
You're talking about Chris.<eos> You were told to leave.<eos> What happened?<eos> What happened to Cynthia? What is it?<eos> I can't discuss their conditions with you.
And?<eos> And you being here instead of there is a waste.<eos> I mean, also, it's your choice.<eos> It's also stubborn.<eos> Bailey spoke to you?
Everyone's behind you.<eos> Everyone was behind me.<eos> The longer Minnick's here, the more people like her.<eos> And the more people like her, then...<eos> Well, I'm behind you, then, so just...
Okay, what about this?<eos> Webber and Kepner explore the wound as Avery evaluates the burns to determine the need for more coverage.<eos> The other Avery can do a perineal evaluation, and after a full assessment, it'll become clear how to proceed.<eos> I jus...<eos> You know, Minnick said that we should work the problem with you.
Oh, my God!<eos> You're back!<eos> - Oh, actually...<eos> - Ahh! I'm so happy!<eos> Oh! Dr. Minnick's method is awesome, but I've really been wanting to do it with you.
Follow me and try to keep up.<eos> Lockhart, Deckler, Lee is the result of a merger of three mid-sized firms.<eos> We are now the largest civil litigator in the Midwest, and you are lucky to be here.<eos> As new associates, you can be fired at any time, and many of you will be.<eos> Look at the person next to you. They are your competitor.
- If we could cross-reference it...<eos> Wait.<eos> Go for Marissa.<eos> Yeah, I'll send him.<eos> Diane wants to talk to you.
Get back! Fuck the old way!<eos> No, hate, no speech!<eos> This way. Through here.<eos> - He's the hacker?<eos> - We think so. Why won't he talk to you two?
Are you her ex-lover?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm sorry, I can't hear you.<eos> Yes.<eos> And did she break up with you?
Yes.<eos> And did she break up with you?<eos> I would guess it was... mutual.<eos> You would guess.<eos> Since you're in a guessing mode, would you also guess that your whole testimony is an attempt by you to get back at the woman who broke up with you? !
I'm your client.<eos> - We're firing you. - You can't.<eos> - And I'm not firing you.<eos> - My firm.<eos> You're fired.
Okay, this seems like a whole sidebar, so we're gonna circle back to that.<eos> Um, who do you want as Joe's legal guardian?<eos> No, no, don't think.<eos> Just answer, okay?<eos> If something happens to both of you, who do you want to take care of Joe?
Okay.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> I'm going. Wait, you're going now?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm going with you to visit your dad.
We got the name of the patient in Syria.<eos> His family lives in Chicago and they won't talk to me.<eos> Why won't they talk to you?<eos> Okay, one second.<eos> Diane needs you to hold a second, and she wants to talk to you.
Unfortunately, I agree.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> This is not...<eos> No, no.<eos> I may agree with you on the spirit, but not the letter of the law.
I can ask. - No, uh, Marissa, wait.<eos> No... okay.<eos> Tell Adrian I need to talk to him.<eos> Can't seem to get him...<eos> Diane needs a word with you.
Then you can expect our filing.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wai...<eos> we did nothing wrong here.<eos> You're welcome to sue Lake Drive, but not us.<eos> No, we will be suing you, personally, Doctor.
- Okay.<eos> So how do we defend ourselves?<eos> We fight.<eos> It's a new civil rights.<eos> And I will march with you, my bros, until my dying breath.
- The episode he wrote.<eos> No, for the purpose of copyright, we wrote the episode.<eos> The studio and the network, we paid Mr. Fisk for a work for hire.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then let's discuss the episode you wrote.
America is being turned into a welfare state by all these stupid Neil Grosses.<eos> ♪ DumbNeilGross.<eos> Love seeing all the Neil Grosses in Ferguson, breaking windows to steal Nikes.<eos> Any relationship at all, to anybody...<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
Ada, no!<eos> Cancel!<eos> As the independent observer, this conversation is determined to be "not privileged."<eos> You're enjoying this.<eos> No, I'm working with you.
As far as I remember, yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, here's the problem...<eos> It would be easier if you would just tell us a problem before there is a problem.<eos> Your mother wasn't with you at these appointments.
No.<eos> Pardon me?<eos> Please...<eos> James...<eos> H-He doesn't want to be with you.
Miss Keane, I suggest you stick to the case you've got and stop bringing frivolous charges into this courtroom.<eos> - Yes, Your Honor. - Furthermore...<eos> I'm ruling that all evidence collected by Rutger Hiss pertaining to the death of Margaret Henderson is tainted, and, thus, is thrown out.<eos> Mr. Segal, you are free to go.<eos> Miss Keane, I'll meet you at the barn dance.
Ah.<eos> This is fun, isn't it? Isn't this fun?<eos> Hmm? Murder, suspects, clues.<eos> Gosh, it feels good to be back.<eos> Right, I'm going to call Candy a cab, and then you and I can get down to brass tacks, yes?
I begged him to quit, but no.<eos> My hubby's all about his work.<eos> He is?<eos> Oh, my God, it's "Detective this," and "Detective that."<eos> Working with you means so much to him.
- What song?<eos> - The song I hate almost as much as I hate these hypocrites, like God Johnson.<eos> Hypocrite?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I see some similarities between the two of you.
Yes.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna be done, sweetheart, in just a little...<eos> I want Froot Loops!<eos> You want Froot Loops?<eos> Have you asked the birth parents to stop contacting you?
No.<eos> I signed the papers, but I swear I didn't know what I was doing.<eos> What did you think you were signing, a car loan?<eos> You don't have to be sarcastic.<eos> Excuse me, but I'm speaking to you as an Attorney, as a favor, not as a best friend.
Well, then you were told wrong, and I'm happy to recommend some to you as well.<eos> I am sorry for your troubles, but I have no stake in this.<eos> You do now.<eos> They filed for custody this morning.<eos> And I find it hard to believe that it's a coincidence that it happened the day after they met with you.
The court... is not gonna forgive you, but... they are not gonna take him away.<eos> What will they do?<eos> Best-case scenario, you settle out of court.<eos> Find a compromise.<eos> The good news is, there's another woman in this who feels just like you do, who knows exactly where you're coming from.
- I don't know.<eos> But the fake fight's back on.<eos> So shut it, you bigmouthed bitch and your stupid sneakers!<eos> - If you don't like my shoes, you can just tell me. - Hi.<eos> Can I talk to you guys about something?
I know you're not asleep.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> No, Ingrid, you're fine.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.
- Oh, sorry.<eos> No, Ingrid, you're fine.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.<eos> I would be asleep if you would leave me alone.<eos> Why isn't she talking to you?
Hi, Captain.<eos> Hi, yeah, it's Candace.<eos> - Yes, I have Dr...<eos> - Dr. Grey.<eos> ...Dr. Grey here, she's asking to speak to you about landing the plane.
Thank you for keeping him alive.<eos> Of course.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Captain.<eos> Nice flying with you.
- Okay, slow down.<eos> I was...<eos> We were on our way to a medical conference.<eos> Pretty routine stuff, really.<eos> Certainly didn't expect to be sitting here in front of all of you.
That's a classic sign of bowel obstruction.<eos> You have something blocking your intestines.<eos> Something like what?<eos> Most common cause is a scar from your previous appendectomy.<eos> Or it could just be something you ate.
Oh, uh, Dr. Minnick?<eos> I think you're right about Ben Warren.<eos> Oh?<eos> Yeah, I saw something that may confirm your suspicions.<eos> I owe you an apology.
Marie.<eos> Dr. Shepherd was able to remove the entire tumor from the optic nerve.<eos> But we'll have to wait till he's awake to confirm his sight was restored.<eos> Oh, baby...<eos> I hope you enjoyed practicing medicine, 'cause after I'm done suing this place, you're all done.
Okay. Thank you.<eos> Bovie.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get her on a morphine drip.<eos> All right, you're gonna be all right.
No, that would be selfdefense.<eos> What's going on?<eos> They're coming up with a set of rules.<eos> No way I'm following what he comes up with.<eos> If you guys are leaving, I'd like to join you.
Something to drink?<eos> Uh...<eos> Nah, I'm good, thanks.<eos> All right.<eos> So how have things been between you two lately?
That's a lot of money!<eos> I told you we shouldn't go to that club.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> You're the one who said we should go.<eos> Man, I'm never going out with you guys again.
- What's up?<eos> - Do we need to leave?<eos> No.<eos> "The Vengabus" is coming.<eos> This was so much fun, you guys.
One of LAPD's real hidden assets.<eos> Detective Henry Cho, meet Detectives...<eos> Murtaugh and Riggs, in the flesh.<eos> Damn.<eos> I'm very thrilled to meet you guys.
We're not your watchdogs.<eos> What was that?<eos> What he meant was, we're not spies.<eos> We're thieves.<eos> Mr. Thawne, I need to speak with you!
Come on, look.<eos> I know this may sound crazy, but doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this world?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rory sold out the boss.<eos> To throw in with you losers.
Please.<eos> All units, report.<eos> I will kill you, I swear. I will kill you!<eos> Help! Help her!<eos> - I'll come back for you.
I'm sorry, but I have to know why they watch it like this.<eos> - What happened to Iran... - What happened to me in Iran?<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Is it the only thing that comes to mind?<eos> You were manipulated.
- It looks very nice, does not it? - Yes. I imagine that mobility is part of your criteria.<eos> No, I would rather rest a little.<eos> A little stability.<eos> Very good.<eos> The ball is on its roof. I would love to work with you.
With the excitement...<eos> That is to know me badly.<eos> I can be extremely excited and remain professional.<eos> If you have to throw it, we talk first.<eos> I have not been totally sincere with you.
Are you waiting for instructions?<eos> No, I do not know.<eos> - It no longer works for us.<eos> - I know.<eos> If you have been contacted, is because your cover is maintained.
- I can not tell.<eos> - Why do not they go to Baku?<eos> - They work for us.<eos> Leave a trail for counterintelligence services.<eos> While you are clean, there is nothing to miss.
That is, from the point B I am alone.<eos> I see myself with a superior official of the Islamic State. My escort will be at 500 meters, right?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> Your man will also be alone and about to betray.<eos> It runs as much risk as you.
Today they have killed Shahanah.<eos> It was a burning nail.<eos> It was a mistake to choose a guy as shady as an intermediary.<eos> Normally, the middlemen of terrorists are usually, right?<eos> I will not argue that here with you.
- Can I keep it?<eos> - Clear.<eos> A medal for a text that I have not written.<eos> But I could have written it.<eos> - I am proud of you.
- Thank you.<eos> - Whenever.<eos> - Good morning, Miss Loiseau. - Good Morning.<eos> Thanks for changing your mind.<eos> Excuse me, maybe I was a little rough with you.
A paranoid of my mine, a brainless.<eos> I have to go.<eos> She can not see us together.<eos> We have a hostage with you.<eos> We will not do anything for you until you are free.
- I have already registered at the entrance.<eos> - I know, sir.<eos> There are candy on the armrest.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> - I go up with you.
And for that I need support.<eos> I need information.<eos> Nadim El Bachir can provide me with useful information.<eos> Why are we interested in helping her?<eos> In my office I whole of things. I can share them with you.
Pretty good.<eos> Do you have news of your father?<eos> No.<eos> Do not they tell you anything?<eos> I mean, do not they give you regular news?
I'm here as counsel to Mrs. Wilkes.<eos> Her son, as you know, is my client.<eos> Mrs. Wilkes.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss, Mrs. Wilkes.<eos> It's an honor to meet you, Reverend Fitch.
I remember.<eos> I thought it was beautiful.<eos> The thing is, maybe it shouldn't be... difficult.<eos> To be content.<eos> With you, I don't find it difficult.
There is a war raging inside us.<eos> A war between the spirit and the flesh.<eos> We all feel that battle... ..that pull between our desires and our duties.<eos> But your inequities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you, that He will not hear.
Every right.<eos> As a leader of this church.<eos> You know what they call you, the other members of your church?<eos> They call you Uncle Tom.<eos> They smile and they shake your hand and then they laugh at you behind your back.
Russians got her first.<eos> She paid the price for my mistake.<eos> And I've spent the 15 years since then teaching hundreds of you not to follow in my footsteps.<eos> Exfiltration is a skill you'll be called upon to use, and it is never easy.<eos> For all the effort you make in... in turning an asset and getting them to work with you, getting that asset out when their job is done, or worse, when...
Yes, well, if you will go thinking for yourself...<eos> What do you want?<eos> I was given strict instructions to keep you at the university.<eos> - Who by?<eos> - You.
To protect a muddy little hillside, you doomed your whole world.<eos> One man.<eos> You think one man can save us all?<eos> Come and meet him.<eos> He came here to meet you.
Not you.<eos> OK, kids, pay attention.<eos> She slaughtered your legion.<eos> You slaughtered everything that she loves.<eos> Now you all have a choice.
Summer's the only person who can build it back up.<eos> And I cannot wait to tell everyone what an amazing father and loving husband you were.<eos> And the best part is, Carol Anne won't be able to touch her.<eos> Summer, we're putting you on the stand Monday.<eos> Larry, I have a few more things I want to go over with you.
No.<eos> I think we're good. You are in big trouble, young lady.<eos> You're not in an open relationship.<eos> You're so not in an open relationship that your husband hired a private investigator to find out what you were up to.<eos> Remember that civic you saw following you on a date with Jamie?
You're so not in an open relationship that your husband hired a private investigator to find out what you were up to.<eos> Remember that civic you saw following you on a date with Jamie?<eos> That was him.<eos> And it gets worse.<eos> Turns out your husband's P.I. Was following you the night of the murder.
If you've got any old shoes lying around your garden, bring them to his place, he'll turn them into hard cash!<eos> Well, no, no.<eos> The reward would be specifically for the pairing of the shoe in question.<eos> I don't want time wasters.<eos> I could have done with you this morning, David. I was sorting out my sock drawer.
Because someone helped you.<eos> Please!<eos> Don't take all this away from me.<eos> I'm not trying to take anything.<eos> But Sid is being held for a murder he didn't commit and I believe that it is connected to what happened to you.
You can go now, Father.<eos> Ah. Tea's up.<eos> Father?<eos> Father?<eos> Are you all right?
Bunty, no!<eos> Police!<eos> Stay down, Father!<eos> It's me he's after.<eos> Not you.
You're improperly dressed, soldier.<eos> Perhaps you should sew it on before you kill me.<eos> Drop it!<eos> You're under arrest for attempted murder.<eos> You're not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, and what you say will be taken down and may be given in evidence.
Drop it!<eos> You're under arrest for attempted murder.<eos> You're not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, and what you say will be taken down and may be given in evidence.<eos> I'll leave that in your capable hands.<eos> Are you all right?
Please, let me hold him.<eos> One last time.<eos> Please....<eos> Lydia Reese, you're under arrest for the murder of Giles Foster.<eos> You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but what you say will be written down and may be given in evidence.
They are.<eos> Chloroquine.<eos> He took them for malaria.<eos> Grace Kemp, I'm arresting you for the murder of Aldous Kemp.<eos> You're not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say may be taken in writing and given in evidence.
You are aware that withholding evidence is a criminal offence?<eos> Yes. Which is precisely why I came to alert you... after I had ministered to Grace Kemp.<eos> The atheist.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll deal with you later.
At the inn.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> He was my friend.<eos> If that's true, you have nothing to fear by confessing what happened between you.
Well, wouldn't you like to keep up with the fast-paced, modern times?<eos> We can discuss this later.<eos> We have soup to deliver.<eos> Sorry. I'm not expecting visitors.<eos> William, I don't think you're very well.
William, I don't think you're very well.<eos> But I have just the thing, so I'll come in and heat it up for you, shall I?<eos> It's really not necessary.<eos> I overslept, that's all.<eos> Well, I'm not going anywhere until I know that you're being properly looked after.
Well, maybe this was his revenge.<eos> Why take it out on Charlotte?<eos> I think we need to hear Mr Crimp's side of the story.<eos> I'm sorry, I promised William I'd go straight back to the hospital.<eos> Well, I'll go with you, Father.
Thank you.<eos> I can't even think straight right now.<eos> That's hardly surprising.<eos> And there is no rush.<eos> Charlotte, what happened to you?
Me, angry with HER?<eos> I thought she didn't want anything more to do with me.<eos> Let's get you some coffee and we'll go and see her.<eos> Sean Crimp, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of William Bayley.<eos> You're not obliged to say anything, but whatever you say may be taken down and given in evidence.
Not now!<eos> With respect, sir, you really need to see this.<eos> Just up here, sir.<eos> Don't you ever give up? Erm...<eos> Hoping to have a chat with you about Sean Crimp.
And keep calm.<eos> And if I'm not back by midnight, call the army!<eos> Well... whatever it is, it's gone.<eos> Oh... I'm really sorry I woke you, Father.<eos> I only wanted to make sure that you were all right.
Absolutely not!<eos> See?<eos> I told you it'd be over in a flash.<eos> That has been the longest journey of my life.<eos> Is Charlotte with you?
You are facing the gallows... ..for a piece of gold?<eos> I assure you, Father... I have no intention of standing on the gallows.<eos> Out!<eos> From now on you'll be on death watch.<eos> Two officers will be with you at all times, to stop you from doing yourself in before the main event.
She killed her husband and buried him in the garden.<eos> Don't listen to anything she...<eos> No!<eos> If you don't do what I say, they'll both be getting a lot more than a little bump on the head.<eos> He insisted on seeing you, sir.
He didn't kill Flynn Hardwick.<eos> His wife did.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> Well, if you send the police to his house, you'll find his body buried in the garden.<eos> Look, even if what you say were true, there is nothing that I can do.
In less enlightened times, prisoners were chained around this cesspool for days.<eos> Needless to say, they weren't permitted a lavatory break.<eos> This is where I leave you, Father.<eos> Um, no.<eos> I'm coming with you.
He's here.<eos> The door's open!<eos> Don't worry, this'll all be over soon enough.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> What happened to you?
Flambeau, you are not a murderer.<eos> But she is.<eos> Doesn't she deserve the death penalty?<eos> No-one has the right to take a life, least of all you.<eos> As much as I'd love to debate the ethics of capital punishment with you, Father, it appears I have to run.
That way.<eos> Goodfellow.<eos> Right, lads, take her down the station.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not going with you.
Do drink, Mrs M.<eos> Mrs Maguire...<eos> I don't know how to...<eos> There's no...<eos> There's no easy way of saying this so I'm going to be perfectly direct with you.
Hello, Anatoli.<eos> We're from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> In case you can't tell from our suits.<eos> We're sorry to disturb your lunch.<eos> We only want to talk to you for two or three minutes.
How did that go?<eos> Looks like she's, uh, rethinking a lot of things.<eos> including us.<eos> She doesn't like people being starved.<eos> She feels closer to you.
Everybody has problems.<eos> Do you think they're gonna make me queen of the Rodeo this year?<eos> Mr. Pirogov.<eos> We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> We wanted to talk with you about your work with Amtorg.
That's a cute kid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Might be a lot of opportunities for him in America one day.<eos> It's something we can talk about, if you're interested.<eos> Talking to you is not safe.
Thank you.<eos> Might be a lot of opportunities for him in America one day.<eos> It's something we can talk about, if you're interested.<eos> Talking to you is not safe.<eos> You're not being watched.
Anything on the greenhouse?<eos> Yes. We should have something within the week.<eos> All right.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I have to talk to you.
Do you mind if I have a go at it?<eos> Oh, yeah. Sure.<eos> Sure.<eos> Give me your best shot.<eos> Mr. Henderson, this is an e-mail that you sent your trainer/lover, Alfonso.
And if she is dead or in prison, she is no help to him.<eos> Do you see my problem?<eos> We wouldn't need much from you.<eos> What means "not much"?<eos> Well, an occasional question about how TASS works, maybe the name of an employee or two, who watches over you, if you know what I mean.
And I don't think it would be to frank.<eos> He would want revenge.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, Henry.<eos> Can I talk to you guys for a second?
He is really nice and friendly.<eos> Last time, when he came to United States, he, brought the gift for my boy.<eos> Hockey... shirt.<eos> My boy loves it.<eos> He visits you here?
The point is when you're walking in the dark you don't know the answer, but you have an instinct for how to move forward.<eos> The instinct is neither right or wrong.<eos> It just is.<eos> We're all machines.<eos> Say hello to the machine sitting next to you.
- Wow.<eos> - I know.<eos> We're going to miss you, Paige.<eos> You and Alice have been really... really good to me.<eos> Meeting you changed everything for me.
- Stan.<eos> - Dennis.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I tell him all about you.<eos> I was very much want to meet you.
Nice to meet you.<eos> I tell him all about you.<eos> I was very much want to meet you.<eos> You are my only American friends.<eos> And I want to share, uh, this happiness with you.
Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> I'm not yet used to it.<eos> But... it's... it's very good.<eos> He want to talk with you.
This is Lucy Preston.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Rufus took out the Lifeboat, didn't he?<eos> That's got to be the only reason he's not picking up his half dozen devices.<eos> Why would Rufus want to talk to you after everything that you've done to help Flynn?
You know what, I think you heard the lady.<eos> Hang out in the lobby if you want, grab yourself a coffee.<eos> But you can't stay here.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> You okay?
- Did they have a nice chat?<eos> - Sorry, Mr. Mason. - National security and all that.<eos> - Yes, well, obviously. That's why I'm asking you.<eos> What did Bruhl have to say to her?<eos> I'm not playing games with you today, I'm not in the mood.
And when I fell, not one person stood up for me.<eos> What does that say?<eos> I just think it's all over for me now.<eos> No, it's... It's not over.<eos> Look... I chose to partner with you. That...
Well...<eos> His loss.<eos> He won't be... sitting across from someone as charming as yourself this afternoon, will he?<eos> Well, I mean, you did come all the way here, so why don't you follow me?<eos> I'd follow you to the end of the Earth.
- Fine...<eos> Then give us the clock.<eos> - Why do you care?<eos> Fillory's on its last legs.<eos> Everything you've said tells me Ember is tired of the game.
The Prime Minister has declared a state of emergency in London.<eos> With supplies running low, humanitarian aid efforts are overwhelmed.<eos> You'll like it here.<eos> Following mass breakouts in migrant camps...<eos> Mr. Leigh, she's ready to see you, now.
- Anyway, till such time as we dig a new well, personal hygiene is baby wipes and blue foam.<eos> - What's blue foam?<eos> - Grab your tackle. Turn around.<eos> This will help with the headaches till you adjust to the oxygen mix up here.<eos> And this guy... will help us keep track of you.
You just painted a big, fat target on your back.<eos> The people these terrorists have hunted, well, they're a vicious lot.<eos> They could take out everyone in a locked room as if they were never there, and you've just said,<eos> "Hello, mates.<eos> I'm the only thing standing between you and freedom."
If it'd make it easier for you, I can do that.<eos> No.<eos> No, this is bullshit.<eos> This is harassment.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Jess.<eos> - No, just go.<eos> It's all you ever do anyways, and you know, it used to make me really sad, but I don't really care anymore, because when you're around, everything really sucks.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, Jess.<eos> What the hell is happening between you two?
Do yourself a favor... leave, before I call the cops.<eos> You're denying knowing Raymond Thorpe?<eos> I never heard that name before in my life.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll admit a search of your home yielded no evidence of a link between you and Thorpe, or you might just be good at hiding it.
Young man, what is your secret?<eos> - I carried the two in my head.<eos> - Well, congratulations... You could kill anybody in this town and get away with it.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'm done with you.
That just gave me chills.<eos> Now, finish with a smile.<eos> Man, that caramel-over-the-apple thing makes me think he may not have done it.<eos> Counselor, I'd like to pass on some advice.<eos> What is going on with you?

- No. The child that grows in the womb of the High King's wife.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Highness?<eos> You've offended the ambassador.<eos> He will no longer bargain with you.
Sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're done here.<eos> So you're going to let us go?<eos> Well, I asked the boss what he wanted us to do with you, but he answered in the form of a riddle.
Oh, no.<eos> Devin got pink eyes.<eos> I'm Ted Murphy, inventor of Smoke Cutter.<eos> - Mm. - Welcome aboard.<eos> Thank you, nice to meet you, sir.
The bishop was in battle with king aelle.<eos> Dear god.<eos> His grace is certainly closer to god right now than to you, prince aethelwulf.<eos> Put him down.<eos> Who did this to you?
I don't know what to think, Sire.<eos> I'm too bound in grief right now.<eos> You understand the weight that falls upon your shoulders in my absence?<eos> Trust your advisors, keep your own counsel., hide your true feelings.<eos> Good day, Madame. Make me proud of you.
It takes two to tango.<eos> Motherfucker said "we."<eos> You ain't French, motherfucker.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> All right, so... I wanted to talk to you about this Clash of the Cupcakes thing.
He is alert and in good spirits.<eos> That doesn't sound like Severide.<eos> He also said do not let Capp sleep in his bed.<eos> He sounds fine to me.<eos> Hey, Chief, I was hoping to run something by you.
Come on in.<eos> Custody battles are never pretty.<eos> I'm telling you now there will be a time when you look back and think this was one of the easy parts.<eos> Great.<eos> Now, you told me Mr. Keyes didn't show up to the initial meeting that you and DCFS arranged between him and Louie, correct?
And my sister Tracy and her family.<eos> They live down the block from my parents.<eos> My Uncle Charles wanted to come too, but I thought that might be overkill.<eos> Andre.<eos> Look, I... I've seen you with him.
That's not what I'm doing.<eos> Who doesn't enjoy their birthday?<eos> Or at least allow the people close to them to celebrate it?<eos> Everyone can do whatever they want.<eos> Just not with you?
- Welcome back! - Lagertha!<eos> Today marks a new dawn for kattegat.<eos> For all of us.<eos> We do not know king ragnar's fate, or whether he will ever return.<eos> You have not been ruled properly for a long time, and many things have been neglected.
I know very well what happened to Kattegat, Lagertha.<eos> I was born here and I grew up here.<eos> We are going to raise an army to invade England and avenge the death of our father.<eos> Will you come with us?<eos> Would you really want me to come with you?
And farewell, Bishop Edmund.<eos> My dear vintner.<eos> May God bless you and keep you.<eos> I am going nowhere, Sire.<eos> I am staying here with you.
Now, how should I, a bishop of God's holy church, abandon him now?<eos> Besides, the cellars are still stocked with some of the finest wines in Christendom.<eos> Am I supposed to leave them to the pagans? Who don't know the difference between one grape and another?<eos> Let's go!<eos> May God be with you all!
Such charity is misplaced.<eos> Sinners must pay their own debts.<eos> The Church has no such place.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I have authority over all France. That includes you.
We're here for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know you didn't mean to hurt me.<eos> I took it too far.<eos> What's wrong with you people?
Not that things are gonna go south, all right?<eos> Usually our plans go north.<eos> But if they do, wouldn't it be nice to have an extra guy with a gun on our side, right?<eos> Here.<eos> You know what, I should be going in there with you guys.
Nope, still smells the same.<eos> I'm sorry that I doubted you, but you did drive off with the guy that we were chasing.<eos> Had to.<eos> I saw he was about to get away, so I tricked him into thinking I was on his side. It's crazy how good I am at your job.<eos> Look, I owe you both an apology.
- Just listen.<eos> Look, I'm calling about the agent you put up to run the DC office.<eos> He's the best I've got.<eos> I think it's a little premature for him to be a candidate.<eos> He should spend some more time with you in New York before taking over an office of his own.
How can I help you?<eos> By being honest.<eos> A dead man is found in my car, I am found with the gun.<eos> I do not know how this happened.<eos> I am being honest with you, Chief Inspector.
Hey, want to meet my family?<eos> These are my brothers.<eos> Actually, one of them is my dad, I'm not sure which.<eos> Probably the gray-haired one with the whiskey-face sunburn?<eos> Oh, it's an honor to meet you, sir.
While we wait on our sketches, I've got another one of the first class passengers coming to the station later, you free?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm going to a party with my boyfriend, and I absolutely can't miss it.<eos> So, Mr. Edsall...<eos> Ms. Kupps met with you about the Paris flight? Yeah.
Then he's already cleared?<eos> Mr. Chen signed off on him last night.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Jenkins.<eos> Looking forward to flying with you, Mr. Jintao.
I'm sorry to get you involved in all of this.<eos> These men, they're holding my friends hostage, and I... I didn't have a choice.<eos> I suppose it's my fault for wanting to believe you were really a fan.<eos> No, I am a fan.<eos> I think what you do is amazing.
Alison in her craft room.<eos> Oh, Sarah, wouldn't you like to go home?<eos> Rachel is offering everything that's been taken from you.<eos> So... is Sarah Manning finally ready... to behave?<eos> The Board is assembling for you at one pm, Ma'am.
OK, before your CAT Scan, are you familiar with an amniocentesis?<eos> - Needle.<eos> - Uh, is that medically necessary?<eos> I'll explain everything to your wife, Mr. Hendrix.<eos> Our staff would like to talk to you about her accident.
Jay and Erin.<eos> Kevin, you're with Adam.<eos> Al, you got Burgess.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's good to be working with you, Detective... or Al.
Do we bring that future about?<eos> That would seem to be the most obvious conclusion.<eos> No.<eos> I say, no.<eos> Friend, I will not fight you.
Probably isn't good enough!<eos> Probably is all you've got.<eos> It's your planet - I can't just give it away.<eos> You know what, sir?<eos> Finally, you've said something I agree with.
Four minutes.<eos> Doctor, you still there?<eos> There's no way of stopping the lab venting, so I'm going to sterilise the building by blowing it up.<eos> Everything in here will be destroyed.<eos> Including you?
My madman in a box.<eos> My Doctor.<eos> Your missus wouldn't approve.<eos> - How the hell did you get here?<eos> - Followed you from Darillium, on the explicit orders of your late wife, River Song.
The simulations have been run.<eos> The Earth will be ours.<eos> Well, consider this a warning on the eve of war.<eos> I AM the Doctor.<eos> I am what stands between you and them.
No, no, no, no!<eos> You don't understand!<eos> This creature is no threat!<eos> He may look like a monster to you...<eos> I wasn't talking to you.
Look at that face, he's having an emotion!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, look at that bit, yeah, he's doing emotions.<eos> - Oh, leave him alone!<eos> - Can I take a selfie with you?
Hello.<eos> Hello, ordinary person.<eos> Please maintain a minimum separation of three feet.<eos> I'm really trying not to kill anyone today, but it would be tremendously helpful if your major arteries were out of reach.<eos> I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
Please maintain a minimum separation of three feet.<eos> I'm really trying not to kill anyone today, but it would be tremendously helpful if your major arteries were out of reach.<eos> I have been so looking forward to meeting you.<eos> Right, I'm very happy for you.<eos> I was watching you on the screen, it took me a while to work out who you were.

I'm never going to believe you're really dead.<eos> Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.<eos> Until then.<eos> It's a big universe.<eos> But I hope I see you again.
Snow on the Drake Barrier Reef.<eos> First time in 50 years.<eos> That weather report aligns perfectly with the Papia Prophecy.<eos> A shift in currents may present a pathway to Atlantis, lost city under the sea!<eos> This is because some children made fun of you, isn't it?
Brilliant!<eos> Oh, and then you swung me out and pulled up just in time and<eos> You kids are nothing but trouble!<eos> Curse me kilts, have I missed trouble!<eos> I suppose I'll have to keep an eye on you to teach you how to get into trouble properly.
Your majesties, welcome to Loria.<eos> You kidnapped our castle?<eos> I'll put it back, as soon as you come around to my offer.<eos> So many hostages.<eos> I wouldn't try anything if I were you.
You've been selling illegal Canadian maple syrup to The Crescent Moon Cafe in Greenpoint, as well as a number of other places, I'm sure.<eos> We just confiscated a few hundred barrels of the stuff at your stash house in Queens.<eos> On top of that, there are several outstanding warrants for your arrest from your days as a member of the Shoreline 99s.<eos> When all is said and done, you're looking at some pretty serious jail time.<eos> The dark cloud that you find yourself under does, however, have a silver lining...?
- Sandy Coleman. - I'll take that.<eos> So, yeah...<eos> The Scratching Post is under new management.<eos> Now, it's likely some of you heard how a couple members of the old regime were, um, terminated without notice.<eos> But, uh, let me tell you this, as long as you keep this operation as clean and tight as this roll up, you will be fine.
Somewhere in Queens?<eos> - I don't have the address.<eos> - I do. Great. Let's go.<eos> _ Hey, Gloria, it's Detective Carisi.<eos> Gloria, we need to talk to you now.
I love these... things.<eos> Yeah, our son?<eos> Why would you bring that non-horse into this?<eos> I was just gonna go for a ride.<eos> Mind if I join you?
Horses it is.<eos> Giddyup.<eos> Ooh, not really. No.<eos> I must say, your Trakehner is beautiful.<eos> You two really have great chemistry.
Done.<eos> And we have to be in school in 5 minutes.<eos> You said it wouldn't take all night.<eos> Ah, that's another thing I do.<eos> I am never honest with you.
You know, the nature of triggers is just so random.<eos> They come out of nowhere.<eos> I mean, who knows what might've set him off?<eos> I haven't spoken to Jon in three years, since our divorce.<eos> Did he divorce you?
I heard four gunshots when I got to my car.<eos> I turned around and saw a motorcycle speeding toward me.<eos> Was there anything in particular you noticed about the motorcycle?<eos> I saw an orange flash on the front windscreen... a sticker of some sort.<eos> In your time at Cook County State's Attorney's Office, have you and I worked together?
- Okay, I just wanted to make sure.<eos> I mean, it's awesome if we are.<eos> Detective Roger Murtaugh?<eos> Hey, Luke Barton.<eos> It's nice to meet you and thank you, both of you, for coming down to our annual fund-raiser.
'Cause you don't have one of your own?<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> Now you're just trying to charm me.<eos> Look at you, camped outside of my house, doing this, trying to scare me a little.<eos> You know, if I think about it, I'd say that you and I, we're not that different.
So, here's how this happened.<eos> The well-respected captain couldn't let bygones be bygones when confronting the recently released inmate who he had sent away years earlier.<eos> He risked his career to get rid of him once.<eos> He decides to do it again, but this time things don't go quite his way.<eos> Luckily, I was on to him and you, and came to save you.
We're two letters over.<eos> So we look here, "without hospital".<eos> Now, in terms of letters, what could "hospital" be?<eos> - H? - Yeah, but we need two letters, remember.<eos> If you were to have an accident, if I'd shot you here in the dark...
It's all right, because I thought something like this might happen.<eos> So when we arrived last night, I went out and I made a little film.<eos> Thank God for that. What was it?<eos> - Well, let's just... - We'll cover this up.<eos> I'd like to talk to you now--
- Harry.<eos> - Shut up, Alabama.<eos> You're gonna be next.<eos> Okay, yeah, so... I'm undercover at The Farm, but no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> There's a twist, because I'm not just training alongside you.
Sir, that was the university welfare officer.<eos> Apparently Esther had reported a case of sexual harassment... against Oliver Wolf.<eos> It comes with the territory, the odd flirtation.<eos> Nothing more than that.<eos> What exactly happened between you?
If you ask any Marine, the reason we fought was to make sure we all got to come home, and we fought for the memories of those who didn't.<eos> Doc Campbell, from all the men of the 8113 and the countless Marines you've helped, our sincerest thank you.<eos> I appreciate this honor, and it is an honor, but the real praise goes out to all the strong men and women who continue to fight long after we've come home.<eos> It's those soldiers that we are indebted to, and we remember them every day.<eos> It has been the privilege of my life to serve with you.
- Attention to the award.<eos> - The Naval Attaché to the United States Embassy in Berlin and the President of the United States take pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Senior Chief Petty Officer Kevin Campbell.<eos> I appreciate this honor, and it is an honor... but the real praise goes out to all the strong men and women who continue to fight long after we've come home.<eos> It's those soldiers that we are indebted to, and we remember them every day.<eos> It has been the privilege of my life to serve with you.
It's Mario Hunt.<eos> Landed up in Otisville, where he took over his gang.<eos> Where he feels free to stonewall us.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> He put out word he'd take a sit-down with you... and only you.
We're looking at him in connection with a double homicide.<eos> Surprised to hear that.<eos> Ronald seemed determined to turn his life around.<eos> The leader of the ADT street gang, and his driver, were murdered yesterday.<eos> Ronald says he was here with you at the time of the murder.
Looked like he had a folder with him.<eos> And how had things been with him recently?<eos> Any fallings-out?<eos> Not as far as I'm aware.<eos> And the deceased ran the hotel with you?
He cared about people.<eos> Charlie Taylor was evidently quite the altruist.<eos> Which is why, when Jacob DeCosta got in contact with Charlie and alerted him to the dire financial situation the hotel was in, Charlie realised that his brother needed his help.<eos> So he came back.<eos> We can't know exactly what happened between you and him these last few months.
He knew that once he'd got Elliot to sign the papers, it was time to force himself to leave this island again and resume living life without you in it.<eos> Charlie had been drinking that night because he knew he had something very hard to do.<eos> He had to say goodbye to the only woman he'd ever loved.<eos> I mean, that's why he was in the state he was in.<eos> I think Charlie, feeling the worse for wear, entered the kitchen that evening not because he needed food, but to come and talk to you, - to tell you he was leaving.
He's... he's doing well.<eos> Adjusting to the culture.<eos> He-he should be here any minute, you could ask him yourself.<eos> I intend to.<eos> But I want to hear from you first.
Look, so somebody helped her.<eos> Now, we can chase our tails looking for them, or we can move on to a proper case.<eos> And what if she's telling the truth?<eos> Guv, she's pulling the wool over your eyes.<eos> She's manipulating you.
- Hiya, pet.<eos> - You all right?<eos> Mr Norton asked if you could leave, it's a big moment for him.<eos> I'll see you later, thanks.<eos> What happened to you?
Robert was desperate.<eos> He could've done anything.<eos> All right, you can go for now.<eos> Chris.<eos> Oi, I'm not finished with you.
"Goodbye, son.<eos> All my love, Dad."<eos> So when you found that note and read it, I think you realised exactly what had gone on.<eos> We know that you'd seen Jerome passing Archer cash, so it would have been easy for you to join the dots... and because you'd also taken a look at the wreck of Torey's car, you knew the brakes were working fine.<eos> That Archer had sold Jerome a lie, and that's why he was lying in front of you, dead.
Fine.<eos> I was engaged to another lawyer at the firm, and it ended badly.<eos> Did you kill her?<eos> So, like, a cheating thing?<eos> You guys, like, totally over each other?
Gar Saxon was guilty of treason against the throne, collaboration with our enemy, and the execution of my fellow Protectors.<eos> But when the rest of Mandalore finds out about his death, there will be chaos.<eos> Perhaps Mandalore needs chaos if it's to become strong once again, and so that we may find a leader worthy of our people.<eos> (GRUNTING) Sure, now you show up when all the fighting is over.<eos> (GRUNTING) The Empire will come for you once they find out what's happened here.
So those are just a couple of the products we think could really help make Atlantis safe, so you don't always have to rely on Aquaman to protect you.<eos> You've given us a lot to think about.<eos> We'll give you an answer in a couple of weeks.<eos> We need to head home for Sinking Day.<eos> Well, it has been an absolute pleasure meeting you.
You know, I worked every summer for my dad.<eos> Oh, God, tales from the flower shop.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> That's where I learned hard work.<eos> And I was hoping I would end up working for someone like my father... someone inspiring, a mentor... yet I ended up with you.
Discharged about a half hour ago.<eos> Casey! I need help!<eos> Hey! You get me out of here.<eos> I'll kill you, I swear. I will kill you!<eos> I'll come back for you.
- possible toxic exposure...<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - Thank you. - 431 Harrison Avenue.<eos> Chief!<eos> I gotta talk to you.
We good?<eos> Find out in a second.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> That's your shooter.<eos> - I'm riding with you.
You think there's oil there.<eos> You're positioning to stake a claim.<eos> There are no Russian troops in Antarctica.<eos> We're willing to recommend changes to the Antarctic Treaty parties.<eos> What happens to you when the Underwoods are ejected from office?
Yeah, but better.<eos> President Underwood?<eos> President Underwood? I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're needed in the Situation Room.<eos> Cathy.<eos> I wanted a moment with you before we join the rest of the team.
I mean, what is immortality?<eos> In time, even Grant's vision will get old.<eos> It will happen, as it does for all of us.<eos> Now this is still in the early stages, but we've been collecting and storing Raymond's memories, thoughts, quirks and tics.<eos> This is a mock-up. But eventually... this Raymond... will feel as real as the one standing before you.
Are you coming, Miss Baldwin?<eos> And your cell phone needs to stay here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have a lot of support out there, no matter what the president did or didn't say.<eos> There are people eager to work with you.
Is Sean Jeffries there?<eos> - Who's calling?<eos> - Who's this?<eos> I work for Tom Hammerschmidt.<eos> I don't understand why I was transferred to you.
Someone will escort you back to your hotel.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I hope I'm not too late to the party.<eos> I'd say you were just in time to make your grand entrance.<eos> Well, when all this started, I don't think I imagined myself standing here with you tonight.
But as far as the NSA job, he didn't want it. I made him take it.<eos> I don't understand how they got him or why he's there. I need to know that he is safe.<eos> He looked fine.<eos> What does he know, LeAnn?<eos> Probably about the same as you and me, which is why we need to keep him out of any serious trouble.
-We need to initiate evacuation now.<eos> -No, General.<eos> We'll do it when I say so.<eos> I'm really sorry. I know I agreed to do this, but I have to go pick up my kids.<eos> Well, what if I just rode in the car with you?
We've all been responding in real time to a potential terrorist attack.<eos> But you chose to stay here.<eos> Why weren't you in the bunker with us?<eos> I chose to remain in my office to oversee the capture or killing of one Ahmed Al Ahmadi.<eos> And yet there was great tension this morning between you and General Braegher.
Likes to keep you close while he keeps himself remote.<eos> But he disagreed with some of her positions, the money went away.<eos> Listen, don't let Jane fool you.<eos> She can seem a bit... haphazard...<eos> But once he's done with you... it's as if a switch gets turned off.
Okay.<eos> We need to head back.<eos> "Beware entangling alliances," Mr. President.<eos> You know, that quote is often attributed to Washington, but it was actually Jefferson who said it.<eos> Anyway, I wanted to catch you before, uh, Mark and your lawyer got here.
Listen. You... enough.<eos> I love you.<eos> You need to know that. - I'm only here to protect you.<eos> - You need to calm down.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- No, no, no.<eos> This is my opening statement, and I will give it in full.<eos> I am not done, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> You accuse me of breaking the rules, and I tell you, I am playing by the rules.<eos> The very rules that you and I all agreed upon.

Oh, Congressman Romero,<eos> I just wanted to see you one last time before I leave.
- Did you know he was gonna do this? - No.<eos> - Because this is bad, Claire.<eos> - This is very... very bad.<eos> My God!<eos> What is it with you two?
Muriel was the reason most of the women were here.<eos> Whoever did this to her is not among us.<eos> I'll need to speak with all of them nevertheless.<eos> You are the first men to cross the gate in years.<eos> And as you've already experienced, Detective, they will not speak with you and I cannot force them to.
- Llewellyn, what are you doing here?<eos> - My job.<eos> Wait for me in my salon.<eos> Please, Miss Athena.<eos> We were hoping to speak with you directly.
How did you meet her?<eos> I saw her staring at a poster of Niagara Falls.<eos> She said she'd always wanted to go.<eos> We started talking.<eos> Then you forced her to move away with you.
Such relief!<eos> I mean...<eos> I couldn't possibly be with an illiterate.<eos> - But Miss James...<eos> - I am indebted to you, Inspector.
Embarrassment.<eos> Doesn't quite cover it, does it?<eos> Not quite.<eos> Still... it appears that I am to be the new broom.<eos> I look forward to working with you, Archdeacon.
You know why this is happening, don't you?<eos> Dead birds and that.<eos> You think you're being ever so careful.<eos> With the fibbing and the sneaking about.<eos> But if I know what's going on with you and Mrs Hopkins, - then others know.
For thy height nor depth nor any other... shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ, Jesus, our Lord.<eos> Whether we live, we live unto the Lord.<eos> And whether we die, we die unto the Lord.<eos> Please.<eos> I hear we owe you a great debt, Mr Finch.
No-one at all?<eos> We're based on Antigua, we hardly ever come here.<eos> It was us who asked to go to Saint Marie.<eos> I see.<eos> So the only people Tom had contact with during his short period on the island was the four of you?
Yes, sir.<eos> - Sir? - Mm-hm?<eos> Hello.<eos> Mrs Chapman.<eos> I wanted to come and talk to you about Tom.
I just can't believe Trev's gone, just like that.<eos> It's so unfair.<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> We had dinner Thursday.<eos> Things were good between you two?
If he wets his khakis when we screen the video for him, he...<eos> Peter Stone?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - We're seeking to enforce a writ of replevin against you and your office.<eos> Nice to meet you, too.
That's not possible!<eos> So, if you can all start by telling me where you were when you heard the gunshot.<eos> Well, I was in the stairwell, heading down from the roof to meet Frank.<eos> He was supposed to be in the reception, but he was late.<eos> Was anyone else with you?
Great!<eos> He wants us to concentrate on Steve Thomas, find anything that links him to the victim, so I suggest we start working through Mr Lewis's papers and phone records.<eos> If the Inspector's right, - we may find a reference to him somewhere in here. - Yes, sir.<eos> I'll start with this.<eos> You do the rest.
Namely the Saint Marie Police Force.<eos> Then, once the coast was clear, just leave at your own convenience.<eos> But you made one mistake.<eos> When you were fighting your dad, your cufflink tore off.<eos> Which meant we came looking for you in London.
You don't know my boss.<eos> He's one fierce individual.<eos> I spoke to Chief Inspector Harris this afternoon.<eos> Did you?<eos> He wasn't rude to you, was he?
Are you arresting me?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Then I'm leaving.<eos> You should know, Dr. Wilkerson, we are seeking a warrant for your financial records as we speak.<eos> If there's a money trail between you and Eli Kotite, we will find it.
In person.<eos> Already in the works, actually.<eos> In fact, a large contingent of police and I should be knocking on your door at about 9:45 in the morning.<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> The bribe that you wired to the medical examiner in New Jersey originated in Grand Cayman.
I'm a detective with the NYPD.<eos> Did you hit your son?<eos> My son is none of your business.<eos> Well, he is now.<eos> I don't need to talk to you.
Would you back off?<eos> Back off!<eos> Ms. Nejjari.<eos> Did something happen to Malik?<eos> Malik is fine. We just came to talk to you.
Back off!<eos> Ms. Nejjari.<eos> Did something happen to Malik?<eos> Malik is fine. We just came to talk to you.<eos> I don't think I should be talking to you.
About what?<eos> That I'd asked you to the wedding.<eos> He said it would look like you were invited to feather his nest, that you were smart, and you'd see right through that.<eos> He said that?<eos> I know you don't know Steve, but he would never in a million years try to pull something like that.
Rubbing elbows!<eos> Rubbing elbows!<eos> Can we stop doing that?<eos> Unless you ask me to do that.<eos> In which case, can I do that with you guys?
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Was a...<eos> - You got one there.<eos> Beautiful walk.<eos> What happened to you two?
I'm all out.<eos> - I'm out.<eos> - Back to back.<eos> Back to back.<eos> What the hell is the matter with you?
- Back to back.<eos> Back to back.<eos> What the hell is the matter with you?<eos> Oh, come on, man.<eos> We're on to you.
My help was to be in the strictest confidence.<eos> The night I was poisoned, I was with people.<eos> I don't know where they are.<eos> I keep calling. I can't reach them.<eos> Except you.
Well, Robert Dahle did go to Sarasota Springs, and he did stay in the hotel he mentioned, but he did not stay alone.<eos> Dahle was cheating on his wife.<eos> Are you saying that the husband hired the Apothecary to kill his wife?<eos> I'm just saying he definitely had a motive.<eos> When did I meet you?
Hey, hey, can you be careful with that thing?<eos> Was I alone last night? Or was I accompanied by anybody? My associate...<eos> Dembe.<eos> No...<eos> What is wrong with you?
And I kiss you.<eos> The two of us.<eos> Forever.<eos> Monsieur Legate.<eos> My employer would like a word with you.
It's your mother's idea.<eos> No, hey, hey.<eos> My God.<eos> You know what?<eos> I can't talk to you guys right now.
It's... it's fine.<eos> It's your daughter, I take it?<eos> I'm-I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> At least, she's talking to you.
Oh, thank you.<eos> Thanks so much.<eos> Hey!<eos> Listen.<eos> Your daughter is struggling on the threshold of what it means to become you.
- you're jealous.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> He's fossilized.<eos> You shouldn't be walking.<eos> Just tell me what happened between you two.
Okay.<eos> So you need to be here with her.<eos> Hey, hey...<eos> I've got this, Sarah.<eos> And I can't sit still, so I gotta come with you.
I told you, I don't know where he's taken the science.<eos> - Her name is Helena.<eos> - Fine.<eos> You shot the one person who did know where she is.<eos> Mr. Frontenac was there to terminate you.
- Oh, that would be great!<eos> I'm going southern regional.<eos> We can catch up.<eos> Great!<eos> See you both at the opening.
- OK.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Uh, out.<eos> I thought we were all heading over to Felix's together.<eos> - I'll catch you guys later, OK?
It's a team house;<eos> That's how we do it in eSports.<eos> I own the place, and the team lives here so that they can practice together all day.<eos> Yeah, we give them room and board, salary, coaches, trainers, the works.<eos> According to O.G.'s calendar app, he had several meetings with you at this location over the last week, all predating your angry texts, and all on the subject of something or someone called Tendu.
I want to do it.<eos> That's my baby girl.<eos> Anybody mess with her, they deserve what they get.<eos> Crazy?<eos> Everything I've been doing, working with you, working with the police, it was so, eventually, I can be a father to her.
Anezka told us Libena fell for Tendu, hard.<eos> She was thinking about telling him the truth about herself.<eos> Say she did.<eos> Say it made him angry.<eos> He confronted you, threatened to expose you.
I'll get there in due time.<eos> Squad 3, ambulance 61.<eos> Man down from unknown causes. 341 West...<eos> When I get back, we are gonna talk.<eos> We'll come with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I keep thinking maybe if I wasn't so stupid...<eos> Just tell me what you know.<eos> Do you know that your husband had another name before he met you?
It was a new girl at school<eos> What new girl?<eos> Chrissy.<eos> I didn't want her taking the blame.<eos> Is there something going on between you?
He didn't say my number.<eos> Ah. He was supposed to say my number.<eos> Come on, Leo.<eos> Everyone already knows your number.<eos> I guess you're right. Detective, you saved my life; I owe you one.
Ah. He was supposed to say my number.<eos> Come on, Leo.<eos> Everyone already knows your number.<eos> I guess you're right. Detective, you saved my life; I owe you one.<eos> If you're ever in an accident, and need cash settlement, I will take your case, no charge.
And thank you.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Murtaugh...<eos> Come on.<eos> You guys have chemistry.
Riggs.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It has been very scary working with you.<eos> But not entirely unenjoyable.<eos> Well, Agent Palmer, uh, truth be told, it hasn't been entirely unenjoyable working with you.
- Can't breathe!<eos> - Okay, calm down, I got you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm getting you out of here.<eos> I got you.
Go ahead.<eos> Gloat away. It'll pass the time.<eos> I'd love to, but time isn't something we have a lot of right now.<eos> You need to come with me.<eos> Why the hell would I go anywhere with you?
- Trust me.<eos> - I'll take my chances.<eos> With what?<eos> There's no due process here.<eos> Please, come with me, or let your family spend the rest of their lives wondering what happened to you.
When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.<eos> How'd you get by?<eos> Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.<eos> Just know you might have to marry one of 'em.<eos> Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.
I am so sorry about the music.<eos> Ma'am, do you mind if we come in, take a look?<eos> Of course.<eos> You're the police.<eos> Ma'am, are you all right?
No, not yet.<eos> May we come in a minute?<eos> Yes.<eos> Quickly.<eos> We're here because your neighbors have expressed concern about what's going on in this house with you and your children.
Yes.<eos> Quickly.<eos> We're here because your neighbors have expressed concern about what's going on in this house with you and your children.<eos> I told you we're fine.<eos> Okay, but we just wanted a chance to talk to you and your kids separately.
You got an extra 50?<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> We got one under.<eos> Officer Reagan.<eos> I want to speak with you now.
Well, you know I'm only asking you about substantiated complaints.<eos> The vast majority of all complaints are second-guessing over minor matters.<eos> And we're supposed to take your word for it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you have the power of the state, and the state always knows best?
So I wonder, do you really think you're here to question me?<eos> Force of habit, interrogating murderers.<eos> You know what they say.<eos> The best defense is a good offense.<eos> Only there is no defense for what I could do to you.
What, to the police?<eos> No, to everyone.<eos> Hello, my name is Anson Gephardt.<eos> I work for the Defense Intelligence Agency.<eos> I'm speaking to you from Jakarta.
- Oh, no, no, no.<eos> See, your colleague... she fell off the map today, so I'm doing my job, and yours.<eos> Look, Agent Palmer took a vacation day.<eos> If she's not calling you back, maybe it's because she doesn't want to.<eos> Having just met you, that makes the most sense to me.
- for this kind of behavior, Captain.<eos> - I understand.<eos> Give me a break, Ronnie.<eos> Chappel's gonna end up getting somebody killed.<eos> Was I addressing you, Detective?
Right now we got to figure out another exit out of here.<eos> Hello.<eos> You have 60 seconds to give me the child or everyone dies.<eos> Is this housekeeping?<eos> We have been trying to reach you guys all day.
You just run over bad guys?<eos> You go with what works.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You ready?<eos> I know I owe you both an apology.
I want to call a truce.<eos> Get here before 3:00.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Anything?<eos> You will never guess who wants some face-time with you this afternoon.
These questions are for your protection, sir, I assure you.<eos> Right, just like Judge Kaplan assured us there was no pressure when he imposed that unofficial deadline for the verdict?<eos> Or the way he's been not-so-subtly steering us to a guilty verdict?<eos> Judge Kaplan is pressuring the jurors?<eos> I shouldn't be talking to you.
Just like you followed up on the threats to the jurors?<eos> I've got multiple complaints of harassment.<eos> I'm not about to let you tamper with that judge.<eos> I'm taking all three of you into holding.<eos> You're done here.
That's how I found out about you.<eos> Did you kill Roth?<eos> Did you kill Rebecca Sherman?<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> But I think that you and I have been doing the same thing...
I didn't kill anyone.<eos> But I think that you and I have been doing the same thing...<eos> Trying to find out who Carly was working for before she died.<eos> All right, so that's why you broke in, to see if we're on the same side?<eos> I had to be sure before I approached you, so I started following you.
Unfortunately, so are you.<eos> Look, you were right.<eos> Clay's struggling, but not with work.<eos> Only you.<eos> Whatever it is that's happening between you two, you have to stop it or, I swear, I will make your life a living hell.
You put me in charge of your finances.<eos> If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.<eos> See?<eos> Miserable.<eos> Okay, you're right, I got myself into this, but I've never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.
And what makes you think I had the Lady Frances?<eos> You lent it to Joshua Chris when you were courting him to sign with you.<eos> Oh. Where did you get that cock-and-bull story from?<eos> Joshua Chris.<eos> He might've been willing to keep your secret back then, but I got the sense from the call with him that things did not end well between you.
I thought you said he was asleep.<eos> He grabbed hold of my arm.<eos> It was like this.<eos> He was just digging his fingernails into me.<eos> Are you feeling all right, Cathy?
OK.<eos> But what about James, the man he killed?<eos> I didn't really know him.<eos> But you remember him, don't you?<eos> He looked after you with your mum when you were young.
I don't know who you talked to, but that wasn't my mother.<eos> Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems.
Well, now that you point it out...<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> We do seem to keep finding roommates.<eos> Now you're taking her side?<eos> Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard.
How do you get to him?<eos> I did some work for his wife a while back, some family trusts that I sorted for her.<eos> How long have you got before this bill gets passed?<eos> Not long.<eos> I just wanted to run it past you first.
- Hi. Mwah, mwah.<eos> Great to see you.<eos> This is my wife, Anna.<eos> Mrs Sheere.<eos> Izzy will do. It's lovely to meet you.
Wait, oh, I'm sorry, let me back up.<eos> I forgot to tell you about the raccoon trap.<eos> So, there was...<eos> Yes, that's great, but what I meant is, tell me all the important stuff she said.<eos> Mr. Rider, when the Princess of Corona speaks directly to you, every word is important.
He wanted street justice.<eos> I tried to stop him.<eos> Gabriela Dawson!<eos> You made contact?<eos> No, they made contact, and they want to talk to you.
Check him.<eos> Pulse is strong.<eos> - Let's get him ready to go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ♪ - I want to come with you!
If you want to keep your job, you'll find out what he's up to.<eos> Your sister...<eos> She died at the Al-Qaeda train bombing.<eos> This is not about my sister.<eos> Whatever it is that's happening between you two, you have to stop it.
I am.<eos> But I can't stay long.<eos> I'm supposed to come to my boss with an emergency so he can leave in 20 minutes.<eos> Leave Felix to me.<eos> Now is the only time I have with you two.
Change is coming, Alex.<eos> Once every few generations, the world is truly transformed.<eos> The new guard takes office, and the old guard swings from the gallows.<eos> Our generation will not be spared that change.<eos> But we need the right people there to guide the rebirth... people like me and you.
You know what game is being played here, A.D.A. Reagan.<eos> If Mr. Kindler is released, then you've admitted you've had an innocent man locked up for the last ten years.<eos> Is he a threat to society?<eos> Or a threat to the reputation of your office?<eos> If you really are innocent, I will admit you've been done a great injustice.
Because it's not coffee, it's Soothing Sunshine herbal tea.<eos> Caffeine free.<eos> Well, if it sounds like a hippie hemorrhoid cream, I don't want it in my cup.<eos> Waverly, can you get her out of here, and then, you know, come back because I'm off in 10 minutes.<eos> Ugh. You guys make The Notebook look bleak.
The cops can't find it.<eos> Rebecca?<eos> Rebecca, can you hear me?<eos> Alex, I'm hurt.<eos> I know, and you're gonna be okay.
IT'S TOO HIGH!<eos> HEY, HORSE. HORSE!<eos> LOOKATMY NECK!<eos> THAT'S WHY HORSES MAKE THAT<eos> THAT, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU SUCK.
BEAUTIFUL EYELASHES?<eos> THANKYOU,YOURHONOR. IMEAN,THISCAN 'TBETHE FIRST TIME YOU'RE HEARING THIS,<eos> RIGHT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]<eos> [ LAUGHTER ]<eos> [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT A PICKLE TO BE YOU, HUH? [ LAUGHTER ]
POKER NIGHT, AND I WAS PLAYING<eos> INCLUDINGMR.BIRD?<eos> YEAH,HEWASTHERE. SOYOUAREGOINGTOLOOKME<eos> IN THE EYE, THESE EYES AND TELL<eos> YOU HE WAS WITH YOU THAT NIGHT?
And did he seem in any kind of trouble to you, anything worrying him?<eos> Money worries?<eos> Anything?<eos> You'll have to talk to his wife.<eos> We are, but... .. we're talking to you, too, so...
You're on your own on this.<eos> I trust that you'll make the right decision.<eos> And for the record, it's number one.<eos> No, I'm the one who should be sorry.<eos> Working with you was the biggest mistake of my career.
But they trust me because they like what I have to say.<eos> And you told me this was about more than the presidency.<eos> It is.<eos> And don't twist my words.<eos> Because you'll find, Mr. Haas, the America I want and you want are not that dissimilar.
Wow. I am really happy to hear that.<eos> I was thinking this conversation was gonna go a lot differently.<eos> No, no.<eos> It was an honest mistake.<eos> I mean, if I had known you were a cop, I never would've treated you that way.
- Sorry, baby, but...<eos> - Do you think it was the "jam on" thing?<eos> - Yeah, I think it was the "jam on" thing.<eos> - Detective Peralta, this is my mother, the Honorable Laverne Holt.<eos> - I'm very excited to meet you.
He was not casing my apartment.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - He was with me that night.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - Oh, doing you.
- And I am so sick of you playing your damn classical music in your office all day.<eos> It's too loud!<eos> We can all hear it!<eos> - Okay, well, this has been...<eos> - You shut your mouth when I'm talking to you.
- What do you want?<eos> We ran background checks on all the employees of the three banks that were hit.<eos> - Nothing interesting.<eos> - Run checks on all the family members.<eos> Or we could get to know each other better and join you in the field.
So, Adrian...<eos> Working from home, hum?<eos> What happened to the office?<eos> Couldn't afford the rent.<eos> I'll be honest with you guys, this PI thing is not going great.
But still, maybe a lesson for all of us that crime doesn't pay.<eos> We go in the front door, we use the wedge formation.<eos> - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for me!<eos> I'm here, I'm here.<eos> Okay, I followed you here all the way on my bike.
I don't know.<eos> The reception was real bad.<eos> Diaz, I know you're scared, but things are starting to turn around.<eos> We're on the money trail, and we just found a new lead.<eos> With all due respect, sir, both you and I know that none of that is gonna pan out.
That's the article.<eos> Hawkins ran you out of New York and took away your life.<eos> If you help us, maybe we can help you get it back.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll talk to you, but you gotta follow me; I gotta go feed the hogs.
Just put on anything by Enya.<eos> No, not anything. "Orinoco Flow." On repeat.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.<eos> You are?<eos> You'll testify?<eos> Hawkins has cost me and my wife too many years of happiness.<eos> I'm not gonna let her do the same to you.
She's right here.<eos> Sh-she's what?<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> So nice to meet you.
Oh, John.<eos> What?<eos> Spare key.<eos> 'I hope you're well.<eos> Justin in with you...'
The next?<eos> She nearly choked me to death.<eos> Nice try.<eos> I figure that's why you're so angry.<eos> Because she's been acting strange around you too.
You take another step towards it, and your left foot hits something wet.<eos> You look down, and there's a puddle before the tree.<eos> The only way to this tree is to wade through this puddle.<eos> So you step into it. The water is up to your ankles.<eos> You take another step, and the bottom drops out from beneath you.
There's a different window.<eos> I'm in the cafeteria.<eos> I sit down and there's a group of my friends.<eos> They're all talking about starting this babysitting club. I get excited and I say, "Can I join?"<eos> And Tammy looks at me and says, "No, you can't join.
You know what, Harvey, instead of being so arrogant, maybe you could figure out a way to keep all of us happy.<eos> Starting with your number two.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means Louis is out of his mind at the moment.<eos> You poured fuel on the fire, and if you asked me to choose between the two of you for Managing Partner right now, I'd choose Alex Williams.
Mr. Specter, you'll have your chance to refute him at trial.<eos> All right, listen, you want me to be honest?<eos> I haven't felt prioritized lately.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Who was there when you had to restructure in '07?
Not so far.<eos> And did he seem in any kind of trouble to you?<eos> - You'll have to talk to his wife.<eos> - We are,<eos> - but we're talking to you, too, so...
You're all right.<eos> All right.<eos> You're all right.<eos> OK.<eos> You're OK. You're OK.
I was mad to think it could've worked.<eos> - James thought it would work, too, but... - It was crazy.<eos> Regardless.<eos> You might have died in there, Morgan.<eos> Did James ever talk to you about Paula Denny?
- 'Cause they told me to.<eos> - Who told you to?<eos> - The guards.<eos> Look, they would post it on the wall whenever they felt like it to keep us from getting too comfortable.<eos> - Which means you don't know the guard who decided to move you, and you don't know the name of the guy you got in a fight with. - I'm telling you guys, man, I'm not lying.
You've got three days.<eos> Let's see if you're as good as you think you are.<eos> - You must be Paula Agard.<eos> - I'm sorry, but do we know each other?<eos> - Not yet, but it is a pleasure to meet you.
- I see what this is.<eos> - I should have known. I have an MBA from Wharton, I graduated with honors, and you think all I am is a high-priced...<eos> - No, I don't give a shit what you think about sex and men.<eos> My problem is that you're in the betrayal business.<eos> You betray the men that you prey on, and then the only time we had an interaction with you, you turned on your employer.
Which means...<eos> I need to keep working on myself, because...<eos> I don't wanna mess things up with the next Tara.<eos> - Louis, typically I refrain from saying things like this to my patients, but...<eos> I am proud of you.
If you let this overwhelm you, you're going to bring about the thing you're most afraid of.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> He was in my mud.<eos> How the hell am I not supposed to let that overwhelm me?<eos> Well... has it occurred to you that instead of worrying this Alex person is going to come between you and Harvey, you could use this as an opportunity to make a new friend?
Except you just told me to go to hell in front of all your buddies, and they saw you meant it.<eos> That's why you came to me at the prison.<eos> Now you got cover.<eos> And I suggest you use it.<eos> Because I am gonna find out what happened here, and when I do, they are gonna shield themselves from liability and I am gonna end up coming after you instead.
Thank you, Peters.<eos> Let me introduce you to our patient today.<eos> A Mr Joseph Smiles.<eos> A brave haberdasher of this borough.<eos> Now, Mr Smiles, let's tell the ladies and gentlemen what happened to you.
How about, um...<eos> Have you two met?<eos> Annie, this is Mr Butterworth,<eos> Mr Butterworth, Annie.<eos> How about... Annie, if I pull your teeth now, rather than be in my debt, how about you offer Mr Butterworth here some trade, so to speak, and Mr Butterworth, you and I could consider that treat as some form of down payment?
No, I won't be there myself, but I promise you he'll do a great job, and you'll be nice and cool for the rest of the summer.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry, what... yeah, yes, that's right.<eos> I'm staying in tonight. All right, great, well, I will be in contact with you next week to confirm.
She never had a problem with drugs before.<eos> So Elizabeth, when she saw those scars on Cora's arms, she tore into her.<eos> She called her a whore.<eos> A degenerate. She refused to take Cora in.<eos> Cora was lucky to have you.
I appreciate it.<eos> Last time, promise.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got five minutes.<eos> This is over. I don't have to talk to you.
- But...<eos> - None of that, that you thought you went through, was true.<eos> Then what happened to me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But somebody, somewhere did this to you.
- No, we are going through this.<eos> We are going through this step by step.<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> He did something to you, didn't he?
We are going through this step by step.<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> He did something to you, didn't he?<eos> What did he do? What did he do to you?
I warned you.<eos> You can't say I didn't warn you.<eos> You did not listen to me, sir.<eos> Are you talking back to me?<eos> No, I'm merely talking to you.
If I go and recover your kid's body, will you please leave?<eos> Wait outside the city.<eos> Give your aid to the survivors when the night horde finally just rips through this place.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> They're going to come for you soon.
These people believe you're causing their time of need!<eos> Only because they are being misled by the Church.<eos> Does one run away when someone tells lies about them?<eos> What have the Church said about the Belmonts?<eos> That you have been corrupted by dealings with the supernatural, that you mock God, that you are threat to the common good, and that evil follows wherever you go.
What do you expect to achieve against us?<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> So you're going to die for nothing?<eos> For people you don't know?<eos> I don't know any of you, but that doesn't matter, does it?
Hide the smoke.<eos> Don't go up in a straight line.<eos> Oh, yeah, they're always lookin'.<eos> We expensive.<eos> How come they hounding' you?
They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse.<eos> All you need to do is focus.<eos> Visualize.<eos> See the destination in your mind.<eos> Look beyond the world in front of you.
-I got the pack.<eos> Abby! Please, Abby.<eos> The book.<eos> Come on. Let's go!<eos> I'm not going with you guys.
-Seeing anyone?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Just for business purposes.<eos> -Business purposes only.<eos> Well, I'm seeing all three of you.
Oh, my God.<eos> Who threw him out the window?<eos> A ghost threw him out the window.<eos> You mean like Patrick Swayze?<eos> Like, he's sitting behind you, making some pottery?
Their skin is on the inside of their body because their organs are on the outside.<eos> But they're okay, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> I think they're dead.<eos> On that horrifying note, thank you all so much for coming.
The other night, someone asked me why I'd come back to Annville.<eos> I didn't have an answer for her... at least, not a convincing one.<eos> I've let you down. Week after week,<eos> I've been just another man that hurts by not helping.<eos> I've not had a single morning where I-I didn't wake up and... have to force my feet to the floor to face you.
You heard the lady.<eos> I will be right back.<eos> This is a perfect birthday drink.<eos> I remember this day, a year ago.<eos> Jim was so looking forward to meeting you.
Before she ran off and joined the circus, she was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.<eos> A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.<eos> She was assigned to The Clown himself.<eos> Dr. Quinzel.<eos> You know, I live for these moments with you.
- Stand by. Arming device.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I don't know who you are.<eos> - Device armed. Hey!<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.
- Who are you?<eos> - I don't know who you are.<eos> - Device armed. Hey!<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you.
- Anything on the other squad?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> Go-7, I need your sensors on those coordinates.<eos> Flag, it's a negative.<eos> They were engaged when you were, but we lost them.
Go-7, I need your sensors on those coordinates.<eos> Flag, it's a negative.<eos> They were engaged when you were, but we lost them.<eos> Seriously?<eos> The hell is wrong with you people?
See, we've had this small disruption to our supply chain...<eos> We'd appreciate your patience.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll deliver in full the following month.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
Now, if I were a 200-pound sack of assholes named Francis, where would I hide?<eos> A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson... out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot.<eos> His form looks good.<eos> And that's why Regina rhymes with fun.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing... is sweet dick-kicking revenge.
Oh, God.<eos> I didn't even tell him he may not be the only daddy.<eos> I love this book.<eos> Hey, Katie Couric!<eos> I need to talk to you!
I want everything.<eos> Gas, air, injections, morphine.<eos> Bridget, remember your yoga.<eos> Fuck yoga!<eos> Oh, I couldn't agree with you more.
Wow! Wow, guys-<eos> Hey! How about a hand for Principal Kent, huh?<eos> Honestly, if my mom was into white guys, it would be you.<eos> I know it would, okay?<eos> Well, as we all know, this is our last assembly, which means this is the last time in front of you guys that I'll be able to tell the most beautiful girl in the world...
All right, bye.<eos> Get in.<eos> I'm gonna address the elephant in the room.<eos> Okay, first of all, you...<eos> You guys, I want to say sorry to.
I don't...<eos> No, I don't think...<eos> When we were in the plane, you said, "Hey, Harris is the Black..."<eos> I think you should...<eos> Mr. Joyner, it was a pleasure working with you.
Hi, everyb0dy!<eos> Most of you knew me back in high school as Robbie Wheirdicht.<eos> - That's Robbie Wheirdicht?<eos> I wore prescription pants every day.<eos> Twenty years ago, in this gym, I stood in front of you all naked and embarrassed.
Yeah, have a seat in there and, uh, Lane'll be right with you.<eos> Hey, I'm glad you're all recording this.<eos> Not every day we get like-minded investigators coming out here to discuss the Blair Witch.<eos> There you go.<eos> Hey, I may need to get you guys to sign some release forms later if that's...
Are you guys really gonna go camping out in those woods?<eos> Yep. That's the plan.<eos> Why?<eos> You ask 'em.<eos> Uh, we wanna go out there with you.
- That's not our problem, man.<eos> - Just hear me out.<eos> What if... what if we get lost, okay? What if we get lost?<eos> I thought you guys came out here all the time?<eos> - We've been following you!
I'm sorry?<eos> A moment-by-moment account.<eos> That's what you came here for, isn't it?<eos> You want me to describe the sound the bullet made when it collided with my husband's skull.<eos> I'm very happy to be in the great state of Texas, to be with you and experience
I love crowds.<eos> You remember governor and Mrs. connally.<eos> Welcome to Dallas, darling.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> Very nice to meet you.
With Jack's face on them.<eos> Let them see what they've done.<eos> Jackie?<eos> Bobby.<eos> Sir, there's a car waiting on the tarmac to take you and Mrs. Kennedy to Bethesda.
Why not?<eos> Daddy had to go see your baby brother Patrick.<eos> In heaven.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm here with you.
I was ten yards back when I heard the first shot.<eos> And as my eyes crossed the president's car...<eos> Mrs. Kennedy...<eos> Keep going.<eos> I had to get to you, put myself between you, the president, and the shooter.
Get me Director Levinson.<eos> We tried.<eos> He's unreachable, sir.<eos> You need to take me seriously.<eos> I've been chasing you across the planet for three weeks now.
Someone call a cab?<eos> - Thanks for doing this, Jake.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Let's get moving, though, because I stole this thing.<eos> I'm coming with you.
You got to lead us.<eos> See you up there, Lieutenant.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> This red mass on the top of the ship... that's your target.<eos> We're gonna send a fleet of drones to go in ahead of you and disable their shields.
- What's your son like?<eos> - Can you get us his autograph?<eos> How often do you see him?<eos> These days we only see each other at Thanksgiving, but unfortunately... last year he had to cancel.<eos> What about you?
Hey, hey.<eos> Look, can we all just, you know, calm down a notch, please?<eos> Let's try to be, I don't know, amicable.<eos> I'm Sammy Bagel Jr.<eos> You know, I'm happy to meet all of you.
No way, José!<eos> Yes way.<eos> José's fucking dead, yo.<eos> Right in my guac and balls.<eos> And the same thing's gonna happen to all of you... unless you find the sausage and the bun.
A sausage.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir, I'm sorry to wake you.<eos> I'm a fellow sausage in distress.<eos> My name's Barry, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I know you moved it, I would have done the same.<eos> It's in Singapore.<eos> Is that safe? Yes.<eos> You're a smart man.<eos> Because you know that if they catch me, they'll go after you.
Get in the car.<eos> They're waiting for you.<eos> Does my wife know where I'm going?<eos> Only they know.<eos> From this moment on, I won't have any more contact with you.
- Hey!<eos> - Calm down already, man!<eos> - Everybody knows that!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> What is the matter with you?
Sf-what?<eos> The student film festival?<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, um, I gotta talk to you about some homework.
The student film festival?<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, um, I gotta talk to you about some homework.<eos> I didn't need to talk to you about homework.
Doesn't matter if it's real or pulling it straight out of their ass.<eos> People are dumb.<eos> They don't know the difference.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna tell you the real reason I'm having lunch with you today.
They don't know the difference.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna tell you the real reason I'm having lunch with you today.<eos> You see, I don't, uh... i don't really have any friends at the moment.<eos> And to be completely honest with you, I'm not interested.
It'll be all right.<eos> Use both hands.<eos> Don't let the blast scare you.<eos> You're a grown woman now, Joanna.<eos> Could I talk to you for a moment?
Wait for me.<eos> I mustn't forget our calendar.<eos> Could you fetch it from the parlor please, Miss Avocet?<eos> Go and help the others.<eos> Miss Peregrine, what a pleasure to meet you at last!
- Yeah.<eos> Well, I shouldn't set too much store by what he says.<eos> You know we do have a police force here, you know, Tora.<eos> It may not be much of one, but, um... it works for us.<eos> You're looking really good and I'll be seeing you in a month.
Just eat your breakfast.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude but who did you say you are?<eos> My name is Dr. Tora Hamilton.<eos> I'm here on behalf of Detective Sergeant Tulloch.<eos> Who I believe spoke to either you or your wife on the phone.
And he said:<eos> "If a man abide not in me he is cast into the fire and he is burned!"<eos> For decades, you have lived in the world torn apart by religious discord.<eos> But soon, thanks to God and Inquisition we will purge this disease!<eos> The sinners before you, sought to defend the heretic prince of Granada, the last heathen stronghold in our holy war.
- If we don't really know what they are...<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Would you like to add something?<eos> If they are wearing cloaking technology, you need to bring it back as intact as possible.<eos> Dr. Clyne and Agent Madison will be on mission with you.
[Sessions] Did you get a message to higher command?<eos> [Orland] No.<eos> - Is there a rescue mission planned?<eos> - No. We intercepted radio chatter from Moldovan friendlies to find this place.<eos> We sent that bird to pick you up and bring you here.
Putting in a sidewalk...<eos> You boys wouldn't recognize it now.<eos> Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.<eos> They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.<eos> It's like I died with you.
Solomon Grundy Born on a Monday<eos> Christened on Tuesday<eos> Justine, please.<eos> It's called "stimming," self-stimulation.<eos> Whereas you and I might tap our fingers, grind our teeth, bite our nails, your son rocks back and forth.
But he didn't even stick to the rehearsal script at rehearsal.<eos> - So, about dinner... Did you...<eos> - Okay, you wore me down.<eos> I'm Sorry?<eos> I'll go to dinner with you.
- Don't put your hands on me.<eos> - Andre? It's okay.<eos> - That's, that's...<eos> - Diane Lester.<eos> I'll be happy to talk to you.
- Yeah.<eos> - The quants you used.<eos> The guy who actually designed the algorithm that crashed.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Is he in that building right there behind you?
Get him an ambulance!<eos> Hey, Kyle, you hang in there, buddy!<eos> Kyle!<eos> You hang in there, buddy.<eos> - You're good to go, pal.
They're kind of my best friends.<eos> And this...<eos> This is Master Shifu.<eos> Legend.<eos> It is an honor to meet you, Master Panda.
Come on.<eos> Roll, roll. That's it.<eos> Hurry!<eos> That's it. Just roll!<eos> I'm right behind you.
Drop 'em off, come right back.<eos> Like I said, it's your call.<eos> Just 'cause some man in uniform tries to tell us what to do doesn't mean we actually have to follow his orders.<eos> Okay, I want you on this one, all right?<eos> -I'll be right behind you.
Hey!<eos> Keep staring at my ass and I'll rip your throats out.<eos> Let's be clear.<eos> I'm not taking orders from you.<eos> I'm not gonna die with you geniuses.
-Holy shit!<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> -Zombie, you see this?<eos> -She's green!<eos> -What the hell, you guys?
Well, I decided to ignore you.<eos> I've been planting bombs.<eos> In about 10 minutes, when the last plane full of kids takes off, I'm taking this place down, for good.<eos> I'm sorry I lied to you, Cassie.<eos> I was wrong when I said I was both one of you and one of them.
- Okay!<eos> We got it. Great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That checks out.<eos> Well, pleasure doing business with both of you.
Probably wanna keep it a little on the down low. Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah, no, no, of course.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> I'm so proud of you guys.
The site's no longer secure.<eos> We're standing by to evacuate.<eos> Where's Ian?<eos> Weber came and got him maybe 10 minutes ago.<eos> But he wouldn't leave until he knew you were okay.
A pleasure.<eos> General Shang.<eos> The pleasure is mine, really.<eos> Your President said he was honored to host me at the celebration...<eos> - ...but I confess, the only reason why I'm here is to meet you in person.
Isabel, a letter.<eos> I admire her too much to leave the grounds of my darkness.<eos> Tom.<eos> But I can not hide my thoughts.<eos> And my time with you allowed me to feel something again.
Kiss?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> The grand clock!<eos> Wilkins!<eos> Right behind you, sir!
So if you're gonna stand there, and do something productive, own it.<eos> Own it!<eos> We're going after the guy who killed Charlie.<eos> If I don't make a change to a certain prison record, the whole thing falls apart.<eos> I ain't interested in joining no justice league with you callin' the shots.
"and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."<eos> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate.<eos> And then the Lord God said to the woman, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.<eos> "In pain you will bring forth children,<eos> "yet your desire will be for your husband. "And he will rule over you."
Stupidity?<eos> The Impossible.<eos> Bek?<eos> I have never been in debt.<eos> And yet I am in debt to you, grandson.
Thank you.<eos> No, no, no, no...<eos> Can you hear me, little one?<eos> And the Lord who created you said "Don't be afraid, for I have redeemed you. "I have called you by your name. You are mine."<eos> "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you."
Is this about that old lady?<eos> She was a real bitch.<eos> Yeah, she was, but she was also right, and you were being a brat.<eos> You defended me.<eos> Because I wasn't gonna stand there and let her talk to you like that.
There's a lot more where that came from.<eos> I think so.<eos> If you're not too afraid.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Not with you here to protect me.
Uh... This is Josslyn.<eos> Right now?<eos> Uh, sure. Bye.<eos> They want me to come down to the station.<eos> I'm going with you.
Heavenly Father is telling you to slaughter the sheep so that you may wear his wool.<eos> He's calling upon you to cut the unholy sheep's throat!<eos> You're afraid.<eos> I see it, my son.<eos> But fear not, this holy divination has been bestowed by Heavenly Father above upon you, and you alone.
How could you possibly be that excited<eos> To be in a frickin avalanche?<eos> I have kind of a weird bucket list.<eos> Number three, bang joe frazier.<eos> [sigh] really regret sharing that with you...
My-my-my-my-- sis-sis-sis-sis-- [sighs] hold this.<eos> Ow! God dammit, dude.<eos> Well, I'm sorry,<eos> But I've got other shit to do today.<eos> Now, what the hell is wrong with you?
I've got to go sometime.<eos> NOT WITH ME!<eos> Die with whoever comes after me.<eos> You do not leave ME.<eos> Clara, I need to talk to you, just on your own.
- You're not going to give me a ring?<eos> - Just be quiet a little.<eos> Listen.<eos> You know the power of this water.<eos> If you get hurt, if anything happens to you at all... - Nothing will happen to me. I must get ready.
No!<eos> "Fear not, for I am with you."<eos> "Be not dismayed, for I am your God."<eos> "Behold, all those who were incensed against you" "shall be ashamed and disgraced."<eos> "They shall be nothing." "Those who war against you shall be as nothing."
It's amazing seeing you.<eos> You know, I still think about you every time I hear<eos> Only Want To Be With You on the radio?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Only Want To Be With You...
- Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Is that Only Want To Be With You?<eos> Yep.<eos> Why is your ringtone Only Want To Be With You?
I've been waiting for the right time to tell you, but now seems like a good time.<eos> Adam, you didn't tell her about us?<eos> Jennifer, could you excuse us for just one moment?<eos> What? No, no.<eos> Honey, if anybody's gonna be excusing anybody, it's gonna be me excusing you.
I'll be right back.<eos> Oooh! What the fuck, man?<eos> It's cold out here, man. Let's get in with the bitches.<eos> What the fuck, man?<eos> - What are we going to do with you, boy? Huh?
Can I tell you something?<eos> Yes, always.<eos> Even if it has the potential to make you sad?<eos> Even better.<eos> That night, I was so looking forward to having dinner with you.
So you were hiding money.<eos> I wouldn't say hiding, exactly.<eos> What are you going to do about it, sue me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm not going to sue you.

My company owns... 800... radio stations.<eos> I think I know how things work.<eos> But surely you're above all that.<eos> You're a huge, huge star.<eos> They should be courting you.
She represents all your frustration, all your unhappiness.<eos> - Hauser...<eos> - Which is why it would mean nothing if we were to kill her.<eos> It's you who has to choose reality.<eos> You shoot her, Doug, and I promise you, you will gasp awake and find me sitting in the room beside you.
Did you know that pickling is back?<eos> - I didn't, but it doesn't shock me.<eos> - I... yeah.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> - Yeah. - Uh, could I talk to you privately for a minute?
Cleveland!<eos> Donna!<eos> Role-playing.<eos> Yep, role-playing.<eos> By the time I'm done with you, you're gonna be a canoe.
When I feel like I'm the butt of the joke, you know what gives me strength?<eos> A silk bag full of money?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> But it's family.<eos> They'll always be there for you, and you always have to be there for them.
But it's family.<eos> They'll always be there for you, and you always have to be there for them.<eos> You're so wise.<eos> You got that, right?<eos> Well, Fandy, it was so nice meeting you.
No, no, no, don't fight me.<eos> That's it, stay calm.<eos> Amanda.<eos> Yeah?<eos> If I've been off with you, it's not been intentional.
Sarah was there with me, she can confirm that.<eos> Greg sent me to see if you were okay.<eos> What happened to the painting?<eos> Vicky, I don't know how to do this.<eos> We've been friends with you and Trevor for so long.
Thank you.<eos> This little girl loves you so much.<eos> Really...<eos> You're all she talks about.<eos> The sun rises and sets with you.
Well, it is a tragedy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure is.<eos> Not many Juliets get laughs during the death scene.<eos> Why were they laughing at you?
- Please...<eos> - I'd never accept so little.<eos> Here.<eos> That's not enough.<eos> What's wrong with you, Cik?
Yeah, okay.<eos> This is one of my favorite Bible verses from Isaiah.<eos> Considering that the Warblers are so good, and that it's the first competition for a lot of you,<eos> I think it's appropriate.<eos> "So do not fear because I am with you.
They were like a little family.<eos> I know your heart's breaking, sweetheart.<eos> I know.<eos> There's nothing we can do.<eos> I'm gonna be sad with you, okay?
I got him. I got him.<eos> Screw it.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Stay down!<eos> What the hell is wrong with you? !
He's a damn genius.<eos> He suggests divorce, knowing you'd feel too guilty to follow through.<eos> Well-played, Gary.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He's just trying to show you he's a good guy.
Well...he used to.<eos> And not just pretend.<eos> Totally believed they're real.<eos> Kate.<eos> You're all right now, aren't you, Jed?
Every time he astral projected, he would create a distortion in the magnetic field and attract metal objects to him.<eos> Even if you're right, what does that have to do with me?<eos> I mean, like you said, it was 25 years ago.<eos> Belly always theorized that the Cortexiphan children would share a psychic link, a deep emotional bond because of their shared experience.<eos> Maybe this person is trying to reach out to you, and the harmful side effects are unintentional.

Nothing's gonna change, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, Mike.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> - But I'm not gonna hug you, okay?
Where's Kyle?<eos> He was here a moment ago.<eos> I... (Kyle, whispering) Ed.<eos> Is Mike there?<eos> (Normal voice) He's standing right next to you, isn't he?
Your cheeks are pretty amid the necklaces<eos> The country is a volcano.<eos> And the day will come when language will turn itself against those who speak it.<eos> This is why the girls love you<eos> Take me away, go on, run me after you
Well, no.<eos> It's a lie.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> I just like you.<eos> I can't believe I get to be with you.
Yeah.<eos> And the FBI interview, or the...debriefing or whatever they're calling it...<eos> that's really important.<eos> They're total dicks for wanting to do it today, but maybe you're better off just going in there and getting it over with.<eos> You sure you don't want me to come with you?
He predicted I would be the first postmistress in five counties.<eos> I am embarrassed to admit that I agreed with him, which did make him laugh.<eos> And this, Sydney... this is my mother.<eos> Oh, Thomas, she looks so tired sitting there.<eos> Are you sure she can endure the long trek of your delivery with you today?
Can you?<eos> I'll try.<eos> And on this eve of All Hallows, we honor the saints and now pray for the souls of the dead.<eos> O lord, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; and in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief.<eos> Do not bring your servant unto judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.
You're the king for God's sake!<eos> Hurry it up!<eos> Please, hurry.<eos> Hang in there!<eos> We'll come right back to save you.
Magazine covers are glittering, You're examining them in rapture.<eos> You just saw a beauty queen in a magazine.<eos> But I'm watching only you, And you don't yet know, That your beauty is superior to any beauty queen.<eos> I'm going to a date with you With ﬂowers in my hands For you, the only beauty queen In the whole big world.<eos> I'm bound to you forever.
Get off!<eos> No!<eos> Hello, Erica.<eos> I'm Dr. Rodriguez.<eos> Dr. Wexlar sent me to talk to you.
You, you are the sultan... this devil of a Turk,<eos> brother to the demon, Lucifer's secretary in person !<eos> But what the hell can you do, knight, when you can't even kill a hedgehog, because your butt is naked ?<eos> We do not fear your armies.<eos> On ground and sea, we will fight you... you, Babylonian spitmeat !
The last talisman.<eos> Idiot!<eos> Could this be a dream?<eos> Life is but a dream.<eos> The nobleman before you
So this is where I pick you up from?<eos> She's got to deal with it sometime.<eos> You sure?<eos> OK.<eos> I'll pick you up at seven?
He tried it on with me.<eos> - He did what?<eos> - I don't care what Pete thinks.<eos> I don't care what anyone thinks.<eos> I just want to be with you.
What are you doing?<eos> I just, I don't think there's any clean towels in there.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> The maid put some out fresh this morning.<eos> What has got into you?
Of course I do.<eos> That's why I'm going back!<eos> You're supposed to be on a mission.<eos> I know. Look, I just...<eos> I needed...to spend time with you.
Sort through them, see if any of 'em fit.<eos> Lesson number two:<eos> you never know when you might need a cork.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> What's happened to you, then?
Billy! That's lovely!<eos> It really is.<eos> Thank you, ever so much.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Now, I'd like a word with you, please.
Well, I know the truth now.<eos> And see how it's upset you?<eos> I didn't think we had any secrets.<eos> You know me.<eos> I just want to spend the rest of my life with you.
That's why--that's why they pay me the big bucks.<eos> You're a good,good guy.<eos> Um,okay. You know,i always knew if michael just took the time to get to know m we'd bece friends.<eos> Hey,pam.<eos> Could i talk to you for a sec?
- Give me some time to make a decision.<eos> - How much time doou need?<eos> - No me than a week.Maybe two.<eos> - Come on,man!<eos> Pam,can i talk to you for a second?
Just leaving another message.<eos> I got a call from Margo saying we got a new dog.<eos> is that true?<eos> I'm trying to give you some space so you can write but that means you actually have to write.<eos> I don't think you have any idea what it's like living with you.
It's too late. It's dialing.<eos> Now it's ringing.<eos> ANGELA: Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> What is wrong with you?
- Can't do what?<eos> It's not fair to you.<eos> And it's really not fair to me.<eos> Wait, What are you saying?<eos> I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
Thomas.<eos> Charles Stewart has broken his promises.<eos> Every one of them. By escaping from Hampton Court.<eos> Gone, it is thought, to the Island of Wight.<eos> I come to apologise to you and to all.
Now I see you've broken a feather<eos> I hope we can patch it up Together<eos> Chiquitita, you and I know How the heartaches come and they go And the scars, they're leaving<eos> You'll be dancing once again And the pain will end You will have no time for grieving<eos> Chiquitita, you and I cry But the sun is still in the sky And shining above you
- You don't like this food?<eos> I don't like the way them Chinky motherfuckers be acting sometimes.<eos> The way they be lookin' at me.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Chris with you?
I know you're always busy, but...<eos> Yeah, no, I'm busy.<eos> I'm at work.<eos> Okay, I was, um...<eos> You know I'd really just love to talk with you.
- dr.Montgomery,is something wrong?<eos> - I'm gonna run some more tests.<eos> You promise me you'll take it easy. I have a stack of dvds to watch,and I expect your father to feed me by hand.<eos> So just call if you have any questions.<eos> It was nice t-talking with you.
Yes!<eos> Isn't 7:00 P.M. a little late for a lunch party?<eos> Lunch party?<eos> It's supposed to say launch party.<eos> What is wrong with you?
May contain poison.<eos> Good night, Maggie.<eos> Come on, sweet.<eos> Everyone's going to sleep.<eos> You know you make me wanna.
Stay out of trouble.<eos> Don't make me worry about you okay? Cabrone.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts<eos> We're approching Mexico city airport and we'll be landing shortly thank you...<eos> Virgin Marie pray for us, mother of Jesus give us strength, the lord be with you.
Your luminous beauty, your goodness, your patience, how you hung on my every word.<eos> You are now in the arms of another.<eos> Who is he, this man?<eos> Does he have poise? Does he have grace? ls he a lover or a fighter?<eos> What powers does he have over you?
You're gonna cry now?<eos> That's rich.<eos> You know, you can't cry about shit when it's your own fault.<eos> Egg all over my goddamn...<eos> If I could be with you forever...
-Didn't you hear me?<eos> - Get out!<eos> - I want to know more.<eos> Please... tell me about the dragons.<eos> Did anybody follow you here?
Let us pray.<eos> "Because she hopes in you, my God."<eos> "Send her help from the holy place, Lord."<eos> "And give her heavenly protection."<eos> "May the Lord be with you."
You have so much to experience before you make a commitment you're not ready for.<eos> You need to get to know each other better... and then you can be comfortable going all the way with it.<eos> - Do you mean it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This time I'm being honest with you.
You have a soul, a ghost.<eos> When we see our uniqueness as a virtue, only then will we find peace.<eos> Safely reconfiguring the child's genetic structure.<eos> Families built better.<eos> What was going on with you at the hotel last night?
What are you doing to me?<eos> I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.<eos> W-w-when I'm finished in this world... my ghost can survive there and regenerate.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I became... fascinated with you.
There is no place for us here.<eos> No,<eos> I'm not ready to leave.<eos> I belong here.<eos> I'll always be there with you, in your ghost.
Who would you target?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?<eos> Oh, you're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage.<eos> I came looking for you, remember?
That is why I'm here today.<eos> Rodriguez Hayes must be overjoyed.<eos> Actually, I heard they were fighting.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.
How did you...<eos> My sense of smell is my best feature.<eos> Was that a bread roll?<eos> Happy Anniversary.<eos> What's wrong with you?
No, not really.<eos> Thank you for trying.<eos> My junior prom is tonight.<eos> But my mom said I'd probably have a better chance here where nobody knew me, so...<eos> I would have danced with you.
Don't you touch my dick!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Ronnie, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, no, I'm good.<eos> I'm proud of you, Ronnie.
I meant evidence.<eos> - Evidence. - Evidence.<eos> Well, why didn't you say so, man?<eos> - Heck, yeah! - Thank God you're pretty.<eos> I'm really proud of you, man.
You are the motherfucking tech guy.<eos> I'm the motherfucking tech guy.<eos> Come on, Ronnie.<eos> - All right, let's go.<eos> - I'm behind you, dude.
Jakob.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Jakob.<eos> I'm going to look after you.
This is how it must be.<eos> We must help her.<eos> Jakob.<eos> Jakob, listen to me closely.<eos> Your mother is watching over you.
Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?<eos> Psycho.<eos> Psycho.<eos> Did anyone at this party... Has anyone talked to you?
Can you wait that long?<eos> This room's off-limits.<eos> I was just looking for the bathroom.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I feel like I'm having Déjà vu with you being in my room.
We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?<eos> Psycho.<eos> Did anyone at this party... Has anyone talked to you?
I'm going back to sleep.<eos> I'm going to sleep in my room.<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> You were friends with Juliet?<eos> No one even talked to you in fifth grade, and I don't hold that against you.
What does that... and then you're just going to go through there and end up here.<eos> If I was going to relive the same day over and over...<eos> I wanted it to be a worthy day.<eos> But not just for me.<eos> Do the kids at school ever make fun of you for the way that you talk?
Yeah, not so good in the morning, though.<eos> - It's like waking up...<eos> - In the middle of the sun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you don't think that it's weird that I'm here with you right now.
How come you never told me about your parents' divorce?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why would I talk about something that happened a thousand years ago?<eos> Because it happened to you.
And I'm sorry. I have to go.<eos> I'm trying to tell you how sorry...<eos> I am sorry.<eos> You said that.<eos> Sorry, but I have to come with you.
Don't you get it?<eos> You can't help me.<eos> I can't be fixed.<eos> You're not the one who needs fixing.<eos> There is nothing wrong with you.
Good deal.<eos> Wife?<eos> Kids?<eos> Hey, asshole!<eos> I'm talking to you.
93 years old.<eos> I'm literally counting the seconds.<eos> Well, I just...<eos> I don't have any family left.<eos> And I've known you... since we were, what, nine years old?
She was on the street, strung out on drugs... comforting strangers.<eos> I never was on the street.<eos> Look, it doesn't...<eos> Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!
And if you're wondering about the lack of family resemblance... you couldn't tell it by looking at her, but she used to be a real hippo.<eos> Your grandpa wrote a well-regarded novel about Melville, and... Pippi's maternal grandfather was a famous judge in Ohio, and...<eos> Shit!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Well, it's been... truly amazing getting a chance to have this time with you.
Delete.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> What? What?<eos> I just had this thought of like...<eos> What if I showed up with you and Claire?
I just have to...<eos> It might be George about tomorrow.<eos> Hello?<eos> No. No.<eos> Look, he has no interest in talking to you, and we'd... just prefer if you don't call this number anymore, okay?
The little fucker might like me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I really have to just take stock of my life.<eos> Start counting my blessings.<eos> The fact is, I got it pretty good here with you, Shelly.
Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.<eos> I came for the child, not you.
How'd you get money from a Viking?<eos> I feel a joke coming on here.<eos> You ask him for it.<eos> You're paying and then you're leaving.<eos> Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart. You sit there and be quiet. You are better at that...
They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.<eos> A force of something almost indescribable moves through your blood and takes you over completely.
You know he was the third most wanted man on the Blackleg's list?<eos> They've been trying to catch him for some time.<eos> Like I said, your man chose the wrong place to hide.<eos> So it seems.<eos> I was wondering what happened to you.
Stop looking around and look at me.<eos> I'm a target, aren't I?<eos> God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.<eos> But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.
Let's get your arse on that boat, Lack.<eos> There's a good fog to cover our tracks.<eos> Come on. I'll need a little breather.<eos> Here, load everyone else up and come back for me.<eos> No, I'll stay with you.
You became suspicious.<eos> Stupid girl.<eos> How long have you known?<eos> I don't know, um...<eos> I was a receptionist there before I met you.
In that time, did she have any medical history or medication?<eos> About her mental health issues?<eos> Had she ever had any variations. Or expressed any depression to you?<eos> You got food all over you.<eos> I just wanted to come... come and sit next to you.
Excuse... excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Is this happening?<eos> Who was that girl I saw you with at the hotel?
Welcome back, Danny.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, that's me done, Tee.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm following you in.
Corporal, what in the living hell are you doing son?<eos> Vail?<eos> Corporal Vail?<eos> Dammit.<eos> Corporal Vail, do you hear me talking to you?
Nick?<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick?<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> I followed you!
You did this for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have made so many many mistakes.<eos> But not this time.<eos> Not you.
But, Smurfette, the Forbidden Forest?<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I have to at least warn that lost village.<eos> Well, we're Team Smurf, and we stick together.<eos> So, we're coming with you.
- Hey, Smurfette.<eos> - Clumsy!<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'm coming, Clumsy bro.<eos> I got you, little buddy.
- Seems like a Bucky to me.<eos> Hit it, Bucky!<eos> Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.
It's not my purpose to help him.<eos> I'm meant to save those Smurfs.<eos> And we're gonna help you.<eos> We're Team Smurf, and we're in this together.<eos> And by "together," I mean me and you.
I swear it.<eos> Release me, Merlin, from your care.<eos> My duty's done. 'Tis only fair.<eos> I'm afraid that's not possible, friend Demon.<eos> I apologize to both you and Jason Blood, but your future portends a shared destiny.
I hear you very well.<eos> Do you know my opinion?<eos> I think we owe ourselves To live every day we have.<eos> I feel I really want Get to know you more.<eos> I share a meal with you.
Well, you guarantee me a bit, I love you too.<eos> Go and achieve success.<eos> I will do, young man.<eos> See you later, Dad.<eos> I was bothering you Long ago, "Murphy".
Time to work!<eos> I'll go, Sam.<eos> - Where did they go?<eos> - I do not know!<eos> I thought they were with you!
Am I catching you at a bad time?<eos> - What is it, LeFou?<eos> - A certain damsel is in distress.<eos> It's hero time.<eos> I'm not done with you yet.
I need a minute alone with him.<eos> Are you so cold-hearted... you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye?<eos> Forever can spare a minute.<eos> When this door closes, it will not open again.<eos> I should have been with you.
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston<eos> Even when taking your lumps<eos> There's no man in town as admired as you<eos> You're everyone's favorite guy<eos> Everyone's awed and inspired by you
I told you to join me for dinner.<eos> And I told you no.<eos> What time is it?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I'd starve before I ever ate with you.
When we return to the village... you will marry me.<eos> And that beast's head...<eos> - will hang on our wall.<eos> - Never!<eos> I'm coming for you, beast.
I thought that you were never coming back.<eos> I'm so sorry I got us into this.<eos> The other night at the hotel, what did you mean when you said that your relationship was the only thing you were good at?<eos> You're always doing such fun stuff, Kate.<eos> Traveling around the world doing crazy things, guys always chasing after you.
I've got the spare tank.<eos> Kate, get down.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Where is it, Lisa?<eos> It's right above you, don't move.
Yeah, not for long.<eos> You get him back in his ride, take him out to the wash and dump him.<eos> What if he wakes up before I get there?<eos> Text me where you are.<eos> We'll pick you up.
Hey!<eos> You'll get it back after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into.<eos> - No, Logan. - What?<eos> I think the...<eos> Logan, the woman that you met, that's not her mother.
- Stay here.<eos> - Don't move.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> He will be back for you.
Charles.<eos> Charles!<eos> Going up.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> You all right?
I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.<eos> So much easier for you.<eos> Easier?<eos> Jesus!<eos> There is nothing easy about you, Charles, nothing!
And he's goin' on and on, and he's calling you a bitch, and a big fat pussy, and a little fucking pussy bitch, and he says that you're his bitch.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I couldn't believe it.<eos> He just keeps going on and on and on that he wants to fight you.
You could just go over there.<eos> And I'd stay here if you're worried about losing your seat.<eos> I can see that that's not it.<eos> Okay. I tell you what.<eos> I'll go over there, and if he nods like this that means he wants to fight you now.
How about...<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> - Honey, what...<eos> - Hey.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
- Let's get out there.<eos> Let's go. - Okay, let's do this.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Trisha, this song is for you.<eos> I don't fuck with you
That I'd rather fuckin' do<eos> All right, fuck it.<eos> This what we're doing?<eos> All right.<eos> Than to be fucking with you

Then you post it up Thinkin' that it's makin' me sick<eos> But I see you calling I be makin' it quick<eos> I'mma answer that shit like I don't fuck with you<eos> You little stupid ass bitch I ain't fucking with you<eos> You little dumb ass bitch I ain't fucking with you
You little stupid ass bitch I ain't fucking with you<eos> You little dumb ass bitch I ain't fucking with you<eos> I got a million trillion things That I'd rather fucking do<eos> Okay, music stopped.<eos> Than to be fucking with you
Holly.<eos> We've been flirting, like, all fucking year.<eos> I've been, like, ignoring you all year.<eos> Oh.<eos> Because I've been playing games with you all year.
- Boom.<eos> Up top!<eos> Down low.<eos> - Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.
Hello.<eos> Who is this?<eos> So I just walked over.<eos> I don't know what came over me and I just said, "I'm not leaving here until...<eos> "Until I meet you.
- No, about yesterday...<eos> No, no.<eos> I came by unannounced.<eos> It was...<eos> No, I shouldn't have talked to you like that.
What are you doing?<eos> No.<eos> This is God's stone.<eos> - I'm giving it back to him!<eos> The devil has you, boy.
Surprise!<eos> That's when it happened.<eos> I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.<eos> You said he'd felt unwell?<eos> You all right?
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.<eos> I swear to you, I thought you were dead.<eos> I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
West highest mountain peak.<eos> Over.<eos> Fox Six confirm, we're at the Sea Stallion.<eos> Chapman, hold your position.<eos> We'll come to you.
Not me.<eos> Not now.<eos> Now, you just listen to me for once in your stupid life.<eos> I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken.<eos> But if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who'll you have then?
What were you doing!<eos> -He's in distress, I'm helping him!<eos> -Restrain him now, do it.<eos> -I was trying to help him!<eos> -Sherlock, what was he doing to you?
You know who.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Nothing's impossible.<eos> You of all people know that.<eos> Coming to get you.
- You used that to scare me.<eos> - No.<eos> You turned my sister into a ghost story.<eos> Of course I didn't.<eos> - I monitored you.
Memories can resurface.<eos> Wounds can reopen.<eos> The roads we walk have demons beneath.<eos> And yours have been waiting for a very long time.<eos> I never bullied you.
The roads we walk have demons beneath.<eos> And yours have been waiting for a very long time.<eos> I never bullied you.<eos> I used, at discrete intervals, potential trigger words to update myself as to your mental condition.<eos> I was looking after you.
- Home.<eos> - No. I mean, what airport?<eos> Enough for now!<eos> Time to play a new game.<eos> Look on the table in front of you.
I just spoke to the girl on the plane again.<eos> - We've been out for hours. - What, she still up there?<eos> Yes.<eos> The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel.<eos> - Is Mycroft with you?
You better start packing.<eos> What?<eos> You don't get it, Templeton.<eos> If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula.<eos> I will turn into a normal baby... and live here forever with you.
But how do we get past Scary Poppins down there?<eos> Okay.<eos> There must be something we can do.<eos> Hey, it's not that bad.<eos> Are you okay?
Now, eyes ahead.<eos> I said eyes ahead, son!<eos> Buttocks up!<eos> Now pedal like you mean it!<eos> Either you run the day, or the day runs you.
No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> They're gone.<eos> I failed.<eos> I would've gotten to my parents if I didn't have to go back for you! What?
No!<eos> Mom, Dad, I'm coming!<eos> Is that you?<eos> Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I got this!<eos> Are you okay? Is the baby all right?
He's goddang precious!<eos> Psst! Hey, twig!<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Aw, man... what did they do to you?
Yeah, it was.<eos> One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.<eos> Perhaps its very greatest.<eos> Yes!<eos> Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.
Yondu, we're about to blow!<eos> Get to the ship!<eos> Not without Quill!<eos> You need to take care of the twig!<eos> Not without you!
He did call you twig.<eos> Nebula...<eos> I was a child like you.<eos> I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.<eos> And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.
I hav...<eos> I haven't done anything wrong.<eos> Could... could you tell me what this is about?<eos> We can talk about that at the station.<eos> I want to come with you.
Supposed to be something happening here tonight.<eos> The stars turn... and the time presents itself.<eos> Hawk, watch carefully.<eos> I will, Margaret.<eos> I'm too weak to go with you.
Gordon, I trust you.<eos> You know that.<eos> And I believe you're on the trail of something big.<eos> Big.<eos> Will Albert be with you?
Yeah.<eos> You better have.<eos> There's... there's one problem.<eos> I don't know you yet.<eos> I'm gonna be watching you, kid.
You better have.<eos> There's... there's one problem.<eos> I don't know you yet.<eos> I'm gonna be watching you, kid.<eos> I'm watching you.
Where the hell they got ya?<eos> Oh, no kidding.<eos> Damn.<eos> I'm sorry, Harry.<eos> Uh, just wanted to talk to you about a few things.
- No, you didn't!<eos> - No, you didn't!<eos> And I knew you'd say that!<eos> See?<eos> We aren't so different, I and you.
And it'll be more fun if we all do it together!<eos> What's the worst thing that could happen?<eos> What are you so afraid of?<eos> The thing I'm most afraid of?<eos> I gotta be honest with you.
Jet engine brake in here and...<eos> Get out of here. No.<eos> Give me... No! Stop it!<eos> Come on, Master Dick. We need to help him.<eos> I'm with you, Grandpa!
I am not gonna be part of a one-sided relationship any longer!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - You and I are done!<eos> - What is wrong with you?
Exactly.<eos> Hey, Joy! Joy, hey. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> I've been waiting to talk to you.
Aw, too late then, huh?<eos> See?<eos> He loves me.<eos> Jesus, Dad.<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, my God!<eos> Heather, stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> Heather...<eos> We got you, Danny.
Marc Jacobs.<eos> You mind if we go inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's cool.<eos> I wanna be fair with you, Danny.
Tempting, but, uh, I have an early morning deadline.<eos> Ellison?<eos> Listen, don't give the front page to Karen.<eos> I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.<eos> - What happened to you?
Ellison?<eos> Listen, don't give the front page to Karen.<eos> I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> - What happened to you?
They don't have to.<eos> They own the pier.<eos> I just need you to watch my back.<eos> You're joking.<eos> You want me to come with you?
Do this tomorrow.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> Fine.<eos> No more bullshit.<eos> I'm going with you.
We haven't got much time.<eos> Too risky. Sundown.<eos> Of course.<eos> Danny, what you're talking about is crazy.<eos> I'll go with you.
- Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come here.<eos> You just gotta let me know you're safe.<eos> I'm here for you.
For now, keep doing as you are.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> Okay.<eos> Danny.<eos> What happened to you?
Just incredible.<eos> Yeah, this image, the serpent, do you know what it means?<eos> Did you know about the offices on the 13th floor?<eos> Well, if I had known, I would have had Ward charge her rent.<eos> Hey, I've always been honest with you, Danny.
Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.<eos> Harold?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> The hell is wrong with you?
I've seen someone else take on the Hand.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I've already made up my mind.<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you both into my fight, but, hopefully, this trip will end the Hand's story in all of our lives.<eos> I'm going with you.
Wow.<eos> Old school.<eos> I've had it since I was ten.<eos> You must've been a pretty gangsta ten-year-old.<eos> So what's going on with you and Miss Thang?
Killing... is wrong, no matter who pulls the trigger or why.<eos> I wonder if you'd feel the same way if someone killed your mother and father.<eos> An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.<eos> It's an easy opinion to have... when you're not the Iron Fist.<eos> I think Gandhi might disagree with you.
Mom!<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> We got you, Danny.
Nothing she says will make you feel better about that.<eos> Let's just be done with this.<eos> So now you're ganging up on me?<eos> We're not.<eos> We're with you.
He always does.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went up to your roof for his meditations.<eos> He needs to restore his chi so he can summon the Iron Fist for our battle with the Hand.<eos> He told me to watch over you.
If I have to.<eos> Uh, it's... just the pizza.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I should go with you.
- Danny told you.<eos> - So it's true?<eos> You're in the Hand.<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> I don't know that he wants to talk to you.
- Guarding the pass.<eos> - Guarding K'un-Lun.<eos> Danny?<eos> I didn't know where else you would go.<eos> Is Bakuto with you?
- To do what?<eos> To become the kind of people who help make the world a better place.<eos> He's getting them jobs in hospitals and businesses.<eos> He's using them for his own means.<eos> It's the same thing he's doing to you.
and that's to see the Hand destroyed.<eos> And then you go back to K'un-Lun?<eos> Davos, could you give us a minute?<eos> I'll be outside... keeping guard.<eos> Danny, I don't like what's happening to you.
Your job was to tell Bakuto if you found Danny.<eos> Brian, Mary.<eos> You guys been keeping up with your training?<eos> - You need to come with us.<eos> - Bakuto wants to talk to you.
And besides, you don't even have a license.<eos> - Do you have a license?<eos> - No, but it's different.<eos> I'm rich.<eos> Well, last time I drove with you, you wrecked Brother Kuo's cart, remember?
Hey.<eos> You know, last week, if you would have told me that I'd be here, working with my daughter, I wouldn't have believed it.<eos> Reunion would be a hell of a lot better if we weren't taking down drug dealers.<eos> Oh, well, we take our blessings where we can find 'em.<eos> You used to say that to me when I'd sit with you during your chemo treatments.
- He needs us.<eos> - No.<eos> He's always been a bastard to me.<eos> Ever since he... came back from the dead, it's like a... It's like a piece of his soul got left in the grave.<eos> He will use you, hurt you, and throw you aside without a second thought.
- Oh, you've lost it, son.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.
I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> I'll come with you.
Wait, what?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm gonna come back for you, Bakuto.
Nobody wanted to be captured by him.<eos> So what?<eos> You want your own personal Sack Man?<eos> Oh, not just mine.<eos> There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.
Who wouldn't?<eos> A little off?<eos> I watched him go at two dead men with a claw hammer.<eos> I can tell you where he made me dump the bodies.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
So fuck you.<eos> - That's not what I want.<eos> - Oh, what do you want?<eos> You want fucking 12 virgins or something?<eos> I want to get to know you.
War's over, bro.<eos> Bro?<eos> Whatever, man.<eos> It's an interesting choice of words.<eos> And yet I disagree with you, bro.
Go on?<eos> What about Sergeant Matthews?<eos> Did he get baked?<eos> Did Dean?<eos> I ain't talking about fucking Dean with you, you dirty fucking Hajji.
If I were you, I would start talking, Isaac.<eos> Tell me about Dean.<eos> What's the obsession?<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - It's interesting to me the bond between you and your brothers.
That was foolish, Isaac.<eos> I could've shot you.<eos> I could've easily shot you.<eos> Ize.<eos> I just want to have a conversation with you, Isaac.
You didn't win shit.<eos> From a place you will not see...<eos> Just a flash of fucking light.<eos> Boom.<eos> When I'm done with you and Matthews everyone will know who the winner is.
Thought she'd be bigger.<eos> Says she was following a client.<eos> - I bet this scared the shit out of her.<eos> - Rumor is, she ain't scared of much.<eos> Well, she ain't met you.
Then we tried anyway.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Talking to you.
Then that path comes to an end.<eos> Last one?<eos> I'm glad you found others.<eos> Don't act like this is normal.<eos> Don't act like I don't know what's really going on with you.
She didn't kill me.<eos> She had...<eos> She had the chance.<eos> Don't try to make sense of this.<eos> 'Cause with you or without you, when the time comes... whatever is living inside the body of Elektra Natchios is gonna have to die.
We want him alive.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> We work together, we walk out of here alive.<eos> No!<eos> Wait, I just wanna talk to you.
I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.<eos> That's your name.<eos> Elektra.<eos> What have they done to you?
There's nothing left to talk about.<eos> It feels as if fate has brought us back together, doesn't it?<eos> What do you want with Danny?<eos> They sent me for him, yes.<eos> But I came for you.
Yeah.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.<eos> I'm gonna need a little more than that.<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> They came for you before, Karen.
You are afraid of dying.<eos> We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.<eos> I was willing to work with you.
Thank you.<eos> I like it here.<eos> Back in New York?<eos> No.<eos> Back with you.
- For now.<eos> But I care about a lot more people than we can fit in a police station.<eos> And I know you do, too.<eos> This city is at stake.<eos> Me and you...
But I feel the need to make amends.<eos> I thought that entire vintage had been destroyed in the fires at Marseille.<eos> You'd be surprised what you can find at the bottom of the Balearic Sea.<eos> Go on.<eos> I did not originally want to leave K'un-Lun with you.
Yeah, Danny.<eos> They took Danny.<eos> And then now, I have to save him from the Hand.<eos> You are in no position to save anybody.<eos> They haven't pressed charges, but they found you with two dead bodies.
I am well aware.<eos> Did you hear what that cop said?<eos> If you're ever investigated, you lose everything.<eos> They'd reopen every case.<eos> Matter of fact, I come with you.
Look, I don't give a shit what you guys are doing... down here in your secret cave thing.<eos> I just came to talk.<eos> You started this.<eos> Ever since you burst into my office, my life has become one big kung fu party.<eos> I don't wanna fight you.
You didn't have to do that.<eos> I know.<eos> It's been a hell of a week.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had it with you.
Look, I-I got to sleep, okay?<eos> I can't think straight.<eos> - I... ah, Christ... is he snoring?<eos> - Yeah. Snoring's the worst.<eos> I'm gonna need to crash - next to you, all right?
When he's done uptown, you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?<eos> We'll just have to take care of ourselves.<eos> Oh, yeah? For how long?<eos> And how much blood?<eos> You kill Santino, the Camorra, and the High Table come for you.
You kill Santino, the Camorra, and the High Table come for you.<eos> I kill Santino, they come for me.<eos> He's offered $7 million for your life.<eos> Seven million dollars is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.<eos> So I guess you have a choice.
What's going on with you, man?
Now, can I get that watch, or... - Hey, Dee, I think he just wants his watch. - I think he needs his...<eos> - Yeah, I understand.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> Rock bottom? Me?<eos> Uh, hey, buddy, how about when your daughter stopped talking to you...
You know? It just makes sense.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Here's the thing, man. I can't do it without you.<eos> I need you to get my back.<eos> Oh, uh, you want me to strip with you?
Huh?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I got my eye on you, loser.
Your drug dealer?<eos> Your skeezy little arrogant douche bag friends down at the bar?<eos> - Those guys are my friends!<eos> - Whatever!<eos> I am so onto you.
Anastasia.<eos> It was you. Wasn't it? You just went and buy all of this?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> For you.
- Let's talk.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just talk please.<eos> Have dinner with me.<eos> Okay, fine. I'll have dinner with you.
I'm not taking any chances.<eos> - Hey, Mr Grey!<eos> - The Yacht.<eos> That's the crew. We'll be here to the morning.<eos> If something would've happened to you because of me.
If something would've happened to you because of me.<eos> It won't.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen to me.<eos> Are these burns?<eos> Who did this to you?
But I would like to take you there myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean of course, I would rather see New York with you.
Miss Steele.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'm just gonna grab some stuff and check them out.<eos> - I should go over help with you.
- I just need to think a little bit.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get up.<eos> What are you doing?
This job isn't easy.<eos> We're meeting women in crisis.<eos> Some have mental health issues.<eos> It's challenging.<eos> But I've watched you in training, in pilot sessions, in real-life situations.
Careful, Mother.<eos> There's an apple and tree analogy lurking.<eos> You guys ready to order?<eos> Here's an idea.<eos> Stop thinking about me and you... and start thinking about what's best for the child.
Yeah.<eos> Why are you so mad all of a sudden?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> I'm annoyed.<eos> Not with you, dear.
If I was the dad of a little girl and I never saw her... and I was in the same town...<eos> I would visit her.<eos> Well, I hope you're happy.<eos> He didn't even need directions.<eos> He could've followed you here.
It wasn't her death she was talking about.<eos> I tried to talk her out of it.<eos> But you know how Diane could be when she made her mind up about something.<eos> I called MIT.<eos> Shankland's out of his mind about the possibility of publishing it with you.
I didn't get a chance to say this earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.<eos> Thank you for what you did on the beach.<eos> So you are here to let me go?<eos> I tried, but it's not up to me.<eos> I even asked them to send me with you..
- I understand that.<eos> Women and children!<eos> We need to make our next position by sunset.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> What is the matter with you?
- Too dangerous?<eos> - Yes, too dangerous.<eos> And you are too distracting.<eos> Look, I will go in there, to find.. ...where ever they are working on the gas or better yet, where it is.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
And we could return this world to the paradise it was before them.<eos> Forever.<eos> I...<eos> I can never be a part of that.<eos> My dear, I don't want to fight you.
Take me with you.<eos> - What? - Dad. You're short handed.<eos> This is too important.<eos> You won't get anyone else.<eos> I'm coming with you.
And I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> I'm not pregnant.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> It's not about what I want or what you want.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there,<eos> I am the crocodile at the watering hole.<eos> We've got one last job to do.<eos> Cipher.<eos> If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
This...<eos> This is for my son.<eos> Dom!<eos> You're out of bullets, Deckard.<eos> Not like I'm gonna need a gun to take care of you.
No, no, James.<eos> Your mother came from Naples.<eos> He bought some land and he bought a wife.<eos> And he bought them both for gunpowder.<eos> He told me never to speak to you of buying her.
Nothing you could tell me about that man would surprise me.<eos> He was half human at the end and he would squat right here and make deals with ghosts in the flames.<eos> And he would speak in a language that was like...<eos> It was like ravens fighting.<eos> And he would talk to you, James.
What are you doing with the door?<eos> You want a bush, you come through me.<eos> That is private property.<eos> Helga, it's so good to see that you're still working... even still alive.<eos> You know that I lay with you when I was just a little boy.
I will give you all the information that you request.<eos> In return, I will need a single meeting with Sir Stuart Strange.<eos> If your witness is Delaney, he is being held in the Tower of London, charged with treason.<eos> No, I have another witness.<eos> When my ship is ready, I will send for you.
Indeed, Your Majesty.<eos> We have to release Delaney.<eos> Aye.<eos> It will happen.<eos> On you, Bill, yeah?
There are no practical difficulties.<eos> Apart from that great big river that connects us.<eos> Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?<eos> I would laugh at you, but you're not well.
Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account... he will secure it and keep you safe.<eos> Safe?<eos> Safe?<eos> When my ship is ready, I will send for you.
Your leaving England was the click of the hypnotist's fingers.<eos> I woke from a trance and realised the depth of our sin.<eos> I have found forgiveness in God and in my husband, and I want no part in your plans or your future.<eos> But we are the future.<eos> Your husband is already passed and you can see that by the way that he follows you.
You see it dance among the seas and stars and glowing around the moon, but in these days, the glow is dying.<eos> What will be in the darkness that remains?<eos> The Truman brothers are both true men.<eos> They are your brothers.<eos> And the others, the good ones who have been with you.
Knock 'em dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> Red door.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is with you, bradley?
Renege on a contract?<eos> That's what I will do.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> Okay, Audrey.<eos> I'll go with you.
I d...<eos> I feel like I'm somewhere else.<eos> Have you ever had that feeling, Charlie?<eos> Like I'm somewhere else and... and like I'm somebody else.<eos> Have you ever felt that?
I think you know.<eos> Andy, Bobby, take him downstairs.<eos> You're making a big mistake!<eos> You made the mistake, Chad.<eos> We've been watching you for months.
- Can I talk to you?
- No, Aria, ice panty liners.<eos> I'm looking that up.<eos> Remember when we used to look up murder weapons indistinctive traits of psychopaths exhibiting signs of hyperreality disorder?<eos> And that rush we got when we thought we were close to finding out who A was.<eos> That tingly feeling you get when you know A was watching you.
Um, she had to reschedule.<eos> Between the two of us, we have to know someone who knows someone who can take care of her.<eos> Claire, are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Is Addison bullying you?
I didn't even know about Mary Drake.<eos> At first, I thought Wren was putting me on.<eos> But then he pulled out his phone showed me your picture.<eos> I still don't know why, but I started to cry.<eos> He just ran into you?
Please, Wren!<eos> - I can't do this!<eos> - Do it!<eos> - Hey. - It's okay.<eos> I got you, I got you, I got you...
- I can't do this!<eos> - Do it!<eos> - Hey. - It's okay.<eos> I got you, I got you, I got you...<eos> The plan was to be you.
I am the power.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> I won't be gone for long, I promise.<eos> Then let me come with you.
She's just a doll to me.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'm gonna miss my flight.<eos> No, I'll drive you.<eos> It'll be too hard to say goodbye to you.
- Do not.<eos> Look there.<eos> You understand, the devil knows what this piece of iron.<eos> And here's good news.<eos> With you will go to the deputy parliamentary group.
- Tëm.<eos> - You're the doctor allowed to stand?<eos> You gave?<eos> A little, well, what are you doing?<eos> I'm with you.
After high school, once back home.<eos> It's clear?<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Yuille, you know, right now I have things to do.<eos> I can not always keep an eye on you.
Fuck it.<eos> I do not need handouts from him.<eos> Tëm, can you hear me?<eos> It is necessary to me.<eos> I want to talk with you!
- My dad.<eos> He has something.<eos> Stiles, is this you?<eos> Alright, just remember this - Canaan.<eos> We're comin' to get you.
So you don't care if they get to you?<eos> They're gonna get to all of us eventually.<eos> You!<eos> You're going first.<eos> That's the only reason I'm with you.
Just hanging out with my dead sister?<eos> Having a good time catching up on childhood memories?<eos> I think you were rotting down there.<eos> Liam finally gets one thing right.<eos> I also think whatever happened to you, you deserved it.
Can you see the books?<eos> I see them.<eos> Concentrate on them.<eos> The books on the shelves are your memories.<eos> Everything that's ever happened to you.
It was at your feet.<eos> I'm gonna put it away, okay?<eos> It's getting dark.<eos> We should try and find some food.<eos> Am I coming with you?
I chose this path.<eos> Service over pleasure.<eos> And I cannot stray.<eos> There may be other villages like this.<eos> People like the Alderman, who refuse to follow you.
So... the girl who fell from the sky.<eos> Jane, look at this.<eos> It's working.<eos> I'm working.<eos> I'm proud of you, Jack.
No.<eos> I'd rather hoped you'd want to stay in my care.<eos> Then why are you leaving?<eos> The princess met you... she liked you, and...<eos> Now she owns you.
- Us. Jack.<eos> What have you done to me?<eos> Saved your life, of course.<eos> This is lady ev.<eos> The Princess owns you.
- Because I know you.<eos> I know the man you are.<eos> And I'll prove it.<eos> I'll clear your name.<eos> Let me come with you.
Did it reveal anything new?<eos> You knew it wouldn't.<eos> Yet you let her see him anyway.<eos> What sway does she have over you?<eos> You left... before I finished with you.
I don't want to.<eos> You have to.<eos> Children can't be corrected if they don't know what they've done wrong.<eos> Show her.<eos> Show her what she did to you.
I will return with all the soldiers of ev, and we will turn your Emerald City red with blood.<eos> Make these guns.<eos> We take them to war.<eos> A war on magic!<eos> I should be coming with you.
How did you feel when you witnessed that birth?<eos> Alone.<eos> Because you knew it was something we could never share.<eos> Because I was...<eos> I was neither with you... nor with her.
I need my mother.<eos> And if I told you where she was, you wouldn't run and tell the Wizaed, would you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I swear.<eos> I stand before you anew.
I know I'm Queen, but still.<eos> Is everyone really that crippled?<eos> - I-i didn't mean...<eos> - What did you mean?<eos> Only that I've been waiting all day to be with you.
It's true.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> Then prove it.<eos> You're free.<eos> I release my hold on you.
But...<eos> This is what I've always been.<eos> This is who I really am.<eos> You were born a girl.<eos> And if you don't change yourself back into one, no one will follow you.
- get inside.<eos> Get in.<eos> We have to go!<eos> Just hold on tight.<eos> I'll be right behind you.
That'd make a lot more sense if I didn't need him just as badly as he needs me.<eos> I don't believe you do.<eos> Whatever he is to you, whatever you are to him... I don't believe you need him to be the man you are.<eos> I think you would be a very good king.<eos> If I were a no-good pirate, I would follow you wherever you led.
Or the time when we went camping?<eos> I said, "Fucking mosquitos bite the shit out of me." Doesn't matter as long as our skin doesn't come in touch with DEET.<eos> What is your point, Nathan?<eos> My point is I did a lot of fucked-up things in our marriage, a lot of hoops I jumped through for you, and now I'm doing those same things for Bonnie.<eos> Personally, I'd rather shove an electric eel up my ass and have it gnaw through my intestines than sit down with you and fucking Psycho Ed.
I didn't want to tell him, but he knew I was keeping something from him.<eos> He says it's not safe, and I think he might be right, you guys.<eos> It might be better to have him there with us. Madeline?<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Can I talk to you, please?
I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.<eos> Trees bow, and warriors fall.<eos> Give me your blessing. Ohh!<eos> I bow my head before you and worship you.
I'm not fighting you.<eos> Real gold, if you're wondering.<eos> Win or lose, and you're gonna lose.<eos> It's yours if you fight me.<eos> He said he doesn't want to fight you.
Telling you I don't know.<eos> Would you tell me even if you did?<eos> Probably not.<eos> As you say, I work for Mr. Wednesday.<eos> Well, then why the fuck am I wasting my time sitting here talking to you?
Are you still working for the man?<eos> I was. About that, we have a problem here.<eos> A...<eos> A problem with me? No.<eos> Not with you, you.
St. Nick took the same deal you did.<eos> The only reason why you're relevant today is because Easter is a Christian holiday.<eos> It's religious Darwinism.<eos> Adapt and survive.<eos> What we have achieved together, you and I, is no small feat.
Logan King.<eos> Chris just told me that he felt much more comfortable with my being here.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Logan, I hate to tear you away dear, but the Wincott's were asking about you.<eos> Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris.
- Who?<eos> Georgina.<eos> I came here to talk to Rod and now I got no juice.<eos> So you think she did that because...?<eos> - Maybe she doesn't like ... the fact that I'm with you
But you shouldn't have been drinking either.<eos> Well, I will have to let you all get on the rest of this night without my marvelous wit.<eos> The whole ordeal has made me quite a bit exhausted.<eos> Why don't you just get some rest?<eos> It was nice meeting you, Chris.
- Okay, that was my fault.<eos> You were one of my favorites.<eos> You hear that, Chris?<eos> One of her favorites.<eos> Hey, it's Chris, I'm either away from the phone or I just don't want to talk to you.
You hear that, Chris?<eos> One of her favorites.<eos> Hey, it's Chris, I'm either away from the phone or I just don't want to talk to you.<eos> Peace.<eos> Hey, it's Chris, I'm either away from my phone or I just don't want to talk to you.
What the hell is this?<eos> - You don't have one.<eos> - I don't want one.<eos> Well, you need one.<eos> What if someone wants to talk to you?
Can you get out?<eos> I want you to get out!<eos> And take your man with you.<eos> Or I will break him open... Shh! Shh!<eos> I'm not going with you anywhere!
Look, cutie-pie, my bar's cleaner than any place you go, because it's mopped with bleach every day.<eos> Every day!<eos> It looks more like they just vanished.<eos> She just means it's bad luck, that's all.<eos> Shut up, I'm not talking to you.
The amount must be measured.<eos> Measured?<eos> You can take twice that much.<eos> But you can't lower the dose.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- I won't fit!<eos> I'll go and pull you from down there.<eos> Go on, Beard Boy, jump.<eos> Let's go.<eos> "...the Lord is with you, blessed art thou..."
Oh, look at us, a couple of college students hanging out on campus!<eos> (sighs) Is it weird having me here?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> It's awesome!<eos> - I'm so proud of you. - Hm.
And of course, the first couple of weeks back, we are gonna feel off, and I'm sure that we missed a really awesome Sigma Nu party or, like, a really exciting football game, but... how many people can say<eos> that they have seen the Terracotta Warriors or floated down the Li River?<eos> What about the night that we got our tattoos at the Lotus Festival?<eos> Would you really trade any of those nights just so you could be on track?<eos> I'm gonna miss living with you.
It's good news.<eos> Be happy.<eos> - [Karolina whimpering] - You.<eos> I don't know what...<eos> I don't know what I'm going to do about you.
No. Something happened, Eddie.<eos> Why run now?<eos> Someone got to you, didn't they?<eos> It was Marius, wasn't it?<eos> He got through to you, huh?
There's got to be new people in the casinos that don't know me, right?<eos> I saw Karolina.<eos> Well? How did she seem?<eos> She seems scared.<eos> She still doesn't want to talk to you.
- It's mellow.<eos> - I'm not...<eos> No paranoia.<eos> Okay. Yeah. Give it to me.<eos> Can I come with you?
I never did!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Do what I say.<eos> Not more, not less.<eos> You're being watched.
I'll see you around, Clay.<eos> Tony.<eos> Am I side two?<eos> Hey, Helmet.<eos> Can I eat with you?
That's for another tape.<eos> Hey, Joanne.<eos> Hazel. Hey.<eos> Are you following me?<eos> Um, I'm ahead of you.
- But I am.<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> Alex did this on his own.<eos> He just broke up with me on his own.<eos> I didn't know he broke up with you.
That if a butterfly flaps its wings at just the right time in just the right place... it can cause a hurricane thousands of miles away.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Is Justin here?<eos> Haven't seen him for days.<eos> I thought he was with you.
- Hey. Mrs. Antilly?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> What, like in the world?<eos> Or with you.
But you saw it.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't, like, trace the handwriting.<eos> I didn't think it was that big a deal.<eos> Do you think she's right?<eos> Does everything that happened to her go back to you and that list?
Group-texted half the school.<eos> Okay, look, calm down.<eos> No one can tell that's us.<eos> You don't think they'll figure it out?<eos> I shouldn't even be seen talking to you right now.
No snapping of arms.<eos> For days after Tyler's picture went around, I tried to catch your eye.<eos> You ignored me for weeks.<eos> But I decided enough was enough.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
- Nope, no "listen."<eos> What follows "listen" is nothing good.<eos> Let me put it this way.<eos> Repeat after me:<eos> "Marcus, I will definitely go out with you."
Clay, Brad.<eos> Brad...<eos> Clay.<eos> Uh, hey.<eos> Uh, I'm not following you.
Okay?<eos> You showed real strength of character.<eos> You always do.<eos> We don't agree on everything, but we can agree on that.<eos> Proud of you, pal.
Leave me alone!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> This shit that happens to you... I think some of it you bring on yourself.
Trust me.<eos> So that guy Brad... is he your boyfriend now?<eos> I hope he's still my boyfriend.<eos> He's been pretty annoyed lately because... I've been spending all my time with another guy.<eos> You.
You should come.<eos> It might be cool to actually hang out when we're not both covered in chewing gum.<eos> Don't be an enabler.<eos> I made a deal with myself.<eos> I'll watch out for you.
You're calling me a pussy, after what you did, or didn't do?<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> Cut it out!<eos> Whatever happens to us happens to you too.
Hey, guys.<eos> Clay.<eos> Dude, you're leaving?<eos> Uh, yeah, I kind of am.<eos> Looked like shit was happening for you in there.
No.<eos> Clay, you don't understand.<eos> I do understand.<eos> Every drama has to be your drama, or it doesn't count.<eos> Somehow this is all about you.
Let's see who can break it first.<eos> Like, break the light bulb?<eos> What are you, six?<eos> It's just a stupid light bulb.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Why aren't you?<eos> Cut it the fuck out.<eos> - Throw it back.<eos> - Jess, stop.<eos> Jess, what is happening with you?
- But part of me was saying, "Don't go."<eos> - Onward!<eos> Not even for Clay.<eos> I should have listened to that part of me.<eos> See, I never told you, Clay, but I've always admired you.
Go on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Going in.<eos> Going in.<eos> I'd talked to you a million times before, but... tonight was different, and...
Well, I look forward to it.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I actually didn't ride my bike here, so we can't do that.<eos> So, but I'll go get the drinks.<eos> Yeah, I think I'm gonna come with you if it's cool.
- Why?<eos> - My parents need me to work at the store.<eos> Which kind of sucks, because I really like working at the Crestmont.<eos> I do too.<eos> What I mean is, I like working with you.
They said you had the best...<eos> I hear you two like a guy between you.<eos> Did Justin finger you?<eos> I bet you went down on him.<eos> - And they all became you.
- I'm sorry, it's just that...<eos> Every time I was thrown out, when my mom was fucked up, one of her boyfriends was fucking with me... he was there for me.<eos> When I had no money, when I was starving, his folks bought my shit for school.<eos> Okay, when my mom was busted for possession, he got his dad to bail her out.<eos> They do that shit so they can own you.
Why not, Tyler?<eos> You got more secrets you're trying to hide?<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> No one's going to believe you.<eos> People'll just laugh at you, like they always do.
Respect.<eos> Jesus, Jensen.<eos> Respect.<eos> So she wanted it.<eos> She got in the hot tub with you.
but he seems to think that, uh, we may be able to get you out of having to go.<eos> And it's not that I don't have sympathy for these parents, kiddo, but you didn't have anything to do with this, and shouldn't have to be put through it.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> You're a good kid, Alex.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Okay.<eos> When?<eos> How about now?<eos> How about we walk right out those doors and hang out for a while?<eos> Are you okay?
And the comfort will grow stale.<eos> And casting about in the dark for some proof that you mattered and finding none, you'll know... that you gave it away... in this moment... on this island.<eos> Left it in the ground... along with that chest.<eos> This is not what I wanted.<eos> But I will stand here with you... for an hour, a day, a year... while you find a way to accept this outcome... so that we might leave here together.
Captain Ryan, the Nefrini people feel it is unfair that the Confederation is taxing our trade routes,<eos> - and we would ask you...<eos> - Blah, blah, blah.<eos> Do you see what my hand is doing, Nefrini?<eos> It's a puppet that is mocking you.
Hmm, you think this is where they live?<eos> Whoo, if they're actually alive.<eos> Do not be sad, my son.<eos> Father.<eos> Leonardo, I know you feel the weight of leading your family, but remember, I am always with you.
You gotta hand over your guns.<eos> We only have two.<eos> Okay.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Before we go in, you have a brain and a backbone, so I'm talking to you, not Gregory.
Benjamin not -- would not -- Man, I said now not!<eos> I said...<eos> Y'all just go.<eos> Do you really want to know what happened in Alexandria?<eos> What happened to you?
- Mm.<eos> Then you take the top loop, bring it down, up, and back through, then...<eos> Got it?<eos> Let me try.<eos> You know... we got lucky, having you with us.
I know you don't want this.<eos> Didn't want this, but I'm starting to understand what's on the menu now.<eos> We can hide like these people, we can keep trying to serve The Saviors, and I can watch you get randomly beaten every so often, or else we can fight.<eos> So, here we are.<eos> And being with you, well... it makes abject terror tolerable.
Just the opposite.<eos> See, this...<eos> Well, this could be the beginning.<eos> This knife is yours now.<eos> You can try to use it, take me out, but considering I am standing above you, holding a baseball bat, that doesn't seem real smart.
Whatever you decide, so it shall be.<eos> No pressure.<eos> And, again, I am sorry you had to see that, even though I know you have seen some things.<eos> I just want you to understand... we are not monsters.<eos> What did they do to you?
We do.<eos> We get you the guns, we fight together.<eos> Say yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> They're out there, so I'm gonna be there with you.
You made the right decision to come.<eos> The decision was made a long time ago, before any of us knew each other, when we were all strangers who would have just passed each other on the street before the world ended.<eos> And now we mean everything to each other.<eos> You were in trouble. You were trapped.<eos> Glenn didn't know you, but he helped you.
Oh, I think you do.<eos> Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum...<eos> Shoney's. or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.<eos> Relaxed enough?<eos> I admire you, Rick.
Nope. Regular blood.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Hi, sweetie.<eos> - Where are the kids?<eos> - Oh, th... they aren't with you?
- Dad?<eos> - Hi, sweetie.<eos> - Where are the kids?<eos> - Oh, th... they aren't with you?<eos> I thought they were with you.
But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.<eos> Nobody needs anything.<eos> Okay, it's fine.<eos> I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?<eos> Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you?
Do it.<eos> Okay, you win, Pickle Man.<eos> I'm unsealing the building.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm coming for you now.
- We didn't just play good.<eos> That hand I got, ten hearts, that doesn't just happen.<eos> That's, what have you, fate or luck.<eos> - Plus my steely gaze. Striking fear into the hearts of the elderly.<eos> - I'm proud of you mister.
All the time you were gone, Dan.<eos> I prayed that Eric would find you and bring you home.<eos> Those terrible events... we, we wouldn't have survived them without you.<eos> I don't know if you even know I'm here.<eos> Know it's me talking to you.
- Happy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So you took his head. As a souvenir?<eos> He didn't need it.<eos> - Who's been living with you?
I believe in miracles.<eos> I don't.<eos> Especially the recent test results.<eos> Good morning, Eric.<eos> Everything okay with you and Hildur?
- I'm running late.<eos> Um, hey, just... just take a second, please?<eos> Listen, I think the idea behind what you're doing, it's extremely noble.<eos> What other 16-year-old even has a social conscience, you know?<eos> So, I'm proud of you.
Get in the car.<eos> Are you?<eos> Are you trying to be funny?<eos> Trying to be serious.<eos> What is going on with you?
Is it possible your heart aches 'cause the other kids were told not to play with you?<eos> 'Cause I would certainly understand that.<eos> Friends play with me.<eos> Josh, Chloe, Skye, Amabella.<eos> Amabella Klein plays with you?
I really underestimated what a compassionate soul you are.<eos> But I was just protecting my friend.<eos> - She's just a little bit drunk.<eos> - And I'm sorry I was so horrible.<eos> Celeste. Can I talk to you for a minute?
I think she just needs a minute. I...<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I'm talking to my wife, not you.<eos> Celeste, let's... Let's just go now.<eos> - We have to talk about it. - No!<eos> I'm not coming home with you.
But instead, I am stuck here for as long as it takes to fix this.<eos> In order to do that, you are going to have to give me something to fix it with.<eos> But you'd better come up with something of value I can use to get him to walk away from this.<eos> You think you can control him.<eos> And by the time you realize he has been controlling you, it is going to be too late.
Ever, Kevin.<eos> We're going forever.<eos> Uh, I don't... I don't understand.<eos> Without Matt?<eos> All of those years that he took care of you?
Well, I can't believe you're saying this, kid, after all...<eos> Let me finish. It's not, you know, easy.<eos> You've done good here, real good.<eos> With Stella, and the business...<eos> And I just wanna say, I'm proud of you, and you don't owe me anything.
I...<eos> I needed socks, thanks.<eos> Don't thank us, thank Santa.<eos> I should, um, go check on the ragout.<eos> Let me help you.
You'd rather die than live in a world with bears in the sky.<eos> I can help you.<eos> - First, you must do something for me.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Gotta fight you?
You'll try, but the gun will jam, or worse it'll backfire and you'll lose two fingers.<eos> Don't push your luck.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> You look like you've seen better days, friend.<eos> - You okay there?
- Cat.<eos> - Goat.<eos> Big, rank, stinking goat.<eos> Mad Sweeney, you look like a man who's fallen on hard times from a great height.<eos> Thought I wasn't gonna see you until Wisconsin.
I ran a new credit check.<eos> She says she has collateral.<eos> Okay. I'll go.<eos> Knowing Libby, it's silverware and jewelry, same as before.<eos> Well, if you want, yeah, I can go with you.
Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.<eos> Just as everyone knows you're already convinced they're cheating on it.<eos> Where's my lawyer?<eos> Where's Mr. Hashem?<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
He's not.<eos> First of all, we... We don't have access to actual conversations, just a record of their calls.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Even if we did, this is the kind of thing that kills careers.<eos> I shouldn't even be talking to you.
I hope not.<eos> Otherwise, you should feel free to ask the Director for someone you're more comfortable with.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I think I'll stick with you.
Right there in front of him.<eos> Huggies.<eos> White wrapper.<eos> Right there.<eos> Right there, right in front of you.
- That, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I said, "Wait."<eos> Doesn't seem wrong to you, being here?<eos> I've been trying to reach you.
It won't be long.<eos> Nothing for now, thanks.<eos> Right out front, sir.<eos> What did I say last time?<eos> I can't be seen with you.
It's Carrie Mathison.<eos> Her foundation represented the bomber.<eos> She's what's pulling you back to New York, isn't that it?<eos> No.<eos> The sway she holds over you... and Saul, I'll never understand...
It's related.<eos> The intelligence community hates her.<eos> And you're caught in the middle.<eos> I must say I'm impressed.<eos> Don't be... I was married to you for 27 years.
Apparently he's developed a real hard-on for the President-elect.<eos> Has he?<eos> Don't give me that horseshit.<eos> You know damn well that's the story you're pushing out there.<eos> Is the Senator there with you?
You go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna ride with Keane.<eos> You sure?<eos> - What about Quinn?<eos> - Is he there, too-- with you now?
I didn't really get into detail. I thought it would be better in person.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> We should.<eos> I don't even mean the immunity part.<eos> I mean, you know, what's going on with you.
Charlie?<eos> - Charlie?<eos> - Alex.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How come nobody's with you?
You're gonna be all right, okay?<eos> We've got you.<eos> Mag.<eos> That was quick.<eos> We were right behind you.
This thing's really starting to kill.<eos> Unfortunately, you are maxed out, my friend.<eos> - I'd like a second opinion.<eos> - He's right. No more meds.<eos> Well, you're no fun.
Leslie, can we talk?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> This is my company.<eos> What's the issue here?<eos> Leslie, these gentlemen want to talk to you.
I got a tattoo.<eos> A couple hundred more and I'll catch up with you.<eos> Let's have a baby.<eos> What?<eos> I wanna have a baby with you.
- Who was that?<eos> - Work.<eos> I need to go to Australia.<eos> Just for a couple of days.<eos> Can I come with you?
They knew pretty much everything, actually.<eos> Well, then they know about me.<eos> I'm sure they do.<eos> And they still think you're gonna get into this thing?<eos> And what if they ask why I came down here with you?
You gonna look your dad up?<eos> - Look him up?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I thought that's why you wanted to come down here.<eos> No, I came down here to be with you.
I have to go.<eos> - Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They want me to get on a bus.<eos> - You want me to go with you?
- Laurie, it's Kevin.<eos> Are you alone?<eos> What?<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Is John with you?
Leave a message.<eos> Hello.<eos> I don't know if you're getting my messages, but I'm sure you're aware there's been a nuclear incident in the South Pacific, but I've secured transportation.<eos> I...<eos> I'm coming to get you, Kevin.
Hey!<eos> I saw you. I know what you did.<eos> You think you can get away with this?<eos> Don't ignore me!<eos> I'm talking to you.
Where's everybody?<eos> Inside, sleeping.<eos> I drugged their food.<eos> Jesus, Laurie.<eos> Well, I wanted to talk to you.
To who?<eos> The Prime Minister of Australia.<eos> Gentlemen, can the president and I have the room, please?<eos> Yes, if you can...<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you? !
You're not the fucking Secretary of Defense.<eos> Oh, yes, yes, I am.<eos> You named me Secretary of Defense.<eos> You were asked who did you want in this position, and you named me.<eos> You summoned me out of retirement and I came back because I owed you.
Yes.<eos> And you're giving me a hard time about inviting you to a dance?<eos> It's a wedding.<eos> You must have me confused with someone else.<eos> Because if you asked me to go to Miami with you, I definitely would've gone.
And everybody here knows I've made my fair share of mistakes, but there is a very big difference between a sin and a mistake.<eos> Because a mistake is just fucking up?<eos> But a sin... hoohoo.<eos> A sin is when you know something is wrong and you do it anyway.<eos> So, Aggie, my darling wife, my sun and my stars, I look forward to a lifetime of fucking up with you.
And I came back through.<eos> I came back here.<eos> Did I... think about you?<eos> Did I wanna call you?<eos> Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?
Your mother knew that.<eos> Knew that the best one can do is to find a place you can protect, build a wall, and save who you can.<eos> You'd be wise to learn from her example.<eos> I'm sorry for what happened today.<eos> The moment I realized what was about to happen, I sent men to find you.
I know that means Voldemort.<eos> Now I know he's single.<eos> Can you just make sure he's not tricking me or anything?<eos> Julian tried to sneak in a clause in our divorce agreement that said I could never remarry and had to die alone in a flea market.<eos> So how did he dump you?
No.<eos> I broke up with Bobby.<eos> And it was worse than I could have imagined.<eos> No. He killed you, and now you're a ghost?<eos> I don't want to make sexy pottery with you.
What's wrong?<eos> Hey.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You have to finish mixing the explosives.<eos> Have you forgotten what these people did to you?
Stand down.<eos> Lower your weapons.<eos> I have Rebecca Ingram from CTU.<eos> She's explained everything.<eos> She's on the line for you.
I'm fine. I'm fine, baby.<eos> Listen, this whole thing with Ben is winding down, and we cleared the guy running CTU.<eos> Does that mean we can go home?<eos> Soon.<eos> I'm-a come get you, and... we can start to put this whole thing behind us.
Your guests are expecting you outside, you should get back to them.<eos> No.<eos> I-I need to see this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you know why I asked to talk to you?
Do not accept them as your friend and your ally!<eos> The Prophet Muhammad had Christians and Jews as his allies.<eos> Ben and I would go in together.<eos> If we make contact with Gabriel, we'll see if he knows how to find Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> Why limit the operation to you and Grimes?
- Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> - I beg you, please.<eos> Don't throw away everything that we have worked for your whole life!<eos> I was just coming to talk to you and your father about campaign managers.
Let's do this.<eos> You got some balls coming back here again.<eos> I got business.<eos> Something for Gabriel.<eos> You think he's gonna do business with you again?
Khasan, I can't do this by myself.<eos> Khasan.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Come here.<eos> God is with you, little sister.
Find someone who can.<eos> And bring them to us.<eos> You let my wife go, and then we'll talk.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I'm not negotiating with you.
Where are you going?<eos> I did not want this.<eos> Flint is my friend, but I know what he is.<eos> I have no illusions about it.<eos> But for all the dangers he presents, for all his offenses... the one thing he's never done is force me to choose between him and you.
If I apologize, you will know it is a lie.<eos> And I do not wish to lie to you ever again.<eos> Leave.<eos> No.<eos> I am going to stay with you.
- Prom tux!<eos> Okay, it's not there.<eos> Ooh. I... think I pulled something.<eos> Stomach ache, neck pain.<eos> That's exactly what happened to you in China.
♪ And if that looking glass gets broke ♪<eos> - ♪ Mama's gonna buy you ♪ - ♪ I don't remember ♪<eos> - ♪ Something ♪ - ♪ The rest of the song ♪<eos> Hey, buddy! What's up?<eos> Oh, I miss singing with you.
He loves music.<eos> He's just like you when you were a baby.<eos> Yeah, I play him my stuff and he just lights up.<eos> Aw.<eos> I'm so proud of you, honey.
You always said you don't know what happened that night, that you might have said yes and you didn't remember.<eos> I know what I said.<eos> But you are not allowed to forgive him for something that happened to me.<eos> You're right.<eos> And if I were you, I'd probably feel the exact same way.
May we have the rings please?<eos> Toby and Lily have asked to say a few words in lieu of vows.<eos> Lily... playing my music way too loud one night... turned out to be the best decision of my life because it led to you storming in and demanding... rightfully... that I turn it down.<eos> So much has happened since then, including creating a family together.<eos> We've already been through a lifetime of experiences, and I can't wait to go through the rest of my life with you.
He's a good friend.<eos> I remember.<eos> By the time it started turning into something else... he wasn't that guy anymore.<eos> I thought you were mad about me and Travis.<eos> When I first ran into you, I was.
It happened.<eos> She has committed to the plan, to me.<eos> The moment we have been working towards since we arrived... it happened.<eos> That's good news.<eos> So, why do you look like that?
When I became her rival, I watched the mistakes she made and resolved never to repeat them.<eos> But at the end, when I felt I had surpassed her in every way, it seemed as though there was something she was still trying to say to me.<eos> Surrendering everything she had sacrificed so dearly for, because it would have come at the expense of the one she loved.<eos> She was trying to tell me, I just could not hear her, about what is truly important.<eos> I said no to Marion Guthrie's plan... despite having no alternative and at the risk of losing the entire endeavor because I refuse to situate a man in a position where he might interfere one day with my ability to repair things with you.
Why good?<eos> Because... he must be very afraid of you to do something like that.<eos> I'm sure when he hears you have escaped, he's going to piss himself.<eos> I have met strong women before.<eos> But... none of them were like you.
I've never dated anyone who owned so many books.<eos> I've never dated anyone who drove a matatu.<eos> We do live in different worlds.<eos> Not tonight we don't.<eos> When I'm with you... all the rules... and the logic of everyday life... things that were so important to me... all go away.
I've never dated anyone who drove a matatu.<eos> We do live in different worlds.<eos> Not tonight we don't.<eos> When I'm with you... all the rules... and the logic of everyday life... things that were so important to me... all go away.<eos> And all I feel... is how fast my heart beats... whenever I'm with you.
Have I mentioned how in love with you I am?<eos> It really isn't the same, is it?<eos> Well... it's not bad.<eos> It could be the way that older couples who've been together a long time feel like when they kiss.<eos> Yeah, I like the idea of a long life spent kissing you.
I have to admit, I'm very uncomfortable with this level of uncertainty.<eos> No, but what is the alternative?<eos> Kala?<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> We can stay with you.
Everything I considered my home... is gone.<eos> Every time I begin to feel I belong somewhere... I have to leave.<eos> I'm trapped between what I want and what I know I can't have.<eos> Mom... I miss you.<eos> I measure so much of my life against one afternoon with you.
- It has almost two million hits!<eos> Oh, can you believe it?<eos> - It is incredible.<eos> - Lito, this is a bit awkward.<eos> I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you.
- It's not that.<eos> - I really think I needed to do this before I was ready.<eos> Well, I wish you would have talked to us first.<eos> Why?<eos> Look, I'm not gonna coddle you.
- Nothing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you think she would be listed as a missing person?<eos> We know she was scared.<eos> We know she went through a lot of trouble to meet with you.
- Sorry.<eos> Karen, listen to me.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know.<eos> Until I met you, I didn't think...
I must go.<eos> I would like to continue this conversation.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> I know you're angry... but this is how a girl like me tells a boy like you that she has a crush on you.<eos> And instead of laying in bed, wishing she was going out with you and not her current boyfriend... she has decided to do something about it.
Someone is listening to all the noise you make.<eos> - You and your lady should be careful.<eos> - Is this is a warning?<eos> Bossman don't do no warnings, Van Damn.<eos> He just comes for you.
- You and your lady should be careful.<eos> - Is this is a warning?<eos> Bossman don't do no warnings, Van Damn.<eos> He just comes for you.<eos> I could get offed just for talking to you.
I was going to...<eos> but then I heard everyone talk about it.<eos> Us.<eos> The new Rumble in the Jungle.<eos> Me and you.
No.<eos> You're just as trapped as we are, aren't you?<eos> It's Sebastian.<eos> He's worried about your relationship.<eos> I told him I would talk to you.
This is what they mean I think by... the "civilizing nature of women."<eos> - Hm... - I mean, everyone makes mistakes. But I think it's important to make amends when appropriate.<eos> As I said, you really didn't have to.<eos> No, but I did.<eos> And my karma has rewarded me with another opportunity to talk to you.
Who... who the hell is this?<eos> Who are we?<eos> Justice, motherfucker.<eos> - And we're...<eos> - coming for you.
Okay, Rajan, I don't under...<eos> Kala, I understand that this is all a shock.<eos> This is difficult for me, too.<eos> I know you have important things to discuss with me, but I'm asking you to hold on, fully understanding that the future of our marriage is uncertain, but that's a small thing compared to your safety.<eos> If anything were to happen to you, I could never forgive myself.
Welcome home, sexy.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Oh. Is she with you?
- No, no.<eos> - Call an ambulance, please!<eos> - I can't get to a hospital.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Come on, what's wrong with you, baby?
Us.<eos> Right now.<eos> And I know you feel the same.<eos> I do.<eos> But I can't be with you in my city.
It just went up to five.<eos> I quit, Bobby.<eos> I can't be in denial about what this place is, what you are, any longer.<eos> You know the only enemy more dangerous than a man with unlimited resources... is one with nothing to lose.<eos> And that is what you are looking at right here.
I'll die off.<eos> And that's before I blew lunch with you not being a vegan.<eos> Of course I'm a vegan.<eos> Here's my problem.<eos> The shit that I do to keep most people after an internship... throwing money around, showing them a good time... none of that's gonna work on you.
Emmett, don't. I...<eos> Uh, I...<eos> I have to work.<eos> (door opens) Bay: Oh, my god, what's going on?<eos> Are you okay?
They're one of the best teams in the whole league, okay?<eos> If we want to beat them, we gotta be bringing some heat.<eos> I know you've been working hard, but the regionals are on the line here.<eos> Carlos, charge the ball!<eos> Don't let the ball play you!
Move along, Katy Perry.<eos> You're not welcome here.<eos> Iris, can I talk to you, please?<eos> I got this.<eos> Look, I can never know what it's like to be you.
Iris, can I talk to you, please?<eos> I got this.<eos> Look, I can never know what it's like to be you.<eos> All I can really offer is my support.<eos> So, if you'll let me, I'd like to sit here with you.
break... break it up!<eos> Break it up! What...<eos> Hey!<eos> Stop it! Stop it!<eos> Hey, what is wrong with you?
I've been meaning to talk with you.
Cleared?<eos> Please.<eos> The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.<eos> You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.<eos> I am sitting right here talking to you.
[sighs] But that's not your problem.<eos> Your problem is that you didn't tell me that covering for you with Mr. Success was putting my family in the crosshairs of some ex-cop gangster and some still-cop psycho looking to pay you back for taking his eye.<eos> He didn't lose the eye.<eos> They are gonna get to me sooner or later, okay?<eos> Now, you know, no matter how pissed off I am at you, and I fucking am, that I would never wanna see you get hurt...
I'm sure you've spoken to everybody else.<eos> All bar you and Inspector Thursday's daughter.<eos> The bank couldn't tell me when she'll be in.<eos> She's gone away, I believe, to recuperate.<eos> You all right?
- I wanna talk about it.<eos> - I don't.<eos> You're unbelievable.<eos> Five years we've been working together.<eos> That's why I'm having this conversation with you and not the AD.
Where's a fucking hammer when you need one?<eos> You hear that?<eos> She said she's ready to gut you like a shark that's eaten a toddler.<eos> If you're... if you're coming in here to have sex or whatever, you can do it, but I'm gonna be here reading Rilke out loud in German.<eos> Is there anybody else here with you?
You're always drunk.<eos> Well, I saw you with Townsend.<eos> We were just talking.<eos> You were in each other's arms.<eos> He's been after you ever since he met you.
We don't have a home!<eos> Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> We can go anywhere and do anything we want.<eos> If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris.<eos> If you want to go to Cairo and ride a camel, I'll be right there with you.
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> We can go anywhere and do anything we want.<eos> If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris.<eos> If you want to go to Cairo and ride a camel, I'll be right there with you.<eos> The world is ours, and I want to see every bit of it with you... as long as we're together, because no matter where we are, we're home.
Previously on "The Magicians"... We summoned some kind of killer moth man from another world.<eos> My friends who got separated and I just...<eos> I can't let them fight The Beast on their own.<eos> You want me to come to Fillory with you?
Well, on that note, I crown you Queen Alice the Wise.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Since we're cleaning slates and shit, give me.<eos> Q.<eos> Uh, I could start by saying something cruel yet totally hilarious about you.
You damn Taliban bastard.<eos> I curse you and your family and hope you burn in hell.<eos> You talking to me, you Russian son of a bitch?<eos> I'm going to pull out your intestines through your filthy throat and hang you in the nearest tree!<eos> Damn you! I'm going to do that to you, you filthy shit-for-brains!
You're safe!<eos> - I'm getting the hostage!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - You could have killed that guy.<eos> - What's going on with you, man?
What, so cops? FBI?<eos> They're all wrong?<eos> - They're hiding the truth. - Why would they lie?<eos> I don't know, Dad.<eos> All I do know is I'm not gonna risk you and Mom getting caught up in this, too.
Bry?<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> I'm at home.<eos> Why?<eos> Lianne with you?
DEA agent Mike Hall.<eos> - You there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're coming at me.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they come for you, too, if they're not already.
I'll be okay.<eos> Went straight through.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Some hotel in Jersey.<eos> I'm coming to get you.
Come on, Booth.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah, what is it?<eos> Karen has an idea that she'd like to run by you.
- not Zsa Zsa Gabor.<eos> - Not many girls would say that.<eos> Well, you're not engaged to many girls.<eos> No.<eos> Just you.
Well, I had to run some errands, and I thought, why not swing by and have some one-on-one time with my favorite daughter.<eos> It's nice to see you.<eos> But I-I am in the middle of a case.<eos> Oh, I-I don't want to interrupt you.<eos> I-I just, uh... wanted to spend some time with you.
Chef said you didn't eat dinner.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> I used to lie in bed next to you and listen to you breathe in and out, and I would loathe the sound.
Let's not pretend I'm a good person.<eos> Mellie, come on, I'm Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III.<eos> I was born with power.<eos> Me wanting power is like a drowning man wanting a bath.<eos> I'm supposed to choose... Between you and Cyrus.
- Robin, how can you...<eos> - Enough!<eos> This is a place of work.<eos> People are trying to work.<eos> Charlie, Quinn doesn't want to go to the Caribbean with you because she's a workaholic - and she's afraid of the ocean.
Oh, Eugene! Wait. Did you drop something?<eos> No.<eos> Rapunzel, from the moment I first met you and you knocked me out with that frying pan, I knew it was love.<eos> You're my light, you're my best friend and I want to be your partner in all things.<eos> I can't wait to laugh with you and share with you.
Sorry, look...<eos> I know there's still a ton of details we need to figure out... and I may have jumped the gun a little.<eos> It's just that... growing up poor and alone...<eos> I got used to having nothing.<eos> But now with you, I finally have something, you know? We have something.
What the hell was that for?<eos> Sucre! What the hell are you doing here?<eos> C-Note told me what's going on.<eos> He tell you to talk me out of it? No.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Well, I'm not gonna challenge the logic in that.<eos> Noel's dead, but Jenna's still out there.<eos> - I mean, we have to find her.<eos> - We will.<eos> But I'm not taking any chances with you.
Oh, did you make an appointment?<eos> We'll go to the doctors together.<eos> I've already been.<eos> That's why I'm late.<eos> But, but I promised I'd come with you.
Did you ask the school to hire her?<eos> No.<eos> They must have wanted both of us.<eos> Lucky for everybody.<eos> Are you gonna be okay tonight?
And I got this terrible cold feeling in my stomach.<eos> She told me that it, it happened before, but this time they knew who the father was.<eos> Because Mary told them.<eos> Apparently, your father was in a restaurant when Jessica walked in or who he thought was Jessica.<eos> Dad did this to you.
She told me that it, it happened before, but this time they knew who the father was.<eos> Because Mary told them.<eos> Apparently, your father was in a restaurant when Jessica walked in or who he thought was Jessica.<eos> Dad did this to you.<eos> He did this to you again?
I'll tell you how, because she has balls the size of church bells.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I didn't need that image.<eos> Why didn't he just ask her who was shooting off the second gun?<eos> I'm sure he will, but he couldn't do that in front of you.
Goodnight.<eos> It's latitude and longitude.<eos> It must lead to the mystery location.<eos> When are you going?<eos> I'll come with you.
Don't judge I'm old.<eos> Well I'll send you my contact we should get coffee at the Bradley.<eos> I can bring my mom.<eos> That'd be wonderful.<eos> Well, it's good to see you.
I mean, they were sisters.<eos> Twins.<eos> Now, do you understand why I don't want you to find her why I want to keep her away from this family?<eos> You knew about Charlotte before the doll house?<eos> I'll be damned if I ever let something like that happen to you again.
Or have a drink?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, I'll take a beer if you got.<eos> That sounds really good.<eos> I'm gonna have one with you.
What does A.D. want from a computer shop?<eos> I don't know, but whatever it is I'll have to bring it to the school.<eos> _<eos> I don't even know why we're fighting about this.<eos> - I'm going with you.
- Yeah, we could try.<eos> I've learnt so much from loving you.<eos> One of the most important things you taught me is not to get greedy.<eos> Now you have to listen to me.<eos> This is the third time I said goodbye to you.
I know the police took your phone and I didn't want you to be without especially now that you're on my team.<eos> - It's not enough.<eos> - What's not enough?<eos> The phone.<eos> I wanna meet you.
To plot Jessica with the medication.<eos> But I intercepted them.<eos> Finally, for once, I stepped out of her shadow and stood out to my bully.<eos> I've been cheated out of so much, Spencer.<eos> Most of all, knowing you.
No.<eos> Good.<eos> You're packed lightly.<eos> Are the rest of your things in your car?<eos> I'm not going with you.
Instead of a family, it's gonna be homes and hospitals, institutions.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> Em... we're not gonna be able to stop it.<eos> Ali...<eos> Look, it took me so long to finally get here with you.
How?<eos> I have a masters degree in American literature.<eos> There is nothing I can't handle.<eos> No.<eos> He's coming for you.
No.<eos> He's coming for you.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Now, Ali.<eos> Ali, we came back for you, so move it.
Alison wouldn't let me.<eos> Why did you want to visit me?<eos> For the same reason you came here.<eos> To see if there was anything to worry about.<eos> I didn't visit, but I kept an eye on you.
Jacob is Poseidon.<eos> He's a CIA operative, deep cover.<eos> He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.<eos> He targeted me for my skills.<eos> Four years ago, he betrayed me so he could have you.
No, no, no, it's me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> They're shooting.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> - Okay. They've come for you.
It's not safe for my kind here.<eos> Are forbidden.<eos> I have to leave this place, John.<eos> So, what, you're gonna bail on me again?<eos> I didn't bail on you. I came back, took the damn chip because Jaha said he would take me to you.
I can help you do what your mother never could, what Ontari never could.<eos> - Rule everything.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Trikru is weak and ready to fall, and Skaikru is more hated than ever.<eos> Give the order to take them both out, and our war chiefs will follow you.
We were told it was lost.<eos> You give me one good reason why I shouldn't just take that and cut your head off.<eos> I just gave you one, and you know I wouldn't be offering this unless what I was saying were true.<eos> Take it.<eos> The clans will follow you.
- Sorry. - Fifteen hundred?<eos> How are you feeling right now, Pearl? It's okay.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just... that it's hard getting better.<eos> And I'm guessing that you're worried about how you're gonna be burning it off, especially when everybody's here watching you?
We get along great.<eos> - I could tell.<eos> She was the only one who had something to say that wasn't entirely self-serving.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Now, I'm gonna be honest with you. - Uh-oh.
- Where is Luke, anyway?<eos> - He's at the doctor for his knee.<eos> Eli?<eos> Eli.<eos> What's going on with you?
The problem with treatment for some of these kids... is that we won't let them hit bottom.<eos> It's too hard to watch.<eos> But for Eli, the bottom is critical.<eos> How is there even less of you?<eos> What did that doctor do to you?
You know, I... had a premonition before you came.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You were a baby.<eos> I didn't hold you enough.<eos> I didn't bond with you.
I accept it if... If death is what you want, I accept it now.<eos> I accept it, but um...<eos> I love you.<eos> I just...<eos> I can't keep fighting you.
You are the baron now.<eos> That night changed everything.<eos> Did it?<eos> Everybody thinks Quinn died by your hand, and Jacobee, too.<eos> Now you control three territories.
The final battle is upon us... Destiny's hand.<eos> But you have nothing to fear, my son. I won't let any harm come to you.
But you have nothing to fear, my son. I won't let any harm come to you.<eos> No matter how much blood will be spilled. Whether there be one man, or a thousand.<eos> I swear to protect my family.<eos> There's no coming back from what you did. What?<eos> Declaring war on Quinn and sunny. Whoever is left, they're gonna come for you next.
M.K. Tells me you've been sharing stories of how you took me under your wing at the monastery.<eos> You were the only Abbot who understood me. You shared my belief that we use our gift to help people.<eos> But then when I tried to do that, you caved to the master's will.<eos> Hey, that's not true.<eos> I came back for you.
I came back for you.<eos> I sacrificed my own gift to save you.<eos> Please!<eos> You came back for the book.<eos> It's what he was using me for all along, just like he's been using you.
How did you get here?<eos> I've never watched a man die alone before,<eos> I was curious.<eos> Come on.<eos> Is m.K. With you?
This employment agency.<eos> What job you looking for?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't understand what you're saying.<eos> Ha ha ha ha. I'm fucking with you, man.
I'm not going with you.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> Eddie, I got a parole officer I got to worry about.<eos> Then no. Then fuck it.<eos> I'm not going. I'll stay here with you.
It's time we went our separate ways, Eddie.<eos> What?<eos> [taxi door opens] No.<eos> No.<eos> It's always been me and you our whole lives.
Drive safe.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> You are a superhero.<eos> I owe you big-time.
So I'm not supposed to tell anyone?<eos> That's right, no matter who, no matter what reasons you think you might have, you must not -- you cannot tell anyone.<eos> There could be terrible consequences -- life-changing consequences.<eos> And we don't want you to get into trouble.<eos> If something were to happen to you because of this, I'd feel sick about it.
Sync by: Aren zo This is Michael's handwriting.<eos> Swan was his calling card.<eos> He's reaching out to us.<eos> But why is he being so mysterious?<eos> Back in the day, he never talked to you straight, as in
- What's that?<eos> - It's, uh... it's something your Uncle Lincoln sent.<eos> - Here.<eos> - I don't want to go.<eos> I want to stay with you.
Hit me!<eos> - Asher!<eos> Get off!<eos> Get off of him!<eos> Asher, what is wrong with you?
That's where I carry all my stress.<eos> As my lady commands.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is Michaela behind you to threaten me again?
Please do...<eos> He looks better than I thought.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's going on with you?
You know what?<eos> You're the problem with the gay community.<eos> You know, we all just treat each other like a piece of meat.<eos> We're all the problem with the gay community.<eos> It was nice meeting you.
You couldn't stand the idea of spending one second alone.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Well, I know you're paranoid and broken, haven't trusted anyone since you were a little boy.<eos> I know what you're trying to do right now.<eos> And you're still acting like that little boy, making up ugly stories about people because you're scared of anyone actually getting to know you.
I'm gonna call, and Sylvia or Charles or one of the Mahoneys are gonna pick up, and then we're gonna find out how stupid your plan is.<eos> No, yo plan is stupid!<eos> - I'm calling.<eos> - Tell him to hang up.<eos> Like, what is wrong with you?
He was burned like a piece of trash, and you deserve to feel the same pain.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I'm gonna let you win.<eos> So take the gift.<eos> Take it, or I'll come for you.
Did it... Did it not work?<eos> My God.<eos> - I was so worried about you.<eos> - I know.<eos> I thought something awful happened to you.
What happened?<eos> He invited me back to his place.<eos> He's getting a cab right now.<eos> - Then go.<eos> We'll follow you. - No, we won't!
You got to remove it.<eos> It's a spoon, string.<eos> - How? - A string a day from my uniforms for four years.<eos> A spoon a guard overlooked one time in a thousand.<eos> There's a water pipe above you.
We have to work together.<eos> Come on!<eos> - No.<eos> - Cross!<eos> I'm not working with you.
Look!<eos> Stop what you're doing and tell Kaniel Outis I will kill the girl!<eos> Take him!<eos> Come on!<eos> I'm not through with you yet!
But got us this far.<eos> Crazy only works if it doesn't get you killed.<eos> _<eos> Andrew?<eos> Uh, Professor Hayden told us to speak with you?
I don't even know why you dragged me into all this, you know?<eos> You got to forget the past, Whip, the details.<eos> None of that matters now.<eos> What have my actions been all these years?<eos> Who's been taking care of you through everything, huh?
Michael?<eos> Your ex, Michael?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait, hold on a second, he really is alive?<eos> He contacted you just now?
Or are you gonna get me a partner, so we get on with the business of changing the world?<eos> Done.<eos> _<eos> I need some food.<eos> I'm with you.
show us what the tattoos mean even before the computers will, and all the people he'll be enlisting for the fight.<eos> You have to call this pay phone in France.<eos> Wait.<eos> Chicago?<eos> I thought I was going with you.
Your part is over.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Tricking Abruzzi's kid is one thing.<eos> Poseidon... he knows your face.<eos> Been tracking you since you went to Yemen.
That's not what happened.<eos> The day I let one of my officers write "vampire car"<eos> in their report is the same day I let you suck my dick.<eos> Now get dressed, go home, get drunk.<eos> Internal Affairs will interview you tomorrow.
Everything we've done since the Canterbury?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> But...<eos> Only because I don't get to spend more time with you.
I'm getting married to Lydia.<eos> Maybe you should do what's in your heart.<eos> I am your father, Clary...<eos> And Jace's.<eos> I need to talk to you.
I can smell it.<eos> And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.<eos> - Now, get off of me.<eos> - Jonathan.<eos> Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?
And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.<eos> - Now, get off of me.<eos> - Jonathan.<eos> Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?<eos> This thing in front of you...
You're done.<eos> I surrender to the authority of the Clave.<eos> - You broke the Accords.<eos> - But I know you won't.<eos> Are you gonna let her mock you after what she did?
Make yourself useful.<eos> Line up the witnesses.<eos> Clary.<eos> Clary, stop!<eos> What is wrong with you?
You seem resourceful.<eos> You'll find a way.<eos> I need answers, Simon.<eos> And if I don't get them, I might just bar all vamps... from fraternizing with their Shadowhunter friends.<eos> Alec, are you okay?
But it'll cost you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey!<eos> - I've been running low. - Hmm.<eos> A chick did that to you?
I'm not a Shadowhunter.<eos> I'm not anything.<eos> Dot?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> What happened to you?
I am Valentine's weapon.<eos> You think he's just gonna let me go?<eos> He knows that you...<eos> You're my weakness.<eos> If I ever get out of here, he'll come after you again.
It'll bleed every ounce of defiance out of you.<eos> I'm nothing like you.<eos> They want me to bend, they can die trying.<eos> Wait until your trial.<eos> After what they do to you...
As if you haven't been through enough, now the Clave wants to rip your family apart?<eos> - I'm talking to Aldertree.<eos> - It's not his call.<eos> The transfer orders came from the Council.<eos> Then I'm going with you.
So we continue to scan for venom and heat signatures.<eos> Try to narrow down the host before it strikes again.<eos> Alec, you check the living quarters.<eos> You two take the utility tunnels.<eos> I'll stay with you.
It's nice to hear something positive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom.<eos> About Idris...<eos> There is a part of me that wants to come with you... but...
No!<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Based on your testimony...<eos> I will recommend to the Clave a punishment of life imprisonment.<eos> May the Angel have mercy on you.
Clary, I...<eos> I have a demon to kill.<eos> Don't tell me you're doing you're the Clave's bidding because of your silly infatuation with that boy toy Shadowhunter.<eos> Leave Alec out of this.<eos> This is between you and me.
The Clave is reassigning me to Idris.<eos> I just got you back.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> The Clave wants to rip your family apart?<eos> Then I'm going with you.
We're all kind of freaking out.<eos> Clary needs you.<eos> I could use you, too.<eos> So, um...<eos> I'll talk to you soon, I guess.
Alec, maybe we can get her back.<eos> What?<eos> I found a warlock who claims she can do it.<eos> But there are risks.<eos> I'll go with you.
If you're lucky enough to be accepted into the sisterhood, you're marked by sacred runes.<eos> It's what allows the Iron Sisters to shape pure adamas.<eos> The Sisters call upon the power of the angels to imbue our blades with their energy.<eos> I hate to leave you.<eos> Then I guess I have to come with you.
It's Maia, right?<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Probably just going through shock.<eos> How about I sit right here?<eos> Ride with you to the hospital?
- Seventeen thousand?<eos> - It was all in the past.<eos> Ancient history.<eos> But right now I'm here.<eos> With you.
Okay, how would I have inspired someone, tell me.<eos> Hey, kiddo.<eos> Hey.<eos> Simon called me when he found you.<eos> I am so sorry I wasn't there for you.
I bet that was a good one.<eos> I should go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, it was...<eos> It was great catching up with you.
Sorry.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I was so selfish, hiding in the woods like that.<eos> You would have never went to Iris if...<eos> Luke, this has nothing to do with you.
I'm myself again.<eos> Good story, but I've heard better.<eos> Wait, in the vision from Ithuriel, the demon that destroyed the sword had a clawed hand.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It has nothing to do with you.
Where is he?<eos> You made the right decision, joining us.<eos> We need to be united now more than ever.<eos> Just to be clear, I'm doing this for the pack, not for you.<eos> You think I wanted to do that to you?
Please let this work.<eos> Jace, don't!<eos> The mortal cup is still out there.<eos> He's the only one who knows where it is.<eos> You're gonna wish you were dead after the clave gets through with you.
Nothing, absolutely nothing.<eos> Though...<eos> Though if I did, I suppose I...<eos> - I might be flattered.<eos> - I wasn't talking to you.
Just my colleague merely frequents this establishment at this hour.<eos> Sorry, Jefferson.<eos> You should go back to the Waverider.<eos> I can handle things from here.<eos> What the hell is going on with you, man?
- Should we, uh, sit down?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This is...<eos> So weird.<eos> Uh, because I didn't think I'd get the chance to meet you.
Communication device.<eos> Really?<eos> It's so small...<eos> Do it, or I'll shove it down your throat.<eos> It will allow us to monitor you.
Okay, you two have made your point.<eos> I need you as much as you need me, all right.<eos> But if you do not open that door, he is going to kill us.<eos> He is coming for me!<eos> Who's coming for you?
- Let me drive. - (car crashes)<eos> Alvarez, spread the word, Mayor James has called in the National Guard.<eos> We don't want any soldiers getting shot by mistake.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> The hell's wrong with you?
I will never be your heir!<eos> On the contrary.<eos> Your strength only confirms what the prophecy has foretold.<eos> An heir to serve as my knight in the darkness.<eos> I will never follow you!
- Iris West, will you marry me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Dr. Brand invents the technology that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> - We don't wanna fight you.
A bad guy like Savitar always turns on his partners.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Wake up!<eos> You're only saying that because he needs something from you.<eos> Once he's done with that, it's over for you.
Do it!<eos> You kill me, you become me.<eos> Either way, I live.<eos> I'll never let the pain, the darkness, determine who I am.<eos> I will never be you.
Someone once told me that a circumstance poison or nectar.<eos> What they meant was that we get to choose we get to choose who we are, so tell me...<eos> Who are you?<eos> Rene: Yo. Hold up.<eos> I'll walk with you.
Heh. Good to see you again.<eos> Have sergeant Diggle cleared out of here and ready for transport asap.<eos> Got a long ride back to langham ahead of us.<eos> So tell me...<eos> What happened between you
I've always wanted her autograph.<eos> You know how people hate to say,<eos> I don't hate it. I friggin' love it.<eos> You really weren't kidding about that<eos> It's like shooting fish in a barrel with you.
What makes me so special?<eos> If you stay in the same spot for more than a minute, and I'll get a chance to tell it.<eos> Well, if you're gonna make a sales pitch, make it good.<eos> You went through something traumatic.<eos> For the past 3 years, you've been trying to understand it because you're afraid of what happened to you and of what you've become, so you're running from it.
You're Kojo Sledgehammer.<eos> It's not nearly as cool as Ghost Fox Goddess, but then I can only aspire to your level of cool, which I do.<eos> Uh, aspire to, I mean.<eos> Take her down hard you said, right?<eos> It is so great to meet you.
Why do you deny your father's wish for you?<eos> You saw the reason tonight.<eos> I am not the man that my father raised!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You're afraid of what's happened to you, of what you've become, and you're running from it.
Hostages could be in either place.<eos> Or neither.<eos> This is a large island.<eos> - I'll check the RPG site.<eos> - I'll accompany you.
Get them to the mainland and then come right back for us.<eos> We are not leaving you here.<eos> I need to focus, and that means getting you out of harm's way, and despite my better instincts, when this is all over, I will come back for you.<eos> When this is all over, you'll be dead.<eos> Can I talk to you for a sec?
There aren't any windows or clocks, so, you lose track of time.<eos> Can't believe they're allowed to do that to kids.<eos> Yeah, they can pretty much do whatever they want.<eos> - At least for now anyway.<eos> - Were you, like, abused in any of those homes you were in?
I don't have a question, more of a comment.<eos> I always thought, like most people, that if someone got arrested and went to jail then they probably did it, or did something bad.<eos> But innocent people get locked up... and I don't really think there's any justice if we just put blind faith in the system.<eos> So, thank you for opening my eyes.<eos> This is really amazing art, and you're very brave for sharing everything that's happened to you.
So, listen, um, Monte called earlier, and she thinks your senior project is incredible.<eos> Really?<eos> She called to tell you that?<eos> Yes, she did.<eos> And she also wanted me to talk to you.
I think that it sounds like you don't want to live with me, just near me.<eos> Mike, if you're getting cold feet, I need to know.<eos> - I have Isabella.<eos> - It's not that.<eos> I want to live with you and Isabella.
I wouldn't mind.<eos> Mike's been good to me, but...<eos> I don't know how Ty would feel about it.<eos> You know, him being a white cop and all.<eos> I thought Ty was glad that you had Mike looking after you.
Been keeping my head down.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - I'm doing good.<eos> Getting good grades.<eos> Uh, so, I wanted to talk to you about...
So, good news.<eos> The seniors backed down.<eos> They're showing their projects.<eos> So, all's well that ends well.<eos> Can I talk to you?
Yeah, well, I was part-time.<eos> I, uh, I was just hopin' that she could, um, write me a letter of recommendation. Uh, but it's... it's not a big deal.<eos> It's... it's okay. No, it's fine.<eos> Look, I'm sure she'd be happy to do it.<eos> Why don't you, um, just give me your name and number, and I'll have her get a hold of you.
And I don't have a rich daddy to buy me the best lawyers.<eos> If I make trouble and get arrested, I'm goin' down.<eos> Just like Ty.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'd do anything for you, but I'm not gonna follow you down a rabbit hole.
It was out of line bringing up my daughter.<eos> You gonna tell that to Susan Williams at 10 a.m. tomorrow?<eos> Look, man.<eos> You expecting me to give you an apology, you don't know me that well.<eos> I don't know you at all, but my sponsor says that I'm the one that owes you the apology.
I have location for Walker and men to help in fight, but we have to leave now.<eos> Your strange friend's pronunciation is horrible.<eos> Yeah. I'll tutor him later.<eos> Hey.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, Lev.
Shut up!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Sweetheart, are you ok?
- So am I, and look.<eos> I am gonna stay here until we take out Gregor and we protect the Bratva.<eos> Ty skazal, "stay"?<eos> Were you going to leave?<eos> Look, Anatoly. I realized I have to get back to my life, but then I saw what Gregor did to you because of me.
You're making a mistake.<eos> Drop the bow, or we will light your ass up.<eos> Fine.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> What do you mean they were after you?
Hey, look.<eos> While under the threat of the impeachment, you can't exactly amend bylaws, so that concussion protocol, yeah, it's a thing.<eos> It's... it's ok, Ollie.<eos> I can...<eos> I can go back to the office and tell everyone we're gonna be working overtime, plus I'm never getting into a limo with you again.
Yes, but where are we going to find that?<eos> I have to go.<eos> Code says you have one hour to finalize personal affairs before spross dopross...<eos> I can do that.<eos> But you must have captain with you who is not me.
Is this true, Gregor?<eos> 40 million rubles.<eos> So it's true.<eos> If anybody wishes to cast a new vote, please do so now.<eos> It seems that you are deciding vote, Viktor.
I doubt he has Susan someplace obvious.<eos> I don't know what's obvious anymore.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I can't let you go out there alone.<eos> - I'm going with you.
I am not getting into a shootout with the SCPD.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Smart move, douchebag.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.
- This building is gonna explode.<eos> - What about...<eos> Chase wants me.<eos> You're no longer his target.<eos> I was gonna say what about you?
Confess your secret, Oliver, and all this ends.<eos> I'll give you a gift, and you can walk out that door and go back home.<eos> Adrian, you're sick.<eos> And you're a hypocrite.<eos> There is nothing that I've done that compares with you.
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.<eos> What is this monstrosity?<eos> You should be resting.<eos> I woke up with headache.<eos> I--I came to find you.
You used your father's memory to justify a killing spree.<eos> There's a price to be paid for that, Oliver.<eos> Your mother paid it.<eos> Your friend Tommy paid it, Laurel.<eos> Do you really want to tell me that John Diggle and Felicity Smoak's lives are better having known you?
Chase had me--<eos> And he let me go.<eos> Go slow, man.<eos> It's over.<eos> Oliver, we're gonna get this son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.
You don't kill because you have to.<eos> So why?<eos> I wanted to!<eos> And I liked it!<eos> We're gonna get this son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> This wasn't you, Oliver.<eos> It was him.<eos> Well, I... I created him.<eos> And I know that that might sound weird, but, this happened to you because of me.
My only chance is... well, I have to do something that he hasn't planned for.<eos> Well, like what?<eos> Listen, Susan, I know that...<eos> W... we never got a chance to resolve things.<eos> I can't be with you.
The Oliver I know would never let a group of dangerous criminals crawl into his city, let them steal medicine.<eos> You don't know what kind of man I am.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> What the hell did Chase do to you, Oliver?
- Goalie.<eos> - That's my girl.<eos> Just like your pops.<eos> Aw. That's so good.<eos> I'm proud of you.
On it.<eos> Ten will get you 20, that's exactly what this is.<eos> One thing at a time.<eos> - Go! - Hey, Thea called.<eos> She says she needs to talk to you.
Hello, Thea.<eos> If you're seeing this, then chances are that I'm...gone.<eos> No matter what's happened, no matter what you've heard, I wanted you to know how much I love you.<eos> You're my daughter, my special girl.<eos> I've done some things in my life, Thea, that I'm not proud of, but I am proud of you.
Agent kosineski got a positive ID before he got tranq'ed.<eos> So these kidnappings are what, payback?<eos> Before Chase tortured me, I told him that the team was my strength.<eos> He's trying to take it away.<eos> So his lady friends can come after you instead of him?
You would do anything, absolutely anything, to keep him safe.<eos> A little while ago, I worried to John...<eos> That the personal connections that I had were making me vulnerable because as long as there are people in my life that I care for, I have to be something else to protect them.<eos> That's something that I can't leave in the past.<eos> I admire you, Oliver.
- Nick!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - How many are behind you?
He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.<eos> I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.<eos> Even if he's dead, it could still survive.<eos> We'll find a way to break it.<eos> I need to be with you.
Even if he's dead, it could still survive.<eos> We'll find a way to break it.<eos> I need to be with you.<eos> And what about Diana?<eos> - She's with you now.
- Trubel, where are you?<eos> We're in the loft.<eos> Nick's not here.<eos> I know.<eos> Is Eve with you?
That was fun.<eos> First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.<eos> I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.<eos> Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.<eos> Do you still have the stick with you?
You're kidding.<eos> She just transferred.<eos> Lucky her.<eos> She gets to learn from the best.<eos> I'm glad to be working on this with you.
I cut off one head.<eos> Plenty more where he came from.<eos> So we cut off all the heads.<eos> Rule the whole system.<eos> The system rules you, kid.
But it wasn't strategic violence, not like you cracking that guy's head because he messed with your stuff.<eos> That was a problem, and you found a solution.<eos> No, in that hotel room, there was madness.<eos> And it stank of sick death.<eos> See, you and I, we're both from the slums.
What's so urgent?<eos> What the hell is he doing here? I know you two have your differences but I don't care.<eos> We've got bigger issues to deal with.<eos> We're going back to Eros. We need your help.<eos> We're done going anywhere with you.
Hey, don't get all "Holden" on me.<eos> Weird and chatty under pressure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, must be real tough growing' up under a blue sky...<eos> Eight parents slobbering all over you.
They are not yours to share.<eos> Nor yours to hoard.<eos> It's a new world, Selina.<eos> There's no room in it for retrogrades.<eos> Then I will not circle with you.
Plus, if I'm wrong, which I'm not... I get rich.<eos> So I'm down with it, Dinesh.<eos> Jared, what do you think about this?<eos> I think this is crazy.<eos> I left my job at Hooli to... to come work with you, Richard.
But you don't know when that will be.<eos> No one knows.<eos> I wish you good fortune.<eos> Missandei.<eos> It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
I don't care about what you feel.<eos> I care about what you think.<eos> What do you think about what you did?<eos> I think I did a shitty thing.<eos> I think I fucked you over, but I did not mean to fuck you over.
Mr. Wednesday.<eos> Overdue.<eos> I have to start with an apology.<eos> I've been remiss.<eos> I should have reached out to you ages ago.
Oh, I'm a fine me.<eos> I just keep getting better every year.<eos> Of course you are, and that is the you that deserves to be seen incorporated.<eos> Everyone in the world gets their place.<eos> With you?
- A man of the mounds. - Oh.<eos> Or rather, that I was.<eos> But now I'm here, in this new world, where nobody puts out ale or milk for an honest fellow.<eos> Or a loaf of bread come harvest time.<eos> If you are who I think you are, I have no quarrel with you.
Or rather, that I was.<eos> But now I'm here, in this new world, where nobody puts out ale or milk for an honest fellow.<eos> Or a loaf of bread come harvest time.<eos> If you are who I think you are, I have no quarrel with you.<eos> Nor I with you.
So, why didn't you tell me about Zsasz?<eos> It's my business.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Not yours.<eos> That's a bit ridiculous, seeing as how I'm standing next to you most of the time.
It's complicated.<eos> We have to warn your friends.<eos> Cole is not someone they should mess with.<eos> Good job, Mom.<eos> Were you followed?
You can't run fast with a five-year-old.<eos> I'm your daughter.<eos> First, we take away his mind.<eos> And then when this bird is broken...<eos> Who are you in on this with?
Oh, I remember.<eos> You're Jim Gordon's little...<eos> Twinkie.<eos> Easy.<eos> How's it going between you and Jimbo?
Let the hostages go.<eos> You're outside?<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> Goody!<eos> The cult will never follow you, Dwight.
Whoever took him will pay, but only once Ed is back.<eos> Ed!<eos> Edward!<eos> Ed.<eos> Are you all right?
I guarantee it.<eos> You ready to tell me what happened?<eos> When Jerome took me away... I thought they were going to kill you.<eos> Shall I tell you what I thought?<eos> I thought how proud I was of you.
Stop it!<eos> I... told you I am fine!<eos> I am a grown man, for crying out loud!<eos> And you're hungry.<eos> What's with you and all the plants?
You know, plants make better friends than most people.<eos> And some of them helped save your life.<eos> It's broth.<eos> I even put in some white willow for your fever.<eos> - What is wrong with you?
I have no idea.<eos> I don't even know what the weapon is.<eos> But that's exactly what I'm going to find out.<eos> - I can help.<eos> - No. The Court knows I reached out to you, but that's all.
Tell me.<eos> What?<eos> You want me to beg? Is that it?<eos> I want you to be nice to me.<eos> Nice to you?
He always said they were his favorite.<eos> But when it came time to give them up I couldn't let them go.<eos> It's time to let them go.<eos> There.<eos> You can lock it away, and once you do, you'll be free of the power it holds over you.
You belong here.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> Then you infected this place and everyone around you.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I am done with you, with the GCPD... with Gotham.
But make no mistake, the Court, and the Court alone, can save Gotham.<eos> So what do you want me to do?<eos> Prove your loyalty to the Court.<eos> Killing my uncle wasn't enough?<eos> That was between you and Frank.
Selina, you can't tell anyone.<eos> Then why the hell did you tell me?<eos> Because I care about you.<eos> And if there's one person I want to save, I want it to be you.<eos> That's the difference between you and Bruce Wayne.
I tried like hell to get out of it.<eos> But Lee insisted.<eos> The truth is, I had a good time.<eos> I considered you a friend.<eos> I can sneak up on you or be right in front of you without you even knowing.
I feel nothing.<eos> Talons have served the Court since its inception.<eos> The Court culls them from orphanages.<eos> Trains them.<eos> What I did to you, the Court has done with them for 200 years.
You know why, Jim.<eos> You blame yourself over what happened to Mario?<eos> You didn't shoot him, you didn't infect him.<eos> Wasn't your fault.<eos> I'd have to disagree with you on that one.
Bruce?<eos> Bruce, get out of the light.<eos> No, Alfred.<eos> I will not let you hurt him.<eos> What's he done to you?
No.<eos> If this is my destiny, I do not want to fail.<eos> You won't, Bruce.<eos> All this, everything the Court of Owls set in motion, everything I have done, has been to prepare you for this moment, and afterward, I will bring you to the one whose vision has singled you out.<eos> He is very eager to meet you.
Let me drive.<eos> Alvarez, spread the word, Mayor James has called in the National Guard.<eos> We don't want any soldiers getting shot by mistake.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> The hell's wrong with you?
I will never be your heir!<eos> On the contrary.<eos> Your strength only confirms what the prophecy has foretold.<eos> An heir to serve as my knight in the darkness.<eos> I will never follow you!
Where are we?<eos> Home.<eos> I don't know... what's gonna happen in the future.<eos> All I know is right here, right now,<eos> I wanna spend every moment I can with you.
I love our loft.<eos> Look... what I don't love is you not talking to me about these nightmares.<eos> I don't know. I mean, I've seen a lot of terrible things in my life.<eos> The nightmares, they're just a part of me.<eos> Yeah, but, Barry, I have been with you through all those terrible things.
- Let's suit up.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> Come here.<eos> I was a dick yesterday, Wally.<eos> It wasn't about you.
You're not like the other Wellses.<eos> Yeah, so you keep reminding me.<eos> No, I mean, those two, they were geniuses.<eos> We depended on them.<eos> But with you, the roles are reversed.
- It's good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you too.<eos> So... what's up?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Can I talk to you for a second over here?
Yeah, which you almost got shot for.<eos> God.<eos> What?<eos> Iris.<eos> What is going on with you?
You're right about that!<eos> I'm fine as hell.<eos> There he is.<eos> Didn't think you'd show.<eos> I wouldn't miss an evening with you, even if it is for a showdown.
Okay, well, we have one at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> Allen, this is an active investigation.<eos> There is protocol to follow... surely?<eos> Not if we're gonna figure this out.<eos> Okay, I'll bag the body myself and meet you there.
Well, that went swimmingly.<eos> Joe's right.<eos> We should've told him before now.<eos> What you should have told him is that I'm the one responsible, that the meta trying to kill him is one that I created.<eos> Julian, you can't change what happened to you.
I'm pretty sure it is.<eos> No, stop!<eos> Too late, Kid Flash.<eos> Me or her?<eos> I got you, baby girl.
It was a really big win for the team, beating Grodd.<eos> I mean, we stopped a gorilla attack from happening.<eos> Yeah, look at you, changing the future.<eos> We're all changing the future, one headline at a time.<eos> Look, I don't know what the future's gonna bring, but I hope every day is with you.
- You're dying?<eos> I didn't say I was...<eos> I-I said I didn't know how much time I had left.<eos> - None of us...<eos> - Okay, what is wrong with you?
Think I'm done with that.<eos> - Good.<eos> - I'll see you at home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, I'll walk out with you.
You know it's true.<eos> You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force by yourself.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm going to get out of here, Wallace.<eos> And then I'm gonna come for you... and Barry and your sister, and I'll kill everyone you love.
And this is something I have to do alone, okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, let's go to work.<eos> Can I talk to you?
Yeah?<eos> Is this really you, or is this... just another Speed Force test?<eos> Yeah, kid, it's really me.<eos> How?<eos> As soon as the team lost contact with you,
Wait, what?<eos> You're going back to Earth-2 already?<eos> - Earth-3, actually.<eos> - But you just got here, Jesse.<eos> I know, I know, and I want to be with you.
So to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit?<eos> Come to see how things turn out for Team Flash?<eos> I wanted to see what happened to my friend.<eos> I am not your friend, Flash.<eos> I'm so sorry I did this to you.
You're gonna die right here!<eos> I forgot to tell you... my suit's cooler than yours.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How could Savitar be you?
Hello?<eos> Anybody home?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Who are you?<eos> What's wrong with you?
you weren't even crying.<eos> And later that night, a sound woke me, and I crawled out of my bed, and I realized that the sound was coming from downstairs.<eos> I peered over the banister, and... I found you crying alone.<eos> I knew I had to go to you.<eos> I sat next to you, and... you put your head in my lap, and I held you while you cried.
Now we can all focus our attention on... stopping Savitar.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Please tell me we're not gonna just let her walk out of here.<eos> - Now you want to fight?<eos> - We don't want to fight you.
Just like we figured out how to get you back.<eos> You sure this is the me you want?<eos> With all the baggage?<eos> Seeing you without the weight of everything that's happened, seeing you happy, like you were before your mother was killed?<eos> Without all of that darkness haunting you, you were finally free.

Um... there's something that I need to say to you.<eos> Hey, Cisco.<eos> What?<eos> Where?<eos> All right, I'll come pick you up.
Imagine: me inspiring you, and you applying that inspiration, and us changing the world together.<eos> And drinking so much coffee!<eos> Tracy Brand.<eos> Will you do me the honor... of joining Team Flash?<eos> With you?
But I do know that Chloe proved herself to you.<eos> Maybe now it's your turn.<eos> Maybe now it's time that you prove yourself to her.<eos> You don't have to prove anything to me.<eos> Well, normally, I would agree with you.
I never saw him again.<eos> See where I'm going with this?<eos> Well, look, man, the good news is... none of them has motive to be the killer. Because none of them cared enough about me to murder.<eos> Thanks for calling me in.<eos> I actually wanted to speak with you.
What'd you do to them?<eos> Nothing.<eos> They are inconsequential.<eos> You're different.<eos> He's different when he's with you.
Okay.<eos> Any sign of Burt?<eos> Not yet, but I'll stick around until someone approaches.<eos> What?<eos> I think I just figured out what's wrong with you.
'Cause it's not happening in real life.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I just wish you'd loosen up, Decker.<eos> You know, throw caution to the wind, be impulsive, just once.<eos> Instead of, you know, being you.
So... none of it was...<eos> None of it was real.<eos> Don't!<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Detective, I need to talk to you.
This is a terrible idea.<eos> I absolutely forbid it.<eos> I hate to agree with Her Highness, but she's right.<eos> You'd be on your own.<eos> We both know I can't go down with you.
Worse, maybe.<eos> At least He doesn't pretend to love me.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> I do love you.<eos> I went back to Hell for you.
You know, I didn't kick this thing off.<eos> You're the one that ordered everything on the damn menu.<eos> Can you shut up?<eos> I just had to pay for it.<eos> And I cleaned up after you... that's what I do.
I can't believe you set me up.<eos> I didn't set you up.<eos> Shut up. Enough.<eos> Hey, we gonna get down to business, or what?<eos> I'll deal with you later.
Thank you. No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well.<eos> I'm sorry we got off to such a messy start... but I'm still available to do business if you're interested.<eos> How long has he been doing this to you?
You haven't even asked about Kennedy.<eos> Okay, I was about to ask you.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> She's in the hospital, and that's where I'm going right now.<eos> All right, we coming with you.
It's about... a lifetime, about the risks two people take when their lives and their destinies cross.<eos> It was always about the music.<eos> Lucious's music was the very air that I breathed.<eos> It was the blood pumping through my veins.<eos> And when music can do that to you, whew, that's when you know.
And since you're all sedated, this might be the perfect time to... take advantage of you.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't die, Lucious. Please don't die.<eos> Because if you die, I'll get everything.<eos> 'Cause, you know, we didn't sign that prenup.
I knew I liked you.<eos> What is it?<eos> May I come in?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Look, this isn't about me or you.
Isn't that sweet.<eos> And it came out today? On the day of the primary?<eos> Angelo, it means nothing, okay?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Look, more importantly, whatever happens tonight, I'm with you.
One step at a time, though.<eos> One step at a time.<eos> And speaking of steps...<eos> I am about to take a pretty big one.<eos> Um, and I don't... I don't want to put a foot wrong with your moms. So, I figured that I would come and-and speak with you first.
We're just kind of freaky together, you know?<eos> That should work out fine for you, 'cause you ain't nothing but a freak.<eos> Well, you're the one that taught me.<eos> Shut up.<eos> There's only been two women who could deal with you, Lucious, and that's been me and Anika.
All right, come on over here.<eos> Girl, take this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Been waiting all evening for this.<eos> Let me get this chair for you.
- I've been waiting all night for this,<eos> - God. No, no, no, I got morning breath, and-and...<eos> - I just want to clean up. - Damn,<eos> - damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.<eos> - Why you acting so skittish?
Well, we take it one step at a time.<eos> Right, Angelo?<eos> Yes, yes. We've, we've been discussing this.<eos> As a matter of fact... I know that you like grand gestures, so...<eos> I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Cookie.
It's about me.<eos> And I'd be lying to you if I didn't say that.<eos> I still have feelings for him.<eos> You still have feelings for Lucious.<eos> I wanted to be honest with you.
Tell me when's a good time for you to...<eos> Why are you in a hotel?<eos> Lucious.<eos> Darling, I'm headed to the airport.<eos> Um... Let me say good-bye to you before you leave.
Angelo. Angelo, we need to talk.<eos> Angelo, please.<eos> Look, I don't blame you for hating me, okay?<eos> You're a good man, Angelo.<eos> I just, I just wish I was a good enough woman to be with you.
Yo, how many of y'all been shot before?<eos> But you haven't.<eos> Dad, nobody told you how to deal with your father getting shot, so don't tell me how to deal with taking a bullet for mine.<eos> And I'm sorry, but you play it hard and-and being hard-headed and doing it your way, that's why Bella was taken.<eos> Now, I want to work with you, but I ain't backing down.
Two Empire releases at the same time - will cannibalize attention from both.<eos> - Man.<eos> - Excuse me, Byron. - No, man.<eos> Shut your dumb ass up.<eos> Dad, I agreed to do a song with you, now you're pulling my album?
You know this is all her idea.<eos> Once she gets rid of me, she coming after you and your brothers.<eos> - Trust me on that.<eos> - My Lord. Ma, first of all I don't deal with that woman.<eos> Second of all, she has no sort of power to get rid of you.
Oh. Good old reliable angel radio.<eos> He was begging for help and then he just stopped.<eos> I need to know if he's still alive.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Well... we'll come with you.
As soon as I get the translation, you cast the spell.<eos> This gun is full of witch-killing bullets.<eos> So why don't you go to your grimoire and tell me how to break the memory spell?<eos> I told him you'd come.<eos> Boyd wanted to go after you, but I said, "Why bother?"
Do you really think they care about you?<eos> I mean, think about it, Crowley.<eos> They kill your kind.<eos> It's in their blood.<eos> And you know... you know... it's only a matter of time before they come... for you.
- Ketch.<eos> - Serena.<eos> You're headed past the Armory. If you wouldn't mind. Unpack, reshelve, and my Sig Sauer could use a good scrubbing.<eos> I have three PhDs.<eos> And we're all very proud of you, luv.
Family's always complicated.<eos> Parents always seem smart and strong and perfect. It's only when you grow up that you realize that they're just people.<eos> Love your brother? And even if you can't swing by, can you call me back?<eos> Just some stuff going down that's... Kind of got me spun out.<eos> Be good to talk to you.
This is Dean's other other cell, so you must know what to do.<eos> Hey. It's me.<eos> Sorry I couldn't pick up before.<eos> I've been on a hunt with ketch.<eos> And, Dean... I'm sorry I haven't been there for you and Sam.
Your favorite.<eos> Yes!<eos> After you eat.<eos> I only want good things for you, Dean.<eos> I'll never let anything bad happen to you.
It's, uh...<eos> I'm your mom.<eos> I know you're gonna be okay.<eos> You are gonna be... amazing.<eos> You have an angel watching over you.
And they'll all be starting to talk amongst themselves and speculating.<eos> Here you go.<eos> All right?<eos> Maggie, sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Three weeks I've had to wait to get an appointment with you.
I've said how amazing you are, for choosing to do this job.<eos> You're just trying to butter me up.<eos> No, I've done that.<eos> I'm being honest now.<eos> I'm so proud of you, Beth.
What can we do?<eos> Letters?<eos> Petitions?<eos> March on the offices?<eos> Bless you, petal, but I've looked in the eyes of the corporate behemoth.
I don't know what to say.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> God, that sounds so useless.<eos> Listen, look, whatever's gone on these last few months, if you need me, I'm here.<eos> I want to be here for you.
Every man who was at that party.<eos> Right.<eos> Pasta.<eos> Again.<eos> What's up with you?
How can you be a good parent when you're still a child yourself?<eos> Dad, pass the ball.<eos> - OK. I'll get these. - See?<eos> I told you this was a good idea.<eos> I'm really proud of you, mate.
It happened to me, too. I was raped.<eos> And when was this?<eos> Two years ago... almost.<eos> June 2nd. It was a Saturday.<eos> Do you know who the person was, that did this to you?
They're not judging you.<eos> You know, we're all here for you.<eos> Cath, I-I need to talk to you about something.<eos> Is it about the attack?<eos> Is it about what he did to you?
It's been a tricky day.<eos> But I wanted to make sure I saw you.<eos> I did what you asked.<eos> I spoke to Trish Winterman,<eos> - about you going to speak to her.
Couple of months.<eos> On and off.<eos> - Do you see him every weekend?<eos> - No, not really.<eos> - Was he with you all night?
I understand.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Really?<eos> You understand how you might have screwed this investigation?<eos> If we find out Trish's attacker has any connection to you, this will never stand up in court!
You're thinking, "How can she be so selfish?"<eos> I don't owe anyone anything.<eos> When I needed help, no-one was there.<eos> We were there, Nira.<eos> I was there for you.
- Hi.<eos> - Are we due to meet? - No.<eos> I got a call from the police.<eos> They're going to be making an announcement.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about it first.
Can you show us what you wore to Cath Atwood's party?<eos> Mum?<eos> Thanks, Leah.<eos> Well, I came here to say we'd be grateful if you didn't contact us any more.<eos> I can't help what happened to you, Trish, but it's brought up stuff that you're gonna have to answer for.
Not that way.<eos> Not through my house.<eos> Back way. Slink out, like your husband did.<eos> Go on.<eos> Mum, I need to talk to you.
- It's not like that!<eos> - It's never like that, is it?<eos> It's never your fault.<eos> You've cost me my job.<eos> You have no idea what this life is gonna do to you.
Because I... I blew what we had.<eos> And my life since then has been so empty.<eos> There's this... chasm... where you used to be.<eos> I just wanted to see you.<eos> Be with you.
Everyone's talking about your case.<eos> - The fact you got them.<eos> - Are they?<eos> Right.<eos> I'm really proud of you, Dad.
The road's shite again.<eos> He's meeting Kim Hopperstad there at four.<eos> Hildur.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I came to talk to you, Erling.
I didn't mean that kind of help.<eos> I meant...<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> This is Doctor Yelburton... she used to work here, but now she works in Khatri's lab of death.<eos> I need to talk to you.
I know.<eos> We all have.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I hardly see you in town anymore.<eos> Is everything alright with you?
What are you doing?<eos> Well, I had to bring her here.<eos> She had a straight flush.<eos> So, you escaped, you little dishrag.<eos> Well, I'm still married to Violet, and I will dispense with you on our honeymoon.
- Because I'll be running it.<eos> So that's how he did it.<eos> That was his promise. And you bought it.<eos> What I did was take matters into my own hands.<eos> He manipulated you.
Which is why I'm reconstituting B613 and will run it myself.<eos> You're retired.<eos> Three...<eos> I love you.<eos> I want Sunday dinners with you, to share this world with you.
Bobby?<eos> Lawrence Boyd.<eos> Must've made a deal.<eos> Some kind of trade for me.<eos> They're coming for you?
Without it, no steak.<eos> I am quite capable of convicting Axelrod with the tools at my disposal.<eos> I no longer need you.<eos> I have not made this sacrifice to come up empty.<eos> If you won't let me get waist deep in the Big Muddy with you, then I'm gonna want something for my trouble.
It's rich.<eos> She doesn't understand our kind of love.<eos> Doesn't mean she loves any less.<eos> Wait till your mom is asleep.<eos> If you can get Adrian to go with you... You can go for a couple of hours.
You wore me out.<eos> Can't take it to my lieutenant.<eos> She thinks this guy walks on water.<eos> Look, Santiago.<eos> Now, if you stir this shit, nobody will ever want to work with you again, ever.
Mirrors are replaceable.<eos> You were saying?<eos> You think what?<eos> Yeah, I don't want you home alone.<eos> I mean, just for a couple of days after school, hang out with friends, work in the library 'til I can pick you up.
Think of it as a growth opportunity, facing your fears, and whatnot.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I got the okay to fix my car.<eos> I'm gonna do the light at lunch.<eos> Well, I'm glad to hear that your car is okay, but, uh... I'm wondering about you.
Miles.<eos> It can't be you.<eos> It's me, Garth.<eos> Okay, what is happening here?<eos> I've been with you the whole time.
There's a lantern on top of newspapers.<eos> You call this normal?<eos> I call them adaptations.<eos> A prophylactic measure for a physical, medical condition.<eos> Did the doctor who granted me guardianship for you
What Jimmy's driving at is the last time I saw her, I covered up my illness.<eos> I'd been suffering from it for some time, but I went to great lengths to conceal that fact from her.<eos> I'm sorry I deceived you, Rebecca.<eos> I didn't want you to think less of me.<eos> Now Jimmy has outed me in front of you.
Yeah, but isn't it funny?<eos> They look like they're having fun.<eos> Hey, do you think they'd wanna go... I don't know... Bowling or something Friday night?<eos> Definitely.<eos> Oh, with you?
Enjoy.<eos> Hi, I am recovering super villain Prince Evillo.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> The name.<eos> Anyway, I am required to talk to you... About bullying.
You disgust me.<eos> Why?<eos> What have I done?<eos> I am your asset.<eos> I contacted you.
Dan?<eos> Do you know the red box trail in Shenandoah State Park?<eos> I can find it.<eos> Meet me there at 8:30 A.M.<eos> Proud of you, Dan.
You trust them more than me.<eos> I trust you enough to be honest about this.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> Locks, cameras everywhere.<eos> You obviously think someone is watching you.
We need to keep him motivated.<eos> Bryan, help me.<eos> Asha...<eos> Help me, Bryan.<eos> I know that he's there with you.
- I'm not gonna sanction a suicide mission.<eos> You going down there on your own is not gonna save Asha Flynn, and it's not gonna be an end to Mejia.<eos> It's just going to be the loss of one good man for nothing.<eos> And no one here is going to standby and let that happen.<eos> Like it or not, you are too important to us all now and to what we do, and I'm not going to debate this with you.
What do you think he will do now?<eos> Your Bryan Mills?<eos> I'll tell you what he's going to do.<eos> He's going to play directly into my hands in Mexico where I have the advantage because I control everybody from the army to the police.<eos> He will come for you.
Mm, mm.<eos> No. No, no, no, no.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Bye.<eos> We've been trying to get a hold of you for the past 15 minutes.
It's complicated.<eos> So boil it down.<eos> Complicated and personal.<eos> We got a tail.<eos> They with you?
You shady bitch.<eos> Crap.<eos> Betty's cell is off.<eos> - I'm getting an Uber.<eos> - Can I come with you?
Walk me to school?<eos> I needed time to process.<eos> To separate what my mom wants from what I want... I think I want.<eos> Which is?<eos> My mom says I should never speak to you again.
Pretending she's a butterfly when really she's a wasp.<eos> For the record, the only reason I went into that closet with Archie was so that Cheryl wouldn't.<eos> - Oh, so you did it to protect me?<eos> - Damn straight.<eos> Okay, so nothing happened between you and Archie in the closet, then?
Stab in the dark.<eos> I'm guessing she cares more about herself.<eos> She's the one who's telling you not to say anything, right?<eos> Look, I saw you guys.<eos> She's messing with you, man.
Write songs.<eos> - Did you see who fired the shot?<eos> - No, sir. Were you alone?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Who were you with?
Count me out, too.<eos> - I've got a date tonight.<eos> - You do? Which Riverdale hottie made the cut?<eos> Hey, Vee-Lo.<eos> I'll swing by the Pembrooke to pick you up at 8:00?
Yeah, but...<eos> No. These girls deserve justice, don't you think, Cheryl?<eos> You want vengeance?<eos> You wanna go full dark, no stars, Veronica?<eos> I'm with you.
Hey, guys.<eos> It's really hot in here.<eos> And getting hotter by the minute.<eos> Time to squeal, pig.<eos> Tell the truth about what happened between you and Veronica.
- But Ms. Grundy said that...<eos> - Grundy.<eos> She was your music teacher?<eos> One who left?<eos> This is hard to hear, and for me to say, but, I think she must've... Connected with you in a way that I just don't see us doing.
Castillo says you are bad, and now you think you're bad?<eos> I just... I want to get this right.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Who wouldn't?<eos> You want me to wallow with you?
I'll show him.<eos> Follow me...<eos> Jughead.<eos> Another fun fact about fear.<eos> Sometimes it grows up with you.
Look, Val.<eos> You don't sing on the bridge.<eos> Actually, the bridge is meant to be sung by two voices.<eos> What is up with you today, J?<eos> What is up with you today, Mel?
Veronica.<eos> I'm sorry about your dad.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Are you gonna do that on the day?<eos> Because if I'm gonna be up there with you,
Are you gonna do that on the day?<eos> Because if I'm gonna be up there with you,<eos> - we need to be on the same page.<eos> - Yeah, and we will be, Val.<eos> What's goin' on with you?
Fine.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Now, my turn.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Whatever is happening with you and Fred, can't happen under this roof.
Due diligence.<eos> We wouldn't want an unfit mother raising our grandchild now, would we?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I didn't do it, Betty, you have to believe me.<eos> Of course, I was with you, and I know who you are.
Maybe that's for the best.<eos> If you don't mind, Fred.<eos> Whatever you want, FP.<eos> It's between the two of you.<eos> I'll go with you, Dad.
Hey!<eos> Hey, get away from there!<eos> Moose, are you okay?<eos> Stay down. We'll get you some help.<eos> - Who did this to you, Moose?
I didn't think you wanted her, else why would she have been exiled like some pariah?<eos> To keep her away from your family.<eos> Oh...<eos> And not because you're ashamed?<eos> Why is your own daughter not living with you?
Why is your own daughter not living with you?<eos> She's not going to set foot in that twisted, poisonous house of yours.<eos> She should be so lucky.<eos> Cheryl, that's not helping.<eos> She'd do a lot better there than with you.
They should.<eos> How many, Mom?<eos> How many families like Ethel's?<eos> It's the risk of doing business with your father.<eos> Could Mr. Andrews lose everything, for doing business with you and Dad?
He's also pimping himself out to Cheryl.<eos> The Blossoms tried to run our business into the ground.<eos> Maybe if you tried talking to Mr. Blossom...<eos> I tried talking to him, Archie, he laughed in my face.<eos> Don't think for a second that the Blossoms are looking out for you.
Oh. "Clifford", please.<eos> And just so you know, you don't have to keep doing me favors.<eos> I like Cheryl.<eos> And I'm happy to be here for her, as a friend.<eos> You know, I'm going to be honest with you.
Val, hey.<eos> Look, you were right.<eos> About being bought and taking shortcuts.<eos> After last night, I'm done with the Blossoms, I am.<eos> Good for you, Archie, but I'm done with you.
Previously on Riverdale...<eos> They're ruining our lives, and to them it's just a game.<eos> They keep score in some secret playbook.<eos> You want vengeance?<eos> I'm with you.
We're past that point, Archie.<eos> I spoke to Mom last week, she didn't mention any of this, Dad.<eos> Your mom moved out two years ago.<eos> She didn't tell you because she wanted me to be the bearer of bad news.<eos> What if I came with you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> Betty, I'm not one of your projects, okay?<eos> Like solving Jason's murder...<eos> No. You're not a project, you're my boyfriend.<eos> Until you're sick of slumming it with me, or until Archie changes his mind and says he wants to be with you?
No, you're laying out some kind of trap for Jughead's dad.<eos> On the contrary, Betty, I took what you said earlier to heart.<eos> So you're not going to question Jughead or his dad about the murder then?<eos> I mean, only if it happens to come up as casual dinner conversation.<eos> I'm not playing this game with you, Mom.
One way or the other, I need to be sure.<eos> We can keep looking forever, Ronnie, and never find anything.<eos> Then what about when he comes home?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But I'll be right there, next to you, doing what I can to help. If you'll let me.
Tonight, I have two.<eos> Meanwhile, I'm having major deja vu.<eos> Remember when this was our lives?<eos> The best of times...<eos> Betty, tonight after the dance, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Have you seen Archie and Veronica?<eos> Oh, never mind, I see them.<eos> What the hell?<eos> There you are, Ms. Cooper.<eos> Mayor McCoy would like to review the evening's itinerary with you.
- What does Betty think?<eos> She thinks it's weird.<eos> Joaquin might know if FP was hired to kill Jason, if it was my father...<eos> I need to see this through to the end.<eos> We know FP used his call from jail to get in touch with you.
It was basically just a warning.<eos> Said to lay low.<eos> No one uses their one call to say "lay low."<eos> Joaquin, do you know something?<eos> I'm not talking to you as your boyfriend, I'm talking to you as the sheriff's son.
Daddy always comes back.<eos> Always, sweetie.<eos> Always.<eos> Daddy, why are you dressed so nice?<eos> 'Cause I knew I was coming to get you.
All right, you're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for what I did to you.
I don't know.<eos> There's something she's holding back.<eos> About Holland or herself?<eos> Somewhere in the intersection.<eos> Benitez agree with you?
I need to hear the ranting.<eos> - Barking.<eos> - Barking?<eos> He barks when he's excited.<eos> Do you have him?
Yeah. I just...<eos> I haven't been back here since that night.<eos> So, you and Amy left a Halloween party at a neighbor's house, which was...?<eos> Two doors down from the corner.<eos> And she broke up with you?
He's not looking at me.<eos> He doesn't look at me.<eos> How does he look at me?<eos> Senator.<eos> He's young, he admires you, he works for you.
I told myself that this was true, that this was you.<eos> You can't be the one person Who destroys every relationship I ever have, can you? !<eos> - Mellie...<eos> - Why are you doing this? !<eos> What is wrong with you? !
Instead of leading me to believe that this was something that you wanted,<eos> Mellie, you should be proud.<eos> Is that what you tell them?<eos> "Them"?<eos> What's going on with you?
I should be able to see him whenever I want, but I can't do that when he's at the condo because I don't live there anymore.<eos> Well, I'm gonna call Summer and get her to come back here.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> - You went behind my back.<eos> Maybe it's 'cause I don't want to talk to you these days, Alex.
Be that as it may, Frost insists on having an audience with this young man.<eos> Frost believes he will help bring Hollow Sky into a new stratosphere.<eos> Your services are required.<eos> This young man can trust you.<eos> He can relate to you.
I was sent here.<eos> To find you.<eos> You what?<eos> By a guy named Isaac Frost.<eos> He's the leader of this group called Hollow Sky and he wants to meet with you.
But she'll be on the other side.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> You'll visit her on weekends?<eos> That's not the goal of our research.<eos> You're so blinded by your delusions, you still can't see what's right in front of you.
I have been noodling and hieing my capital eyes on this success of yours, Fitzgerald.<eos> - I'm sure you have. - Yes.<eos> And I have a brilliant idea.<eos> We turn Paradise into a picture show.<eos> Starring you and Zelda.
How much is this costing anyway?<eos> Careful, Alfredo.<eos> Mr. Fitzgerald dresses left.<eos> That'll be a good look for Amory, don't you think?<eos> You'll be him, and he'll be you.
- All I wanted to do was write.<eos> This is what you wanted.<eos> Scott, my parents are here.<eos> What does it matter what I might have wanted a week ago?<eos> What is wrong with you?
She loves to jog and dog.<eos> Darryl, what can I do for you?<eos> The question is: What can I do for you?<eos> Because I get it.<eos> You're now the number one; I'm the number two, dangling under you, ready to drop in, make a splash.
You're doing really well, Nathaniel.<eos> No, I see how hard you work, how talented you are, how little food you eat.<eos> You're a very disciplined young man, and you don't need your dad to tell you that.<eos> You have to know that for yourself.<eos> I've been kind of a jerk to you, Darryl.
We have to get out of here.<eos> How are we gonna get out of here?<eos> - Just calm down.<eos> - I am calm.<eos> I just can't be stuck in here, and I cannot be stuck in here with you.
REBECCA (muffled):<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You do not have my consent.<eos> What in the world would make you think that I would want to have hot, naked, sweaty elevator sex with you?
Yeah.<eos> All day, "erryday," it's sexy sexy time.<eos> So what?<eos> I had sex with someone this morning.<eos> That has nothing to do with whether or not I want to have sex with you or not.
Right. Planned by your fiance's ex-girlfriend.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> VALENCIA: I am so good at my job.<eos> Head coordinator for assistant coordinator.<eos> Um, I'm right next to you.
See those free throws!<eos> You got it.<eos> You got it.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> What's up with you?
Oh. I would not mention him to Rebecca.<eos> Makes her upset.<eos> Okay.<eos> But what does that have to do with Harvard Law School?<eos> What has gotten into you today?
She's so happy.<eos> Yeah, but, Josh, if you have problems, she's the one you're gonna want to face them with, right?<eos> She's the one you chose.<eos> - But I don't want to hurt her.<eos> - You know, I'm proud of you, Josh.
Everything's gonna be okay, silly.<eos> - You promise?<eos> - Yes, I promise.<eos> God, you're so calming.<eos> I-I feel like if I could just stay here, in this gym, with you, all my problems would magically be fixed.
You swore you would help me find my way to Josh.<eos> You believed in it then even more than I did.<eos> (chuckles) Oh, I used to think you and Josh were written in the stars, and... all right, you know, then I realized that was... more for me than you.<eos> I needed that fantasy then.<eos> But now... oh, I'm so proud of you.
And I'd have to worry about DNA.<eos> As for my two cents, I'm just missing the ending.<eos> You promised one, 'member?<eos> Take a good look at me, buddy.<eos> I'm coming for you.
I want you to look at the picture.<eos> You want me to look at the picture.<eos> Yes.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> Because you're my neighbor and I want to be friends with you.
What was I supposed to do?<eos> - You should have talked to me about it.<eos> - I did try to talk to you.<eos> Next time, try harder!<eos> What is going on with you, Alex?
What?<eos> You gonna steal my gun and shoot me?<eos> It's empty.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you, Matthews.<eos> I just want to talk to you for a minute,
I'm just coming back from class.<eos> Cool, that's cool.<eos> Well, I was just, um...<eos> I wanted to see if maybe you'd want to do something.<eos> I would love to do something with you, Holden.
- or Kevin's as good as dead.<eos> This guy in the yellow jacket, he's a professional.<eos> My brother didn't even have a chance.<eos> Hey!<eos> Didn't you say he came after you, held a gun to my brother's head?
These days finding information on people is a piece of cake.<eos> Everyone is connected.<eos> Do you... do you really think the universe shows you where to go?<eos> The universe has a way of course correcting.<eos> It talks to you.
I mean, of all people, you know what that feels like.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - You were a whistle-blower.<eos> You know, you refused to go along with the cover-up into the shooting of Karim Ali and you testified against your colleagues at the inquest.<eos> That is why I insisted on meeting only you.
Dino, where's Charlie?<eos> In the alley, near 28th.<eos> In the alley near 28th.<eos> Hey. A little word to the wise-- the street changes a kid.<eos> So don't blame him if he doesn't want to go with you.
- It's not nothing.<eos> - I tried to run away.<eos> Solomon put me on the chain.<eos> I learned.<eos> What else did he do to you?
Is this an ambush?<eos> If it was an ambush, I'd be wearing a mask.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Give us a second.<eos> I- - I wanted to talk to you about Bram.
Give us a second.<eos> I- - I wanted to talk to you about Bram.<eos> I can't tell you how sorry I was to hear about his situation.<eos> Thank you. I just wondered if there was anything else that you can do for him.<eos> - Maddie didn't talk to you?
I can't tell you how sorry I was to hear about his situation.<eos> Thank you. I just wondered if there was anything else that you can do for him.<eos> - Maddie didn't talk to you?<eos> - She did.<eos> I just- - I thought maybe if I spoke with you directly--
- I do.<eos> - Then rise, Maddie Kenner, and receive your welcome into the Greatest Day.<eos> Welcome.<eos> It's time.<eos> I am so proud of you.
I believe the authorities look unfavourably on child labour.<eos> Oh, didn't I say?<eos> I'm a slow healer.<eos> I've been thinking -- if the baby's another girl, I might move out.<eos> I might come with you.
With my dying father.<eos> When will you go?<eos> As soon as I can get passage from Southampton.<eos> You've made the bravest, most caring decision that you could.<eos> I'm proud of you, Pats.
Wait.<eos> He can't go without an 'ankle.<eos> Give it to him.<eos> Take this from your mother, Andrew.<eos> And may God's love go with you always.
- Post.<eos> - Good.<eos> Post?<eos> Let me stay, please.<eos> I don't have to go back, I can stay in England with you.
I'm going to help you.<eos> No knife.<eos> No knife.<eos> I spoke to your neighbour.<eos> She's going to look after you, so you're not on your own.
It doesn't make sense!<eos> There's just no room in my head for it.<eos> Let me see what I can do.<eos> I wanted to come to your room.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
We express deepest gratitude for this day and every day, for the gift of this passage and that we have found The Ladder.<eos> There is one spirit whose name is Truth.<eos> ‐ And let's send some extra Love and Light to Joy, who leaves tomorrow for 3R.<eos> ‐ Love and Light.<eos> ‐ We are so proud of you, hon.
You leave the hospital, you think everything is better, and... you think everything is better, and... ‐ I can't. ‐ Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I feel so close to you these last few months.
You know, tends to happen when your father's a scumbag.<eos> She tells me everything, Solloway. I know it all... the fucking hot tub.<eos> - Dad, what the fuck?<eos> - Shit.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Sorry, I-I thought that was Whitney.<eos> That? God, no.<eos> That's... that's Elfrida.<eos> What, s... you and Whitney aren't...<eos> - Is she not here with you?
I'm just saying... let me help you take a break.<eos> Just hit pause, get off the merry-go-round, and take stock of where you are and what you want.<eos> I have nowhere else to stay, and I...<eos> You can... Just stay in my room.<eos> With you?
A finger in the bum?<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> I want you to know I understand.<eos> Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fury that drives you.
The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.<eos> I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven.<eos> I told you it's difficult to explain.<eos> Bran...<eos> I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.
I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.<eos> Today might be the day I kill you by accident.<eos> Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> I needed to see you.
But I can now.<eos> With the faces I can choose.<eos> I can become someone else.<eos> Speak in their voice, live in their skin.<eos> I can even become you.
- Goddamn it, Leon!<eos> Stop!<eos> Leon.<eos> With everything that's going on, you just sit here and feel sorry for yourself.<eos> And you? You're letting a grudge get the better of you.
Oh, also don't forget the, uh, committee meeting on Monday.<eos> 2:00 pm, can't be late.<eos> Yeah. I'll be there.<eos> Can I interrupt? Yes, please.<eos> What happened with you and Henry?
You know... We're talking to someone.<eos> Getting information from them, and... It is risky for this person.<eos> And I just... I don't want to be responsible if something goes sideways.<eos> Would you be responsible, though?<eos> I mean, isn't it that person's choice to talk to you?
I'm not hungry.<eos> Ah, come on, Richard.<eos> If he wants to stand, it's okay.<eos> I just thought, you know, considering your... condition now, maybe the equilibrium's a little off or something.<eos> Look, I don't mean to make fun of you.
Stop being a monster and be a man.<eos> Be a man you can be proud of, Cy.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm going to die in here.<eos> I will always be your friend, but I will not speak to you again.
You know, there's a restaurant in Kowloon that has a clay-baked chicken dish that you have to order 24 hours in advance.<eos> Yeah, Jaffar, I can't.<eos> I understand.<eos> 24 hours seems like a lot of hoopla for chicken, doesn't it?<eos> I mean I can't... I can't, um, go to Hong Kong with you anymore.
He looks familiar.<eos> That's Kevin's brother... the psycho that put you in a coma.<eos> Hi, I'm Jamie.<eos> Holden!<eos> They're coming for you, Holden.
I know.<eos> That's exactly what Holden's around here doing.<eos> You can help more than anyone, Luke.<eos> "More than anyone"?<eos> Until a few days ago, I was just the kid who visited the hospital, you know, every week with you and Mom.
Do you reimburse?<eos> I feel like a tool.<eos> You worried about style points?<eos> Why are you so intent on helping me?<eos> Because I care about what happens to you.
You're in a hospital, son.<eos> But you're okay. You're safe.<eos> - You're in a lot of trouble.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - They're going to be coming for you.
so be careful.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Hey!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
Um, I gotta... where... Where's the bathroom?<eos> There's... sorry, I'll be right back.<eos> Holden?<eos> Don't resist.<eos> They're coming for you, Holden.
I don't understand.<eos> What happened?<eos> I was lost 'till Holden woke me up.<eos> He saved me, Willa.<eos> Holden was in there with you?
Arthur?<eos> I've found... someone.<eos> Holden, this is Arthur... my grandfather.<eos> Grandfather?<eos> I've been waiting to meet you, Holden.
He attached Celeste to that machine... and he killed her.<eos> Isaac Frost is my father, isn't he?<eos> Is that why you kept him from me for all these years?<eos> I didn't need to keep Isaac away.<eos> He never once asked to see you.
You're safe with them.<eos> I get that.<eos> But you...<eos> Your friend needed you to dig a bullet out of his shoulder, so you dug a bullet out of his shoulder.<eos> You don't wait for things to happen to you.
Ahhh. It's not funny.<eos> - It's a little bit funny, right?<eos> - No, it's not. - Come on.<eos> - Gives me the creeps.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
He told me to call you if anything happened.<eos> How far are you from Fort Reed?<eos> You're awake.<eos> Ha. I'm glad.<eos> Selfishly, I... could hardly wait to meet you, but I thought I'd let you rest.
Solomon has business partners.<eos> As soon as they realize what's happened, they're gonna tear apart this bloc looking for us.<eos> We'd better go, then.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'm coming with you.
You found a safe harbor.<eos> I don't want to do anything to mess that up for you.<eos> I just need to know that if there's a knock on my door, you will look after Gracie.<eos> Of course I will, Katie.<eos> But nothing's gonna happen to you.
Remember, unclip, clip, every knot.<eos> Unclip, clip, every knot. All right.<eos> Let's see what you got now.<eos> I've climbed worse than this.<eos> I'll be right behind you.
Our Humvees had a weak spot, and the IED must have hit it just right.<eos> First thing I saw was one of my best friends.<eos> When I got home, I never said anything about it to anyone, not even your mom.<eos> I just carried it around inside me, and I can still feel it sitting there.<eos> That's why we need to talk about what happened to you in Santa Monica, 'cause I don't want you to carry it around like I did.
your little fancy life.<eos> Let me tell you what actually was going on.<eos> Noah was using you.<eos> He was using you to get the fuck away from us, and he knew the fastest way to do that was to marry some control-freak rich girl.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Let me tell you what actually was going on.<eos> Noah was using you.<eos> He was using you to get the fuck away from us, and he knew the fastest way to do that was to marry some control-freak rich girl.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?
She works for Vogue.<eos> Wow, fancy.<eos> She's smarter than me, more successful, much better looking.<eos> I'd say between the two of us, I'm winning.<eos> Between me and you? No.
Hey, what time did Martin get home?<eos> Martin?<eos> He's not home yet.<eos> He's not home yet?<eos> I thought maybe he was with you.
And I can't live like that.<eos> Well nobody's asking you to.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I just wanted to share it with you.
And so am I.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Hey, can I ask you something?<eos> Okay.<eos> Who was he with you?
No?<eos> No, I-I mean, no, not "no."<eos> Yes.<eos> Definitely yes.<eos> Of course I want to start a family with you. But I-I-I'm exhausted tonight, babe.
- Twenty-four.<eos> - So two years older than you.<eos> I don't know, don't you think you might have mentioned that?<eos> I mean, why wouldn't you tell me?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Alison, we must...<eos> - What good would that do?<eos> You know, look...<eos> Scott was a deeply troubled guy, and he was trying his best to hurt me.<eos> Yeah, I-I'm sorry for what happened to him, but I am not going with you to his mother's house.
I knew that the day I met you.<eos> You got married.<eos> To the wrong woman.<eos> If...<eos> I was going to break the rule, I should have broken it with you.
We had a deal.<eos> I think I'd like us to have more deals.<eos> If you think I'm gonna be working for you...<eos> But you are... because we found your weakness.<eos> It's standing right next to you.
There has to be some higher purpose.<eos> This is my shot, Jake, to run a clean election, to do this right, to make a president honestly.<eos> This is my chance at redemption for Defiance.<eos> So I have to win.<eos> There has to be a reason, or else why did I do this to you?
- Boring.<eos> - Did you ever have to shoot down any enemy planes?<eos> You ever have to kill anyone?<eos> Could you at least tell me that?<eos> I don't want to talk to you!
I know he is not cheating on you.<eos> And I know that some slut was texting him on election night... consolation for his big loss.<eos> He's been staying out all hours of the night with her ever since.<eos> I wanted to think it was you, but the two of you were in the same room that night.<eos> I was watching you.
Your phone, give it to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Jake!<eos> Where are we going?<eos> What is wrong with you? !
Why would you do that?<eos> You asked me how I played you.<eos> This is how I played you.<eos> You know, for as scary as you look, you sure do have a soft spot for a sob story.<eos> Who's playing you now?
The president does.<eos> Fully support the decision of our attorney general to pursue the death penalty against Cyrus Beene, for a crime of this magnitude deserves no lesser punishment.<eos> What?<eos> David, it's Abby.<eos> I need to talk to you.
We're supposed to be keeping an eye on Abby.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> That's what Liv told me before she left.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Why in the hell would we have to keep an eye on you?
She needs you.<eos> If anyone can pull her back, if anyone can save her, it's the one person who got out.<eos> It's Olivia Pope.<eos> God, how could you be so stupid?<eos> How can you look out for everyone around you and not see danger looking you right in the face?
If anyone can pull her back, if anyone can save her, it's the one person who got out.<eos> It's Olivia Pope.<eos> God, how could you be so stupid?<eos> How can you look out for everyone around you and not see danger looking you right in the face?<eos> I mean, what the hell is wrong with you?
It's Olivia Pope.<eos> God, how could you be so stupid?<eos> How can you look out for everyone around you and not see danger looking you right in the face?<eos> I mean, what the hell is wrong with you?<eos> How many times does this have to happen? When are you going to realize that the only people who really love you are right next to you?
I need one more shot.<eos> I know it seems unfair, but...<eos> I can't give up, James.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Of course I wish I could be with you, but you don't want to be with a man who's given up on his dream.
I would stake my life on it.<eos> Dad?<eos> What's going on, Dad?<eos> It's been too long.<eos> I wanted to see you.
You've made the ultimate sacrifice, Cyrus.<eos> It's time I do the same.<eos> I can't let you do this.<eos> You don't have a choice, Mr. President.<eos> The Deputy Bureau Chief just came into my office and told me that Olivia Pope is not being arrested and that he is now leading the investigation, reporting directly to you.
California votes with the following result...<eos> Mellie Grant.<eos> I told you to leave my father alone!<eos> I told you!<eos> And for some reason, you find it very hard to believe that if I had to choose between you and him, you will lose!
Yeah.<eos> The thing is, Every single time I run into one of those wives wearing her headband,<eos> "what the hell happened to you, lady?<eos> Wake up."<eos> There's nothing wrong with you, david.
The Constitution is in shreds.<eos> We, the people, have been suffocated by their bare hands!<eos> This is every man for himself, and I very much intend to save myself.<eos> That is my only concern!<eos> What did they do to you?
Listen to me when I tell you this.<eos> I hate you.<eos> All of this, this "you and me"...<eos> That was me doing my job.<eos> Everything I've done with you, everything I've done to you, has been...
I have never been in control of my own life.<eos> Never at any step.<eos> I think I am, but, really, I am surrounded by people who are experts at pulling strings and making me think I am in control.<eos> What I'm saying is that... you have taken so much from me, and still...<eos> I admire you.
We need a slam-dunk case that will reflect well on the President.<eos> So much for your sayonara.<eos> See?<eos> Liv's not going anywhere.<eos> What is wrong with you?
See?<eos> Liv's not going anywhere.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> You look...<eos> - What's wrong with you?
Okay.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - I can come with you.
I don't.<eos> - Livvie out there?<eos> - No.<eos> Can I talk to her?<eos> She doesn't want to talk to you.
Can I talk to her?<eos> She doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> She wouldn't be happy if she knew you were treating me this way.<eos> Shackled, locked up with no food or water...<eos> Olivia wants nothing to do with you.
That thing with those tabloid idiots went online, and Becca thought it would be crazy awesome to make a gif of me flipping them off.<eos> Now it's all over the school.<eos> Is that good or bad?<eos> You're talking to me again.<eos> When was I not talking to you?
Hello?<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Okay, I'll be right there.<eos> The alarm in my apartment's going off, so I just need to...<eos> - I-I'll come with you.
Otherwise, I'm gonna get sucked in and miss my surgery.<eos> - Hey, Dr. Lin.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I just wanted to say... you guys are the best.<eos> When you're diagnosed with the big effin' "C," you have this team behind you who's all, "We're gonna beat this."
But it's told to us to teach us something.<eos> - Delphine.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - I thought you were dead.<eos> - I wasn't allowed to contact you.
It's me.<eos> Sarah?<eos> What?<eos> What...<eos> - I came to get you.
- I know this is a Hygge party, and it's supposed to be relaxing, but it's hard to be relaxed when your guest of honor is late.<eos> I'll call him.<eos> It's easy to see why Diana leans on you so much.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, you don't have to be a therapist to know that she has some trust issues, but not with you.
That's why I wanna see you with a good guy.<eos> You discovered Colin, you supported him through the entire editing process, and the minute he got successful, he didn't have time for you.<eos> That is until he needs you again.<eos> I was married to a guy like that, and you deserve better.<eos> You deserve someone who treasures you, who... who opens doors, who walks on the outside of a sidewalk.
And what will you tell them?<eos> - That you stole from me? - Yes.<eos> Exactly that.<eos> - They don't need to know about you and me.<eos> - Do you realise what will happen to you?
I thought I told you to leave.<eos> So raise your glasses and give a cheer to 50 golden years!<eos> Emma.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Emma. Emma! Are you all right?
It's bloody chaos.<eos> - Get everyone outside.<eos> You, too.<eos> - No, I want to help!<eos> - I will not risk you.
- That's not what I want.<eos> - Since when?<eos> I want more, Shannon.<eos> You don't answer yesterday when I tell you that I love you.<eos> You don't answer a couple hours ago when I tell you I wanna be with you.
I think... I think I have a way to set us up for the rest of our lives.<eos> I just means that I have to stay with Sean a little bit longer.<eos> Shannon, I... I don't wanna wait.<eos> Okay?<eos> I wanna be with you.
I just means that I have to stay with Sean a little bit longer.<eos> Shannon, I... I don't wanna wait.<eos> Okay?<eos> I wanna be with you.<eos> I wanna be with you right now.
To look for validation elsewhere, so much that I was willing to take it from the first mentor that offered it to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I am, Lena.<eos> When you came to visit me in jail, I honestly wanted to be a better mother to you.<eos> But every time I've had the opportunity to choose you over something else...
Mon-El of Daxam.<eos> Though not...<eos> Not like the, uh...<eos> You know, the others Daxam. The killy ones?<eos> You must be a good guy or she wouldn't be with you.
Assist Lillian and Lena Luthor.<eos> Yeah, sure thing.<eos> When you go to meet her, I'm coming, too.<eos> You can't fight for me.<eos> But I can be with you.
The people we love, they're, uh...<eos> They're another secret superpower.<eos> Keep him with you.<eos> It's time.<eos> I'm here for you.
Ms. Grant!<eos> Well, at least he tried.<eos> - You came.<eos> - You called.<eos> They followed you.
There was a moment this year...<eos> Where I felt completely broken.<eos> When I regretted a choice that changed my life.<eos> And then you forced your way into my home, wrapped your arms around me, and you said,<eos> "I'm proud of you."
When I regretted a choice that changed my life.<eos> And then you forced your way into my home, wrapped your arms around me, and you said,<eos> "I'm proud of you."<eos> Didn't make me feel any better at the time, but it was something to hold onto.<eos> I am so proud of you.
I'm an intern.<eos> How did everything go?<eos> Salutations, my dear.<eos> Um... I think Chuck's working tonight.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
When are you and I gonna go a few rounds?<eos> Let me tell you an open secret.<eos> These traders I jack up all day, they are middle-school children.<eos> You, you are Mike Wagner.<eos> But you need to ask yourself where are you at right now?
Going after Spartan-Ives is asinine.<eos> A man facing a firing squad has only two choices... accept it or push against his restraints.<eos> And I don't accept anything.<eos> You were facing hard labor.<eos> Now you're in the firing line, and you pulled me right there with you.
- Why?<eos> You are lucky in your looks, just like your mother.<eos> You will have handsome children.<eos> I suppose you are still vain in your appearance though.<eos> I wish to speak to you as a friend.
You headed home?<eos> Gonna spend the rest of your night reading The Ladder in your room?<eos>  No.<eos>  Be easy, Hawk.<eos>  Can I come with you?
 I don't know anything about anyone following you.<eos>  Sure you do.<eos> It's what you guys do over there, isn't it?<eos> I mean, I did it.<eos>  I promise you, I did not have anyone follow you, Eddie.
How long are they keeping you here?<eos>  Till they think I'm fit to leave, I guess.<eos>  What are they doing for you?<eos>  Just tests, meds, I don't know yet.<eos>  They don't know what's wrong with you.
What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> That's... that's good.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Wait, what?<eos> Excuse me, are you messing with us?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> So this is just some creepy thing that you do, dude? Come on. Just leave us alone, okay?<eos> What's wrong with you?
How you doing, buddy, huh?<eos> I had to see him.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> No, that's fine. It's fine.<eos> Mom, I need to talk to you about something.
I hope you don't mind.<eos> No, that's fine. It's fine.<eos> Mom, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> Did Shahir explain what's going on?<eos> Mom, did Shahir talk to you about what's happening?
Put it down! Put it down! What?<eos> What? !<eos> It's a crime scene, Leonard.<eos> You already got your prints all over the damn shoe.<eos> I'm going first! What kind of Marine were you?
There's one of Chester and Leonard up there somewhere.<eos> I took it when Leonard was just a-a wee slip of a boy.<eos> He talked about you a lot, 'specially near the end.<eos> Bet there was a whole lotta cursing involved.<eos> He was proud of you, Leonard, for serving your country.
Previously on "Hap and Leonard"...<eos> What the hell is Chester doing with a dead kid's body under his house?<eos> - Hey, officer? - Yeah?<eos> There's somethin' we should show ya...<eos> What is wrong with you?
Police ain't done shit about our missing kids. That's why we want to talk to you.<eos> Who you?<eos> Florida Grange, Attorney at law.<eos> All right, girl.<eos> All right, well, where you are, I'll talk to you. Tell me about your boy.
Yeah.<eos> Black and beautiful.<eos> And you ain't.<eos> Never stopped me and you.<eos> Me and you ain't you and her.
And others?<eos> The hardest.<eos> You oughta know that by now.<eos> Boy...<eos> Me and you fixin' to mix.
- Is she fucking sleeping?<eos> - Dwight!<eos> - Man!<eos> - Dwight!<eos> - What's wrong with you?
I miss her so much!<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I miss her so much!<eos> - I got you.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I miss her so much!<eos> - I got you.<eos> I got you, man.
It's okay if you're nervous.<eos> It's a big day.<eos> I'm not sure if I can... hey...<eos> This isn't about anything else.<eos> It's about me and you, right?
What are you doing?<eos> Making room. Help me.<eos> I think she's drowning. So?<eos> She's dead anyway.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Dad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I made contact with the pilot.<eos> She wants to meet you at a neutral site.<eos> Why didn't she come here with you?
- About what?<eos> - About Jesse.<eos> I don't like keeping secrets from me mate.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I didn't know you and him were... when me and you... you know, when we...
Fragments started falling down.<eos> They hit our dome.<eos> Luckily, the safety blisters held, it was the only reason that we were able to get out.<eos> What happened to Mei?<eos> You were really badly hurt, the doctors had to induce a coma, and I stayed with you.
- My badge! See, your friend saw it straightaway because of her eye.<eos> But... it's moving like a reflection.<eos> It's not reflecting you.<eos> It's mimicking you.<eos> There's something in the water pretending to be you.
This won't hurt at all. - No, but tell me.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Yeah, cos I think you're going to wipe my memory.<eos> I'm not stupid, you know.<eos> That's the trouble with you.
- I was quite happy where I was.<eos> - Dr Powell's orders.<eos> - There you go, Mr Bright.<eos> He'll be by later to discuss your X-rays.<eos> Did they talk to you?
For an officer of your talent to remain at detective constable would be a waste of material.<eos> Believe me, Morse, I've seen it all too often.<eos> Better men passed over in favour of mediocrity because they weren't... club.<eos> So you think I should take it?<eos> That's a matter entirely for you.
But we don't know where that power comes from.<eos> - I don't think that matters.<eos> - It does matter.<eos> Look what happened when those guys tried to take the stick away from you.<eos> It acted defensively, like it was connected to you.
Well, did they leave?<eos> Not before they checked out the shop, like, fully.<eos> What if they come back and break in?<eos> Nick, you need to get out of here.<eos> I'm going with you.
Not very good.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> - If anything happens to Nick...<eos> - Yes, I've heard it all before.<eos> I really think you should be more worried about what happens to you.
It's Renard.<eos> Hey, Captain.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Put him on the phone.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
I'll be on the roof.<eos> Renard only has one thing he can use against you.<eos> My son.<eos> Can you get Adalind and the kids, bring them back here?<eos> - I should go with you.
She has amazing abilities, ones I don't understand, and I don't know where they came from.<eos> And Sean doesn't know either.<eos> We have to protect her.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so happy to be back here with you.
- Anything you say or eat will be used against you in the court of law.<eos> No, honey, you have to wait till the water boils - until you pour that in.<eos> - It is.<eos> Sweetie, the stove's not even... on.<eos> It must be fun being you, isn't it?
See what happens when I don't do what I must.<eos> Kenneth Slater?<eos> He's one of the victims that was kidnapped on the case I was looking into.<eos> But he was returned alive.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.
Listen, you probably don't want to hear this right now, but your wife is not crazy.<eos> Wow, I guess you would know, huh?<eos> - Haley...<eos> Haley...<eos> - No, no, I'm done - talking to you, Paul!
Um, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not sure what happened.<eos> You gonna follow me everywhere?<eos> I like your new place, Sean.<eos> But I'm not following you.
You gotta stand up.<eos> All right.<eos> You're gonna have to go first.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, I'm right behind you.
- He alone?<eos> - No, no.<eos> He's here with a bunch of friends for a birthday.<eos> Gonna be here two nights.<eos> I'm gonna make him pay for what he did to you.
I think so.<eos> Maybe one too many last night?<eos> Yeah, that's probably it.<eos> I need coffee.<eos> I can go with you.
I adore it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was just looking at the view.<eos> It is so... beautiful, yes.<eos> But it could never hold a candle to the view of you.
- Rosalee. - Nick!<eos> - Eve.<eos> - Monroe!<eos> Monroe!<eos> What is wrong with you?
She's a Hexenbiest.<eos> I suspected this.<eos> Are you together?<eos> No, it was complicated.<eos> Sean, everything with you is always complicated.
- And you gave them to her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I'm worried she's gonna try to do this on her own.<eos> - Is that what she said?<eos> - Not exactly, but she's really worried that this skull thing is gonna come after her, after you, even Diana, not to mention the rest of us.
- I need to talk to her.<eos> - I was hoping you'd say that.<eos> - Hank.<eos> - Nick, we got a body.<eos> Okay, I'll pick you up.
And I'm worried she's gonna try to do this on her own.<eos> Sorry... Didn't mean to wake you.<eos> I wasn't sleeping very well anyway.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Did Renard talk to you?
Wait, Nick.<eos> I don't think this is such a good idea.<eos> We don't even know what kind of power this thing has or where it came from or what effect it's gonna have on you or us.<eos> It's the only option we've got, and we don't even know if it's gonna work.<eos> If it does, I'm going with you. - No.
He could've killed us, but he didn't.<eos> No, he needed you there to open the way from his side so he could cross over with you.<eos> This day was predicted from all the symbols on the cloth.<eos> We think that everything is supposed to happen today, March 24th.<eos> Wait, did he follow you here?
Now, there's a prophecy about something called a Shaphat.<eos> A child bride for evil.<eos> I'm not letting that thing anywhere near my daughter.<eos> You and Adalind need to hide her.<eos> Zerstoerer has connected with Eve and you in your loft, so that's out.
What did you guys do with the books?<eos> I wanna find out as much as I can about Zerstoerer.<eos> In the cellar, we left them out and open.<eos> We were kind of in a hurry to get here.<eos> Rosalee and I will go with you.
But I did nothing for them.<eos> Nick.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> Who?<eos> The other Grimms fighting with you.
- Rosalee.<eos> - Nick.<eos> - Hank, you're okay!<eos> - Wait, you're okay?<eos> - And you.
Are you going out?<eos> I've been thinking over what you said, Uncle, about Lord Coniston,<eos> - and I wondered if I shouldn't go to London. - Oh, my dear.<eos> You'd make your old guardian very happy.<eos> I only wish I could come with you.
Chynoweths stroll in where Warleggans fear to tread.<eos> Did you manage to advance our cause?<eos> How?<eos> By the subtle disparaging of Ross.<eos> I observed no such subtlety from you.
How very blessed we are.<eos> I wonder how Dwight will keep Christmas this year?<eos> Easy now, Williams.<eos> Merry Christmas, sweetheart.<eos> God's grace be with you.
I wish there was a way to repay you.<eos> There is.<eos> Tell Caroline.<eos> What?<eos> How it stands with you now.
I think ye still pine for the girl who be lost to ye.<eos> - I've missed you, sister!<eos> - Rowella!<eos> I did not know what the obligations of marriage would be.<eos> Is he unkind to you?
When do you expect?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Mama never spoke of such things.<eos> I did not know what to expect, what the... obligations of marriage would be.<eos> Is he unkind to you?
- Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm tired of being Uncle Shahir.<eos> And I want to be a father.<eos> With you.
And so she broke up with me that night.<eos> But this was '91.<eos> Your dad was elected the previous year, So you weren't working on the campaign.<eos> Well, I was also really busy with sports.<eos> So, you were lying when you said amy broke up with you. Because you were busy with your dad's campaign.
I'm being a pussycat compared to how the d.A.'s gonna be.<eos> Trials are war and you need to toughen up.<eos> Your testimony seems smug and evasive, And if I were in the jury box I'd be jumping up and down to convict you.<eos> So, let me ask you this again,<eos> Why did amy meyers break up with you?
I wasn't going to be the latest in a long line of people. Who've abandoned that kid.<eos> Isaiah could fire you for this.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay then.<eos> I'm going into court with you.
Yes.<eos> Back where you belong.<eos> - Louis, I can't do that.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> And not only that, you can get the ten best associates from Robert Zane's stable to come with you.
If I wanted to rip you apart, you'd be in million pieces right now, because Jessica is gone, and you're not in my league.<eos> I offered the merger because my daughter has some kind of misguided loyalty to you, and I didn't want to extinguish that spark in her.<eos> If I'm not in your league, why is she loyal to us instead of you?<eos> - Watch yourself, Harvey.<eos> - Robert... I'm not looking to get in a fight with you.
- Mike...<eos> - Stop messing with my life!<eos> Harvey.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> I was just gonna come talk to you.
Yeah, well, I don't believe it, and I didn't come here to see you.<eos> I came here to honor my father, so get up there, say what you're gonna say, and let's get this over with.<eos> Harvey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
It was a nice speech.<eos> Thank you, Harvey.<eos> Harvey... when my parents died,<eos> I felt like I was completely alone in the world. I don't want you to feel that way.<eos> I want you to know that whether you want me in your life or not, you still have a mother that loves you and will always be there for you.
You're turning this around on me?<eos> I'm not turning it around, Harvey.<eos> You have no idea what it's like to have a child who acts like you don't even exist.<eos> You don't know what it's like to have a mother who asks you to lie to his own father for her.<eos> Harvey, I never should have done that, and I have been trying to tell you I am sorry about it for 20 years, but until yesterday, you made it clear to me that you had no interest in whether I lived or died.
- Harvey, Harvey...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Let him get it out of his system, 'cause I know I want to get it out of mine.<eos> I didn't come here to fight, Harvey.<eos> I came here to tell you I've never seen your mother more excited than when she was heading out to have dinner with you.
I know that, but I need him to be able to anyway.<eos> Give me the file.<eos> I'll figure something out.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm proud of you, Louis.
- I do.<eos> It's just...<eos> I thought we could talk.<eos> - What do you mean talk?<eos> - Harvey, please, I need to talk to you man-to-man.
Be serious.<eos> - I am being serious.<eos> - Well, you know what-- never mind.<eos> - Louis, it doesn't matter what I see.<eos> What matters is what this woman sees, and she obviously sees something, or she wouldn't be with you.
But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think i don't really know you.<eos> Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?<eos> - Are we ready to take a picture?<eos> - no, I don't.<eos> And now I feel like I'm ruining this, so... If you don't want me to come in with you, I won't.
We don't know everything about each other, but that just means we need to get to know each other better, and what better way to get to know each other then by preparing to bring our child into the world?<eos> - Louis, if this is your reaction to what we went through today, I feel like I know you better already.<eos> - Speaking of what we went through today, how'd it go?<eos> - Why don't you take me home, and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> - Harvey, can I talk to you for a second?
There's no point talking to her again.<eos> The point is that something was bothering her and she was ordered to suppress it.<eos> Mars is using peace as a distraction.<eos> "Peace as a distraction."<eos> God, I wish I could disagree with you right now.
You saw what happened when we stepped off the ship.<eos> You're breathing natural air.<eos> You're trying to orient yourself with that damned horizon.<eos> Just rest.<eos> A transport is coming to get you.
A friend at the Martian Embassy managed to get me Sergeant Draper's service record.<eos> Anything interesting?<eos> Not at all.<eos> She's an exemplary soldier who does what she's told to.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- Amos!<eos> - Enough.<eos> Stop it!<eos> He can't find Mei if you bash his head in!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Look, you think I don't know what this feels like?<eos> I know what this feels like.<eos> I lost my whole career on the witness box.<eos> My reputation, too.<eos> You think I'd do that to you?
- Oh, sure, thanks.<eos> The case against Bloom is still very, very good.<eos> Yeah, and the jury will love me.<eos> How could they not?<eos> Amy. What happened to you on the stand was a mistake that could have happened to any one of us, and they will all learn from that.
What's going on in there, Eugene?<eos> Tracy's taking a nap, Mrs. Loach.<eos> We'll be out in... just... just a minute.<eos> Tracy, honey, are you okay?<eos> What's he doing to you?
I didn't have you pegged as a cliché.<eos> Bartender at Sugar Foot said you might know where He is.<eos> - Which bartender's that?<eos> - Tall black guy.<eos> Said I should talk to you.
- That was fast.<eos> - What was fast?<eos> Well, I assume you're here to tell me you filed suit against Velocity.<eos> What I'm here to tell you, Craig, is Mike Ross is gonna handle Velocity.<eos> Then we have a problem, 'cause I didn't cut a deal with Mike Ross. I cut a deal with you.
It's an executive kitchen.<eos> I'm an executive.<eos> Yeah, but you're a bagel guy.<eos> This place is like croissant central.<eos> Then maybe I just came in here hoping to spend some quality time with you.
Then why don't you start drafting a suit.<eos> 'Cause after I get these people on board, that's exactly what we're gonna have to do.<eos> Donna, you're never gonna believe what Louis just asked me.<eos> Give me three guesses.<eos> He wants to be you.
My gift to you was saving your ass when you screwed the pooch by involving me in this case.<eos> Seriously, Harvey, I appreciate you rolling with this thing.<eos> Especially when I had to improvise.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> The truth is, I like getting the chance to work with you again.
Well, I-i know you don't want the job,<eos> But, um, good luck with your interview today, mom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You going down?<eos> I'll go with you.
You told me it was family business.<eos> You told me to fall back.<eos> Do you know where he is or not?<eos> I could find out. Good.<eos> I'm coming with you.
That's the most important thing for both of us to keep our jobs and our lives, do you understand?<eos> Mom?<eos> Raina.<eos> You said you loved my dad.<eos> You said you wanted us to live with you.
Angela was there? Yes.<eos> The cops were...<eos> in their rooms. Went through their things.<eos> When I get out, I'll make it up to them, okay?<eos> When I get out, I'll make it up to all of you.
I held you down with taking care of Ruiz and knocking off Milan.<eos> Dre, J's been in the game with us for years.<eos> You show up a couple of months ago, you think you ready to be a distro?<eos> Yeah. I am ready.<eos> Look, Tommy, I've been real with you since day one, man.
- Come on... show me... just... just one time.<eos> Hey!<eos> Speak English.<eos> English!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Stop!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Or what?<eos> Just... don't.<eos> What happened to you, Hitler?
Drinking it.<eos> 'Til the end of the world, right?<eos> 'Til the end of the world.<eos> Hey, asshole.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. I'm talking to you.
I'm a greedy, selfish, destructive.<eos> You name it.<eos> Jealous.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe that's the difference, though, between me and you.
The police came five minutes later.<eos> He go to prison?<eos> Yes... he got out on parole last year.<eos> Moved back to Paterson.<eos> Okay, and did he ever contact you again?
We know you weren't in Manhattan the night that Quinn was attacked.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So why are you here?<eos> - Well, we think someone planted your cigarette butt there at the scene.<eos> Notice anybody suspicious watching you?
- Okay.<eos> So why are you here?<eos> - Well, we think someone planted your cigarette butt there at the scene.<eos> Notice anybody suspicious watching you?<eos> When you get out of the can, you feel like the whole damn world is watching you.
When you get out of the can, you feel like the whole damn world is watching you.<eos> Judging you, hating you.<eos> Anybody in particular?<eos> Uh, yeah, I noticed, uh... a car.<eos> Following you?
You're safe.<eos> Quinn, you're safe now.<eos> You're safe.<eos> You're safe.<eos> I got you.
Quinn, you're safe now.<eos> You're safe.<eos> You're safe.<eos> I got you.<eos> I got you.
I got you.<eos> How you holding up, Liv?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> The LBA is sending a representative to the station.<eos> He'll be with you when you make your statement.
Well, Erin. He...<eos> He really cares about you.<eos> Maybe... Maybe you don't have to tell him.<eos> Why do you keep doing this to me?<eos> What's going on with you and Erin?
But don't go in hard.<eos> He's practically one of ours.<eos> Hank.<eos> Bunny Fletcher is here.<eos> She says she's not leaving until she talks to you.
Okay, ladies, bed checks.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You know you're supposed to be in your room already.<eos> Ellie.<eos> Ellie, can I talk to you?
Have you spoken to Philippe?<eos> Does he have the happy news of his bride?<eos> He remains at Saint-Cloud.<eos> And when does he return home to Versailles?<eos> I wanted to speak to you about that.
Not blue.<eos> Why not? It's the King's colour.<eos> Red, then.<eos> A rich crimson.<eos> Fashion will be our standard, darling, and the people will walk behind you.
Take Fox and Leddy with ya, knock on every door.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Good.<eos> Go.<eos> So am I with you today?
Yeah. An hour ago, those two hated each other, But then his father extends a hand.<eos> Dr. Charles calls it "flipping the script."<eos> Don't know if I could've done it.<eos> Yeah. Not many people can.<eos> Okay, what is with you?
Can you elaborate? What exactly did you see in ms.<eos> Scott? Well, I...<eos> I saw real sadness. You know, there were tears rolling down her face, and, um, her jaw was clenched, you know, and her body sort of drooped with what looked like shame.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Are you sure you're gonna be all right?
I'm just really sorry.<eos> It should be me apologizing to you.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm the one who made everything worse.<eos> I haven't been fair to you.
Possible she doesn't wake up.<eos> Never wakes up, renal failure, deficits, coma...<eos> Wheeler?<eos> They're just kids.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Maybe we're just experimenting.<eos> To see how it feels.<eos> Or...<eos> Maybe we're reliving something that happened to us in the past.<eos> Did something happen to you, rey?
I was explaining how you don't love her.<eos> Of course I love her.<eos> Then why don't you want her to have any friends?<eos> This is crazy.<eos> Grace, can I please just talk to you?
That's because it didn't change me.<eos> I'm the same person I've always been.<eos> I beat it, just like you said I could.<eos> Senator.<eos> I'm your brother... the same one who followed you around when we were kids.
I know.<eos> I just can't shake this feeling.<eos> Something's off.<eos> Off how?<eos> With the mission or between you and...?
I'm tired of playing games, Mack.<eos> Coulson said that if I wanted to know where you went today, I should ask, and he's right.<eos> Um...<eos> I went to see my ex.<eos> I-I've been wanting to talk to you about this, and...
What's the occasional bullet in the head among friends?<eos> Done.<eos> Now talk.<eos> Where's Radcliffe?<eos> I'm right in front of you, and...
We brought you here for your own protection.<eos> My own protec...<eos> I don't want your protection.<eos> I don't want anything to do with your Agents of Doom.<eos> What happened to you?
What, are you kidding?<eos> I've never seen this guy before in my life.<eos> You want the book?<eos> Let him go.<eos> - What did they do to you, man?
Superior.<eos> That's all I wanted to hear.<eos> I leave the city now.<eos> You've made it far too great a risk to even be in this country.<eos> We both know S.H.I.E.L.D. will come for you and try to take you down.
You don't even know, like May.<eos> Stop it! The ...<eos> The same goes for you.<eos> Of course this is happening.<eos> This always happens to you, to me, to us.
I'm sorry.<eos> What are you apologizing for?<eos> It's been a few years.<eos> It makes sense to take this step.<eos> I would love to live with you.
Did you find the extraction beacon?<eos> Exactly where we programmed it.<eos> Okay.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> Hydra is after you.
- Twin cam, 88.<eos> Ooh! That's my girl.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> Do what they say.<eos> I'm right here with you.
Please...<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> So, this Radcliffe... is he dangerous?<eos> Maybe not physically.<eos> But sometimes the greatest threats are the ones right in front of you.
If I knew, I would tell you because if anyone could get you to wake up and realize that this nightmare isn't real, it's her.<eos> She loves you and you love her and she's a real person, not a hydra murder-bot who's got your brain...<eos> The carrot or the stick?<eos> When neither motivates the truth, we face unspeakable choices.<eos> What happened to you, Fitz?
- No.<eos> My days of following blindly are over.<eos> If there's any truth to what you're saying, you'll have to show, not tell.<eos> I can work with that.<eos> I'm not talking to you.
Daisy's looking for a way out.<eos> Hello, Agent May.<eos> - I'm Jemma Simmons...<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> My squad's been hunting you the past week.
Come on, May.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Just jump.<eos> Jump.<eos> I followed you.
And the first thing I choose, Leopold... is you.<eos> It's not that simple!<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> What stopped you?<eos> - He was right there with you, no?
Emergency dose.<eos> That's too dangerous.<eos> Might give me enough Adrenaline to take on some terminators.<eos> I'll find a way to take them myself.<eos> I don't want any - more bad to happen to you.
Shame.<eos> I will miss that place.<eos> Come on, stay awake.<eos> We need to find a way to the surface.<eos> And I haven't been totally honest with you about what happened when you were not around.
- You watched, unaffected, as I took a hammer to the bones of the Director's corpse.<eos> I couldn't feel this then!<eos> Now you are like an infant, unable to process these new emotions or the idea that you don't always get everything that you want.<eos> And you have yet to experience the thrill that killing can bring.<eos> Maybe I'll experience that now... with you.
How can she even look me in the eye?<eos> Or even stand the sight of me at all?<eos> How can she stomach it?<eos> The memory of seeing me shoot that woman...<eos> Um, you know, the reason I... wanted to get closer to you in the first place was... to try to understand what you two felt for each other...
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> I haven't been totally honest with you.
This book opened my eyes to the truth about Inhumans.<eos> It contains a plan to defeat them, and you can all be a part of it.<eos> I smell a load of L. Ron Horsecrap.<eos> Daisy, goodness.<eos> Is Coulson with you?
- There's music and art...<eos> - And smashing heads on the floor.<eos> That's the one I like the best so far.<eos> Did you know that blood has a copper smell?<eos> Okay, Ophelia, I'll go with you.
We can go away, start again.<eos> Too late.<eos> This is making me feel better.<eos> Fitz, why do we feel better when we make someone else suffer?<eos> Because there's something wrong with you, you psycho!
I feel terrible that I tried to pull you away from her and worse that we couldn't save her.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> There's nothing to forgive.<eos> Those years with her, as a father, it'll always be a part of me.<eos> But they also gave me a glimpse of a life I could have here... with you.
We gonna do this shit or what, man?<eos> Amber!<eos> Amber? !<eos> Why ain't you returning any of my calls?<eos> Maybe because I don't wanna talk to you, Ricky.
What about...<eos> What about the woman in the car?<eos> She's doing OK, she broke her collarbone.<eos> Her face is pretty smashed up.<eos> Have you got someone staying with you?
If he's dirty,<eos> I'm not getting in your way but right now, this nightmare... whatever else Musgrave has you doing, this is your priority.<eos> Clear?<eos> I need to go to Toronto for the autopsy.<eos> I'll come with you.
They weren't going to let any of us get away.<eos> Not if you had a red tag.<eos> This is your stop.<eos> As they used to say.<eos> It was nice to finally meet you.
- Such a special day.<eos> - Such a blessed day.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> We are right here with you.
I imagine you must find this strange.<eos> I guess it's a little strange.<eos> I want...<eos> This will sound silly.<eos> I'd like to play a game with you.
Don't get too close to her.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> Trusting anyone is dangerous.<eos> Especially a carpet-munching gender traitor.<eos> I'd like to play a game with you.
- It's just a package.<eos> It could be anything! A bomb.<eos> Anthrax.<eos> What do you know?<eos> What is wrong with you?
I like the car.<eos> Good.<eos> You're here early.<eos> I need you to take point on a consumer fraud hearing for Sandra.<eos> Nathan, I need to talk to you.
It doesn't make sense for us to be working together on this.<eos> All right, you want the truth?<eos> When Jessica made managing partner, she and I never really got to do cases together anymore.<eos> You used to work on cases together?<eos> Yeah. She was me and I was you.
I lost a chance at being a father.<eos> And those associates have always been my children to me.<eos> My children.<eos> And the truth is, I've been neglecting them ever since they got here, but that ends this morning.<eos> I'm proud of you, Louis.
- So what's the problem?<eos> - The problem is those fantasies weren't of me being a therapist to a man who's still too afraid to admit that he needs help, much less take control of a firm that bears his name.<eos> Thank you for dinner, Harvey.<eos> If you need a session, call my office.<eos> Unfortunately, I can't see you anymore, but I can give you a recommendation for someone who can.
- Commander, sir.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Blessed day.<eos> - Rita?<eos> - What's wrong with you?
According to your chart, it's Ceremony night.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, fainting isn't uncommon on Ceremony nights.<eos> How are the Waterfords?<eos> Are they treating you okay?
Fuck!<eos> God damn it!<eos> God fucking damn it!<eos> We're home.<eos> Look, I'm sorry this is happening to you.
Not gonna be a lawyer.<eos> Mike.<eos> The thing is, I was fine with it until Harvey started dangling it in front of my face.<eos> I think the problem was, I actually started believing it could happen.<eos> Do you want me to stay with you today?
I accidentally forgot my pen in the conference room.<eos> I have one you can borrow.<eos> Benjamin, when I say accidentally, I mean intentionally because it gives me an excuse to go back in there and eavesdrop on what they're saying about us.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Can I come with you?
Because when they see me without you, they're gonna think it's two against one and they'll make me an offer to cut you out.<eos> Wait, you actually think they would do that?<eos> Of course they will.<eos> These guys are vultures.<eos> Well, then shouldn't I go with you so we can stop it?
Thanks, Harvey.<eos> Actually, you weren't really in the Bar, ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd ask how your day was, but last time I did that, it didn't go very well.<eos> Tara, can I be honest with you?
How dare you say that to me after what I had to find out about you.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means you're sitting there like you're the high priestess of moral authority, when the first time we slept together, you were with another man.<eos> How can you say that to me?<eos> I was up front about it with you and with him.
- Look at that, even when we cancel, I feel like I'm getting to know you better.<eos> Me too.<eos> So are you gonna tell me what's going on?<eos> You know what?<eos> Now that I just talked to you, I feel like I can - work it through myself.
I know this is a shock for you, Emily.<eos> Things will be easier for you now.<eos> You won't want what you cannot have.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Look, I'm sorry this is happening to you.
No.<eos> Must be nice.<eos> Ten ways to tell how he feels about you.<eos> Number two.<eos> He keeps finding ways to accidentally run into you.
Offred, is that you?<eos> I heard there was a bit of trouble in town.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A bit.<eos> Are you all right?
Did you make your proposal to the committee?<eos> Yes, if it did any good.<eos> D6 and 7.<eos> What about you?<eos> I've barely had a chance to talk to you.
Can I get you a glass of water?<eos> It's June.<eos> My name.<eos> It's June.<eos> It's nice to meet you, June.
Moira, do you know Rachel?<eos> Hey.<eos> No. Okay?<eos> No.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Judith!<eos> I can't find the fan.<eos> She was struggling, so I went to go and help her.<eos> Edwina, the fan is in the other cupboard.<eos> Right in front of you.
That's not your issue.<eos> Really?<eos> It seems to me that it is since that's what stands between me and winning.<eos> No.<eos> Your anger is what stands between you and winning, your inability to De-personalize this competition, and as a result...
Dolls deputized me before he... He did, right?<eos> - Indeed.<eos> - Just... find out where the revenants have gone.<eos> We need to make sure that they're... not regrouping or planning something.<eos> Hey, can I... can I talk to you?
- Just... find out where the revenants have gone.<eos> We need to make sure that they're... not regrouping or planning something.<eos> Hey, can I... can I talk to you?<eos> OK, when was the last time you slept slash ate slash applied deodorant?<eos> Did Bobo do something to you?
- What are you doing?<eos> Pretty easy from this side.<eos> I just hit the button.<eos> Well, hit it again!<eos> - I'm coming with you!
No, seriously, erm...<eos> I'm very...<eos> Drunk?<eos> Grateful.<eos> I admire you.
Makes you scared to leave your own home.<eos> Is David back?<eos> He was.<eos> Went straight out again.<eos> He spoken to you?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> Renee!<eos> Let me in.<eos> Where's John?<eos> Ain't he with you?
Don't do this.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> David...<eos> I know you weren't at the bank vault.<eos> I followed you to the lock-up...
Shut up.<eos> Come on, son.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What about John?<eos> Is he with you?
You really think P would bother to have us look that shit up in a book?<eos> She says... she misses you.<eos> Tell her I miss her, too.<eos> So much.<eos> What makes you think she talking to you?
You're all bullshitting around, making demands no one's ever going to listen to.<eos> I'm the only one doing the real work around here.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Uh, some sort of coin locker baby.<eos> Red, what is going on with you?
I can't stop thinking about her parents.<eos> It's this adoption, Jonathan.<eos> It's making me feel things I don't want to feel.<eos> It's making me a worse doctor.<eos> Look, I can't control how you're feeling, Shahir... but I can be here for you.
It's Martha!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Let's take a walk.<eos> I'm really happy you're here.<eos> Ever since I met you, I've wondered what it would be like to be with you... to actually be with you.
It's an Orthodox thing...<eos> It's when you go on a series of dates and you talk about big things like morals and values, and by the end of it, you know if you're compatible or not.<eos> I'm gonna say we didn't pass with flying colors.<eos> No, we did not.<eos> But it didn't make me want to be with you any less.

Oh, my...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do you think everybody can tell?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, what happened to you?
They all had blood work done a few days before they disappeared.<eos> Blood work?<eos> That's weird.<eos> It's missing persons.<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
Yeah, didn't wanna overdo it.<eos> So lunch?<eos> No, actually, I'm working.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> I'll come with you.
- Just stop.<eos> - Winn, let me help...<eos> Just stop!<eos> I'm good here, maybe.<eos> Or you know, at a desk, but I can't go out there with you again.
In our line of work, it happens all the time.<eos> How do I know you're not gonna run next time it does?<eos> I won't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanna be happy with you.
Then what would the Speedster need the Spear of Destiny for?<eos> He could just go back and change history himself.<eos> Changes to history cause timequakes and aberrations, which we can undo.<eos> Changes to reality, however, those are permanent.<eos> Who's coming for you?
Hello, Sara.<eos> Good-bye, Sara.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Mr. Rory, we meet again.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
You're suffering from hypothermia.<eos> You're not thinking clearly.<eos> You're not thinking clearly.<eos> You're the one who doesn't think seals are cute.<eos> Whatever, I'm tired of arguing with you.
I-I just thought that you would want my expertise.<eos> After all, I have already retrieved two fragments of the Spear, but...<eos> Word to the wise, speak to me with respect.<eos> That little thing on your head doesn't control me.<eos> I don't want to fight with you, Amaya,
Um, he said something about paying his respects to the queen before we left.<eos> Hm, funny,<eos> Sara said the exact same thing.<eos> I just wanted to say good-bye.<eos> I enjoyed meeting you.
You kissed me when you were sick.<eos> Yeah, um, says you.<eos> Are you working with me because you like me?<eos> I don't know what to tell you, okay?<eos> I want to work with you, Kara!
I'm sorry if that disappoints you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm going to find Livewire and her soldiers because someone has to.<eos> And apparently I'm the only person in National City that appreciates how evil she actually is.<eos> - Well, let me come with you.
- We're here, J'onn.<eos> All right.<eos> M'gann?<eos> This is where it happens.<eos> What is happening to you?
Tell me.<eos> To be your friend.<eos> I couldn't bring your people back to life, but I could make you feel less alone.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm here with you.
I don't want to be the guy at the office anymore.<eos> Yeah, I don't want to just be stuck behind a computer.<eos> We're going to do this.<eos> And we're going to do this alone if we have to.<eos> But we would love to work with you.
You're cut off after this one.<eos> Armek.<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> Would you prefer it in the human tongue, wife?<eos> I am no longer bonded to you.
What other species deserves to be obliterated because you decide you're better than them?<eos> Whichever one we choose.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I don't need to bond with you to know that J'onn J'onzz and the Kryptonian are your friends.
Yeah. I guess so.<eos> Kara.<eos> I'm not ever going anywhere.<eos> I promise.<eos> Just because I'm with Maggie, it doesn't mean I'm not with you...
I have for a while.<eos> I just didn't...<eos> Know what it was.<eos> I've just had one of the hardest nights of my life, and I'm heading into something I probably won't survive,<eos> but standing here with you, I feel like everything's going to be okay.
It was like ripping a Band-Aid off every day of my life.<eos> So, I really am a Luthor.<eos> We're the only two Luthors left.<eos> And we need to be there for each other.<eos> I want a second chance with you.
Could've, should've, would've.<eos> It's a... That's a thing I heard at the bar.<eos> It's not...<eos> Yes, but I don't want to do that anymore.<eos> With you.
It's Vera Wang.<eos> This is not okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry, I came on strong.<eos> I'm just enthusiastic to finally be here with you.
Don't you...<eos> Don't you see what he's doing here?<eos> He's creating havoc so that he can play the hero and then impress you.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> She's been slumming it with you for so long, she doesn't realize what's out there.
Mxyzptlk!<eos> Show yourself, you smug, grand-standing dandy.<eos> Bummer sticks.<eos> It's just you.<eos> I've come to challenge you, Mxyzptlk.
- No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You may have cut me off from the Fifth Dimension, Daxamite, but I still know a thing or two about the old fisticuffs.<eos> How could you think she'd ever want to be with someone like you?<eos> Why, you think she's gonna be with you?
It's in the rules.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's only room for one crazy person in this relationship.<eos> Maybe we should just... control-alt-delete this, and we can talk it over with a cup of Thoni tea.<eos> Being with you would mean being at odds every day with my heart, Mxyzptlk.

Yeah?<eos> Me, too.<eos> - Um, one note.<eos> - Okay?<eos> I would like to wake up next to you.
Jeremiah!<eos> Eliza.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My God, did I miss you?<eos> Hey, Kara, can I talk to you for a second?
And bingo.<eos> Find anything?<eos> Yeah, GPS coordinates for everywhere this van has been.<eos> I know where Cadmus is.<eos> - Want me to go with you?
So don't let Snapper or anyone else tell you differently.<eos> Okay?<eos> - You know something?<eos> - What?<eos> Maybe being Supergirl and having you is enough.
Okay, okay.<eos> Oh, wow, this is a little complicated so it just might take me...<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> Well, I think it's time we give the noobs the old Supergirl welcome.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Supergirl, watch out!<eos> J'onn, she's losing altitude.<eos> I'm trapped!<eos> I'm going up there.<eos> - Right behind you.
Kara Zor-El.<eos> Stand down!<eos> Stand down!<eos> Do not engage! Do not engage!<eos> I need to speak with you.
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh...<eos> - What does she want?<eos> - You. - She wants to talk to you.
...as a violent alien wages an all-out attack against innocent civilians.<eos> Laser eye patch.<eos> That's new.<eos> Well, duty calls...<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
Emily.<eos> Alex, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanted to come see you.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
I crossed an ocean of stars looking for my son.<eos> I'm not going to let you get in my way now.<eos> Your family awaits you.<eos> No! Wait!<eos> I'll go with you.
We'll talk later.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where is she?<eos> What did she do to you?
Alex, we're ready now.<eos> So, how'd it go? Good.<eos> Thank you for making me do that.<eos> You guys talking about me at the end there? Yeah.<eos> She said how lucky I am to have you.
I don't even understand it.<eos> You make it look so easy, to do the right thing that you wouldn't even guess that it's that hard.<eos> But it's hard.<eos> You sacrifice a lot for everyone else and...<eos> I know I'm beginning to sound like a broken record here but I admire you.
He sent me a personal invite to this press conference.<eos> - Are you gonna go?<eos> - Jack's my Kryptonite.<eos> But it's just gonna bring up a lot of painful things, and I'm not sure I can relive it.<eos> But if your good friend Kara came with you...
You could have made it easier on me.<eos> It's not like I wanted to go.<eos> I'm not here to make it harder.<eos> I just miss you.<eos> May I please have dinner with you?
- Weird.<eos> Mike seems nice, though.<eos> Maybe we can do a proper double date sometime soon.<eos> Yeah, uh...<eos> I actually came here to talk to you about Jack.
Okay.<eos> It's been a while since I had a best friend.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And I haven't felt like that since Clark.<eos> And working with you, it makes me happy.
- Maggie.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - Yeah, I was just looking for Alex, wondering if she checked in with you.<eos> Didn't you crash at her place last night?<eos> I did, but she left to catch up with you after you left.
Just...<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Those firsts that you talked about...<eos> I want to have them all with you.
Through a wall, Alex?<eos> He's an alien with telekinetic and telepathic powers.<eos> Hey, look at that. It's like the...<eos> The... The Mona Lisa.<eos> You said that he connected with you.
- All of us?<eos> - All of...<eos> Tomorrow we could begin the material trials.<eos> I keep forgetting that success means that you're leaving.<eos> Working with you has meant so much to me.
Or we can work together.<eos> And we can save our loved ones and this city.<eos> You mean your daughter that you kidnapped and framed?<eos> We're going to save this city.<eos> But we will never work with you.
We're clear of the supership and safe.<eos> Fire at will.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Turn it back on, Mother.<eos> I came for you.
Why is it turning back on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not in control of myself.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm not going with you.
I found out you work here.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's creepy.<eos> Oh, no, no, I'm...<eos> I'm just... I'm just messing with you.
You're very beautiful.<eos> I'm not trying to make things weird or anything.<eos> I just... I think that you're beautiful.<eos> How are you happy like this?<eos> Well, I'm with you. Um...
But he left a long time ago.<eos> But don't let it worry you, it must have been a thief or a poacher.<eos> Thieves. Perhaps.<eos> It's strange though that the dogs didn't bark<eos> Clara? Were you feeling unwell last night?
It was never yours to begin with.<eos> You got to get it in the boat before you can hang it on the goddamn wall.<eos> Only thing to do in a case like this is write off the loss against your cap gains.<eos> This was supposed to be my cap gain.<eos> Anyway, I-I should be apologizing to you.
You got used to it.<eos> Still is better than anchovies.<eos> That's for fucking sure.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> Where are you?
It's not up for debate.<eos> Why the change of heart?<eos> We need to get the word out, what we know.<eos> Stop.<eos> What's with you?
She's not on the grounds.<eos> Your mom's been doing really well.<eos> She'll be okay.<eos> Yeah, well, she couldn't have gone far but I'll drive around, take a look around.<eos> I'm coming with you.
You saved my life.<eos> How's Kelly?<eos> Doing okay.<eos> She's a strong girl.<eos> Can I run something by you?
Yes.<eos> It was sloppy.<eos> Agreed.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> Are you all right?
I'll try.<eos> Oh, have you marked out the finish line with paint?<eos> I think Captain Grimes was doing that.<eos> Well, he HASN'T done it.<eos> That's one for you, please.
Throwing things into little hoops?<eos> The hammer?<eos> I'm not entirely sure what that is -- but presumably you just need a hammer.<eos> And then you throw it.<eos> Well done, Pennyfeather. I'll leave the details to you.
- Maybe.<eos> Are you stupid or something?<eos> Mom told us not to say anything.<eos> She's a liar, just like Dad.<eos> Sup with you, 'Riq?
You feel everything, hear everything, smell everything... Wide awake.<eos> Then you have a heart attack.<eos> Shit all over yourself.<eos> Last one I seen, took the dude a full 45 minutes before he stopped twitching.<eos> That's what's gonna happen to you.
Then you have a heart attack.<eos> Shit all over yourself.<eos> Last one I seen, took the dude a full 45 minutes before he stopped twitching.<eos> That's what's gonna happen to you.<eos> That's exactly what's gonna happen to you.
Don't leave anything out.<eos> We already went through this.<eos> Go through it again.<eos> I got to Truth in the morning.<eos> I met with you, Proctor, and Karen Bassett.
- All right, see ya.<eos> 'Riq, 'Riq, hold up a minute.<eos> See you, Baby Girl.<eos> See ya.<eos> Yo, man, what's up with you?
- Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - I got it.<eos> - Good.<eos> 'Cause it doesn't matter how many eyes are on you right now.
He ain't gonna let nothin' happen to anybody.<eos> It's like a formula.<eos> That's enough for this size.<eos> You a'ight?<eos> What's wrong with you, little nigga?
I know I messed up at the dinner.<eos> And so I tried to paint you a thing... 'cause I know you like cherries.<eos> It was supposed to be a bowl of cherries, but I can't even do that right.<eos> One more classic Greenberg failure.<eos> Josh, what is going on with you?
Not bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She was talking about transparency, you know.<eos> And how we can't live double lives.<eos> May the road rise up to meet you.
Understand?<eos> Helen?<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm coming with you.
Aye, well, some bastard took 'em.<eos> Giving me the third degree.<eos> Seeing if I had spareribs on the menu.<eos> Aye, and I'm still bloody watching you.<eos> And you!
45 minutes of my time waiting for you.<eos> I had a whole goddamn spread.<eos> Man, I'm sorry.<eos> - Leslie...<eos> - I've had it with you.
I may want you out of there. I may pull you out of there.<eos> Today. Before she comes.<eos> Cool.<eos> I'm gathering some information.<eos> I'll reach back out to you today.
Me and my Vardies have just pollinated three miles of wheat.<eos> - 'You've got to keep smiling.'<eos> - Got to what?<eos> - It's the Vardies.<eos> - God, what's wrong with you?
No reception.<eos> Shireen, please, sort the record out.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> Is it something to do with the music?<eos> Did someone do this to you?
Because nationalism is an infantile disease.<eos> The measles of mankind.<eos> Where on Earth did you get such an idea?<eos> Papa, you didn't.<eos> I'm proud of you, Albert.
He's here for one week... one week... and he fixes all our problems.<eos> We should have school vacations more often.<eos> Albert.<eos> Albert.<eos> I'm very proud of you.
With an envelope or something and I stash it in a church. And I call another guy and let him know it's there. Go on.<eos> About two weeks ago, I had to leave an envelope...<eos> With a letter to a pow. Call him...<eos> Let him know. You have another package for him, he needs to get it today.<eos> If you give him a distress signal and he doesn't show up. At the church, my colleague gets the last word with you.
If you will not get a real job, how on earth will you survive?<eos> Maja.<eos> Big brother.<eos> We missed you in Milan.<eos> I thought it would be best to meet you and Mother here.
I'm fairly certain I just said it.<eos> Don't act like you want to marry me.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> I missed the train because I was distracted.<eos> I couldn't wait to share my ideas with you.
Nope.<eos> I was standing in that office, and it was everything I'd worked for.<eos> And all I could think about was you.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I'd give everything up to be with you.
I know that four milligrams makes you a bit groggy, so I could break it up for you.<eos> You know what else might help? I have today's crossword puzzle.<eos> And there's only one word filled in with pen, which is almost certainly completely wrong. Aside from that, it's brand new.<eos> I know that always helps me fall asleep. You're such a good guy.<eos> Are you-are you sure you're okay? Yeah, no, it's just... it's, um... it's just work stuff, you know?
I take it you're not coming, then?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't you want a life of excitement? Adventure, wonder?<eos> Yeah, I really do. Um...<eos> Just not with you.
Yeah, why-why not?<eos> I mean, it's been a while since we went out. - Really?<eos> You're up for it?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Lucy, I'm up for anything, if it's with you.
that's personal.<eos> Are you and Lucy thinking about...<eos> - It's just between us, so...<eos> - Joshua!<eos> - I am so proud of you, man. - Thanks.
I actually think I'm gonna go for a walk.<eos> - Uh, how come?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I need some air. - Okay, wa... wait.<eos> - I can walk with you.
You should probably get going soon to that strip club.<eos> Traffic around the airport's always crazy.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> What's the matter? I am just dreading this bachelor party.<eos> I'm gonna be stuck there all night, unable to leave, and all I feel like doing is staying in with you
Okay, boys, it's showtime!<eos> - Go get him, boss.<eos> - Yeah! Show him.<eos> Who the (bleep) are these guys?<eos> Mike, are you... are you all right?
I was with a woman in Brussels.<eos> You admit it.<eos> It was your heroine, Marie Curie.<eos> I spent hours talking to her, told her all about you.<eos> She even said she'd want to meet you one day.
The Academy would be the perfect place for you to do your work.<eos> I can't move to Berlin, Elsa.<eos> Why not?<eos> You know I couldn't wait to get out of Germany when I was a boy.<eos> If I came back, it would only be because I want to be with you.
And he certainly didn't tell us that Jamie was his girlfriend's best friend.<eos> Now why would he keep that from us?<eos> Is Rory the jealous type?<eos> No, I... wouldn't say that.<eos> Look, I'm going to have to ask, love, was there something going on between you and Jamie?
- Vera...<eos> - It's OK, Dad.<eos> We've seen his texts, Rory.<eos> All last weekend, wondering why you dumped him, wanting to meet and talk, saying how much he loved you, didn't understand why you dumped him.<eos> Now, because you ignored him, he got angry, drunk and angry, - and went to meet you out at the Priory. - No.
It was really about our family.<eos> He was jealous of what we have.<eos> He wanted to destroy us.<eos> Me in prison, you and Jennifer alone.<eos> I couldn't stand the thought that he might be using you... .. so I lashed out.
That's right.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh. Oh, that's right.<eos> Come on.<eos> I told you I was gonna come for you, Eugene.
No, it's work.<eos> It's going badly.<eos> But it's more you.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
If ever I'm in a position to influence the policies of this country, I will fight with every bone in my body to make sure that our veterans get all the care they and their families need.<eos> My second pledge is that we will never go to war unless our interests are directly threatened.<eos> We will honour our alliances but we will not sacrifice our men and women to other nations' misguided ambitions and strategies.<eos> That'll go down well in Washington.<eos> Kretchmer asked me to talk to you.
- Who's protecting you, Tony?<eos> Who are the wankers who smashed my bike?<eos> - I don't know what you're on about.<eos> - Then I'll call the press.<eos> Boy, are they itching to talk to you, Tony.
You could have said, "This is rubbish."<eos> You could have stopped everything right there.<eos> No, the ships had sailed.<eos> The intelligence didn't matter.<eos> We were going to support our ally. "I will be with you whatever."
I think Greenwood was right.<eos> I AM being followed.<eos> A van, two men in it, outside my house.<eos> And at the cemetery.<eos> Think the spooks are still after you?
'Jesus, what's going on?<eos> ' You should call Greenwood.<eos> Tell her.<eos> No.<eos> 'Em, if you're being followed, call the cops.'
You think he would pay for the expedition?<eos> He fancies himself an intellectual, and he funds the Prussian Academy.<eos> Why not go directly to the source?<eos> Can you arrange a meeting?<eos> Only on the condition that I accompany you.
What's wrong?<eos> You're becoming famous.<eos> You draw more attention than an ordinary man kissing his mistress. Elsa, you are not my mistress.<eos> Are you not still married?<eos> I'm here with you.
- Yeah.<eos> - You're drunk, go home.<eos> Scumbag Mak's gonna file a charge with the New York State Bar.<eos> I'm gonna get suspended or disbarred.<eos> Everything that is happening to you is happening to you because your client murdered Greg Knox.
I'm angry that the lawyer I trusted just got disqualified.<eos> I'm angry that I'm standing here with you wondering if you ready for this shit.<eos> You didn't pick me, I get it, but you need to get over that shit.<eos> And you need to do it pretty goddamn quickly, because if we can't trust each other,<eos> I am no good to you and I'm the nigga standing between you and a needle.
This is zulu-13.<eos> I'm 20 meters from jackpot, ready to infiltrate.<eos> Roger.<eos> Got to watch your six, newb.<eos> Lilywhite, along with "right in front of you," what's another place that bad guys might be?
No, they didn't.<eos> Shoot.<eos> I thought I was on to something.<eos> Let's go have dinner.<eos> There's something else I wanna bounce off you.
The clubs will be open soon, and our stuff will be flowing in no time.<eos> Chicago, they need answers soon.<eos> Keep my phone.<eos> What if something happens?<eos> How are we supposed to reach you?
For the dance floor?<eos> The VIP area?<eos> Whoever planted the gun had to go upstairs.<eos> I'm on suspension, Jerry, but from desk duty you could look.<eos> Even discussing this with you could have me lose that desk job.
Tommy, look...<eos> I don't know any other way to say this.<eos> I'm your dad.<eos> You're my son.<eos> And I want to meet you.
- Damn it, 'Riq...<eos> - Get out of my room.<eos> Ow, Tariq, stop!<eos> I'm your dad.<eos> And I want to meet you.
Yep.<eos> Three more trucks.<eos> Probably four hours, tops.<eos> All right.<eos> I gotta go, but I'll hit you later.
Yes, 100 backstroke and 100 butterfly.<eos> I'm trying to get my times right so I can swim at nationals this year.<eos> My son swam when he was at school too.<eos> Of course he gave it all up when he went to college, but<eos> I'm sure your mother is very proud of you.
QCP.<eos> Cheers to that.<eos> Tariq. That you, son?<eos> Hey, I want you to come in here and meet someone special.<eos> This gentleman right here standing in front of you with the gray suit is the legendary Councilman Rashad Tate.
You know, to wake his eyes up.<eos> Yo, stop fucking around.<eos> Get him on stage.<eos> This ain't over.<eos> When we're done with you, your outside's gonna match your insides.
They will.<eos> I promise.<eos> It's just, I wasn't...<eos> You know, nobody teaches you how to be doin' these things.<eos> And I wanted to meet you first.
This is not some shiny extracurricular, Piper.<eos> You're right.<eos> This is actually very important.<eos> Whatever.<eos> It's far too hot to fight with you.
Storm in there and decoupage them into submission?<eos> It's freaking awesome.<eos> Where did you find that?<eos> My wife. Big on Pinterest.<eos> Mendoza, you all right?
No, it was your mother and those bitches.<eos> She made you do it, and everything else that's fucked up in your life.<eos> Huh? Right?<eos> Where were you when all this was going on, huh?<eos> That gun may have landed in front of you, but it was your finger that pulled that damn trigger.
We're sacrificing the one for the many.<eos> And what's the difference between her and me?<eos> Hey.<eos> You shot a motherfucking guard and you gonna "hey" me?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
What'd I do?<eos> - See?<eos> That does look rewarding.<eos> Thanks to them being locked up and all at our mercy and everything, we have a chance to make a real change around here.<eos> If your mom could talk outta her Ritz cracker, I think she'd say she's proud of you.
I told you she wasn't just a bossy twatwaffle.<eos> Is that you, Vause?<eos> I thought that you hated shower sex.<eos> I'm giving this one last shot.<eos> For you.
This is wrong on so many levels.<eos> If you're gonna contour your blush, you gotta blend better.<eos> I'm not comfortable.<eos> Oh, you poor thing.<eos> Who did this to you?
Yeah, you fully hiding, ain't you?<eos> Fuckin' thermometer planet.<eos> Come on!<eos> One more round.<eos> I ain't playing with you no more. "Gyno" is a word.
Three hundred more are strolling around the hallways, hungry and bored, looking for some action.<eos> What exactly... were you thinking you'd do?<eos> You think I'm here to rescue the hostages?<eos> I've taught my guards to fend for themselves.<eos> I'm here for you, Reznikov.
Inmates will always try to cheat, manipulate or deceive you.<eos> There must be consequences.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Fucking stop it!<eos> The fuck is wrong with you?
- Yeah.<eos> What, Christmas is coming early this year, huh?<eos> It's just a little stocking stuffer.<eos> It's, uh... some chocolate for my chocolate.<eos> It's always candy with you, huh?
You are arguing with the wrong bogeyman.<eos> I represent the governor, and his priority... is that we end this ASAP.<eos> Well, it's my priority to make sure we do right by these women.<eos> And why do you think I'm here, Joe?<eos> To have a threesome with you and that lunatic who ran in here before?
- It's a long story.<eos> - What do we do when he wakes up?<eos> - We torture him into a confession.<eos> Don't you think that we have all already suffered enough in service of your revenge scheme, Red?<eos> Did he do that to you?
I kill at trivia night.<eos> In Connecticut.<eos> Specifically in Connecticut. Mmm.<eos> Fuck, would you look at me?<eos> I'm all giggly and gay for you.
It's gonna be all right.<eos> The doctors, they're gonna take care of you, and I'mma be there real soon.<eos> I'mma be there when you wake up.<eos> I got a plan... and I'mma be right next to you before you know it.<eos> Mama's coming for you.
Whoa!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Jesus, come on!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Gina, you magical nymph!<eos> I stand corrected.<eos> This totally makes up for the electricity thing.<eos> Fuckin' A!<eos> To you exactly what you are doing to us right now!
Fine.<eos> - Hey, nurse?<eos> You still open?<eos> - Do you really wanna keep playing that?<eos> - What happened to you? - Uh...
But, sadly... still sober.<eos> You gonna tell me what happened, or you... you gonna keep stalling with all your words?<eos> Uh, for now, I don't want to talk about it.<eos> You know, I don't wanna think about it.<eos> All I want to do is just sit here, you know, with you.
You have taught me... that...<eos> love hurts.<eos> You've taught me that life...<eos> It hurts.<eos> And I want to be there for you.
I'm gonna go to Arkadia.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm a better thief than I am a hunter.<eos> - I'll come with you.
Rodents!<eos> We should have gone through with it.<eos> A smack in the old witch's mouth and we'd have been sorted.<eos> What, and risk going back inside, is that what you want?<eos> Are you all right, Mildred?
- You don't have to.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I'll take a cab.<eos> - I'm taking you home.<eos> What is going on with you?
- You did it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everyone is so pleased.<eos> I know it was tough, but you got through it.<eos> - I'm really proud of you.
And now she needs a nap.<eos> Sleep!<eos> Train, say your prayers, eat your vitamins.<eos> Chewables and the swallow kind.<eos> I'm coming for you, Hep Cat.
Things don't just happen.<eos> People make choices.<eos> They want things, and then they go for them.<eos> Can we go somewhere and talk about this?<eos> - I don't wanna fucking talk to you.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Frau.<eos> Is there anything I can help you with?<eos> No, thank you, Helen. I'm all right.<eos> I just wanted to say again... how very sorry I am about Ilse.<eos> She was very fond of you.
Look, I get that there's no great way to deliver this news, okay?<eos> But coming out here and pretending to audition for a show that I'm directing, and then following me around like some crazed fangirl,<eos> I mean, definitely, you know, made it, you know, worse.<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> I just... wanted to meet you.
Okay?<eos> I'll fight you.<eos> - Who's that yelling from the audience?<eos> - You heard me.<eos> I said, I'll fight you.
We're gonna have so much fun.<eos> Stop ignoring me!<eos> Stop ignoring me, you pussy!<eos> Pay attention to me, you miserable sad sack!<eos> - What's wrong with you?
I'll be so good.<eos> No, that's crazy.<eos> So I have to be a niffin, yet I don't even get to be a niffin?<eos> I could travel the universe.<eos> I could see things you couldn't even imagine, but instead, I have to be bored and stuck with you!
Is it gone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did it.<eos> But, Julia... there was a complication.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
When I was young, my father told me that physics was a waste of time.<eos> I only realized at the end of his life that he wasn't being cruel.<eos> He was terrified for me.<eos> And I forgave him for it... only too late.<eos> I'm proud of you, Hans.
It's not very common in women.<eos> True.<eos> Scalpel, Bernard.<eos> Adrian didn't say you were coming.<eos> OK. He wants me to shadow you.
- Can you turn the screen on? - Mm-hm.<eos> Ironically, we think that's when the men actually go underground, and they get cunning.<eos> You know... porn, affairs, prostitutes.<eos> Interesting theory.<eos> Is that what happened to you?
You love Cinnamon. But she is prostitute. You know that.<eos> She blew me without a condom.<eos> Yeah, and then after, she say, "I don't normally do that." Yeah?<eos> Pretend.<eos> She can't go with you to Gold Coast.
I'm... I got to go.<eos> Um, where's Charlie?<eos> Um, I texted him.<eos> I think he just had a late shift.<eos> Alex, are you going to be okay?
Hunter! I was okay with the new Hunter at first, but this doesn't seem so good.<eos> ♪ I don't know what's going on.<eos> I get hungry, I get mad, I get tired.<eos> It's this never-ending cycle.<eos> Well, we're gonna find out why this is happening to you.
Hey man, it's not like I didn't see the attraction in your life.<eos> Even... Even in school, you could buy anything you wanted.<eos> [laughs] That's funny.<eos> That's... That's straight funny.<eos> You don't know how many times I wished I was you... stable home, good grades.
No!<eos> Clarke, what do we do?<eos> The sky is... falling.<eos> The sky is falling.<eos> What is wrong with you?
No.<eos> Indra. Indr...<eos> What happened?<eos> Skairipa...<eos> They'll be back for you. You should run.
Your Highness, we would not advise--<eos> That worked for Jane?<eos> - Sold.<eos> - Great.<eos> I'll come with you.
Shit what?<eos> Just--dead ended again.<eos> How's Mayakovsky?<eos> Oh, still a jerk-off, you know.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Let's go.<eos> Before you ask, no.<eos> No luck with the adoption records.<eos> No luck with the hospital. And no luck with the nurse.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Look, I got what I wanted.<eos> The rest was all a favor to you.<eos> So banish me forever.<eos> Send me home.<eos> You know, in a sick way, I sort of admire you.
You're alive.<eos> Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> I do.<eos> But it's more fun with you.
3 o'clock bus is always late.<eos> The 4 o'clock never comes at all.<eos> Whitby sends her regards.<eos> I thought you had.<eos> Another one with you.
- Mmm. All right.<eos> I'm setting this for 6:00 a.m. Saturday.<eos> - I'll let you know ASAP.<eos> - Noon will be fine.<eos> Meantime, you should find someone to keep an eye on you.
Let's do it.<eos> Will you be able to cope with being very rich?<eos> Yes.<eos> The money can be tiresome.<eos> If I'm with you, I'll be happy.
Tara, I think you need to --<eos> No.<eos> Just stop it, please.<eos> Just listen to me, okay?<eos> Tara, what has happened to you?
Please, carry on.<eos> Meg?<eos> I hear Eric's on the case, as it were.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you got your client with you?
Anyway, I-I figured if you were gonna be using foul means, she's best not knowing.<eos> -You have a good memory.<eos> -Almost photogenic.<eos> Uh, this is Corrine's mobile number, home address, e-mail address, and car reg.<eos> Can I leave it with you?
-Are you looking for a flat?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I have one.<eos> I know.<eos> I live there with you.
I have to go.<eos> Ray has been arrested.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.
Lead your men onto the field but do not risk your own life.<eos> Do not fight in person.<eos> If I died, you would be rid of me.<eos> Your mother safe, your cousin free to take the throne.<eos> How can I prove to you that I am with you, except to ask you not to die?
You know she won't give up, don't you?<eos> - My mother.<eos> We are still here.<eos> We have a guest.<eos> He arrived just before you did.
And if I have to hear about his years in exile one more time I think that I will choke him with the pheasant legs he has such a taste for.<eos> However will I keep it up for eight weeks on Royal Progress?<eos> Don't be downcast.<eos> We shall make it work to our advantage.<eos> I just wish I was coming with you.
Why do you smile?<eos> Because you lend them greater power if you fear them.<eos> What?<eos> Three stray Stafford rebels?<eos> And all the Tudor guards with you and you fear three beleaguered men without an axe between them?
I'm supposed to be his prize.<eos> But you must seem to be obedient if we're not to set off warning bells.<eos> And you would like another round of playing Queen, no doubt, driving all the plots yourself.<eos> We must each do what we can, my Lizzie.<eos> The midwife will consult with you.
Yay!<eos> Granny Ceci!<eos> Will you play a game?<eos> Yes.<eos> I cannot stay here with you, Lizzie.
- Yes.<eos> In fact, there was a country-wide survey to pick a name, and they settled on "Australus." But not for the same reason as a sheep. No, this was entirely different.<eos> Seems the kangaroo has a great deal in common with the rat. Hence, "Australus."<eos> I mean, it's elegant, don't you think?<eos> And yet, even by any other name, there's still a slab of giant rat sitting on the plate right in front of you.
And the car, the 430... Maserati.<eos> Now you've established that, as a team, our twin turbo-charged Maseratis are faster than a 67-horsepower "Celery", let's get rid of the little Japanese car and find out which of our three cars is the fastest round the track.<eos> We'll be driving Maseratis on a race track in continental Europe.<eos> Sounds good, doesn't it?<eos> What's the matter with you?
My hands are on the wheel, I'm safe.<eos> He holds it next to my ear so it's hands-free.<eos> Who's Bell-end?<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't want to talk to you.
Nope.<eos> Isn't that one of tabor's bathrobes?<eos> Is that our entire week's food supply?<eos> Guys, what's with the third degree?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Let's go.<eos> Tell you what... No.<eos> No.<eos> How many times do I have to say this?<eos> I am not sparring with you!
I guess from who I used to be, ways of thinking that generate assumptions about people and... well, androids.<eos> - This sounds like an apology.<eos> - That's because it is.<eos> What for?<eos> The way I treated you when we first came out of stasis, for how I treated your friend, Victor.
It's more like they ran into me, actually. Repeatedly. With their fists and feet.<eos> Where are we?<eos> What were you doing on that station?<eos> I was trying to stop a bombing.<eos> Kal, was he with you?
You can't seriously blame yourself for what happened to me.<eos> On that very first day when we came out of stasis, I took command.<eos> And the crew let me because they had faith in me. They trusted me to look after them.<eos> And you did.<eos> Not well enough... for One or for you.
Ryo and his soldiers are clones.<eos> They got on board with the help of The Android, but it's not really her.<eos> She's been hacked.<eos> Five, you need to wake up.<eos> They're coming for you.
So... he's not dead?<eos> No, his mind's still intact, but it's permanently cut off from his body.<eos> Basically, he's a prisoner inside his own head.<eos> That seems almost cruel.<eos> After what he did to you?
Adrian?<eos> Ambrosia... ah! Thank god you're okay.<eos> Wh-what's going on?<eos> Where's tabor?<eos> [Adrian] I dunno, I thought maybe he was with you.
Mira can do all those things and more.<eos> The first of her kind.<eos> She will join Section 9 as soon as she's operational.<eos> Please don't do that.<eos> You're reducing a complex human to a machine.
Nothing I can't know, nothing I can't be.<eos> I want you to listen to something.<eos> It's my 4 year old daughter.<eos> In the time it took her to sing that lullaby she learned to speak fluent French.<eos> Do you know that song...?
Someone's watching him.<eos> Dr. Osmond, what is it you want from us?<eos> I think it's more about what Hanka Robotics can do for you.<eos> 73% of this world has woken up to the age of cyber enhancement.<eos> Do you really wanna be left behind?
73% of this world has woken up to the age of cyber enhancement.<eos> Do you really wanna be left behind?<eos> My people embrace cyber enhancement, as do I.<eos> There's no one who really understands the risk to individuality, identity, messing with the human soul.<eos> Gentlemen, excuse me, I think you have the wrong...
A message was left at each of the crime scenes by someone identifying himself... as Kuze.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Togusa.<eos> You and Ladriya go speak to Mr. Cutter, the CEO of Hanka.
- No big deal.<eos> - What are they?<eos> Sensory echoes from your mind, shadows.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> How do you know what's a glitch and what's me?
Authorized personnel only.<eos> Please disable communication enhancement.<eos> I'm busy. Dr. Dahlin!<eos> Are you finished yet?<eos> If you hadn't riddled the Geisha with bullets, this would be much easier.
They don't.<eos> You've been inside the same shell as he has.<eos> That could have very serious consequences.<eos> You were not authorized to deep dive the geisha.<eos> You're disappointed.
No, I'm worried.<eos> You're not invulnerable.<eos> I can repair your body, but I can't protect your mind.<eos> Why not?<eos> You can see all my thoughts so... You should be able to secure them.
Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?<eos> Is section 9 missing some critical operational resource?<eos> We have everything that we require.<eos> Major is our most sophisticated weapon only if she's intact.<eos> And Dr. Ouelet informed me that you let her dive a corrupted geisha.
Is section 9 missing some critical operational resource?<eos> We have everything that we require.<eos> Major is our most sophisticated weapon only if she's intact.<eos> And Dr. Ouelet informed me that you let her dive a corrupted geisha.<eos> You realize the supreme importance that Hanka represents to this government.
Major is the future of my company.<eos> If you compromise your systems again... I will burn this section.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Mr. Cutter.<eos> Be careful who you the threaten.
- I don't know anything.<eos> Enough, enough!<eos> We need him alive.<eos> Please. I have been through this.<eos> You have the wrong guy.
Please. I have been through this.<eos> You have the wrong guy.<eos> So tell us who we do have.<eos> My name is Lee Cunningham.<eos> - Where'd you get the weapons? - I don't know.
- Is this her? - Yeah.<eos> Isn't she a little angel?<eos> - This is your daughter? - Right.<eos> Do you have kids?<eos> Where do you live?
Is it a tall building?<eos> It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.<eos> You don't have a wife.<eos> You live alone, just you.
- What? No.<eos> - We went to your apartment. - There was nobody there.<eos> - No.<eos> You live there for 10 years by yourself.<eos> No. - You're just lying.
You live there for 10 years by yourself.<eos> No. - You're just lying.<eos> - I'm not lying.<eos> I didn't kill anyone!<eos> - Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Why do you keep doing this to me?<eos> - Holocube disconnect.<eos> Please!<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Why do you keep saying this to me?
How many?<eos> Dozens.<eos> How many?<eos> 98 unsuccessful attempts, before you.<eos> You killed 98 innocent people?
You were so beautiful.<eos> Nothing I have is real.<eos> I found him.<eos> I told you to be careful.<eos> You knew who he was the whole time.
Nothing I have is real.<eos> I found him.<eos> I told you to be careful.<eos> You knew who he was the whole time.<eos> You built him.
You built him.<eos> He had a.. Violent unstable mind.<eos> His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!<eos> - I tried to save him! - No.<eos> You left him to die.
Hanka security to Headquarters.<eos> We have the Major.<eos> Why is she sedated?<eos> She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.
We have the Major.<eos> Why is she sedated?<eos> She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.<eos> You should have called the first time she came to see you.
Why is she sedated?<eos> She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.<eos> You should have called the first time she came to see you.<eos> Instead, you gave her information.
2571 is not a failure.<eos> I will delete all the data and reprogram her.<eos> - She won't remember him at all.<eos> - No, no, no...<eos> You download all the data on the terrorist and then I order you to terminate.
- No, no, no...<eos> You download all the data on the terrorist and then I order you to terminate.<eos> - We'll build one that's better.<eos> - I'll delete everything.<eos> - You deleted before.
But her ghost survived!<eos> Her ghost is what failed us.<eos> We cannot control her.<eos> She's no longer a viable asset.<eos> You should be the one to do it.
Her ghost is what failed us.<eos> We cannot control her.<eos> She's no longer a viable asset.<eos> You should be the one to do it.<eos> What are you doing to me?
You should be the one to do it.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I'll run the standard synaptic. Upload your data on the raid.<eos> Find out exactly what Kuze told you.<eos> You know what he told me.
I'll run the standard synaptic. Upload your data on the raid.<eos> Find out exactly what Kuze told you.<eos> You know what he told me.<eos> The truth.<eos> You're deleting everything, aren't you? No.
I do not consent.<eos> I do not consent.<eos> We never needed your consent;<eos> Yours or anyone's.<eos> You're killing me, aren't you?
Hanka security will hunt her from here.<eos> - What are the orders?<eos> - To terminate on sight.<eos> You want to kill her?<eos> You built her!
You kill her, you kill us.<eos> I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?<eos> Oh, the poor pumpkin!<eos> Oh, you surprised me.
On the street, in my dreams.<eos> As if she's still here.<eos> She was... fearless.<eos> And wild.<eos> You remind me of her.
You remind me of her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> How do I remind you of her?<eos> The way you look at me.<eos> Who are you?
I'm not ready to leave.<eos> I belong here.<eos> I'll always be there with you, in your ghost.<eos> Target is in view.<eos> What are you waiting for?
Get down! Don't move, asshole!<eos> On your knees now, you son of a bitch! Okay, okay.<eos> I want to comply.<eos> I really wanna comply.<eos> But you're confusing me.
Wow.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?<eos> Augustus always had such, well, not exactly nice things to say about you.<eos> When did you realize it was all fake?
You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?<eos> Augustus always had such, well, not exactly nice things to say about you.<eos> When did you realize it was all fake?<eos> You mean the clown show?
Go figure.<eos> The bullets could've been real.<eos> Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but-- I don't like to be tested.<eos> Gibbons never believed you were dead!
I bet they had a blast.<eos> We ran facial IDs on every database in the world. Nothing.<eos> Not even a match on a speeding ticket.<eos> They're ghosts, in a day and age where that kind of thing is almost impossible.<eos> Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.
We ran facial IDs on every database in the world. Nothing.<eos> Not even a match on a speeding ticket.<eos> They're ghosts, in a day and age where that kind of thing is almost impossible.<eos> Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.<eos> What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?
The last time I was patriotic, I got three strikes.<eos> And there was only one man who believed in the underdog.<eos> Patriotism is dead.<eos> There's only rebels and tyrants now.<eos> So, which are you?
There's only rebels and tyrants now.<eos> So, which are you?<eos> I'm Triple-X.<eos> Well, welcome back, Triple-X.<eos> Uh, where are you going?
That's all I'm saying.<eos> Your ghosts are hanging out in the Philippines.<eos> Figures they'd go to the Pacific.<eos> Some jungle rave that's off the grid.<eos> How the hell did you find it so quickly?
You can check your coat.<eos> I promise you, no one would dare steal it.<eos> I can't guarantee it won't walk off on its own.<eos> Wheels up in 10, boys!<eos> Which means you're already seven minutes behind.
I wonder, how many of you have ever pulled a freestyle triple back-flip on a BMX bike before?<eos> All of you?<eos> No.<eos> We don't play on bikes.<eos> Oh, you don't play on bikes.
Oh, you don't play on bikes.<eos> Any of you ever carve an R4 on a snowboard while an avalanche is on your booty?<eos> We're soldiers, hotshot.<eos> Not slackers.<eos> Okay, but you all have HALO jumped over Eastern Europe using a standard-issue armor deployment parachute system.
Okay, but you all have HALO jumped over Eastern Europe using a standard-issue armor deployment parachute system.<eos> Am I right?<eos> No.<eos> We're not all jacked up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.<eos> Where'd you find this guy?
No.<eos> We're not all jacked up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.<eos> Where'd you find this guy?<eos> Well, there's a first time for everything.<eos> What did you just do?
Well, there's a first time for everything.<eos> What did you just do?<eos> I can't believe this shit.<eos> I'm not gonna have clowns watch my back.<eos> I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?
Now, this is a team I can work with.<eos> I'll make this easy for you.<eos> These four assholes, very bad guys.<eos> Pandora's Box, very bad thing.<eos> We'll land in Manila and you will requisition your own transportation to the island.
You think a dog knows how to work a Frisbee?<eos> Master says, "Fetch," and the bitch listens.<eos> You would look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.<eos> Oh, sweetheart, this is not a game.<eos> You are all my soldiers now.
Oh, hell, no.<eos> I dropped your soldiers over Eastern Europe.<eos> So, why did you leave Lassie behind?<eos> This is my operation!<eos> You will listen to me.
Of course not.<eos> We were a new Triple-X team Gibbons created.<eos> We discovered a high-level intelligence officer was trying to manipulate satellites.<eos> And even before we could unmask him, Gibbons was killed.<eos> So, you knew they were Triple-X all along.
We were a new Triple-X team Gibbons created.<eos> We discovered a high-level intelligence officer was trying to manipulate satellites.<eos> And even before we could unmask him, Gibbons was killed.<eos> So, you knew they were Triple-X all along.<eos> I needed you to retain a sense of objectivity.
Let me guess.<eos> Everyone's jumping at the chance to dismantle their spy programs.<eos> No.<eos> The world's too stupid to realize that Moscow wasn't a bluff.<eos> Okay, Triple-X, you will base out of an NSA safe house.
Uh, looks like East 404 Congress Street.<eos> He's on the top floor.<eos> I'm showing activity in Pandora's Box.<eos> I can jam the signal, but only for a few minutes, so hurry.<eos> You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.
To be the hero we needed.<eos> You take the box to the NSA, and we're right back to where we started.<eos> Wow.<eos> This is touching.<eos> Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.
Just in time.<eos> Watch out, Cage.<eos> Keep this up, people might mistake you for one of the good guys.<eos> Hey, suit.<eos> You got what you wanted.
Just be where the bullets aren't.<eos> Sadly, the terrorist activated Pandora's Box one last time before we could stop him.<eos> You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.<eos> If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone, then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.<eos> You're just another tyrant.
Thank you so much for coming.<eos> I don't think we've ever been at a reception table with a nanny before.<eos> Have we, Jerry?<eos> Only very good or very bad nannies are remembered so many years later.<eos> Which one are you?
It was on the RSVP. You put it there yourself.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> And how are you so sure you're not with the singles?<eos> If there are couples at your table, they could be what's called "swingers."<eos> How well do you know the bride and groom, Mr. Kepp?
My name is Walter.<eos> I can tell by your accent you must be a relation to the bride's father.<eos> Close relation?<eos> Yes.<eos> So what do you do, Walter?
Hollywood marriages bust up all the time because of the nanny.<eos> And you know what, Renzo? Even if she is a little older, so what?<eos> There's something to be said for know-how, experience and someone who's seen a lot of things.<eos> You don't want somebody perfect for your first dance. It's just too intimidating.<eos> You okay?
There's something to be said for know-how, experience and someone who's seen a lot of things.<eos> You don't want somebody perfect for your first dance. It's just too intimidating.<eos> You okay?<eos> No. Not okay.<eos> I could just see you staring at somebody for a minute.
Just say something smug and walk away.<eos> No, it wasn't like that.<eos> I just saw you there, and I...<eos> Yeah, well, it was like that.<eos> Also, in order for you to know that I'd been staring at someone for a real, true minute, you had to be staring at me for a real, true minute.
No.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not that you asked, but this is where I'm sitting so if you end up in the high teens, you know where to find me.
Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.<eos> What's your favorite book, Walter?<eos> Probably that one.<eos> Walter, where do you live?
Eloise, what's your connection to the bride and groom?<eos> Right, yeah, that's the sort of question you ask back here.<eos> It's not gonna be what you want to hear.<eos> It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right?
Right, yeah, that's the sort of question you ask back here.<eos> It's not gonna be what you want to hear.<eos> It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right?<eos> You're the nanny. Francie's nanny.
It's not gonna be what you want to hear.<eos> It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right?<eos> You're the nanny. Francie's nanny.<eos> How do you know that?
It won't be what she wants to hear.<eos> You're Jo Flanagan, right?<eos> You're the nanny. Francie's nanny.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> And you know Henry Grotsky from the diner scene, you're those people...
And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.<eos> And you're Grotsky's friend's kid?<eos> You requested the singles' table. That was never gonna happen.<eos> How do you know us?
You requested the singles' table. That was never gonna happen.<eos> How do you know us?<eos> So, Francie, today's bride, is my oldest friend.<eos> Oh... Thank you!<eos> There's been a long discussion about what kind of table this is and you've just resolved it!
Oh... Thank you!<eos> There's been a long discussion about what kind of table this is and you've just resolved it!<eos> She is the best friend of the bride.<eos> Well, oldest.<eos> How close to the toilet do you feel now, Mr. Kepp?
Well, oldest.<eos> How close to the toilet do you feel now, Mr. Kepp?<eos> The same. The distance is the same.<eos> You know what? It's the same wedding.<eos> It's the same celebration no matter what table you're at.
It's no mystery, it's not a big deal.<eos> I got dumped by Francie's brother, Teddy Millner, the best man.<eos> That tall drink of shit over there at table one you can barely see.<eos> God, look at him.<eos> That guy is exactly who you think he'd be.
I feel nothing, actually.<eos> I feel liberated.<eos> I feel free.<eos> God.<eos> You have no idea what that feels like.
Someday.<eos> I mean, I am free. I do, I mean,<eos> I'm a free man, I do know how it feels.<eos> Right. Great.<eos> Well, then, you know.
Shit.<eos> What a shame.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Oh, thank you. So much.<eos> How long have you worked here?
See?<eos> He has a pathological aversion to answering a question directly.<eos> He always answers with another question.<eos> Why did you make Facebook friends with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?<eos> You answered with a question.
Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Renzo, pick up...<eos> Not now, big fight.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You look lost.
Okay, I think this conversation is over, right?<eos> Because it started with you asking for a dance and then the answer to that was no.<eos> First, can I ask if she'd like to hear about my extracurriculars?<eos> Okay. I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Rezno, and say that she has evaluated the whole package, including the after-school specials and she's not really ready to dance with that, okay?<eos> So you could just stand awkwardly in front of another table.
I'm Donny Haczyk.<eos> Good to see you again, Donny.<eos> People do weird things at weddings.<eos> What was I ever thinking?<eos> It's so weird, one day you can be 100%, the next...
Because there's a plate of pigs in a blanket about to come through that door.<eos> Just grab it.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How did you...
She's temperamental.<eos> She hasn't had a drink and now she's puked up mini hotdogs.<eos> Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?<eos> What? Huh?<eos> You children are such a disappointment.
You children are such a disappointment.<eos> Go away, please.<eos> You're right.<eos> Teddy Millner was always rotten.<eos> You don't know me.
I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.<eos> And not you.<eos> You two can drop by and choose something from the mini fridge.
Honestly, it still sounds better than junior prom, honey.<eos> Junior prom is a horror show.<eos> Well, if the thinking was for me to see people at their most happy, I would have to say that seems to be a huge miscalculation.<eos> Did you just break another chair?<eos> What kind of nanny are you?
The day is ours.<eos> Hello.<eos> My name is Walter and I'm a successful pothead.<eos> I'm smoking the reefer.<eos> Are you a potter?
Waitin' for your ship to come in<eos> Folks like me on the job from nine to five<eos> Concierge, please.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, can you tell me when the next ferry arrives?
There's a dog in your bathtub.<eos> See?<eos> That's what I mean about hotel bathtubs.<eos> You know, marriage is till death do us part.<eos> What does that mean? Does that mean you're gonna get to heaven and then you'll be single, and then do whatever you want at that point?
You know, marriage is till death do us part.<eos> What does that mean? Does that mean you're gonna get to heaven and then you'll be single, and then do whatever you want at that point?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Nobody knows what happens after you die.<eos> You are Romeo and Juliet and we all wish you the same happy ending.
That was your idea.<eos> What?<eos> I wanted to be a high school guidance counselor but instead I went to prison.<eos> You made the right decision.<eos> How did you steal all that money?
Yeah, well, uh...<eos> Roger got me a job in his office when he worked for the Ford Motor Company.<eos> I'm quite good with numbers, so I worked out a way to steal $125,000.<eos> So I did.<eos> What did you do with it?
So I did.<eos> What did you do with it?<eos> Oh, it wasn't for myself.<eos> My friend Eric, who's an absolute sweetheart, a lovely bloke, his wife was very sick and needed an operation.<eos> Well, then you saved a life.
On account of the fact she didn't exist.<eos> I don't think he'd ever been married.<eos> What?<eos> He made it up just for the money.<eos> You just called him a sweetheart!
Yeah.<eos> I mean, I know it's too early to know, but... I know.<eos> Well, I have a request.<eos> Don't call her Jo.<eos> I met you today and you think I'm gonna name my daughter after you?
No way.<eos> I know you.<eos> Bina, an affair?<eos> Bina!<eos> Walter, would you come with me, please?
Goodbye.<eos> I should just let you know that I've got a little bit of eczema behind my knees.<eos> And, um, oh, last year I had a cold sore, but that was because Jalapeno was using my washcloth.<eos> And not just on his face.<eos> But, yeah, otherwise, I'm all fine so just let me know when you want to start the intercourse.
I'm due around the same time you are.<eos> So?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said that I should be in the Woodside ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres because they're understaffed, apparently.<eos> Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?
What did he say?<eos> He said that I should be in the Woodside ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres because they're understaffed, apparently.<eos> Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Denny, who's that man there, he said that there's no one registered under the name you asked about.

Sorry.<eos> God, that's so weird.<eos> Walter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where are you going?
Where are you going?<eos> I gotta go and help with the hors d'oeuvres in the Woodside ballroom.<eos> Why?<eos> Understaffed.<eos> So, you're not the friendliest guy in the world.
Why?<eos> Understaffed.<eos> So, you're not the friendliest guy in the world.<eos> I am not.<eos> How did you manage to seduce Bina?
I was a junior counselor.<eos> She was a senior counselor.<eos> Honestly, Renzo, it's no big secret.<eos> Camp does most of the seducing.<eos> Less often than you think.
What if you came here for a different reason today?<eos> What if you went away with someone better?<eos> What if I know how to find your wedding crasher?<eos> Go with your gut. Go with your gut. Go with your gut.<eos> Megan-Ann, Mr. Pfaffler, you probably don't remember me.
Yeah, baby<eos> Nice bit of cake?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo, everybody...<eos> Sorry it's taken us so crazy long to get here.<eos> We're so glad you could all make it.
Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.
Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.<eos> I don't know why I should be embarrassed about this, but I lost it almost immediately after you gave it to me.
My God, I am so sorry.<eos> Frankie, stop.<eos> Don't you know he's a friend?<eos> What a terrible, terrible way to meet.<eos> - You're Lieutenant Buchannon, right?
Victoria Leeds, the new owner of the Huntley Club.<eos> Of course. I know exactly who you are.<eos> - Well, welcome to Emerald Bay.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> I heard you were a head-turner.
- Well, welcome to Emerald Bay.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> I heard you were a head-turner.<eos> What an understatement that is.<eos> And I heard you were a charmer.
- don't give a fuck.<eos> - Don't give a fuck.<eos> Yeah. Okay, that ocean out there has riptides that'll tear your little mangina in two.<eos> My mangina?<eos> So you are being serious.
Oh, my God!<eos> Looks like he just vomited in the pool.<eos> After a night of partying in Rio led to a streak of bad luck in the pool,<eos> Brody was dubbed the "Vomit Comet."<eos> How do you feel about losing a medal for your teammates?
There's no "I" in "team."<eos> But there is a "me."<eos> Are you dyslexic?<eos> I'm Caucasian.<eos> This is the guy you think is a good PR opportunity for us?
- Good afternoon. - So, how is our progress?<eos> Most of the council has signed off on your terms.<eos> Good. And the rest are almost there.<eos> "Almost"?<eos> Councilman, you seem like the kind of man who knows how to seize an opportunity.
You haven't heard about this?<eos> Yeah, I heard.<eos> Everybody's heard.<eos> All right. Welcome, everybody.<eos> You know, Baywatch proudly accepts only one new recruit every year.
We follow rules because if we don't, people die.<eos> You work in an office and you doze off at your desk one day, no big deal.<eos> You slack off here... Say it with me...<eos> People die.<eos> So here's the thing, if you've come to Baywatch on your little motorcycle, thinking you're cool, trying to work on your killer tan... Well, you need to find another beach to go to.

Well, you need to find another beach to go to.<eos> But if you've come to sacrifice for something much bigger than yourself, this is the beach for you.
- Let's go!<eos> - Come on, let's go!<eos> - Listen to what she's saying.<eos> Keep it going! Keep it going!<eos> You are guppies!
- Come on, let's go!<eos> - Listen to what she's saying.<eos> Keep it going! Keep it going!<eos> You are guppies!<eos> One day you will be sharks!
Just some property owners won't give approval.<eos> But I'm working on it.<eos> Yeah, well, you just ran out of time.<eos> Leon, would you show Mr. Rodriguez what we do to people who don't deliver?<eos> I know you're dealing flakka, which is gonna drive down real estate prices in the bay, right? Right?
Yeah, well, you just ran out of time.<eos> Leon, would you show Mr. Rodriguez what we do to people who don't deliver?<eos> I know you're dealing flakka, which is gonna drive down real estate prices in the bay, right? Right?<eos> So if anything happens to me, I will expose you.<eos> And then you'll never get your approvals.
And then you'll never get your approvals.<eos> Such accusations.<eos> I'm not a Bond villain.<eos> Well, yet.<eos> You're in politics.
Such accusations.<eos> I'm not a Bond villain.<eos> Well, yet.<eos> You're in politics.<eos> You know that no one can claw their way to the top without getting a little dirt under their fingernails.
- Two. One.<eos> Go! - Shit, man.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Are you the fire water man?
Okay, guapo.<eos> If you want me, you can have me.<eos> But rápido because the boat is on fire.<eos> - Some other time. - No...<eos> Are you all right? Can you hear me?
Help!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Take my hand.<eos> Trust me.<eos> - Are you hurt? - No.
Hang on.<eos> - What?<eos> C.J.!<eos> Portside!<eos> Miss, are you okay?
- What?<eos> - We would have died?<eos> - Burned to a crisp.<eos> - I'm not ready to die!<eos> I know. It's okay, you're not.
Lieutenant.<eos> Beat cop.<eos> So keep us informed of the investigation and we're gonna do the same.<eos> All right. Hey, how do I keep in touch?<eos> Seashell phone, or do I just blow into the conch and you appear?
This dude is not rich at all.<eos> All his money is tied up in real estate in the bay.<eos> Well, I guess you'll have to help me persuade him some other way.<eos> Every man has a price.<eos> Speaking of which, I know you've been using my special set of skills for your own nefarious purposes, but additional compensation would go a long way in motivating me to keep my mouth shut.
- Brody?<eos> - What?<eos> - You're our lookout.<eos> - Lookout?<eos> Guys, if you want to find drugs at a party, I can walk in there and find drugs.
Summer.<eos> Hey, am I the only one that thinks this is clearly a job for the police?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.
- Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> I wanted to meet the new neighbor everyone is talking about.<eos> So I presume you know why I had to invite you.
- All right.<eos> Sounds good. - All right, Steph.<eos> So where should I, like, look out from?<eos> Victoria.<eos> You killed Rodriguez in front of witnesses.
Sounds good. - All right, Steph.<eos> So where should I, like, look out from?<eos> Victoria.<eos> You killed Rodriguez in front of witnesses.<eos> What the fuck were you thinking?
Let's check it out.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Mitch. I just got a little hunch, okay?<eos> Shit.<eos> You two, what are you doing back here?
- Mitch, hold up.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That's a very nice scooter.<eos> Have you ever seen the Olympics?
- You're right.<eos> It's bath time, shithead.<eos> All right, Ellerbee, what did we learn from the perps after the interrogation?<eos> The only perps here are you three.<eos> Okay, you turned the canals into the goddamned X Games.
Police do pursuits!<eos> When you do it, it's just some guys chasing some other guys.<eos> - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> Hey, what are you saying? You're just gonna let those guys walk?
You don't get to say that.<eos> You're just tan.<eos> - Right on.<eos> - Come on, brother.<eos> Look, even if you were police, which you're not, and even if this was your jurisdiction, which it isn't, and even if you had probable cause to pursue, which you definitely don't, what you did would still be totally illegal.
The Councilman's boating accident was no accident at all.<eos> He had no smoke in his lungs, his neck was broken in multiple places.<eos> Which means he was probably dead before that boat even caught on fire.<eos> And our investigation has found that all of this shady shit leads right back to the Huntley.<eos> You don't do investigations.

What, you think that I wanted this?<eos> - It kinda looks like you did. - What?<eos> If anyone should get the job it should be Stephanie.<eos> No shit. I couldn't agree more.<eos> What would you have done?
Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...<eos> - Now that...<eos> - Mitch is gone.<eos> He's gone, so all we care about now is protecting the bay.<eos> And we know you feel the same.
And we know you feel the same.<eos> I do.<eos> I always knew I liked you two.<eos> - Enjoy the party.<eos> - You look amazing, by the way.
- Well, it washed up on shore.<eos> You only threw it eight feet, dude.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome. You're very welcome.<eos> Guys, after finding the drugs, helping save Chen and helping me blow up the bad girl with a Roman candle, it's a pleasure to say you are officially no longer trainees.
Enter La Rocciosa...<eos> And the boy who wouldn't speak.<eos> My first language.<eos> I have these from previous employers.<eos> Did you live with each family?
My son has not spoken since.<eos> Seven months... And 16 days.<eos> Alessio will see you to your room.<eos> I would like to introduce myself to your son.<eos> You haven't told me his name.
That's my son, signorina, not me. Hmm.<eos> Jakob doesn't want you here.<eos> He hasn't shown it yet, but he will.<eos> There is such power in his silence.<eos> You will feel it.
Jakob doesn't want you here.<eos> He hasn't shown it yet, but he will.<eos> There is such power in his silence.<eos> You will feel it.<eos> You speak very harshly to him.
The nurse, of course.<eos> Come closer.<eos> Come.<eos> Let Lilia see you.<eos> You've come to make the boy talk.
Oh, welcome.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Welcome to La Rocciosa, my child.<eos> Grazie.<eos> You're very kind.
No, I, uh, never could.<eos> This is your wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> What was her name?<eos> You spent time with Jakob this morning.
No.<eos> No, signore, I do not.<eos> Nor do I.<eos> Sometimes I wish I did.<eos> Have you considered taking him away from this place?
Sometimes I wish I did.<eos> Have you considered taking him away from this place?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> It was impossible.<eos> It was as you saw last night.
Signore, I'm no longer sure I can care for your son.<eos> Why?<eos> I have been misled about what is required.<eos> I must consider whether I am properly qualified.<eos> You're just like the others.
He needs help.<eos> And he's breaking his father's heart.<eos> The boy is all that matters.<eos> He is the future.<eos> Look at yourself, how beautiful you are.
The boy will speak when the time is right.<eos> He's waiting.<eos> But he's waited long enough.<eos> Surely that is clear to anyone.<eos> When he speaks, where will you go?
Put that one away.<eos> Signore.<eos> Please.<eos> I have something to ask.<eos> You may very likely refuse.
You may very likely refuse.<eos> What is it?<eos> I saw this afternoon something I had previously failed to notice, certain resemblances between you... You and my wife.<eos> I...<eos> I... I think you know what it is I ask.
I...<eos> I... I think you know what it is I ask.<eos> If I have offended you, I apologize and ask that we forget the matter entirely.<eos> Your work here will be unaffected.<eos> Look at yourself, how beautiful you are.
I'm right here.<eos> Jakob.<eos> I'm going to look after you.<eos> I promise.<eos> You're hurting him now.
You're hurting him now.<eos> Let me care for him.<eos> Let me care for them both.<eos> Is it her? Or is it me?<eos> You wanted to see me?
It's for me to protect him, and now I have made things worse.<eos> She wants me here to take care of Jakob and...<eos> And to take care of you.<eos> The voice is real.<eos> You're mad.
You said it yourself.<eos> "Serious condition."<eos> I should have paid closer attention.<eos> No!<eos> Instead of helping Jakob, you've made yourself unwell.
Oh, no.<eos> No. No, no.<eos> Jakob.<eos> This is how it must be.<eos> What are you doing?
I'm so afraid.<eos> Lilia, where is she?<eos> Who?<eos> Lilia.<eos> What do you mean?
Maybe for you, there's 1,000 or 3,000... Or ten.<eos> So much time, you can bathe in it.<eos> So much time, you can waste it.<eos> But for some of us, there's only today.<eos> And what you do today matters...
And maybe into infinity.<eos> But I didn't know any of that until right before I fell.<eos> The thing is, they don't get to know.<eos> You don't wake up with a bad feeling in your stomach or see shadows move.<eos> If you're like me, you wake up 24 minutes and 47 seconds before your best friend is supposed to be picking you up.

Yeah.<eos> Tonight everything changes.<eos> Mwah. That face.<eos> Baes!<eos> What are you doing?
Huh?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She just called us bitches.<eos> What did she do?<eos> So you attack her?
She just called us bitches.<eos> What did she do?<eos> So you attack her?<eos> This is not my fault.<eos> You throw beer all over her?
No, you're not.<eos> My Patience, however, is at its breaking point.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Please.<eos> If you insist.
What?<eos> Yeah, let's do it.<eos> Come on!<eos> Why do you guys hate me so much?<eos> I know you know what's written in this bathroom somewhere.
Maybe for you, there's 1,000...<eos> Or 3,000.<eos> Or ten.<eos> But for some of us, there's only today.<eos> And what you do today matters...
Remember when we were kids?<eos> Life was all there in front of us, waiting to happen.<eos> You could be an astronaut or the President, whatever the hell you wanted.<eos> Every day was an adventure, and things were only going to get better.<eos> Then the years pass and you start to see... that it's all a big fairy tale.
It's actually a pretty interesting town.<eos> Oh, okay, that flies in the face of everything I've ever heard... about St. Louis in particular and Missouri at large!<eos> What the hell do you know about it?<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You don't want to have to be the ones to cart poor old...
It looked like he did it on purpose.<eos> It's fine, okay?<eos> It's fine. Thank you.<eos> But excuse me!<eos> Before you go, um...
Thank you.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> Just a second.<eos> Watch the door.<eos> Quick question: Can you tell me where a guy could find some pussy in this town?
Excuse me, sir?<eos> Just a second.<eos> Watch the door.<eos> Quick question: Can you tell me where a guy could find some pussy in this town?<eos> Oh, you're looking for a strip club, huh?
Stay the fuck away from us.<eos> We don't want nothing to do with that crazy bitch.<eos> Don't talk to him.<eos> Look.<eos> It's torture for me to see you guys, too... especially hatchet-face over here... but I need to know if you've seen Pippi.
Pippi?<eos> They grow up so fast.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> What a day!<eos> Can you imagine... how much bird feces is in this park?
Super well-educated.<eos> Yeah, they got a big house.<eos> Like... way bigger than this place.<eos> That's great.<eos> And how did Claire's parents feel about you and Wilson making contact like that?
How could this be kidnapping?<eos> Well, the parents are pretty P.O'-ed.<eos> It's hard to blame them.<eos> She is just 17.<eos> Whose side are you on?
No, I'm not...<eos> I like it.<eos> It's like an acknowledgement to a whole other generation...<eos> Hi.<eos> It doesn't matter if you're out of here 20 years, living on an island.
I like it.<eos> It's like an acknowledgement to a whole other generation...<eos> Hi.<eos> It doesn't matter if you're out of here 20 years, living on an island.<eos> You will never be truly free until you've been washed in the blood of the Lamb.
It doesn't matter if you're out of here 20 years, living on an island.<eos> You will never be truly free until you've been washed in the blood of the Lamb.<eos> A believer stuck 10 years in the shoe... is freer than any man who disdains the Word.<eos> That is beautiful, beautiful stuff.<eos> Have you always been a... God-fearing man, Pastor?
I'm sorry.<eos> She has to leave.<eos> Wilson, she needs to leave.<eos> Wilson!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?
Yeah, well, we don't want you or your book.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> Go home.<eos> I gave you a chance to raise this wonderful girl.<eos> If you love her, then... you love a little piece of me, too.
Yeah, I have an intruder on my property.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks for taking care of my baby.<eos> You... did an amazing job.
Light!<eos> Where would we be without Merlin and the Mages who helped him?<eos> Where are they now?<eos> Why do they not show themselves?<eos> You know where they are, Lord Mercia.
Look after him.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Are the men ready?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> Are you sure about this, my Lord?
It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.<eos> Have I not sacrificed enough?<eos> And have you not felt your power increase?<eos> With every kingdom conquered, with every level added to your tower.<eos> When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.
A young boy.<eos> Your boy.<eos> Blue Boy.<eos> And he's a good boy.<eos> Oi! What are you lot doing?
Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.<eos> If we can catch you, they can catch you.<eos> If you can catch him, so can we.
You see, she's a friend of mine.<eos> So you're gonna have to sort her out.<eos> They'd been warned.<eos> They had to pay.<eos> How'd you get money from a Viking?
My king...<eos> Carefully.<eos> So you're Uther's son.<eos> Not only did you survive in the gutter, you blossomed out of manure.<eos> You've got the wrong man, sire.
You know what happens now.<eos> You're quickly becoming a legend.<eos> Someone here to see you.<eos> I think you need to see her.<eos> Do you know who I am?
You're quickly becoming a legend.<eos> Someone here to see you.<eos> I think you need to see her.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I know who you are, Mage.
Do you know who I am?<eos> I know who you are, Mage.<eos> I've seen you in my dreams.<eos> You've been sent by Merlin.<eos> Then you know why I am here.

I've seen you in my dreams.<eos> You've been sent by Merlin.<eos> Then you know why I am here.<eos> So, you will be his guide.<eos> And you will help me.
How unfortunate it was at the expense of my Viking guests.<eos> King Vortigern! King Vortigern! King Vortigern!<eos> Behold, your born king.<eos> Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.<eos> You wanted a prophecy.
They have a word for that, don't they?<eos> "Mage."<eos> I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.<eos> I thought you'd be taller.
I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.<eos> I thought you'd be taller.<eos> And have a beard.<eos> You do know I can see through this?
I told you, you were in safe hands.<eos> You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.<eos> You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.<eos> You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches.<eos> So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely, can you just get around to telling me exactly what it is you want?
You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches.<eos> So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely, can you just get around to telling me exactly what it is you want?<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> I want to get my arse out of here and see what's left of my life and the people in it.<eos> But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?
What is it that you want?<eos> I want to get my arse out of here and see what's left of my life and the people in it.<eos> But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?<eos> And why aren't we?<eos> You just lost two men.
I want to get my arse out of here and see what's left of my life and the people in it.<eos> But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?<eos> And why aren't we?<eos> You just lost two men.<eos> But you were prepared to lose five to save this pretty neck.
Why don't you leave him with me for a minute or two, boss?<eos> Put your ring back on, honey tits. You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.<eos> And if you like that sword so much, Your Lordship, you can keep it to peel your grapes.<eos> Now that would've hurt a lot more if I left the ring on.<eos> I see what you're doing.
Wet Stick, meet Percival.<eos> Rubio, meet Back Lack.<eos> Sir Bedivere, who runs this aristocratic family of cave dwellers, meet Blue, son of Back Lack.<eos> The infamous Goosefat Bill needs no introduction.<eos> So, you think you can take down Vortigern?
We can arrange a meeting with six of those families...<eos> Let me stop you there.<eos> If I may, allow me to run you through the proceedings as I think they will unfold.<eos> They'll start by telling us...<eos> If you're intending to galvanize the people of this country against the current king, there has to be a realistic strategy.
But doesn't it make the palace burn well?<eos> 10,000 boys.<eos> All under 12 years.<eos> Young enough to forget their families, and to have no other loyalty than to you.<eos> Plus, 5,000 more each year for as long as you grant us passage through your seas.
There are rumors, Great King.<eos> Even across the seas, we have heard the legend of the sword, of a king other than yourself.<eos> I would be doing my own king a disservice if I did not ask this question.<eos> Are the boys yours to give?<eos> Do you really consider your faith better served by a rumor?
Are the boys yours to give?<eos> Do you really consider your faith better served by a rumor?<eos> Or by the word of the conqueror of this island with an army of 100,000 souls behind his sword?<eos> I meant no disrespect, Great King.<eos> You asked to see me, Father?
I can't leave him!<eos> Have a look at this situation, would ya?<eos> The king of all England himself has made the effort to visit a commoner.<eos> A man from nowhere, and today, my last day.<eos> You look well, and I feel poor.
Come on, lads.<eos> Blue!<eos> Blue!<eos> - Blue!<eos> You took your time getting here.
It was my turn to cook tonight.<eos> I've been sent by His Majesty to deliver a message.<eos> Let's think...<eos> "Be at the castle before dark" "if you wanna see the girl and the boy" "alive."<eos> I would love to stay and chat, but you do understand the situation between me and my wife.
Let's get this done quickly, shall we?<eos> Put him on his knees.<eos> Put him on his knees!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> You know the price.
Father, what's happening?<eos> Leave.<eos> Why is there blood on your face?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Father, you're scaring me.
Nock!<eos> Light!<eos> Ready!<eos> Loose!<eos> While I understand there's been a change in the leadership of this nation, I am confident that you will still honor the agreement made by your predecessor and my king.
It would be unwise to displease my king.<eos> George, Wet Stick, Percy, on your knees.<eos> Sir Bedivere, if you would?<eos> I'm prepared to extend the deadline by a week.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry. You've made a mistake.
George, Wet Stick, Percy, on your knees.<eos> Sir Bedivere, if you would?<eos> I'm prepared to extend the deadline by a week.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry. You've made a mistake.<eos> You're no longer dealing with the man you previously met.
Sir Bedivere, if you would?<eos> I'm prepared to extend the deadline by a week.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry. You've made a mistake.<eos> You're no longer dealing with the man you previously met.<eos> You are addressing England and all the subjects under her king's protection.
Arise, Sir George.<eos> So you have a choice.<eos> You can now kneel to England...<eos> Arise, Sir Tristan.<eos> ...or I'll step off this throne, and you can deal with me as the man you previously met.
Just tell me a complete lie.<eos> You could... you could say anything you want to me.<eos> That's the fun about me.<eos> I lied to you.<eos> And, people, you are the future!

Do you trust me to stick your finger in here?<eos> He did everything.<eos> He exhausted every poison.<eos> He knew every form of love, suffering, madness.<eos> Learn all the rules when you're young, 'cause that makes Mom and Dad happy.
- I have a condition.<eos> - Yes'?<eos> Uh, I can't be left alone... for more than five minutes.<eos> Can I get you something else?<eos> I'd like to hear you sing.
The shame of it.<eos> Things changed.<eos> You became suspicious.<eos> Stupid girl.<eos> How long have you known?
Just let me know when I can come over and take him out or...<eos> - Anything.<eos> If you need me to feed him.<eos> - Tomorrow... if fine?<eos> - Where are you from?
Something passed overhead here.<eos> Cut the tops off the trees.<eos> Well, it had to be huge.<eos> Well, whatever it is, it's up there.<eos> You hear that?
Come on!<eos> Go!<eos> Up, up!<eos> Ledward, you gotta stay up!<eos> Oram, where are you?
A deadly virus.<eos> Payload accidentally deployed when we were landing.<eos> In the confusion, we lost control of the ship.<eos> Elizabeth died in the crash.<eos> You've seen the result of the pathogen.
All the animals, the meat, if you will.<eos> Either kill them outright or use them as incubators to spawn a hybrid form.<eos> Highly aggressive.<eos> Have we been infected?<eos> You'd know by now.
Ohy!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> This is my site.<eos> What do you think you are doing?
This is my site.<eos> What do you think you are doing?<eos> Evacuate your men.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Who the hell are you people?
I'd like to recommend him for a citation.<eos> Let me run another scenario of mine.<eos> Sir?<eos> One in which two assholes from long range reconnaissance that would be you run all over northern Iraq, just one step ahead of the enemy.<eos> Except, instead of hunting for the enemy you hunt for antiquities stealing whatever isn't nailed down and selling it on the black market.
Where is what?<eos> The letter.<eos> The map you stole from me.<eos> Map?<eos> I do not know what you are talking about.
Jenny, you can do this!<eos> You can do this!<eos> Give me your hand!<eos> Miss Halsey<eos> Miss Halsey, do you think you're up to it.
Pull her back!<eos> Delta team move!<eos> Bring the target down!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where are you taking me?
Stay.<eos> Make yourself comfortable.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Who am I?<eos> The more relevant question, Mr. Morton is: Who exactly are you?
In theory, I know all about you.<eos> Army reconnaissance, decorated soldier and page after page indicating a deep and troubling moral attitude.<eos> But you see, this file contains nothing of any real value to me.<eos> That's why I wanted to see you face to face.<eos> Who are you?
And the business being?<eos> Evil, Mr. Morton.<eos> Recognized, contained, examined, destroyed.<eos> She is, by far, the most ancient we have ever encountered.<eos> What are you doing to her?
Fascinating.<eos> What was I supposed to tell you?<eos> Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?<eos> When Henry came to me i took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.
Either... we wait for that day to arrive or we can fight it on our own terms.<eos> Which brings me to you.<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah, great, yes... doc.<eos> You said that you could cure me of this curse. Get rid of it.
Do you want to put the stone in the dagger and stab him with it?<eos> The dagger will allow Seth to enter his body.<eos> And then we obliterate it.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Do you want to stab me with that thing?
The dominoes are already falling.<eos> We haven't much time.<eos> Unfortunately, it is a risk we must take.<eos> That's really your plan?<eos> You heard Ahmanet.
That's really your plan?<eos> You heard Ahmanet.<eos> Your curse cannot be broken.<eos> I am truly sorry, Mr. Morton.<eos> No matter what I do, you are going to die.
No matter what I do, you are going to die.<eos> Yes, evil is a disease.<eos> A pestilent pustulant infection borrowing its way into our souls.<eos> The world needs a cure.<eos> You can be that cure.
Give it to me my chosen.<eos> Give it to me my love.<eos> Somewhere in there I know you're a good man.<eos> The world needs a cure.<eos> You can be that cure.
Please.<eos> - Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf.<eos> - We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.<eos> I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.<eos> And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.
- We have to go to the Forbidden Forest.<eos> I've told you time and again, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden.<eos> And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.<eos> None of this makes any sense, and I really don't understand why you can't follow simple rules.<eos> You snuck out and it put you all in danger.
And now you're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel's lair.<eos> None of this makes any sense, and I really don't understand why you can't follow simple rules.<eos> You snuck out and it put you all in danger.<eos> Seems to me the only way I can keep you safe is if...<eos> You're grounded.
- But, Papa, but...<eos> - Come on!<eos> No "buts."<eos> None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going.<eos> Do you understand that?
- What?<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't know what we were thinking.<eos> Good.<eos> Because, as I was saying, you behaved completely irresponsibly.
What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I was thinking of getting a little place out here.<eos> Just a quiet place in the forest.<eos> It's a little breezy up on the hill.<eos> What do you think I'm doing out here?
Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.<eos> Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.
That's not even convincing.<eos> When I find those Smurfs, I will ground them for a month of blue moons.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> Well, all right.<eos> Have you ever seen something so beautiful?
Yeah, sure.<eos> It's been fun.<eos> Well, not tons of fun, but it's had its moments.<eos> Kind of.<eos> You know what I'm trying to say.
- Sounds awesome!<eos> - Use this.<eos> - Grab on!<eos> I don't know about this.<eos> You won't regret it.
Wet, a little tired, kind of waterlogged.<eos> Thanks for asking, but...<eos> I'm still evil, so...<eos> Enjoy drowning.<eos> Hope you're better swimmers than you are judges of wizards' character.
Enjoy drowning.<eos> Hope you're better swimmers than you are judges of wizards' character.<eos> Brainy.<eos> Hefty?<eos> You okay?
That's it, Brain Man.<eos> It's time for you to earn your manners badge.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Take cover!<eos> Who are you?
Garga-what?<eos> He's a dangerous wizard who wants to capture all Smurfs and use them for his evil magic.<eos> And he knows about your lost village.<eos> "Lost village"?<eos> You're the ones who are lost, not us.
- Brainy's log, day two.<eos> We've encountered a rare new life-form.<eos> Are there more like you?<eos> They are at times very intimidating.<eos> - Are you gonna stay here?
There's no way he could survive.<eos> Help me!<eos> Help me!<eos> There's no way I'll survive!<eos> With all due respect, you don't know Gargamel.
Help me!<eos> Help me!<eos> There's no way I'll survive!<eos> With all due respect, you don't know Gargamel.<eos> Yeah, well, with no due respect, you don't know us.
Smurfette was created by this Gargamel?<eos> Yeah.<eos> From a lump of clay. Really cool story, actually.<eos> I knew I didn't trust her.<eos> You'd like her if you get to know her.
He doesn't seem so tough.<eos> Yeah, Gargamel!<eos> That's what you get when you attack Smurfy Grove.<eos> - Gargamel?<eos> What are you talking about?
Where are the boys?<eos> - 'Sup, Papa?<eos> - Hello there.<eos> I rode a dragonfly!<eos> Well, thank goodness you're all okay.
Well, thank goodness you're all okay.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> I wasn't born yesterday, you know.<eos> Yeah, that's clear.<eos> Look, you four are coming home with me.
That's right.<eos> I'm Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.<eos> I'm afraid that's quite impossible, because I happen to be the leader of the Smurfs.<eos> Whatever you say, Papa-thing.<eos> Excuse me, do you mind not calling me that?
I'm afraid that's quite impossible, because I happen to be the leader of the Smurfs.<eos> Whatever you say, Papa-thing.<eos> Excuse me, do you mind not calling me that?<eos> Well, if the thing fits...<eos> By the way, where'd you learn those moves?
Get away!<eos> Help me.<eos> Someone help!<eos> Stay away!<eos> What are you doing?
What did you do with my family?<eos> Steven, it's me, Gloria!<eos> I'm your wife.<eos> These are our children.<eos> You're not my family!
Let me help you.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> I've given birth to the devil.<eos> It's the devil!<eos> You're tired.
I've given birth to the devil.<eos> It's the devil!<eos> You're tired.<eos> Give me the baby.<eos> You don't want to hurt her.
Maybe he'd change my luck.<eos> He'd definitely be less mopey than you.<eos> John Constantine, the man who perfected the bad idea.<eos> The only reason I came to this dung heap of a casino is to find a relic to keep that monster locked away forever.<eos> Boys, boys! You're boring me.
Great.<eos> Sorry about the Batmobile. I hope your insurance was paid up.<eos> What, is there even a policy for something like that?<eos> Hey, I told you not to do that, Orchid. Use a bloody door.<eos> I am glad to see you are well.
Innocent lives are at stake.<eos> Well, doctors say an upbeat attitude can help, so what I'll focus on today is that I met Batman.<eos> Force of good.<eos> It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me...
It lets me access different planes of existence without doing 20-odd hours of incantations.<eos> In this case,<eos> I'll poke around this poor sod's memories to see how his madness began.<eos> And, more importantly, what caused it.<eos> What are you doing here?
The apartment was like that when I arrived. Richard as well.<eos> - Come on!<eos> You were all over him.<eos> - I was attempting to help.<eos> When you burst in, I knew I'd get blamed, so I ran.
A single human among your teeming masses.<eos> I only know John Constantine because he enrages me.<eos> Faust lives in an observatory which is invisible.<eos> It's a place where dark magic would infect the earth below it.<eos> I will take you there so you are no longer here.

Yes, I have been phoning them for weeks.<eos> I did not get a satisfactory answer.<eos> What about this foreclosure warning?<eos> Yellow warning.<eos> You must have defaulted.
Right?<eos> Because it does not last, is that logical?<eos> The new interest rate is much higher, So monthly payments jumped To suddenly mortgage you.<eos> We must clarify the possibility of this happening When refinancing.<eos> - You did it.

To review my remarks here only.<eos> Terms and conditions are explained.<eos> I personally explained. The possibility of higher interest rates During refinancing.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> You told me. The odds of exceeding the interest rate For the basic financing price. Very slim.

They make an assessment.<eos> - I've written letters, you know.<eos> Letters to every Cunt.<eos> Even wrote to the Queen.<eos> - You've written to the Queen?
Never got back to us, like.<eos> Too fucking busy to speak to the working classes.<eos> Different story when she needs a soldier.<eos> "Step this way, Mr. Begbie." "Sign here, Mr. Begbie."<eos> I didn't know you'd served in the army.
- Didn't fucking mention it.<eos> I cannot believe it.<eos> What was the last fucking thing I told you?<eos> Mind and mention the diminished responsibility, you fucking dumb Cunt!<eos> I think it would be better if we brought this meeting to a close, and you and I get together once you've had time to reflect upon the situation.
It's not for junkies who need to score.<eos> So that was me.<eos> No job, no money.<eos> No access to the little fella.<eos> And then you went back on the heroin.

- Who are you?<eos> - I'm your blackmailer.<eos> And your salvation.<eos> You cooperate with me, no one will ever see this video.<eos> Now, my research suggests that, as deputy headmaster of one of Edinburgh's leading private schools, you earn, near enough, £70,000 per annum.

Lumiere!<eos> - Oh! - Be calm.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> You're making her dinner!<eos> Well, we thought you might appreciate the company.
You're making her dinner!<eos> Well, we thought you might appreciate the company.<eos> Master, I just want to assure you... that I had no part in this hopeless plan.<eos> Preparing a dinner, designing a gown for her, giving her... a suite in the east wing!<eos> You gave her a bedroom?
- Good thinking, Cogsworth.<eos> - What?<eos> That's the most ridiculous idea... I've ever heard.<eos> Charm the prisoner!<eos> But you must try, Master.
Well, be my guest.<eos> Go ahead and starve.<eos> If she doesn't eat with me... then she doesn't eat at all.<eos> Idiots!<eos> You can't talk to us like that.
You can't talk to us like that.<eos> I forbid it.<eos> Am I too late?<eos> Shame, I was really going to tell him off this time.<eos> Oh, Master, you've returned.
Keep it down.<eos> Of course, of course!<eos> But what is dinner... without a little music?<eos> Music?<eos> Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?
They can sing, they can dance<eos> After all, miss, this is France<eos> And a dinner here is never second best<eos> Go on unfold your menu<eos> Take a glance and then you'll Be our guest, oui, our guest
Be our guest<eos> Be our guest<eos> Please be our guest<eos> Pudding?<eos> I don't understand why you're all being so kind to me.
Be our guest<eos> Please be our guest<eos> Pudding?<eos> I don't understand why you're all being so kind to me.<eos> Surely, you're as trapped here as I am.
Checkmate.<eos> Again.<eos> Wait! No!<eos> You cheated again.<eos> Mademoiselle, what are you doing?
Well, you should learn to control your temper!<eos> Try to get some rest.<eos> Thank you, miss.<eos> We are eternally grateful.<eos> Why do you care about him so much?
Why do you care about him so much?<eos> We've looked after him all his life.<eos> But he's cursed you somehow.<eos> Why?<eos> You did nothing!
It was the one story Papa could never bring himself to tell.<eos> I knew better than to ask.<eos> A doctor's mask.<eos> Plague.<eos> You must leave now.
I never imagined she'd actually say yes.<eos> What was I thinking?<eos> No, Master.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> The rose has only four petals left which means tonight... you can tell her how you feel.
You will feel slightly nauseous.<eos> Don't worry, Master.<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> Just stop being so nervous and tell Belle how you feel.<eos> Because if you don't... I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your days!
Well, Master, I have had my doubts, but everything is moving like clockwork.<eos> True love really does win the day!<eos> I let her go.<eos> You what?<eos> Master, how could you do that?
- Plumette?<eos> Plumette?<eos> Oh, my darling, Plumette.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Maestro, you were so brave.
Lumiere, look!<eos> Oh, my Prince!<eos> Hello, old friend.<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> You saved our lives, mademoiselle.
This is the best night ever.<eos> Oh, I could be here all night!<eos> That is crazy.<eos> You guys are insane.<eos> Seriously, you have to try.
- It's amazing. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Look.<eos> 25-foot great white sharks.<eos> They come right up to your cage. - 25 foot?<eos> - You have never seen anything like it.
You took that whole class!<eos> Okay, okay, look, look.<eos> This is Méjico, okay?<eos> It's not even diving.<eos> You're gonna be in a cage.
It's not even diving.<eos> You're gonna be in a cage.<eos> You're only down five minutes.<eos> - It's totally safe. - Exactly.<eos> It's like you're going to the zoo, except you're in the cage.
- Hola. - Hi.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hola.<eos> - Hey, how are you?<eos> I'm so glad you came.
- Hola.<eos> Buenos días. ¡Cómo están?<eos> - Bien.<eos> - Bien.<eos> You both know how to scuba dive, right?
- Yeah, okay.<eos> Yeah, I know that, yeah.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Right, okay.<eos> All right, you're only gonna be going down about five meters.
- Oh, I'm so scared.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Shark don't hear so good up here, you know?<eos> But underwater?<eos> You're in his world.
Can sense if you're frightened or weak.<eos> Track you down.<eos> Good to go!<eos> Don't pay any attention to that pendejo.<eos> You're going to have a great time.
Well, he definitely likes to look at you.<eos> Did you feel that?<eos> The cage just moved.<eos> I thought we were gonna drop for a moment.<eos> Are you girls okay?
- Hello?<eos> - I hear you.<eos> - I read you loud and clear, Kate.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> Oh, you have to help us.
- I hear you.<eos> - I read you loud and clear, Kate.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> Oh, you have to help us.<eos> Are you both okay?
Javier's coming down to you now.<eos> He's going to hook up the cage to our spare winch<eos> - and pull you up.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And remember, Kate, whatever you and Lisa do, don't try to race to the surface.
- Okay.<eos> And remember, Kate, whatever you and Lisa do, don't try to race to the surface.<eos> You'll get the bends.<eos> I'm going back down now.<eos> Promise me you'll come.
- Taylor, can you hear us?<eos> Lisa, I can hear you. Oh!<eos> Okay, um... we are heading up now.<eos> No, it's not safe.<eos> You need to stay in the cage.
You need to stay in the cage.<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> Kate has been badly hurt.<eos> We are coming up now.<eos> All right, but you need to go very slowly.
Kate has been badly hurt.<eos> We are coming up now.<eos> All right, but you need to go very slowly.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> If you ascend too quickly, you're going to get the bends.
Look at your gauge.<eos> Tell me what your depth is.<eos> Um, we're at 30 meters.<eos> You need to slow down.<eos> If you get nitrogen bubbles in your brain, you are dead, do you understand?
I knew it was you.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> - Please!<eos> I'm in trouble!<eos> You're the only one that could help!
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.<eos> I know I said June, but I need the boat now.<eos> Why would that mean the price go up?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know you wanted 70...
Eating his curds and whey.<eos> Then came a big spider Which sat down beside her.<eos> And frightened Miss Muffet...<eos> Friends, I have good news for you today!<eos> It's not about what you do.
And frightened Miss Muffet...<eos> Friends, I have good news for you today!<eos> It's not about what you do.<eos> It's not about your deeds.<eos> You can't live up to God's rules.
Get it with chicken!<eos> Get it with steak!<eos> And with the cheese baked right in the shell... it's the next big thing!<eos> Go now while supplies last.<eos> Who are you?
And with the cheese baked right in the shell... it's the next big thing!<eos> Go now while supplies last.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who I am.<eos> You're the man who puts me to sleep.
You know who I am.<eos> You're the man who puts me to sleep.<eos> We both could use some sleep. No!<eos> No!<eos> What are you doing to me?
We need to get out of here.<eos> Go north, cross to Canada.<eos> Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.<eos> How did you find me, huh?
You can have $30,000 more when we get there.<eos> My friends there will give it to you.<eos> They will be waiting.<eos> They will give you anything.<eos> Where did you get this?
And that's your daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know you're still good inside.<eos> I know you want to help us.<eos> You don't know anything about me.
- We have to be there Friday.<eos> - Or what?<eos> Or we miss our chance to cross.<eos> Please.<eos> You have to.
Logan.<eos> - Logan.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> You'll get it back after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into.
We are going to save as many children as we can.<eos> I read about a place, up north.<eos> A place for mutants.<eos> They call it Eden.<eos> If you are watching this, it means that I am dead.
There is no more money.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> She's not my child.<eos> But I love her.<eos> You may not love her.
Stay here.<eos> Evening, Mr. Munson.<eos> What brings y'all this way?<eos> Why don't you ask your boys?<eos> Mr. Munson, you understand you're trespassing right now, right?
What you need is rest, and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, you're not!<eos> I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.
You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, you're not!<eos> I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.<eos> You got to check yourself into a hospital.
I mean, I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you.<eos> You got to check yourself into a hospital.<eos> Find out what it is!<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.
Find out what it is!<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.<eos> Maybe I can run some tests.<eos> Look, Doc. You seem like a nice guy, all right?
Well, try to remind yourselves that these are all little killing machines.<eos> Machines who would've happily disemboweled your family.<eos> Not all.<eos> I was told you want these assets off-board, dead or alive.<eos> Are you changing my brief?
Waste this dick, Logan!<eos> Please stop, Mr. Howlett.<eos> I'm gonna have to tell these men to fire on these children.<eos> You don't want that.<eos> You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off.
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.<eos> I'm gonna have to tell these men to fire on these children.<eos> You don't want that.<eos> You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off.<eos> You will not survive further wounds.
Yeah.<eos> He's the asshole who put this poison in me.<eos> Yes, he was one of them.<eos> I think I might have killed him.<eos> I think you're right.
Whoa!<eos> Hey!<eos> Buddy, excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry, you're parking in my spot...
Don't have money for books, but got money for this newfangled...<eos> He gonna fuck that coffee machine up.<eos> Is this a practical joke?<eos> Huh?<eos> You know I don't play that shit.
It's state of the art, though.<eos> All you gotta do is put in your order, and it does the rest.<eos> Coffee.<eos> You know, I'll just... I'll do it for you, and I think that's just gonna be the easiest.<eos> Right, so you got your drink selections down here.
Tastes like shit.<eos> Fucking waste of money.<eos> Shit don't even voice activate.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> "It takes courage to grow up and to become who you really are."
That was awkward.<eos> "It takes courage to grow up and to become who you really are."<eos> Right?<eos> E.E. Cummings wrote that.<eos> And, guys, you're growing up.

E.E. Cummings wrote that.<eos> And, guys, you're growing up.<eos> You're moving on.<eos> For many of you, this is gonna be the last English class you're ever gonna take.<eos> So, um, I want you to remember something.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> You want more?<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Why did you open the door?
Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop this!<eos> Don't look at me and smile when you're doing it.
Maybe I'll just power on the...<eos> - Farewell, you bastard.<eos> - A-ha!<eos> I think I see what's going on here.<eos> Mr. Strickland, you are the victim of a senior prank.
Messing with the TV with your goddamn computer telephone?<eos> No, I'm not the one doing it.<eos> I'mma show you what's funny.<eos> Everybody,<eos> I want you to hashtag L-M-F-A...
It was you!<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> Give me that phone!<eos> I don't have one.<eos> You just broke mine, remember?
I don't have time for this today.<eos> I've got 30 termination meetings today alone.<eos> Everything in my office is glued to something else.<eos> I got drawers filled, filled with Silly String.<eos> You see that?
You did it.<eos> I mean, you did do it, so...<eos> He did it.<eos> That's what happened, was you...<eos> 'Cause he, you know, chopped the desk.
Yeah.<eos> And the kids were pushing him with the pranks.<eos> They're out of control this year, sir.<eos> I've never seen anything like it, really.<eos> You know what, I think maybe you should take that all in consideration.
E.E. Cummings said that.<eos> And words are gonna matter for you guys.<eos> Uh, um...<eos> Yes, Nathaniel.<eos> Is it true you're gonna fight Mr. Strickland?
What did you hear?<eos> Hashtag teacher fight?<eos> What is this?<eos> You guys are tweeting about this now?<eos> Why would you agree to fight Strickland?
He's right.<eos> He can't be taking no punches.<eos> - Right?<eos> - No.<eos> You see those twins out there?
I got this.<eos> Very well.<eos> That bitch crazy.<eos> Okay, Neil, so I think if you talk to Principal Tyler and just kind of reverse that story, everything will get worked out.<eos> So you want me to say I just made the whole thing up?
Yeah.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Well, because this is all your fault.<eos> How?<eos> You're the one who tattled.
You're the one who tattled.<eos> I was in a very compromising situation.<eos> You would've done the same exact thing.<eos> I was in the exact same situation and did the opposite thing.<eos> It's not the same exact situation, Neil, because you don't have a wife and kids, so you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Are you trying to blackmail me?<eos> Want me to lie for you or not?<eos> Hey, buddy, let's get one thing straight.<eos> I'm still a teacher at this school, okay?<eos> Are you?
Okay?<eos> How would you like it if I talked to your faculty advisor about this?<eos> My faculty advisor's Mr. Strickland.<eos> God damn it.<eos> You know, with the AppleCare, too.
- What?<eos> - I know! What are you...<eos> What is this?<eos> Why are you guys here?<eos> Why aren't you in school?
You're spinning out, okay?<eos> Everything really is okay.<eos> I don't know why you don't believe me.<eos> Just 'cause you're acting kinda nervous and...<eos> Well, you caught me off guard!
- Yeah.<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> And Mr. Strickland got in a lot of trouble because of you.<eos> Whew!<eos> You know this completely contradicts your statement, right, Campbell?
- Unbelievable.<eos> And Mr. Strickland got in a lot of trouble because of you.<eos> Whew!<eos> You know this completely contradicts your statement, right, Campbell?<eos> Look, we can get caught up in the whole statement game. Who said what and what they meant by what they said, and what words mean when people say them, and, you know, who's making a statement and what the statement means, and whose statement has something to do with something that someone else says.

Who said what and what they meant by what they said, and what words mean when people say them, and, you know, who's making a statement and what the statement means, and whose statement has something to do with something that someone else says.<eos> And, see, statements get...<eos> You know?

Yeah, I know I said the chopping thing, didn't I?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I was looking at the AV system, and I heard the crash and, you know, I did...<eos> You know how when you do one of these and you're like, "Oh, my God."
And shame on you because we have been through an ordeal over all of this.<eos> You should have come out and said that in the first place.<eos> - So...<eos> - He's right.<eos> Yeah, so there you have it.
Oh!<eos> Sir, thank you so much.<eos> That is fantastic news.<eos> I wouldn't get too happy, Campbell.<eos> Because you're still under review, and you put me through a lot of shit today.
No...<eos> I am a teacher.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's actually another teacher who's gonna beat me up after school, - so that's why I'm calling.<eos> - I'm sorry, can you repeat what you just told me?
There's another teacher here who wants to have a fist fight with me after school.<eos> So, I need help.<eos> Oh, very funny!<eos> Assault is a real thing.<eos> I would like you to stop laughing and listen to my...
So, I need help.<eos> Oh, very funny!<eos> Assault is a real thing.<eos> I would like you to stop laughing and listen to my...<eos> You're a grown man.
How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> I thought you guys knew how it worked.<eos> We do.<eos> Well, if you do, you should have told me.
Okay, guys.<eos> What seems to be the trouble here?<eos> Strickland was smoking marijuana.<eos> And he has molly in his bag.<eos> And who are you?
- Anymore?<eos> At all!<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> Guys, there's no fights today.<eos> Didn't you hear?
Uh, uh...<eos> Superintendent Johnson and I were just talking about his fishing trip to Alaska.<eos> I caught a halibut.<eos> You...<eos> You caught a halibut.
Anyway, it's an executive course right by the airport, right?<eos> Okay, thanks for the job, I guess.<eos> Step tight. Pop! You know.<eos> I'm sorry though.<eos> What cuts are you gonna make?
It's none of your business, Campbell.<eos> Well, no, it is my business, right?<eos> I... I teach at the school.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> I mean, you gonna cut buying new books or are you gonna shorten the school year?
So, what are you gonna do?<eos> I mean, you gonna cut buying new books or are you gonna shorten the school year?<eos> You gonna increase the class sizes again?<eos> That one was a real bright idea.<eos> Now would be a real good time for you to stop talking.
No, I'm not sorry.<eos> All right?<eos> I think, in fact, I'm tired of always saying I'm sorry.<eos> I asked you guys a direct fucking question.<eos> What cutbacks are you gonna make?
Well, all right. I may be just a teacher, but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me to ask a goddamn question about something that's gonna affect my ability to fucking teach!<eos> Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.<eos> And I know I'm just a teacher, but that ought to be worth something around here.<eos> In fact, that ought to be worth everything to you guys, but instead, you treat us like shit.
Campbell, get your ass out of here while you still got a job!<eos> No, I can't do it, man, because I'm done listening to you.<eos> And I know I'm just a teacher, but that ought to be worth something around here.<eos> In fact, that ought to be worth everything to you guys, but instead, you treat us like shit.<eos> And you don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly.
And you don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly.<eos> And I can't believe I'm saying this, but Strickland's right.<eos> The students are running all over the fucking school.<eos> So this may be just a teacher's opinion, but you guys fucking suck at your jobs.<eos> And if you ever leave me waiting outside again so you can talk about a goddamn fishing trip,
Little stupid ass I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck<eos> Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you<eos> Or anything that you do
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you<eos> Or anything that you do<eos> Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do<eos> I heard you got a new man I see you takin' a pic<eos> Then you post it up Thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
- Yeah!<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck bitch.<eos> - They just stopped the music.<eos> - I don't give a fuck about you<eos> Or anything that you do
Bully this, bitch!<eos> Oh, my!<eos> I was unaware of the lyrics and...<eos> And the strong language in that song, so I do apologize.<eos> But you know what?
The fight never ends!<eos> The fight never ends!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Like he said, the fight never ends.<eos> Unless you're him.
See you in a bit.<eos> I never said nothing about no running.<eos> Who's you?<eos> Seabiscuit?<eos> You don't run nowhere.
But boo-fucking-hoo!<eos> I can be a dick, too.<eos> You wanna see me be a dick?<eos> Hmm.<eos> So what do you teach here?
Says here you pressed domestic violence charges three years ago against your alleged assailant,
I'm sorry that happened to you.<eos> They dated for two years.<eos> And you were treated in a psychiatric hospital after the incident.<eos> That was my choice.<eos> But after the restraining order was up, you tried to resume contact.
They dated for two years.<eos> And you were treated in a psychiatric hospital after the incident.<eos> That was my choice.<eos> But after the restraining order was up, you tried to resume contact.<eos> You tell me, Ms. Banks, after all this why would you wanna go back and reunite with Mr. Vargas?
We downloaded the contents of Mr. Vargas' phone.<eos> I have almost 50 pages of Facebook messages between you and Mr. Vargas.<eos> These belong to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you don't understand, I...
These belong to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you don't understand, I...<eos> The man is dead, found in your home, with your face all over his phone and your delicates found in his car.<eos> Now you're gonna have to help me out here.
It's a beautiful dress.<eos> Beautiful on you.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> We can lift the neckline a little here.<eos> You're David Connover's girlfriend, right?
Miguel, thanks for signing on to this with me.<eos> And to his lovely wife, Sarah, our lawyer...<eos> I still can't pay you.<eos> A lot of you guys here saw me through a rough time when my dad got sick and passed away and that's what made me realize that this is where I belong.<eos> And to those of you who thought I was crazy for quitting Merrill Lynch and brewing beer in my garage, well, you were Wrong.
He did live there for years.<eos> It's not always all about you, Julia.<eos> If you're going to be a parent, especially to my daughter, I'd like you to learn that lesson.<eos> Fast.<eos> You're sure they're not from David Connover?
All the time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're gonna do great here.<eos> And your connection with David, it's...<eos> You talk, you laugh.
I stayed because of Lily.<eos> The affair...<eos> The affair just confirmed things.<eos> She said that you guys were trying to get back together when you met me.<eos> And that you were taking couples therapy.
You...<eos> I haven't done any of this.<eos> Tessa Connover, um, she was the one behind all of this.<eos> Your fiancé's ex-wife sets up a fake Facebook account, lures your abusive ex here and then kills him for no reason?<eos> You see what this looks like, right?
- We receive no word.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Our holy father has many enemies<eos> Discretion was of the utmost important.<eos> You do not know what you ask.
These are dark days for the faithful.<eos> Jerusalem has been lost for 20 years now.<eos> our Holy Father believes that the relic kept here, has the power to separate the faithful from the faithless. To summon the wrath of God upon his enemies.<eos> A power that could insure victory in the upcoming crusade.<eos> You can not hide such power.

They are afraid of it.<eos> Even before the lightning, they would not go near it.<eos> Of course they were.<eos> They know what happen to those who disturb the relic.<eos> Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the stories, brother.
He's obeyed every task asked of him, no matter how difficult or dangerous.<eos> In all that time, he's never spoken.<eos> It is not our place to ask why.<eos> You should sleep.<eos> I did not know you spoke my tongue, brother Ciarán.
In all that time, he's never spoken.<eos> It is not our place to ask why.<eos> You should sleep.<eos> I did not know you spoke my tongue, brother Ciarán.<eos> The abbot said you were far travelled.
- What of it?<eos> - A place of the Sídhe.<eos> They say that Tuatha day DenAnn come out at night to play among those rocks.<eos> They cast spells into the water and bewitch travellers.<eos> You are afraid of this?
They cast spells into the water and bewitch travellers.<eos> You are afraid of this?<eos> You allow your course to be determined by Pagan superstition?<eos> - Geraldus, we should not tarry here.<eos> - We are soldiers of Christ. Yet you would run from a mere scandaious?
What is that, boy?<eos> - It helps ward off.. - it soothes the aching stomach, brother.<eos> - Will you try some of it?<eos> - I have no stomachache, herbalist.<eos> You were to take us to the Merville's border.
The rock that ended his earthly life. caught fire and burned the men who murdered him.<eos> They cried out for mercy, but the ground opened up and hell swallowed them whole, while the body of Matthias was elevated to heaven.<eos> And this is that stone.<eos> Most impressive.<eos> You talk having some kind of agreement with these men. - I would like to know the particulars.
You talk having some kind of agreement with these men. - I would like to know the particulars.<eos> - They do not concern you.<eos> As regard the sanctity of the relic and the lives of my brothers, They're very much concern me.<eos> You're not blind to what kind of men these are.<eos> Yet you entrust all to their protection.
- They do not concern you.<eos> As regard the sanctity of the relic and the lives of my brothers, They're very much concern me.<eos> You're not blind to what kind of men these are.<eos> Yet you entrust all to their protection.<eos> You were on crusaid, brother.
These are enemies of Christ.<eos> He rejoices with every one you destroy.<eos> Your work is not yet done.<eos> Such is true for all of us.<eos> What would you have us do?
I will carry it.<eos> I will carry the relic.<eos> One of you will have to free Ciarán.<eos> We can not risk to recovery of the relic. Not for one man.<eos> How can you say such a thing?
We are never alone.<eos> Have faith.<eos> Praise be.<eos> God has heard us.<eos> How far do you think you can get?
My brother is a murderer.<eos> No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Did you miss me?<eos> Did you miss me? '<eos> I've only been gone four minutes.<eos> Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.<eos> What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.<eos> What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.<eos> Is that quite clear?<eos> Don't minute any of this.<eos> Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and...<eos> Are those ginger nuts?<eos> Oh, God...<eos> LOVE ginger nuts.<eos> Our doctor said you were clean.
♪<eos> What shall we do next?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Vivian.<eos> What would you do, Vivian?
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.<eos> That's not what happened at all.<eos> It is now.<eos> Remarkable.<eos> How did you do it?
We have some very talented people working here.<eos> If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.<eos> That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.<eos> No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.<eos> You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.

Obviously, there's unfinished business.<eos> Moriarty.<eos> I told you<eos> - Moriarty's dead.<eos> You say he filmed that video message before he died.
I told you<eos> - Moriarty's dead.<eos> You say he filmed that video message before he died.<eos> Yes.<eos> You also say you know what he's going to do next.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.<eos> Posthumous revenge.<eos> No, better than that - posthumous game.<eos> We brought you back to deal with this.<eos> What are you going to do?
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.<eos> 'Wilson?<eos> ' 'Lymph nodes?<eos> ' Sherlock...<eos> Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
Catherine.<eos> - Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.<eos> Have we? - Yeah.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Well, you know what I think...
Will you do it?<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.<eos> In Christ's name.<eos> Now, what name have you given your daughter?
I delete any text that begins "Hi."<eos> No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Phone!<eos> And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?
All right, good girl, good girl.<eos> Good girl.<eos> I'd better finish this, hadn't I?<eos> Hey.<eos> Afternoon. He says you've got a good one, Greg?
Must feel very different...<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> Yes, well, you know how it is.<eos> All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.<eos> Are you two having a little joke?
- Yeah.<eos> Got them, don't worry.<eos> Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.<eos> Yeah, never mind about that.<eos> Where are you now?
But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.<eos> I...<eos> Sherlock?<eos> Mr Holmes?<eos> Sorry, you were saying?
Who?<eos> What?<eos> Who...?<eos> Who was this?<eos> Are you serious?
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.<eos> Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.<eos> And if there's nothing...<eos> I know what happened to your son.<eos> You do?
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> And the porch where it was smashed,<eos> I noticed the motion sensor was damaged, so I assume it's permanently lit.<eos> How did you notice that?
There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.<eos> One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.<eos> Well, good enough.<eos> Effectively a costume.<eos> You're joking?
Well, good enough.<eos> Effectively a costume.<eos> You're joking?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
Oh, my God!<eos> Surprise!<eos> That's when it happened.<eos> I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.<eos> You said he'd felt unwell?
What kind of a life would that be?<eos> Besides, I have the strangest feeling...<eos> Miss me?<eos> That's mine.<eos> You two take a... bus.
Oh, hi, Stella. Greg.<eos> You, uh...?<eos> Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so...<eos> Right, right, right...<eos> Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you?
How did she die?<eos> Hypothermia.<eos> What?<eos> I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...<eos> Will you two please keep it down?
Will you two please keep it down?<eos> !<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?
!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you?<eos> You started out in manual labour.
You started out in manual labour.<eos> Don't bother being astonished.<eos> Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.<eos> I was a carpenter. Like me dad.<eos> You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.<eos> How the hell...?<eos> Ah... e-cigarettes.<eos> Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.<eos> If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
How the hell...?<eos> Ah... e-cigarettes.<eos> Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.<eos> If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.<eos> But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.

Has it?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.<eos> What about my girlfriend?<eos> What? You said I had an ex...
Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.<eos> What about my girlfriend?<eos> What? You said I had an ex...<eos> You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.<eos> It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
What? You said I had an ex...<eos> You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.<eos> It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.<eos> But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.<eos> If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.

I thought you'd done something clever.<eos> Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit?
I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league?<eos> Well...<eos> You thought she was having an affair.
To see Toby.<eos> Ah, right.<eos> Who?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Right, are you coming?
Who are you?<eos> I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.<eos> Who's Sherlock Holmes?<eos> Not a policeman.<eos> What do you think?
Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.<eos> Can you hear a squeaking?<eos> No. Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel -<eos> Why Planes Fail.<eos> Did you see it?
She said relax.<eos> Did you have a nice time in London?<eos> It was OK, I guess.<eos> But did somebody hide the sun?<eos> Did you lose it in the war?
Everything OK, madam?<eos> I think I'm dying.<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Oh, you're sweet.
You're all right.<eos> Oh, you're sweet.<eos> You have a very kind face.<eos> God will smile on you.<eos> 'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.<eos> I've got you where I want you.<eos> Give in, give in!<eos> I will destroy you.<eos> You're completely at my mercy.
Your daddy.<eos> Come here, Rose.<eos> Come here, darling, it's all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
Come here, darling, it's all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.<eos> How many more times?<eos> Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.<eos> And you're basing all this on a code name?<eos> On a whispered voice on the telephone?<eos> Come on, Mycroft.<eos> You were the conduit for AGRA.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.<eos> We're like them.<eos> Ghostly, living in the shadows.<eos> Predatory?<eos> Well, it depends which side you're on.
I knew this would happen one day.<eos> It's like that old story.<eos> I really am a very busy man.<eos> Would you mind cutting to the chase?<eos> You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Hello, Mary.<eos> Hey. John?<eos> On his way.<eos> Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?
Hey. John?<eos> On his way.<eos> Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?<eos> You were the person on the phone that time?
Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?<eos> You were the person on the phone that time?<eos> Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.<eos> Why did you betray us?
I thought I'd had it.<eos> Then she was taken hostage in that coup.<eos> I couldn't believe my luck!<eos> That bought me a little time.<eos> But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.<eos> Lady Smallwood gave the order.<eos> But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.<eos> Seemed to do the trick.<eos> And you thought your troubles were over.
Or so I thought.<eos> My secret was safe.<eos> But... apparently not.<eos> Just a little peace.<eos> That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
Really, I understand.<eos> So, just let me get out of here, right?<eos> Let me just walk away.<eos> I'll vanish, I'll go forever.<eos> What do you say?
So, just let me get out of here, right?<eos> Let me just walk away.<eos> I'll vanish, I'll go forever.<eos> What do you say?<eos> After what you did?
London Aquarium.<eos> Yes, now.<eos> I was never a field agent.<eos> I always thought I'd be rather good.<eos> Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.<eos> Thanks.<eos> For a secretary.<eos> - What?<eos> It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was. Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.<eos> They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.<eos> The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.<eos> Yes, your little flat.<eos> - How do you know?
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.<eos> The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.<eos> Yes, your little flat.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?

Yes, your little flat.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?<eos> And what are you, widowed or divorced?<eos> Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.

- Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.<eos> A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.<eos> Sherlock, don't.<eos> Pets do that, or so I'm told.<eos> There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
Pets do that, or so I'm told.<eos> There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.<eos> That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.<eos> So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.<eos> To prove how good you are.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.<eos> All except Sherlock Holmes.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> So it would seem.<eos> You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
Mary?<eos> Stay with me, stay with me.<eos> Oh, come on...<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
This is a two-way relationship, you know.<eos> The whole world has come crashing down around you.<eos> Everything's hopeless.<eos> Irretrievable.<eos> I know that's what you must feel... ..but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
Yes. Yes, I expect you're right.<eos> I'll make some tea, shall I?<eos> Mrs Hudson?<eos> - Yes, Sherlock?<eos> If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident...
This is an opportunity for our country.<eos> Listen, Senator, Landsat is sending a mission to the island.<eos> We could piggyback on that operation.<eos> With your permission, of course.<eos> What're you hoping you'll find?
So, uh, how much do we tell him?<eos> Just enough to get him to say yes.<eos> Now there's a man worth talking to.<eos> An uncharted island?<eos> Let me list all the ways you're gonna die.
Rain, heat, mud, disease carrying flies and mosquitos.<eos> Sure, you could load up on the atabrine for the malaria, but what about the other bacteria?<eos> We haven't even started on the things that want to eat you alive.<eos> We'll double that.<eos> You have no idea how dangerous this is.
Pay him.<eos> I think Mr. Conrad should be fairly compensated.<eos> Here's to profit during peacetime.<eos> One question.<eos> You came here looking for a tracker.
We're just scholars and scientists.<eos> We need someone with experience.<eos> In case things go sideways.<eos> Men go to war in search of something, Mr. Conrad.<eos> If you'd found it, you'd be home by now.
Embedded with MACV-SOG.<eos> Ah, you were in the shit.<eos> I respect that.<eos> But it's people like you lost us support back home.<eos> You're not actually gonna blame the people without guns for losing the war, are you?
That means we'll be by ourselves.<eos> Three days later, the refuel team will meet us here on the north end of the island.<eos> That may be our only safe departure window for an unknown period of time.<eos> So, tip for everybody, don't miss it, please.<eos> What are you doing down here?
So, tip for everybody, don't miss it, please.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> Why does a geological mapping mission need explosives?<eos> You weren't listening in class.
I could ask you the same thing.<eos> Why does a geological mapping mission need explosives?<eos> You weren't listening in class.<eos> Seismic charges for the geological survey.<eos> Uh-huh. You believe that?
What about you?<eos> How did British special forces get dragged into this?<eos> - Just "Conrad." I'm decommissioned.<eos> They offered me money.<eos> You don't strike me as a mercenary.
I'm sure the Landsat inspector will be inspired by your courage.<eos> No, he'll be inspired by my common sense.<eos> This is only a map survey.<eos> To one of the last uncharted areas on the face of the Earth.<eos> And you wanna call it on account of rain?
Copy all, Fox Three.<eos> Heading 0-9-0.<eos> Are you seeing what I'm seeing?<eos> The seismic response is incredible.<eos> Hey, Randa, you're not gonna believe this.
I should be sitting at a desk.<eos> So, wait, are we just not gonna talk about this?<eos> My best guess is we're scattered over a four to five mile radius.<eos> We should head north and join anyone we find.<eos> Are you all right?
We should head north and join anyone we find.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I don't know how to answer that question right now.<eos> I don't know what that was either.<eos> All that money that they paid you? I hope you're worth it.
Seven confirmed KIA.<eos> Galleta, Saraf, and Hodges.<eos> Slivko and the rest are unknown.<eos> Where's Randa?<eos> How you doing?
Thank you.<eos> Good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> You are going to tell me everything I don't know, or I'm gonna blow your head off.
Nobody believed me.<eos> Yesterday, I was a crackpot.<eos> But today...<eos> So this was never about geology.<eos> You dropped those charges to flush something out.
Yesterday, I was a crackpot.<eos> But today...<eos> So this was never about geology.<eos> You dropped those charges to flush something out.<eos> Who are you?
But today...<eos> So this was never about geology.<eos> You dropped those charges to flush something out.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You heard of the USS Lawton?
Ancient species owned this earth long before mankind.<eos> And if we keep our heads buried in the sand, they will take it back.<eos> My agency is known as Monarch.<eos> We specialize in the hunt for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms.<eos> You knew that thing was out here?
No need for that.<eos> Come on now!<eos> Everybody, keep your wigs on now!<eos> What?<eos> I didn't believe it when they said you were coming.
Did you crash here?<eos> Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.<eos> You are more beautiful than a hot dog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.
Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.<eos> You are more beautiful than a hot dog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.<eos> But you're real.
Oh, there's a lot out there.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> We gotta get home.<eos> You don't wanna be out here at night.<eos> You probably noticed a lot of weird things on this island.
There's no crime, no personal property.<eos> They're past all that.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> So, good news.<eos> They say you can shack up here.
So, good news.<eos> They say you can shack up here.<eos> I didn't hear them say anything.<eos> Oh, they don't speak too much.<eos> When you've been here as long as I have, you start to understand.
Kong's a pretty good king.<eos> Keeps to himself mostly.<eos> This is his home.<eos> We're just guests here.<eos> But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight.
They come from the vents deep down.<eos> That's why Kong got so mad.<eos> Those bombs woke up a bunch of them.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> You're lucky he's out there, too, or you wouldn't have made it this far.
And she floats.<eos> Pulled the engine parts from my P-51 and his old Zero.<eos> Found a B-29 on the beach one day.<eos> That was something.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.
It felt good.<eos> Then I thought he was crazy when he said the earth was full of monsters.<eos> I can't tell when I'm talking<eos> - or when I'm not talking.<eos> - You're talking.
I understand going after your man.<eos> But the rest of it...<eos> This is beyond us.<eos> You don't like the way I'm running things?<eos> You know where the door is.
But the rest of it...<eos> This is beyond us.<eos> You don't like the way I'm running things?<eos> You know where the door is.<eos> You set this in motion when you put this place on the map.
We're back here by nightfall, understood?<eos> In 24 hours, we have to be on the other side of this island.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Hear you loud and clear.<eos> All right, you heard the man.
Moving out in 10.<eos> This is a good group of boys.<eos> We're all gonna die together out here.<eos> You're a good group of boys to die with, I'll tell you that much.<eos> You shouldn't have come here.
He's right, Colonel.<eos> We can't kill Kong.<eos> Now, that other creature? That's the threat.<eos> And there are more of them down there.<eos> If you take away a species' natural competition, they'll proliferate out of control.
This is nuts!<eos> Please!<eos> You need to listen to us!<eos> We're not at war, Colonel.<eos> You're making a mistake.
We're not at war, Colonel.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> Your lies got my men killed!<eos> - And you're gonna get us all killed!<eos> Whose side are you on, Captain?
The boat must be around that bend.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> Conrad, which way are we going?<eos> You three need to go back to the boat.
It's that way.<eos> Wait for us till dawn.<eos> If we're not back by then, just go.<eos> You ain't gotta twist my arm.<eos> Where are you two going?
Ladies and gentlemen, here we go now to the Cub half of number eight.<eos> If you want to see a crowd go crazy, see what happens if this guy hits one right now.<eos> Fly ball, very deep.<eos> And the impossible dream just became the possible dream!<eos> You just gonna sit there?
Is this fun for you?<eos> I promise I won't tell the Russians.<eos> - I promise I will tell the Russians.<eos> - She's gonna tell the Russians.<eos> Why are you keeping us here?
I woke up. THERAPIST:<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I don't.<eos> You just said you woke up.
And we can just say that.<eos> I only mean it's okay.<eos> I'm letting my daughter down.<eos> How the hell is that okay?<eos> You just lost your wife.
I'm letting my daughter down.<eos> How the hell is that okay?<eos> You just lost your wife.<eos> And Rosie just lost her mother.<eos> THERAPIST: You are holding yourself to an unreasonable standard.
Okay.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> THERAPIST: Is there anything you're not telling me?<eos> (CHUCKLES) No. (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> What are you looking at?
THERAPIST: Is there anything you're not telling me?<eos> (CHUCKLES) No. (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You keep glancing to my left.
-I tend to notice these things.<eos> -I'm sure.<eos> Now, I am reminding you of your friend, I think.<eos> That's not necessarily a good thing.<eos> Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?
Do you blame him?<eos> I don't blame him... I don't think about him.<eos> Has he attempted to make contact with you?<eos> No!<eos> How can you be sure?
What's the very worst thing you can do... to your very best friends?<eos> Something on your mind?<eos> Yes, Simon.<eos> Oh yes.<eos> Whatever you tell us, stays in this room.
Whatever you tell us, stays in this room.<eos> I think I speak for everyone.<eos> WOMAN: Well, what is the worst thing you could do?<eos> Tell them your darkest secret.<eos> Because, if you tell them, and they decide they rather not know...
Tell them your darkest secret.<eos> Because, if you tell them, and they decide they rather not know...<eos> You can't take it back.<eos> You can't unsay it.<eos> Once you've opened your heart, you can't close it again.
-The memory.<eos> -The memory.<eos> Yes.<eos> I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.<eos> Didn't exactly know who you were gonna be using it on.
-The memory.<eos> Yes.<eos> I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.<eos> Didn't exactly know who you were gonna be using it on.<eos> (CHUCKLES) -You mean you didn't ask.
Something personal.<eos> And of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess.<eos> But you, I think, might have a need to forget.<eos> By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world you will not remember any of what you've heard.
One of you sits on the board of a prominent broadcaster.<eos> Two of you work for me.<eos> And one of you of course, is my lovely daughter.<eos> Faith.<eos> You are the people I need to hear me.
-What name?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.<eos> And I don't know if he ever did it.<eos> (SIGHS) You've changed, you need to top up your tan and your roots are showing, you're letting yourself go.
I can't remember.<eos> I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.<eos> And I don't know if he ever did it.<eos> (SIGHS) You've changed, you need to top up your tan and your roots are showing, you're letting yourself go.<eos> Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?
-No, not American.<eos> Left hand drive.<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> No.<eos> Why do you ask?
Of course, you don't own a car.<eos> You don't need one. Do you?<eos> Living in isolation.<eos> No human contact. No visitors.<eos> Okay, how do you know that?
Okay, how do you know that?<eos> It's all here, isn't it?<eos> Look.<eos> Cost cutting is clearly a priority for you look at the size of your kitchen, teeny-tiny.<eos> Must be a bit annoying when you're such a keen cook.
Why was I doing that? -I don't know.<eos> -Me neither.<eos> Must've had a reason.<eos> It'll come back to me.<eos> Presumably, you downsized when you left your job.
This cup of tea...<eos> -Code?<eos> -It's a cup of tea.<eos> Because you might prefer some coffee.<eos> You're my last hope.
Do you hear me?<eos> Off it.<eos> Off it!<eos> Sorry. What?<eos> What are you talking about?
Sorry.<eos> I'm still catching up with my brain.<eos> It's terribly fast.<eos> Those markings, do you see them?<eos> You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door, but they're on the left hand side, so you weren't driving. You were in the passenger seat.
You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door, but they're on the left hand side, so you weren't driving. You were in the passenger seat.<eos> I came in a taxi.<eos> There is no taxi waiting in the street outside.<eos> That's what I checked when I went to the window.<eos> And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one, and look at you.
I came in a taxi.<eos> There is no taxi waiting in the street outside.<eos> That's what I checked when I went to the window.<eos> And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one, and look at you.<eos> You didn't even bring a coat, in this rain?

-Then you can keep your scars.<eos> I want to see your handbag.<eos> Why?<eos> It's too heavy.<eos> You said I was your last hope, and now you're going out into the night with no plan on how you're getting home.
You said I was your last hope, and now you're going out into the night with no plan on how you're getting home.<eos> And a gun.<eos> -Chips.<eos> -Chips?<eos> (SIGHS) You're suicidal.
He's left his flat.<eos> Was it on fire?<eos> SMITH: Even when I'm on the road I still like quality food.<eos> SHERLOCK: You see the fold in the middle?<eos> For the first few months, you kept this hidden.
SHERLOCK: You see the fold in the middle?<eos> For the first few months, you kept this hidden.<eos> Folded inside a book.<eos> Must have been a tightly packed shelf, going by the severity of the crease.<eos> So, obviously you were keeping it hidden from someone living in the same house, at the level of intimacy where privacy could not be assumed.
Relationship is over.<eos> The paper has been exposed to steam and a variety of cooking smells.<eos> So, it must have been on display in the kitchen.<eos> (SNIFFS) Lots of different spices.<eos> You're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash.
You're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash.<eos> Yet, you're still cooking to impress.<eos> You're keen, and kitchen is the most public room in any house.<eos> And since any visitor could be expected to ask about a note like this, I have to assume you don't have any.<eos> You've isolated yourself.
It's Mycroft.<eos> Might be about Sherlock.<eos> Of course it's about Sherlock.<eos> Everything's about Sherlock.<eos> FAITH: How did you know my kitchen was tiny?
And how am I supposed to do that?<eos> -FAITH:<eos> Sex. -I'm sorry.<eos> Sex.<eos> How did you know I wasn't getting any?
How did you know I wasn't getting any?<eos> It's all about the blood.<eos> This one comes from the very first night.<eos> You can see the pen marks over it.<eos> I think you discovered the pains stimulated your memory so you tried it again later.
This one comes from the very first night.<eos> You can see the pen marks over it.<eos> I think you discovered the pains stimulated your memory so you tried it again later.<eos> I'm no expert, but I assume that since your lover failed to notice an increasing number of scars over a period of months, that the relationship was no longer intimate.<eos> How do you know he didn't notice?
-Would he? -Wouldn't he?<eos> Isn't that what you people do?<eos> -Well that's interesting.<eos> -What is?<eos> -The way you think.
We must be careful not to burn our bridges.<eos> SHERLOCK: Do you know why I'm gonna take your case?<eos> Because of the one impossible thing you said.<eos> FAITH: What impossible thing?<eos> You said your life turned on one word.
Look, I think we can rule both of them out as targets.<eos> Okay, I got it wrong then.<eos> It wasn't on one word.<eos> It can't have been.<eos> Did you remember quite distinctly that your whole life turned on one word?
A name you instantly recognise that tore your world apart.<eos> Okay, well, how?<eos> No idea yet.<eos> But I don't work for free.<eos> You take cash?
Once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it.<eos> You know, death, it's something that happens to everybody else.<eos> Your life is not your own.<eos> Keep your hands off it.<eos> You're not what I expected, you're... (GROANS)
CHILD'S VOICE: * My little master, who will find me... *<eos> (GASPS) Sorry, I...<eos> Faith?<eos> Faith!<eos> SHERLOCK: You said your life turned on one word.
Faith?<eos> Faith!<eos> SHERLOCK: You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him, that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Why not?<eos> Why shouldn't he be?<eos> -What is wrong?<eos> -What's the matter with you?<eos> Do you know where you are?
Right, you there!<eos> Stop right where you are!<eos> -Oh, John.<eos> -Mrs Hudson.<eos> Do you have any idea what speed you were going at?
On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers, from war-proof!<eos> "And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us<eos> "Here the mettle of your pasture!<eos> "I doubt not, for there is none of you here so mean and base "that hath not noble luster in your eyes!<eos> "I see you standing like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start!"
"I see you standing like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start!"<eos> (PANTING) "The game's afoot."<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> Can I have a cup of tea?<eos> -(DOOR SLAMMING) -Did you call the police?
They're that man on the telly, aren't they?<eos> -What pictures?<eos> -They're everywhere.<eos> Oh, these pictures?<eos> Oh, you can see them too!
I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken.<eos> But if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who'll you have then?<eos> Because I'll tell you something, John Watson.<eos> You will not have me.<eos> Have you spoken to Mycroft, Molly, anyone?
Oh, get over yourself.<eos> You're not my first smack-head, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> That woman's out of control.<eos> I asked for a cup of tea.<eos> -How did you get him in the boot?
I'm the widow of a drug dealer.<eos> I own property in Central London.<eos> And for the last bloody time, John, I'm not your housekeeper.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I answered your phone, you were busy.
I own property in Central London.<eos> And for the last bloody time, John, I'm not your housekeeper.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I answered your phone, you were busy.<eos> I think you'll want to take it.
-Uh, yes, hello?<eos> -Is this Dr John Watson?<eos> Yeah, who's this?<eos> Culverton Smith.<eos> You've probably heard of me.
Get me a fresh glass of water, please.<eos> This one's filthy.<eos> I mean, I'm aware of this morning's developments.<eos> Yes, I'm sure he was being hilarious.<eos> Sorry, did you say all still meeting?
-Two weeks ago.<eos> -Two weeks?<eos> Yes.<eos> Two weeks.<eos> How did you know where to find me?
I didn't know that you were gonna be here.<eos> -I have absolutely no idea what's going on.<eos> -Sherlock's using again.<eos> Oh, God. Well, um...<eos> -Are you sure?
-Yeah, he is. -Yeah, okay, right.<eos> He is. Ugh. (CHUCKLES)<eos> But he's our monster.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.
He is. Ugh. (CHUCKLES)<eos> But he's our monster.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.<eos> But did you know... -I'm a...
Beyond what?<eos> SMITH: Dangerous.<eos> And action!<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.
SMITH: Dangerous.<eos> And action!<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> You know I'm a killer.<eos> But did you know... I'm a cereal killer?
Brilliant?<eos> Safest place to hide.<eos> Plain sight.<eos> Mr Holmes.<eos> Culverton wants to know if you're okay going straight to the hospital.
No.<eos> No, not endless.<eos> Need another hit, do you?<eos> It can wait until the hospital.<eos> You involved, much?
Yeah, I'm John Watson.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dr Watson.<eos> -I love his blog.<eos> Don't you?
I love your blog.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Right.<eos> Here he comes. The internet tech.<eos> You all know Sherlock Holmes.
You all know Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Oh, and Dr Watson, of course.<eos> Mr Holmes, I was wondering.<eos> Well, we all were, weren't we?<eos> Maybe you could tell us about some of your cases.
Absolutely, yes!<eos> The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself but rather, the iron chain of reasoning from cause to effect, that reveals, step-by-step, the solution.<eos> That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair.<eos> Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence, as they were available to me.<eos> And in this very room, you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington, the poisoner.
-Good, then I'll...<eos> How do you capture a serial killer?<eos> Same way you catch any other killer. No, no.<eos> But most killers kill someone they know.<eos> You're looking for a murderer in a tiny social grouping.
But most killers kill someone they know.<eos> You're looking for a murderer in a tiny social grouping.<eos> Um, Mr Smith.<eos> Um, I'm just, uh, wondering maybe this isn't a suitable subject for the children. Nurse Cornish.<eos> -How long have you been with us now?
Additionally, serial killers are easily profiled.<eos> They tend to be social outcasts.<eos> -Educationally sub-normal.<eos> -SMITH: No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're just talking about the ones you know.
They tend to be social outcasts.<eos> -Educationally sub-normal.<eos> -SMITH: No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're just talking about the ones you know.<eos> The ones you've caught.
-SMITH: No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're just talking about the ones you know.<eos> The ones you've caught.<eos> But, hello, dummy.<eos> You only catch the dumb ones.
Everyone out.<eos> Mr Smith, we're actually in the middle of something.<eos> Saheed, isn't it?<eos> Saheed. Yes.<eos> -How long have you been working here now?
To what?<eos> The way you're talking.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Yes.<eos> You mean, am I a serial killer?
Well, it's true.<eos> I do like to mess with people, and yes, I am a bit creepy but that's just my USP.<eos> I use it to sell breakfast cereal.<eos> But am I what he says I am?<eos> Is that what you're asking?
-Yeah, of course I am.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, no, a medical doctor, you know, not just feet or media studies or something.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> Are you serious?
I'm a doctor.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> No, really.<eos> Are you?<eos> Are you, are you actually serious?
Either I'm a serial killer, or Sherlock Holmes is off his tits on drugs. Hmm?<eos> Delusional paranoia about a public personality.<eos> That's not so special.<eos> It's not even new.<eos> I think you need to tell your faithful little friend how you're wasting his time because you're too high to know what's real any more.
I apologise.<eos> (STAMMERS) I miscalculated.<eos> I forgot to factor in the traffic.<eos> Nineteen and a half minutes. (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> (DOOR OPENING) Ah, the footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two.
(DOOR OPENING) Ah, the footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two.<eos> The third of course, will be the end of a walking cane.<eos> Your daughter Faith's walking cane.<eos> Why would she be here?<eos> You invited her.
"Faith, I can stand it no longer.<eos> "I've confessed to my crimes.<eos> "Please forgive me."<eos> How would that have any effect?<eos> You don't know her.
Oh, but I do.<eos> I spent a whole evening with her.<eos> We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.
We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.<eos> I know you care about her deeply.
I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.<eos> I know you care about her deeply.<eos> I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.
You simply do not.<eos> I know you care about her deeply.<eos> I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.<eos> You care what she thinks.<eos> (CHUCKLING) You maintain an impressive facade.
FAITH:<eos> Dad? What's happening?<eos> What was that text?<eos> Another one of your jokes? (CHUCKLES)<eos> Who are you?
Dad? What's happening?<eos> What was that text?<eos> Another one of your jokes? (CHUCKLES)<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who the hell are you?
Oh, my God.<eos> Sherlock Holmes?<eos> I love your blog.<eos> (SIGHS) You're not her.<eos> You're not the woman who came to Baker Street.
He didn't just suddenly do it.<eos> Look, I didn't know he had the bloody scalpel.<eos> Sorry, I'm not sure I completely understand.<eos> -Understand what?<eos> -But I thought you two were, were old friends!
-Have we? -(SMITH LAUGHS)<eos> Sherlock?<eos> So who came to my flat?<eos> -Well, it wasn't me. -(LAUGHING)<eos> You look different.
Sherlock, you okay?<eos> -Watch him. He's got a knife.<eos> -Got a what?<eos> Got a scalpel.<eos> You picked it up from that table.
I saw you take it.<eos> I certainly did not!<eos> Look behind his back!<eos> -Look. (LAUGHS)<eos> -I saw you take it!
Well, seeing as I'm inside your head, I think we can call that self-loathing.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where is Mrs Hudson?<eos> She'll be up in a moment.<eos> -Uh, what are you doing?
What, is he locked up in a tower or something?<eos> Mycroft Holmes.<eos> What are these dreadful people doing in my house?<eos> Mrs Hudson I apologise for the interruption.<eos> As you know, my brother has embarked in a programme of self-destruction, remarkable even by his standards, and I'm endeavouring to find out what triggered it.
Mycroft Holmes.<eos> What are these dreadful people doing in my house?<eos> Mrs Hudson I apologise for the interruption.<eos> As you know, my brother has embarked in a programme of self-destruction, remarkable even by his standards, and I'm endeavouring to find out what triggered it.<eos> -And that's what you're looking for?
-So to speak.<eos> -And you've had all this time?<eos> Time being something of which we don't have an infinite supply.<eos> So, if we could be about our business.<eos> You're so funny, you are!
Poor old Sherlock.<eos> Always going on about you.<eos> I mean he knows you're an idiot.<eos> But that's okay, 'cause you are a lovely doctor.<eos> But he has no idea what an idiot you are!
Always going on about you.<eos> I mean he knows you're an idiot.<eos> But that's okay, 'cause you are a lovely doctor.<eos> But he has no idea what an idiot you are!<eos> Is this merely stream of consciousness abuse, or are you attempting to make a point?
This is my house, this is my friend, and that's his departed wife.<eos> Anyone who stays here a minute longer is admitting to me personally, they do not have a single spark of human decency.<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> You reptile.<eos> You've been ages waking' up.
Save him.<eos> But I do think you're going to need a little help with that, because you're not exactly good with people.<eos> So here's a few things you need to know about the man we both love.<eos> And more importantly, what you're going to need to do to save him.<eos> How did you get in?
But I do think you're going to need a little help with that, because you're not exactly good with people.<eos> So here's a few things you need to know about the man we both love.<eos> And more importantly, what you're going to need to do to save him.<eos> How did you get in?<eos> Policemen outside, you mean?
When I get the urge.<eos> H.H. Holmes.<eos> Murder castle, but done right.<eos> I have a question for you.<eos> Why you are here?
H.H. Holmes.<eos> Murder castle, but done right.<eos> I have a question for you.<eos> Why you are here?<eos> It's like you walked into my den and laid down in front of me.
I have a question for you.<eos> Why you are here?<eos> It's like you walked into my den and laid down in front of me.<eos> Why?<eos> You know why I'm here.
Then I'll restore the settings.<eos> Everyone assumes that it was a fault, or...<eos> -You just gave up the ghost.<eos> -Yes.<eos> You are good at this.
-I feel scared. -(CHUCKLES)<eos> Be more specific.<eos> You only get to do this the once.<eos> Scared of dying.<eos> You wanted this though.
You only get to do this the once.<eos> Scared of dying.<eos> You wanted this though.<eos> I have reasons.<eos> But you don't actually want to die.
I wanted to hear your confession.<eos> Needed to know I was right.<eos> Why do you need to die?<eos> The mortuary, your favourite room.<eos> You talk to the dead.
The mortuary, your favourite room.<eos> You talk to the dead.<eos> You make your confession to them.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, what?<eos> What do you mean?
Yeah, it's always doing that.<eos> You can't save John, because he won't let you.<eos> He won't allow himself to be saved.<eos> The only way to save John, is to make him save you.<eos> Why do you do it?
If he thinks you need him, I swear...<eos> And off we pop.<eos> He will be there.<eos> Mr Holmes, you okay?<eos> What were you doing to him?
And off we pop.<eos> He will be there.<eos> Mr Holmes, you okay?<eos> What were you doing to him?<eos> What were you doing!
Well, we could carry on now, I'm not tired.<eos> There's a loads more.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> You know, I am gonna be so famous now.<eos> You're already famous.
(CHUCKLES) Seriously?<eos> I'm Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I wear the damn hat.<eos> Isn't that right, Mary?<eos> THERAPIST: You seem so much better, John.
You know, the secret one.<eos> Oh, that was just something...<eos> I said.<eos> I'm sure there's...<eos> How did you know about that, I didn't tell you that.
How did you know about that, I didn't tell you that.<eos> -You must have done.<eos> -I really didn't.<eos> Well, maybe Sherlock told me.<eos> Wait, you've met Sherlock exactly once, in this room.
We spent a night together.<eos> It was lovely.<eos> We had chips.<eos> (IN FAITH'S VOICE) You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes.<eos> You're...
In fairness though, he does have excellent taste in chips.<eos> -What's that?<eos> -What's what?<eos> The flower in your hair is like I had on the bus.<eos> You looked very sweet.
All the time.<eos> Oh, please don't go anywhere, I'm sure the therapist who actually lives here wouldn't want blood on the carpet.<eos> Oh, hang on. It's fine.<eos> She's in a sack in the airing cupboard.<eos> -Who are you?
Oh, hang on. It's fine.<eos> She's in a sack in the airing cupboard.<eos> -Who are you?<eos> -Isn't it obvious?<eos> Haven't you guessed?
Still had 10 minutes to go.<eos> Well, we'll see about a refund.<eos> Right, you two, Wiggins has got your money by the gate, don't spend it all in one crack den.<eos> I hope we didn't spoil your enjoyment of the movie.<eos> You're just leaving?
Sleep well!<eos> Dr Watson, why would he do that to me?<eos> - That was insane.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, someone convinced him that you wouldn't tell the truth unless you were actually wetting yourself.
Well, someone convinced him that you wouldn't tell the truth unless you were actually wetting yourself.<eos> "Someone"?<eos> Probably me.<eos> So that's it, is it?<eos> You're just going.
If there's a queue, join it.<eos> For God's sake, this is not one of your idiot cases.<eos> You might wanna close that window.<eos> There is an east wind coming.<eos> You have to sit in the chair.
"The deduction thing"?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - More than you can know.<eos> Enlighten me.<eos> You realise I'm the smart one.
Heaven may be a fantasy for the credulous and the afraid.<eos> But I can give you a map reference for hell.<eos> That's where our sister has been since early childhood.<eos> She hasn't left, not for a single day.<eos> Whoever you both met, it can't have been her.
- The detective.<eos> The pirate.<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray, this is a restricted area.<eos> Repeat, restricted area.<eos> You are off course.
Golf, whisky, x-ray, this is a restricted area.<eos> Repeat, restricted area.<eos> You are off course.<eos> Are you receiving?<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray, you are off course.
Yeah, receiving you.<eos> This is a distress call. Repeat, distress call, we're in trouble here.<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray, what is your situation?<eos> Golf, whisky, x-ray?<eos> Where are you now?
He's here.<eos> Sir, we found two more from the boat.<eos> He stole our boat!<eos> Him and another fella, with guns!<eos> Where did you find 'em?
- Yeah, I really am.<eos> - Please, sit down.<eos> I don't even know who he is!<eos> He's Dr John Watson, formerly of the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers.<eos> What're you doing here?
The true art of disguise, according to your famous friend, is not being looked at.<eos> But I am looking at you, aren't I, Mr Holmes?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> But that is sort of the point, isn't it?<eos> See, you should've been looking at the guy you just gave your pass to.
It justifies dressing up or any damn thing I say it does.<eos> Now, listen to me.<eos> For your own physical safety, do not speak.<eos> Do not indulge in any non-verbal signal suggestive of internal thought.<eos> If the safety of my sister is compromised, if the security of my sister is compromised, if the incarceration of my sister is compromised, in short, if I find any indication my sister has left this island at any time, I swear to you, you will not!
- Aye.<eos> Still beautiful, though.<eos> -AUTOMATED Door closing.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> Why do you think you're here?
- Good and bad are fairy tales.<eos> We have evolved to attach an emotional significance to what is nothing more than the survival strategy of the pack animal.<eos> We are conditioned to invest divinity in utility.<eos> Good isn't really good, evil isn't really wrong, and bottoms aren't really pretty.<eos> You are a prisoner of your own meat.

- And?<eos> Killed himself.<eos> And?<eos> His family.<eos> You're going to cry.
You couldn't really tell.<eos> Is that vibrato or is your hand shaking?<eos> I warned you explicitly.<eos> No one was to talk to her alone.<eos> - You spoke to her.
I warned you explicitly.<eos> No one was to talk to her alone.<eos> - You spoke to her.<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> You even brought her a visitor on Christmas Day.
- Sorry?<eos> Do it now. Listen.<eos> - My sister's methods...<eos> - Just listen.<eos> You have no idea how I could help.
I'll touch it too if you're scared.<eos> I can fix her for you and then I'll give you her straight back.<eos> Good as new, I promise.<eos> That's all?<eos> What you're proposing is not... It's not right.
Good as new, I promise.<eos> That's all?<eos> What you're proposing is not... It's not right.<eos> Yeah, everyone who went in there got affected.<eos> - Enslaved, you said? - Yes.
Do you trust your wife?<eos> One question.<eos> That's your voice, isn't it?<eos> Do you trust her?<eos> You've got to stop saying these things.
Also, cowboys in black hats.<eos> Darth Vader.<eos> Don't be alarmed.<eos> I'm here now, I'm here now.<eos> Did you miss me?
But if you're gonna put a baby in a manger, you're asking for trouble.<eos> - You know what this place is, of course.<eos> - Of course.<eos> So, am I under arrest again?<eos> You remain a person of interest, but until you commit a verifiable crime, you are, I regret, at liberty.
- Of course.<eos> So, am I under arrest again?<eos> You remain a person of interest, but until you commit a verifiable crime, you are, I regret, at liberty.<eos> - Then why am I here?<eos> - You are a Christmas present.
With me?<eos> She has noted your interest in the activities of my little brother.<eos> So...<eos> What's she got to do with Sherlock Holmes?<eos> Whatever you're about to tell me, I already know it's gonna be awesome!
You can't do it, Sherlock.<eos> If you do it, it won't count.<eos> I'll kill her anyway.<eos> It has to be your brother or your friend.<eos> You have to do this.
I'm particularly focused on internal conflicts where strategising round a largely intuitive moral code appears to create a counter-intuitive result.<eos> I will not kill.<eos> I will not have blood on my hands.<eos> Yes, very good, thank you.<eos> Killing my wife is what you're doing.
Killing my wife is what you're doing.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> John.<eos> Dr Watson, are you married?
Dr Watson, are you married?<eos> - I was.<eos> - What happened?<eos> She died.<eos> What would you give to get her back?
- What happened?<eos> She died.<eos> What would you give to get her back?<eos> I mean, if you could, if it was possible.<eos> What would you do to save her?
Tick, tick, tick.<eos> Tick, tick, tick...<eos> Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.<eos> What's your name? David.<eos> -Are you sure about this, David?
Of course I'm bloody sure.<eos> Nearly there.<eos> Right, do you want to pray or anything?<eos> With Eurus Holmes in the world, who the hell would I pray to?<eos> You are a good man, and you are doing a good thing.
So are you.<eos> I'll spend the rest of my life telling myself that.<eos> Please...<eos> God.<eos> I know that you are scared, but you should also be very proud.
Interesting.<eos> All right, there you go.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> - And he's dead.<eos> - Dead or alive, it really wasn't very interesting, but you three, you three, were wonderful.
You got what you wanted.<eos> - And he's dead.<eos> - Dead or alive, it really wasn't very interesting, but you three, you three, were wonderful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You see, what you did, Dr Watson, specifically, because of your moral code, because you don't want blood on your hands, - two people are dead instead of one.
Hang on.<eos> What advantage did your moral code grant you?<eos> Is it not, in the end, selfish to keep one's hands clean at the expense of another's life?<eos> You didn't have to kill her!<eos> The condition of her survival was that you or Mycroft had to kill her husband.
Hello, we're still here.<eos> - Can you hear us?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Everything's gonna be all right.<eos> I just need you to tell me where you are.
- Big.<eos> Lots of people on it?<eos> Lots and lots, but they're all asleep.<eos> I can't wake them up.<eos> Where did you take off from?
I can't wake them up.<eos> Where did you take off from?<eos> And the driver's asleep.<eos> No, I understand, but...<eos> Where did you come from?
No, I understand, but...<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> Where did the plane take off?<eos> My nan's.<eos> And where are you going?
No cuts, no scarring.<eos> Not Nathan then.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Well done, Dr Watson!<eos> How useful you are.
- Is it a city?<eos> - I think so.<eos> She's about to fly over a city in a pilotless plane.<eos> - We'll have to talk her through it. - Through what?<eos> Hello, are you still there?
- Well...<eos> - Well what?<eos> We're not actually going to discuss this, are we?<eos> I'm sorry, Dr Watson.<eos> You are a fine man in many respects.
Four.<eos> Three.<eos> Two...<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, are you still there?
Hello?<eos> Hello, are you still there?<eos> Yes. Yeah, no, I'm still here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> You went away.
Hours and hours.<eos> Why don't grown-ups tell the truth? No, I...<eos> I am telling the truth.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> - Where did you go?
Victor Trevor.<eos> We played pirates.<eos> I was Yellowbeard and he was...<eos> He was Redbeard.<eos> You were inseparable.
No one.<eos> No one.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, let's play.<eos> Hello, are you there?
Yeah.<eos> I think you better get 'round here.<eos> P.S.<eos> I know you two.<eos> And if I'm gone, I know what you could become.
I think you better get 'round here.<eos> P.S.<eos> I know you two.<eos> And if I'm gone, I know what you could become.<eos> Because I know who you really are.
Because I know who you really are.<eos> A junkie who solves crimes to get high.<eos> And the doctor who never came home from the war.<eos> Will you listen to me?<eos> Who you really are, it doesn't matter.
Show Mommy your teeth.<eos> It was just the three of us.<eos> The Templetons.<eos> And three is the perfect number.<eos> Interesting fact... did you know that the triangle is the strongest shape found in nature?
No, I can handle him.<eos> I know how important this mission is to the company.<eos> Mission?<eos> Well, trust me, ma'am.<eos> You got the right baby for this job.
That's awful!<eos> Bad news, baby!<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> My job is to find out exactly what that new puppy is... so that Baby Corp can stop it.<eos> And you're going to help me.
Fantastic.<eos> Triplets, go!<eos> A. B.<eos> C. D.<eos> No, what have you learned about the new puppy?
Weeks!<eos> Three weeks!<eos> For three... evers!<eos> Grounded?<eos> You're gonna stay in this house with your baby brother... until you learn to get along.
Yep.<eos> My Dad says, "Those who can, do."<eos> "And those who can't, supervise."<eos> Your father is a hippy.<eos> What happens when you grow up?
What?<eos> What the...?<eos> Thanks for dropping in, kids.<eos> Francis Francis?<eos> I see you've met my big brother, Eugene.
Can you put your head back on, please?<eos> What is all this?<eos> Surprise!<eos> A Baby Corp binky?<eos> Where did you get that?
You don't recognize me?<eos> Perhaps from my youth!<eos> Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby?<eos> He is him?<eos> And him is you?
And him is you?<eos> Except older and wrinklier.<eos> That's not right.<eos> No.<eos> You were my hero!
Except older and wrinklier.<eos> That's not right.<eos> No.<eos> You were my hero!<eos> How did you end up here?
No!<eos> You brought me the very thing I needed to destroy Baby Corp.<eos> No!<eos> Yes!<eos> You walked right into my trap!
You'll never get away with this!<eos> Yeah, not if we...<eos> What?<eos> Tell?<eos> Who are you gonna tell, Tim?
Oh, no.<eos> Don't be nervous, buddy.<eos> It's only overnight.<eos> We'll be back before you know it.<eos> Besides, you boys are in great hands.
Now, ladies, the secret to deep fried butter... is a healthy dab of margarine.<eos> Hey, Mr. Lady Man!<eos> The baby.<eos> I think he's sick!<eos> You gotta do something!
My parents always hold my hand during takeoff.<eos> Boy, the stocks are crazy today.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Ross again.<eos> As you can see, I've switched off the seat belt sign.<eos> What are you two boys doing up here?
Argh!<eos> That's great!<eos> Thanks!<eos> I just went with the flow.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, and those in coach... on the left side of the plane... you can see we're approaching fabulous Las Vegas.
Right.<eos> Excuse me, ladies.<eos> Can we get a ride home?<eos> Jimmy's been sick, and he needs his expensive medicine.<eos> Where do you live, sweetie?
Tim, there they are!<eos> Mom, Dad!<eos> Imagine a puppy that never grows up... never gets old.<eos> A puppy that stays a puppy forever.<eos> I give you the only thing you'll ever love... the Forever Puppy!
We won?<eos> We won, we won, we won!<eos> We won! Yes!<eos> Victory nap!<eos> You ruined everything!
You ruined everything!<eos> It's not fair!<eos> It's not fair!<eos> That's not right.<eos> Now you're really going to pay!
That's a terrible idea!<eos> That's the attitude.<eos> You're so right!<eos> You've got it, sir!<eos> You're the man!
Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.<eos> Impeccable, both physically and mentally.<eos> We control the DNA of our progeny... germinating them in birthing pods.<eos> I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.<eos> Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson... in the archaic ways of our ancestors.
Yes!<eos> Look at this!<eos> Where is the other half of our ship?<eos> My ship.<eos> Either one of you could have gotten us through that field... had you flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs!
Yondu was the guy who abducted me... kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight... and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.<eos> - Eat you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, that son of a bitch.<eos> How'd you locate us now?
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!<eos> The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.<eos> That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!
I don't know where I came from exactly.<eos> First thing I remember is flickering... adrift in the cosmos utterly... and entirely alone.<eos> Over millions of years... I learned to control the molecules around me.<eos> I grew smarter and stronger.<eos> And I continued building from there... layer by layer... the very planet you walk on now.
I desired... meaning.<eos> "There must be some life out there in the universe... "besides just me," I thought.<eos> And so, I set myself the task of finding it.<eos> I created... what I imagined biological life to be like... down to the most minute detail.<eos> Did you make a penis?
Why?<eos> My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> You Earthers have hang-ups.
If you loved her, why did you leave her?<eos> This is mutiny!<eos> This is mutiny!<eos> This is mutiny!<eos> You're scum!
Listen!<eos> Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.<eos> I should have told you earlier.<eos> I'm stupid.<eos> You are in danger.
Ego will have won him to his side by now.<eos> - Then we just go.<eos> - No! - He's our friend.<eos> - All any of you do... is yell at each other.<eos> You are not friends.
But today, I reclaim this space... to tell you a beautiful story.<eos> Now the rotten CEOs are gone.<eos> It's Mirando's new era with me, and with new core values, environment and life.<eos> Awesome.<eos> You're much more fun than the last chief executive.
He's the "very healthy" guy!<eos> All the other super pigs were on flat land, accessible by car.<eos> Japan's one was five minutes from the airport.<eos> And you...<eos> I notice that you had to leave the fucking mountaintop super pig till the end, because you knew that the climb would rile me.
This year, I travelled...<eos> - What's he saying?<eos> - Dunno.<eos> One of those 26 farms to decide who will be invited to the Best Super Pig Fest in New York City, where it will be unveiled to the world.<eos> You've done an incredible job.
They fucked, not me.<eos> They fucked up.<eos> I know what they're calling me, those A.L.F. fuckers.<eos> They're calling me a psychopath.<eos> You're not a psychopath.
Fuck, yeah.<eos> That was the best I've ever had.<eos> The best of the best.<eos> Today Mirando presents to you our super gourmet sausage.<eos> Juicy like you've never tasted before.
- No!<eos> Who's ready?<eos> Ten years ago, twenty-six farmers from lands far away were each given a magical super piglet.<eos> This year, I met these wonderful people, to decide which super piglet would have the honor of being invited to this prestigious occasion.<eos> Are you ready to meet the winner of this contest?
Are you ready to meet the winner of this contest?<eos> Yeah!<eos> The best super pig on the face of the earth?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Are you ready?
Hello, Lucy!<eos> Lucy, we love you!<eos> No.<eos> I'm here to introduce you to a real superstar.<eos> Maybe you've already seen her on YouTube, enjoying her little shopping spree on that... in that underground mall in Seoul!
Uh, wait a sec...<eos> Where's Old Black Man?<eos> Oh, my God. He's gone.<eos> What the hell? What?<eos> Uh... guys? You're gonna want to see this.
♪ Let's draw good conclusions ♪<eos> ♪ Let's make a better guess ♪<eos> ♪ Let's hope we learned our lesson ♪<eos> ♪ And just pray for the best. ♪<eos> Well, Reverend, I see that you and the deacon are praying.
- Carl.<eos> - Ruth.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Looking for you.<eos> Children, did you find him?
It's morning. You know the routine.<eos> Go home.<eos> Or wherever the hell it is you go during the day.<eos> I had the craziest dream.<eos> You were there.
Go home.<eos> Or wherever the hell it is you go during the day.<eos> I had the craziest dream.<eos> You were there.<eos> You were there.
You all were singing.<eos> All right, well, that's great.<eos> We don't give a shit, 'cause we don't like hearing about people's dreams.<eos> Yeah, let's go, chop-chop.<eos> Come on. Does this mean you didn't learn your lesson?
No... My address?<eos> III don't know.<eos> Um, my goodness.<eos> Um, yes, I know this.<eos> You know, I know this.
He's our maintenance man.<eos> But I saw him out back a little while ago.<eos> Harvey?<eos> Harvey, you son of a bitch!<eos> Are you Hank?
Who's Chip?<eos> That's Barney's brother.<eos> We need a key from Chip.<eos> I was just on my way, but h...<eos> How did you know?
I'll bring the coffee and the doughnuts.<eos> Okay, Deputy Chief Hawk.<eos> Dave?<eos> Don Harrison, State Police, Rapid City.<eos> Are you taking this case?
How long's he been in there?<eos> About half an hour.<eos> That's enough.<eos> You sure you don't want to take this?<eos> Mike said you're fishing buddies.
I never have.<eos> II... I've... I've never...<eos> I've never been there.<eos> Could... could you please tell me what this is about?<eos> Did you get the warrant?
Mr. Todd?<eos> Yes, Roger?<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Why do you let him make you... do these things?
It's maybe a $6 or $8 cab ride.<eos> Cab ride.<eos> Something must have happened, right, Dougie?<eos> There's a whole line of cabs right out front.<eos> Are you okay?
Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me. Sir?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can you, please come with me?
Hi.<eos> Can you, please come with me?<eos> We'll go this way.<eos> Come on.<eos> You weren't going to leave without your winnings, were you, sir?
A little companionship?<eos> On the house.<eos> Think of us as a home away from home.<eos> Home.<eos> And do you live around here?
What's your name, sir?<eos> Dougie Jones.<eos> Limo for Mr. Jones.<eos> Smithie, bring a limo around front, please.<eos> But you have to promise me something.
That's right.<eos> We're watching you,<eos> Mr... Jones.<eos> We're on Lancelot Court.<eos> You don't know your address?
So I had a man out here recently to look at the furnace, and, Sheriff Truman, he wouldn't answer any of my questions about what happens when no one's here.<eos> We come in early, and the heat is still on.<eos> What if we came in even earlier?<eos> Would the heat still be on then?<eos> Are you next to a loud stream, Sheriff Truman? You're breaking up.

What if we came in even earlier?<eos> Would the heat still be on then?<eos> Are you next to a loud stream, Sheriff Truman? You're breaking up.<eos> Are you still fishing?<eos> Are you next to a really loud stream?
Are you next to a loud stream, Sheriff Truman? You're breaking up.<eos> Are you still fishing?<eos> Are you next to a really loud stream?<eos> You're breaking up, Sheriff.<eos> Well, II hope we can get this sorted out when you get back to the office, but right now, it's very comfortable in here.
Well, II hope we can get this sorted out when you get back to the office, but right now, it's very comfortable in here.<eos> I have to go, Sheriff Truman, because there are some people coming in through the front door.<eos> Lucy.<eos> Lucy.<eos> You were on the phone with her again, weren't you?
I couldn't stand out in the parking lot all night.<eos> I hate cellular phones.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> Lucy, hang up the phone.<eos> But you're in the mountains... fishing!
We're so excited.<eos> He came in unannounced.<eos> Good to see you again, Wally.<eos> It's good to see you, too, Sheriff Truman.<eos> As you know, your brother, Harry S. Truman, is my godfather.
And rest assured that we are working to bring you back home for our talk.<eos> I've never really left home, Gordon.<eos> See you soon, old friend.<eos> We can hold him for two more days without filing any charges.<eos> I assume you haven't given him his phone call.
See you soon, old friend.<eos> We can hold him for two more days without filing any charges.<eos> I assume you haven't given him his phone call.<eos> No, we haven't.<eos> Warden Murphy, I suggest you give him his private phone call, and I expect to hear all about it.
Broke it.<eos> Sure did, pal.<eos> Hello!<eos> Mega, mega jackpot.<eos> Congratulations, sir. You are a mega winner.
Sure did, pal.<eos> Hello!<eos> Mega, mega jackpot.<eos> Congratulations, sir. You are a mega winner.<eos> You've just won two mega jackpots for a total of $28,400.
And now food is coming.<eos> You're still with me.<eos> That's good.<eos> Could you send in Steven, please?<eos> Sir, you wanted to see me?
Sit down.<eos> Okay.<eos> Great.<eos> Yeah, well, not great.<eos> You think you're some sort of hotshot?
Great.<eos> Yeah, well, not great.<eos> You think you're some sort of hotshot?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This résumé is one of the worst written I've ever seen, and you didn't even fill out this form properly.
This résumé is one of the worst written I've ever seen, and you didn't even fill out this form properly.<eos> Not even close.<eos> It's incomplete.<eos> It's worse than sloppy.<eos> I wanted to see you to tell you that if you ever want to find work anyplace, then you better get your act together, do things properly, and start showing some respect for a possible future employer,
Now, you can get up and get your ass out of here.<eos> What an asshole.<eos> That's rough.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When do you get those tests back?
Your wife is here.<eos> She went to your office, and you weren't there.<eos> I could have told her that.<eos> Hold on a minute.<eos> She is now walking to Deputy Chief Hawk's office, where you are.
Hey, thanks for coming in.<eos> I hope everything's okay.<eos> Yeah, no problem.<eos> Coffee?<eos> You all right?
Fuck that acai berry shit from the Amazon.<eos> In the immortal words of Pete Seeger, if I had a hammer...<eos> Guess what.<eos> I've got a hammer.<eos> You must see, hear, understand, and act.
That's right.<eos> Only $29.99 plus shipping.<eos> Accept no substitute.<eos> Get yours now.<eos> You can go in now.
And where'd this one come from?<eos> Police.<eos> Buckhorn, South Dakota.<eos> Another wild-goose chase, I bet, but we got to check it out.<eos> You ever been to South Dakota, Cindy?
There are three tracking devices on this car.<eos> Get up close behind that truck.<eos> That should do it.<eos> I hope you're not sore at me for running off.
Ray.<eos> I want that information.<eos> Yes?<eos> Looks like you're out half a million.<eos> Well, I think you're wrong about that.
Don't touch the badge.<eos> Manzella.<eos> Manzella Court?<eos> Red door.<eos> Have you been drinking, sir?
Fifty thousand.<eos> A... and how's he supposed to get that?<eos> Who can get that kind of money?<eos> And what if he doesn't have it?<eos> What are you gonna do then?
Meter's still running.<eos> It's up to 52.<eos> So let me get this straight. People were playing games.<eos> He made a bet where he lost $20,000.<eos> But you want him to pay you back $52,000?
And we are certainly not gonna be shit on by the likes of you.<eos> Nevertheless, lady...<eos> So here's what we're gonna do.<eos> Without my knowledge, my husband came to you for a loan of $20,000.<eos> You were nice enough to give it to him.
gonna give to you right now, $25,000.<eos> That is my first, last, and only offer to you.<eos> What kind of world are we living in where people can behave like this?<eos> Treat other people this way without any compassion or feeling for their suffering?<eos> We are living in a dark, dark age, and you are part of the problem.
And he left town soon after.<eos> Who else saw him that day?<eos> Well, like I said, Doc Hayward, but I don't know who else.<eos> Let's bring Harry up to speed, see what he thinks.<eos> Can you get him for me?
- I know it's my truck.<eos> I can't talk to you about this here.<eos> I told you.<eos> Please go away.<eos> But if you weren't driving, I need to know who was.
There you are, Doc.<eos> What's this all about?<eos> Doc, do you remember way back when, the night Harry called you in to examine Special Agent Dale Cooper at the Great Northern?<eos> I can't remember what I had for breakfast this morning, but I remember that.<eos> Tell me what you remember.
It's good to meet you.<eos> Detective.<eos> Thanks for seeing me.<eos> This shouldn't take long.<eos> You submitted a set of fingerprints a few days ago to our database, and we need to verify the source.
You submitted a set of fingerprints a few days ago to our database, and we need to verify the source.<eos> Well, I can show them to you, but our search was blocked.<eos> That must have been from your end?<eos> I'd like to see the prints, please.<eos> Where did you lift them from... A crime scene?
How old was this man?<eos> Late 40s.<eos> When did this man die?<eos> Within the last five or six days.<eos> You're sure this is the body you took those prints from?
Lieutenant Knox, sir.<eos> It's not just prints this time.<eos> It's a body.<eos> It's him.<eos> You're sure?
I've turned off the security cameras.<eos> We can speak freely... and privately.<eos> The dog leg.<eos> That dog had four legs.<eos> One you found in my trunk.
We can speak freely... and privately.<eos> The dog leg.<eos> That dog had four legs.<eos> One you found in my trunk.<eos> The other three went out with the information you're thinking about right now.
The dog leg.<eos> That dog had four legs.<eos> One you found in my trunk.<eos> The other three went out with the information you're thinking about right now.<eos> Two people you don't want coming around here if anything bad happens to me.
One a.m. tonight.<eos> Smooth and safe.<eos> And if your mind should wander to a place where I might not make it out of here alive, remember the dog legs.<eos> I'm not interested in you.<eos> You'll never see me again, and no one will ever hear anything more about Joe McCluskey or your late Mr. Strawberry.
And if your mind should wander to a place where I might not make it out of here alive, remember the dog legs.<eos> I'm not interested in you.<eos> You'll never see me again, and no one will ever hear anything more about Joe McCluskey or your late Mr. Strawberry.<eos> Is there a reason you're not talking to me, Dougie?<eos> What were you and Bushnell discussing earlier?
Mr. Jones?<eos> Detectives Fusco.<eos> Badge.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Who are you, ma'am?
He doesn't know where his car is.<eos> Was it stolen?<eos> Dougie, was your car stolen?<eos> Stolen.<eos> Did you report it stolen, sir?
Dougie, was your car stolen?<eos> Stolen.<eos> Did you report it stolen, sir?<eos> Sir.<eos> Did you report your car as a stolen vehicle?
Well, I guess this is as good a time as any.<eos> He doesn't know where the car is.<eos> He hasn't seen it in a few days, so, yes, there's a very strong possibility that it was stolen.<eos> Stolen.<eos> All right, then, Mr. Jones, where did you last leave your car?
He hasn't seen it in a few days, so, yes, there's a very strong possibility that it was stolen.<eos> Stolen.<eos> All right, then, Mr. Jones, where did you last leave your car?<eos> Well, if we knew that, we'd know where to find it, wouldn't we?<eos> Okay, can you describe your vehicle, please?
Dougie?<eos> Dougie.<eos> A few days ago.<eos> Few... days ago.<eos> Is there a reason why you didn't report your car missing?
Is there a reason why you didn't report your car missing?<eos> Reason?<eos> Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.<eos> There's more to life than cars.<eos> Too many cars, too much going on, and Dougie's been under a lot of stress lately, and if you want to know the truth, so have I.
Reason?<eos> Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.<eos> There's more to life than cars.<eos> Too many cars, too much going on, and Dougie's been under a lot of stress lately, and if you want to know the truth, so have I.<eos> Officers, have you found the car?
Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.<eos> There's more to life than cars.<eos> Too many cars, too much going on, and Dougie's been under a lot of stress lately, and if you want to know the truth, so have I.<eos> Officers, have you found the car?<eos> Who are you, sir?
Who are you, sir?<eos> He owns this place.<eos> Bushnell Mullins.<eos> Dougie works for me.<eos> You did find his car, didn't you?
You did find his car, didn't you?<eos> The car has been found.<eos> It was involved in an apparent explosion.<eos> Multiple fatalities.<eos> Why didn't you tell us that to begin with?
Multiple fatalities.<eos> Why didn't you tell us that to begin with?<eos> The deceased individuals had ties to a gang associated with multiple car thefts.<eos> Well, there's your answer.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, our son's home alone waiting for his supper, and in case you think we're neglecting him, he's being watched by our neighbor as a favor, and we'd like to go.
Evening.<eos> Well...<eos> I guess he won't have any trouble collecting the insurance, huh?<eos> I have some questions about those files you covered for me, Dougie.<eos> But you go ahead.
The main road is that way.<eos> He ever give any problems?<eos> No, I never had any trouble with Dougie at all.<eos> He's a... solid citizen.<eos> So you can't think of any reason why someone would try to kill him.
Little more emphasis on the "slow."<eos> Dougie had a car accident, as I recall, not long before he came to work for me.<eos> Every once in a while, he shows some lingering effects.<eos> His wife can talk to that better than I can.<eos> Well... we appreciate you coming down, Bushnell.
Sorry.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Could you get the door?
William Hastings.<eos> I'm 43.<eos> Mr. Hastings, are you the author of an online journal or blog entitled The Search for the Zone?<eos> Uh-huh. Yes.<eos> What sort of things do you write about?
Mr. Hastings, are you the author of an online journal or blog entitled The Search for the Zone?<eos> Uh-huh. Yes.<eos> What sort of things do you write about?<eos> Different things.<eos> Approximately two weeks ago, did you write an entry about encountering what you described as an alternate reality?
Approximately two weeks ago, did you write an entry about encountering what you described as an alternate reality?<eos> A different dimension.<eos> Yes, but it's real.<eos> It's all real.<eos> How long have you been interested in this subject, Mr. Hastings? Many years.
It's all real.<eos> How long have you been interested in this subject, Mr. Hastings? Many years.<eos> I do...<eos> I do a lot of reading.<eos> But this time, you wrote that you actually found and entered such a place. Yes.
How long have you been interested in this subject, Mr. Hastings? Many years.<eos> I do...<eos> I do a lot of reading.<eos> But this time, you wrote that you actually found and entered such a place. Yes.<eos> And that while in this place, you wrote, and I quote,
Yes.<eos> You see, Ruth was very good at... uncovering hidden records.<eos> And she had indications that if we went to a certain place at a certain time, we would enter the dimension and make contact with a certain person.<eos> And so we went there.<eos> And that's where you found the Major.
What's your wife's name?"<eos> "Phyllis," I said.<eos> I didn't kill Ruth.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> You... you have to believe me.
This is all my fault.<eos> It never should have happened.<eos> William, are any of these six photographs I'm showing you the man you call the Major?<eos> That's the Major.<eos> Draw a circle around the photo of the man you call the Major.
It was something like no one has ever seen before.<eos> I've never seen anything like it. I...<eos> I've never... I've...<eos> I've never read anything like it.<eos> You don't know.
Otherworldly.<eos> Beverly.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I don't know why it is.<eos> You're a good man, Ben.
What are we gonna do, sir?<eos> The only thing we ever do.<eos> Flip the switch to the Bat-Signal!<eos> Flip!<eos> Commissioner, are you there?
Talk us through it.<eos> Well, I don't wanna scare any small children who may be listening, but it's a little-known fact that Gotham City is built on a bunch of flimsy plates stuck together.<eos> There's literally nothing beneath us, except an infinite abyss that smells like dirty underwear.<eos> If Joker's bomb were to go off, these plates would break apart, plunging every Gotham citizen into the eternal abyss forever.<eos> And you wouldn't want that, now would you?
And you wouldn't want that, now would you?<eos> Now get me the mayor!<eos> Joker out!<eos> Madam Mayor, I cannot ask you to do this!<eos> - Jim, did you find Batman?
Batman jam! ♪<eos> ♪ Batman! ♪<eos> ♪ You think my muscles are big?<eos> Thank you.<eos> ♪ You haven't seen my brain ♪
Hey, Dad.<eos> I saved the city again today.<eos> I wish you could have seen me.<eos> I think you would have been really proud.<eos> There you are!
24/7, 365, at a million percent.<eos> And if you think that there's something behind that, then you're crazy.<eos> Good night, Alfred.<eos> Sir, it's morning.<eos> Master Bruce, you live on an island, figuratively and literally.
No, no, no!<eos> You could even make some new friends.<eos> No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No!<eos> And before you go, we can do your favorite thing.
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No!<eos> And before you go, we can do your favorite thing.<eos> Tuxedo dress-up party.<eos> Sir, aren't you forgetting something?
- Indubitably.<eos> Good. Must be nice to be happy.<eos> Tonight, on Metropolis in Focus, we have our favorite star, Superman!<eos> What up, Gotham!<eos> Superman, tell me. How do you feel about your recent banishment of Zod to the Phantom Zone?
You can't prove it, you didn't do it.<eos> Mr. Wayne, so great to see you!<eos> Come and join us!<eos> Mr. Prime Minister.<eos> Did you have some work done?
Mr. Wayne?<eos> Should I get experimental surgery to make my eyes larger and more vulnerable-looking?<eos> Uh, do that.<eos> Uh, Mr. Wayne?<eos> Are you currently in the market to adopt a child?
Close-up street magic à la David Blaine?<eos> - All of it sounds great.<eos> - Really?<eos> Because all of it sounds like me.<eos> Mr. Wayne, do you think you'd be interested in adopting me as your future orphan son?
Whoo! Let's hear it for Batman!<eos> Who I wish was here right now.<eos> Oh, I'm sure he's listening.<eos> I'd like to ask all of you a question.<eos> Are you fed up with crime?
- That's me right there.<eos> - I know who you are, Mr. Wayne.<eos> You bet you do.<eos> Quick quest, what is your problem with Batman, and also, what the heck, dude?<eos> I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wayne.
This is a great first day.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Question for Batman.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> What are you gonna do with the rest of your life?
What are you gonna do with the rest of your life?<eos> What do you mean, the rest of my life?<eos> We don't need a vigilante crime fighter now that there's no more crime.<eos> Uh, yes, you do.<eos> You can spend some quality time with your family.
No more crime! No more crime! No more crime!<eos> No more crime! No more crime! No more crime!<eos> No more crime! No more crime! No more crime!<eos> Is everything okay, sir?<eos> You've barely touched your lobster thermidor.
Not right now, I don't.<eos> And it starts by raising your son.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I literally have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The young orphan you adopted at the gala.
Rip!<eos> That's better!<eos> Now I'm free, now I'm moving. Come on, Batman. Let's get grooving!<eos> I can only look you in the eyes right now.<eos> - Sir, what are you doing?
Uh, no, I would crush you.<eos> Sure, sure, sure.<eos> Hey, listen. Thank me later, but I just happened to be in the hood. And I figured that you could probably use the...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Are you having the "57th Annual Justice League Anniversary Party"
No.<eos> You're going down!<eos> Look out!<eos> Smash!<eos> I guess you're right.
Me.<eos> Oh, I wanna help, too!<eos> - And I shall join as well. - Whoa!<eos> Alfred Pennyworth at your service, ma'am.<eos> - How did you...
Come on, Master Dick. We need to help him.<eos> I'm with you, Grandpa!<eos> Get off my Padre!<eos> Unhand him, you animatronic fiends.<eos> What are you two doing here?
Batman, you're on a timeout.<eos> What?<eos> Alfred, you better un-timeout me right now!<eos> No.<eos> Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.
What?<eos> Alfred, you better un-timeout me right now!<eos> No.<eos> Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.<eos> Guys, you're all un-timeouted!
I'm sorry, that's not possible.<eos> I'm Danny Rand.<eos> The son of Wendell Rand.<eos> I've, uh, been away a long time.<eos> And you're here to see Harold Meachum?
Welcome to Rand Enterprises.<eos> Touch the interactive screen<eos> - to access the company directory.<eos> - Whoa. This is new.<eos> - You don't belong here.
- Come on.<eos> - No.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Who are you?
Excuse me!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where's Harold?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who are you?
Ward?<eos> Joy?<eos> It's Danny.<eos> Danny Rand.<eos> How did you get up here?
How did you get up here?<eos> The elevator.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I came to see your father.<eos> Look, but I think you're in the wrong place.
We can talk about this.<eos> Stage Deli's been closed for years.<eos> It... it doesn't matter where we go, okay?<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> You are absolutely insane if you think I'm gonna sit down and have a cup of tea with you.
Blindsided our guards in the lobby.<eos> - I'm calling the police.<eos> - No.<eos> If he gets arrested, he'll be out again in a few hours.<eos> If you set foot in this building again, our guards will take it as a personal threat and will respond with whatever means necessary.
I'm okay.<eos> Yeah, I... I'm good.<eos> I don't give a shit what you are.<eos> You know, you...<eos> you remind me of Billy.
Okay.<eos> Oh, hey, come on.<eos> I promise, I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I know you're not.<eos> I'm texting my driver right now, which means he's going to be pulling around the corner any second and if you're still with me when he gets here,
Yes, it is.<eos> I can only wonder what it's like inside that crazy little head of yours.<eos> You wanna know what it's like? Hmm?<eos> It feels like this...<eos> When you're a ten-year-old boy and you watch your mother die... and you know you and your father are next, it feels like this!
Pass them around, invite your friends to take a class.<eos> We need more students here.<eos> Oh, also...<eos> Thursday nights will be closed for AA meetings.<eos> They pay more than you do.
Please go.<eos> I apologize for any inconvenience.<eos> Hey!<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're the security guard from Rand.
I apologize for any inconvenience.<eos> Hey!<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're the security guard from Rand.<eos> Why are you...
How the hell are we supposed to deal with this guy if we don't know anything about him?<eos> Hey... listen up.<eos> The first rule of war and business is to know your enemy.<eos> Yes, you've told me that, but in this case...<eos> Have you considered this might be someone hired to make us look bad at a time we don't wanna look bad?
I was trying to focus my chi so I could get myself out of here.<eos> How'd it work?<eos> It didn't.<eos> It's the drugs.<eos> You need to let me out of here.
How's that?<eos> Keep practicing your kata.<eos> At least an hour a day.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you Colleen Wing?
I'm sorry to intrude.<eos> My name is Ward Meachum.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> this is rather awkward.<eos> I'm wondering if you've had any contact with a man who's going by the name Danny?
What can I do for you?<eos> this is rather awkward.<eos> I'm wondering if you've had any contact with a man who's going by the name Danny?<eos> homeless... no shoes?<eos> Why do you ask?
He actually held a gun to my head.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> Honestly...<eos> I think he has some serious mental problems.<eos> so how did you find me? note anyone that he might be in contact with.
so how did you find me? note anyone that he might be in contact with.<eos> Your name was on the list.<eos> look...<eos> I don't know the guy.<eos> But you've met him?
But you've met him?<eos> He came around here once.<eos> Did he... hurt you... in any way?<eos> That'd be a mistake.<eos> It would be very helpful for us if you would be willing to sign some papers that would attest that you felt threatened by him.
Threatened?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Look... it's for his own protection as well.<eos> The man needs help.<eos> I think Rand would be happy to set up a... neighborhood improvement donation... to be spent however you choose.
How about this?<eos> simply say the man... acted unusually... made you feel uncomfortable.<eos> I just don't think...<eos> I'll give you some time to think about it.<eos> You'd be doing us a great favor.
John Anderson.<eos> That's your name.<eos> You are not Danny Rand.<eos> I am Danny Rand.<eos> I don't care what you think!
But now...<eos> I don't apologize for anything.<eos> get the car ready tonight.<eos> the thing with the four wheels.<eos> it's just... you never leave the penthouse.
This is Dr. Paul Edmonds from the Birch Psychiatric Hospital.<eos> I'm treating the patient your family admitted.<eos> how can I help you?<eos> I'm wondering if I can ask you an odd question.<eos> okay. you did a commercial for Rand?
Anything else stick out about that day?<eos> They put me in a stupid dress.<eos> It was cold out.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you do anything afterwards?
Did you do anything afterwards?<eos> yeah.<eos> The circus.<eos> we all went to the circus afterwards.<eos> You're sure?
He was always jumping around.<eos> thank you.<eos> That's it?<eos> it was... it was an odd question.<eos> Why do you ask?
it was... it was an odd question.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm afraid I can't really say.<eos> Patient confidentiality.<eos> now you have me curious.
Hi.<eos> Me again. but I was hoping we could make a trade.<eos> yeah?<eos> What kind of trade?<eos> If you sign these... then...
What kind of trade?<eos> If you sign these... then...<eos> I will leave you this.<eos> 000?<eos> - You could do a lot with that.
I... I... I don't think I understand.<eos> I'm gonna suggest that you have an anxiety disorder with psychotic features. because now it means we can make a plan for treatment.<eos> I don't want to make any false predictions.<eos> This... this will take time.<eos> you need to let me out of here.
I'm happy for you to convince me.<eos> Do... do you want to show me the Iron Fist?<eos> Let's see how it works.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not... not until you take me off these drugs.
Danny, what happened to you?<eos> Why are you back here?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> And every time I try and tell the story, people freak out.<eos> But you and Ward, you're the only link to a life that I had.
I thought you understood.<eos> I have to live in the real world, Danny.<eos> This is how it works!<eos> I've been meaning to ask... what's this?<eos> You should see the other guy.
- Come on, sensei.<eos> I got my moms and two brothers.<eos> You think I could cover that with what I make pushing a broom?<eos> I get it, but those private fights are illegal.<eos> All the shit I could've got into, you want to bust me for making a dollar fighting?
You dishonor yourself when you fight for money.<eos> There's more at stake here than just your bills.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you the one who takes care of these?
I...<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> There are discussions about your loyalty.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm doing everything you ask.
Enough!<eos> The dojo is a place of respect.<eos> And who the hell are you?<eos> Maybe you wanna test me and find out.<eos> You chatter like monkeys.
Something you might have missed?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, uh... can you help me?
We don't want you here.<eos> Danny, listen... we can work this out, okay?<eos> I have Hogarth now.<eos> We're coming for you.<eos> You can't deny what's mine.
How about some respect?<eos> Well done!<eos> Now, I told you it was gonna be a great night, didn't I?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Well, I hope you didn't lose your money on that one.
I thought so.<eos> But since the time of your last offer, we have had a change of heart as well.<eos> We are still insisting on the full rights guaranteed as the sole heir of Rand, which includes a controlling 51%, board seat and compensation, but we are now adding a corner office, support staff, and a housing allowance in the amount of one million per year.<eos> Your sense of humor has always been your best attribute, but come on.<eos> You can't even prove he's who he says he is.
You can't even prove he's who he says he is.<eos> At best he's crazy, at worst he's a con man.<eos> Take the offer and be thankful that we don't sue you.<eos> Ward...<eos> I'm glad you mentioned my sense of humor.
How did they get this?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Did you steal it?<eos> That is immaterial.<eos> You know that it will hold up in court.
Now, watch this.<eos> Boom!<eos> - Sensei Wing knocked the shit out of him!<eos> - Right.<eos> You know the rules about cell phones in my dojo.
You know the rules about cell phones in my dojo.<eos> Line up.<eos> Make seiza.<eos> Darryl.<eos> I'm sorry, Sensei, but they never get to see you go all out.
I'm sorry, Sensei, but they never get to see you go all out.<eos> No, it's me that needs to be sorry.<eos> I'm a hypocrite, and I shouldn't have gone there.<eos> I don't need an apology.<eos> What you did was awesome.
I don't need an apology.<eos> What you did was awesome.<eos> I posted it online.<eos> You what?<eos> People gotta see what a badass you are and come for lessons.
What is it?<eos> Leishmaniasis.<eos> If left untreated, latest numbers show roughly 50,000 a year.<eos> And we have the cure?<eos> We can save lives at five bucks a pill, but you wanna raise the price?
These monks you hung with.<eos> They were, like, real deal, robe-wearing Shaolin-type bald monks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Huh. - Pretty old school.<eos> So you were running around the mountains wearing robes.
That's the best you've got?<eos> Really?<eos> This guy's twice your weight.<eos> How about you add another fighter?<eos> And when I win, you double my payday.
How about you add another fighter?<eos> And when I win, you double my payday.<eos> You are one crazy chick, you know that?<eos> But I like you.<eos> You ready for the fight of your life?
But I like you.<eos> You ready for the fight of your life?<eos> You better be!<eos> Hey!<eos> You better be!
- Okay.<eos> - We have to call the police.<eos> - I know where they're going.<eos> - What?<eos> You have no idea how bad it is.
So we're in our pricing-strategy meeting, getting ready to boost the price, make a huge profit, and be able to fund years' worth of new lab research.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - In walks Danny, and he uses the full weight of his majority shareholdings to force us to sell the drug at cost.<eos> At cost.<eos> - You're kidding me.
- Mmm-mmm.<eos> That is a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars.<eos> He is worse than these bleeding-heart-liberal-trust-fund hipsters wandering around Williamsburg.<eos> Uh, thanks for the interview.<eos> What, you're leaving so soon?
We had a deal with the previous tenant.<eos> Joy Meachum broke that deal.<eos> We wanted words with her.<eos> No.<eos> You wanted to kidnap Joy to broker a new deal.
For a ride.<eos> Okay, exhale.<eos> - Better. - Yeah.<eos> - Feel good? - Yeah.<eos> - I heard you and Danny grew up together. - Yeah.
I wanna tell you about this great new product.<eos> It will only take a minute.<eos> I guarantee you've never seen anything like this.
With a revolutionary, synthesized opiate offering security and versatility.<eos> Pills, patch, powder, drops.<eos> It's 100% pure... 100% of the time.<eos> Boasting a faster absorption rate, a slower metabolic rate... and the most exciting part, the CP450 liver enzyme inhibitor. Which prevents the human body from ever building a tolerance to it.<eos> So, as you can see...
So with the right supplies, any amount can be made in a real lab.<eos> Whoever the Einstein is behind this made sure there'd be no limit to how much one can make.<eos> A drug like this could mean a major epidemic in this city.<eos> I'm gonna deal with this.<eos> - Wow. How are you...
- Wow. How are you...<eos> - Hey.<eos> Thank you so much for your help, Sandi.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Inside, you'll find all the reports from federal, state, and local agencies.
Thank you so much for your help, Sandi.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Inside, you'll find all the reports from federal, state, and local agencies.<eos> Our chemical plant on Staten Island has passed every onsite inspection.<eos> I have 15 documented cancer diagnoses that say you're wrong.
I have 15 documented cancer diagnoses that say you're wrong.<eos> I acknowledge how terribly unfortunate this is, but Rand Enterprises had nothing to do with it.<eos> So it's just a coincidence that all the victims live within a one-mile radius of your facility?<eos> We have been compliant with every applicable environmental law and regulation.<eos> I'm afraid you're looking for something that isn't there.
- No.<eos> But if you like, I can call Sarah Galvin in Transport and have her bring that information to you.<eos> I'm on my way down now, anyway.<eos> She's right off the elevator on the fourth floor.<eos> I'll let her know you're coming.
That's the last thing a control freak wants to hear.<eos> I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> I read about that drug thing you did in the paper.
He got it from the Rand chemical plant near where we live.<eos> It's spewing poison into the air, the ground, all around us.<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> I...<eos> - You're different than the others.
Sorry.<eos> I'm in the middle of a lesson.<eos> - Claire Temple.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How do you know each other?
I've never had takeout like this before.<eos> - Oh, the thing is, it's...<eos> - A great idea.<eos> It's a really, really good idea.<eos> You're different than the others.
- Is he shot?<eos> - He's been stabbed.<eos> We need to get him to a hospital.<eos> Jump in.<eos> You don't understand.
They have her.<eos> Who has her?<eos> The Hand.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.
is if he continues to decline, there'll be nobody for his daughter to come back to.<eos> If I go to the hospital, I'll be arrested.<eos> And they will kill Sabina.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> - You have no idea what they're capable of.
- Did you empty my trash can?<eos> - Maintenance came by early today.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I... I didn't ask.<eos> Do you want me to...
- Three or four pills, huh?<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> What?<eos> Do you want the whole thing?<eos> Look, you can leave right now, or I can call security.
Are you willing to kill Danny Rand so that the Iron Fist might live?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> When does the real warrior get here?<eos> These childish insults are getting tiring.<eos> It's like you all trained on the same playground.
I withdraw.<eos> I never believed I would meet another Iron Fist in my lifetime.<eos> I had hoped.<eos> But why are you in New York?<eos> Who are you?
It seems you haven't come to destroy us, so I'm curious.<eos> Answer my question.<eos> I am Madame Gao.<eos> Do you remember the katsura tree in the center of K'un-Lun Square?<eos> You've been to K'un-Lun.
- And I made a promise.<eos> - Honor.<eos> Yes.<eos> Something I thought your father, Wendell, could use more of.<eos> What did you say?
Yes.<eos> Something I thought your father, Wendell, could use more of.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You knew my father?
Too many angles.<eos> Poison arrows can weaken the soul over time.<eos> That's better.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> How did you get in here?
And I don't plan on leaving anytime soon.<eos> You're not going to attack an old woman in front of all your employees, are you?<eos> I think Danny Rand is in enough trouble around here.<eos> I passed your test.<eos> You know who I am.
I passed your test.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> What I can do.<eos> You're not the first I've met to carry the mantle of the Iron Fist.<eos> Is that why you use that symbol on your heroin packages?
Is that why you use that symbol on your heroin packages?<eos> The dragon without the wings?<eos> The other Iron Fists I've known were fierce, unrelenting in their mission to protect K'un-Lun from the Hand.<eos> They would never have backed down from a grand duel just to save the life of one girl.<eos> How did you know my father?
Eat at fancy restaurants with your friends, like Claire Temple and Colleen Wing.<eos> Stop your war.<eos> This city is no place for the Iron Fist.<eos> You're a businessman now... and this is the best offer you are ever going to get.<eos> My father... did you make him an offer too?
You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why, Mr. Rand, I have a mind to report you to HR.<eos> You think this is a game?<eos> You're using my company, my building, to sell poison!<eos> Is that really so different than what you're doing on the top floor?
You're late.<eos> Sorry, everyone.<eos> I, uh... had a problem with the elevator.<eos> I know some of you aren't happy with me.<eos> And I know what you want me to do.
If your father were here...<eos> But he isn't.<eos> And as far as I can tell, he's nowhere in this company.<eos> And believe me, I've spent most of the day looking.<eos> I know you all want me to back out on this... but my dad once told me,
What?<eos> You already went to the press?<eos> She seems to think it's gonna make front page tomorrow.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know this isn't what you wanted.
She seems to think it's gonna make front page tomorrow.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know this isn't what you wanted.<eos> Any of you.<eos> But if you look deep down at the better part of yourselves... you'll know we're doing the right thing.
Look out for your own.<eos> I started this program... to teach you not just how to defend yourselves, but how to prepare for your futures.<eos> Today is Darryl's last day.<eos> He's been selected for an elite training program that comes with a full scholarship to a university.<eos> - You gonna miss me?
We actually did, sir.<eos> Twice.<eos> Just... hold on.<eos> Stop the car.<eos> You've refused to sell the Hand's heroin.
You can fight.<eos> I'll give you that.<eos> But the Hand is legion.<eos> Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?
But the Hand is legion.<eos> Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.
Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.<eos> You don't know me... but the Hand does.
She's home.<eos> She's safe.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.<eos> Where's Madame Gao?<eos> You must forgive me.
You know what to do.
Cut the theatrics, Lawrence.<eos> Let's get this over with so we can pack our offices.<eos> Oh, your things have already been packed... uh, minus any Rand property, of course.<eos> The boxes will be released to you as soon as you sign your termination agreements.<eos> You're holding our knickknacks hostage?
They're not just stuff, Ward.<eos> I have things that can't be replaced...<eos> photos of Mom and Dad.<eos> As I said, your mementos are a pen stroke away.<eos> I think you'll find the severance to be more than generous.
The stock will rebound.<eos> He bought a warehouse and a pier for no... discernible reason... and refused to settle the class action suit.<eos> It was becoming a pattern.<eos> This deal is non-negotiable.<eos> And you both have to sign, or you both get nothing.
It was becoming a pattern.<eos> This deal is non-negotiable.<eos> And you both have to sign, or you both get nothing.<eos> Ward... you mind joining us for a second?<eos> I said you both have to sign, or no deal.
I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I just want to know what happened between you and my father.<eos> Is that what's driven you to this state?<eos> He tried to shut this place down, didn't he?<eos> So you stopped him.
Is that what's driven you to this state?<eos> He tried to shut this place down, didn't he?<eos> So you stopped him.<eos> A shot in the dark rarely finds its target.<eos> You deny it?
You know she was responsible for your parents' death.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> Nothing she says will make you feel better about that.<eos> Let's just be done with this.<eos> So now you're ganging up on me?
Yeah, much better.<eos> Are you uncomfortable?<eos> What difference would it make?<eos> You will not untie me.<eos> You're right.
I was just trying to be polite.<eos> I won't make that mistake again.<eos> Regret hovers around everything you do.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> You don't know anything about me.
- I swear to God...<eos> - Claire?<eos> Why don't you take a break?<eos> Hello, Ms. Wing.<eos> You don't look well.
A woman in this world.<eos> You are consistently underestimated.<eos> Last... warning.<eos> Your grandfather was right to train you the way he did.<eos> You didn't know my grandfather.
You are consistently underestimated.<eos> Last... warning.<eos> Your grandfather was right to train you the way he did.<eos> You didn't know my grandfather.<eos> This is what you do.
Last... warning.<eos> Your grandfather was right to train you the way he did.<eos> You didn't know my grandfather.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> You mess with people's heads.
"The frog trapped in a well... does not understand the sea."<eos> So what?<eos> That's a saying anyone in Japan would know.<eos> It was printed in his obituary.<eos> You could have looked that up.
I need to go home.<eos> I was relieved to hear from you, sir.<eos> I'd really been quite worried.<eos> Especially after Ward and Joy lost the company.<eos> You never went this long without contacting me before.
You're gonna run out of time.<eos> - Did you get everything? - Uh-huh.<eos> If I give her too much, she'll fall asleep.<eos> If I give her too little, she'll resist you.<eos> Not afraid of needles, are you?
That's all?<eos> Just wait.<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> Get ready.<eos> How did you know my father?
He was more than willing to partner up.<eos> What?<eos> And when your father found out...<eos> Well...<eos> What are you talking about?
- It's the same poison from China.<eos> - Can you help her?<eos> Not unless I know what this poison is.<eos> We just put Gao to sleep.<eos> Did you really think your drugs would affect me?
- Say it.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> - We're gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're such children.
They're getting the lay of the land.<eos> Shit!<eos> - Danny!<eos> - Surround Gao!<eos> Claire, Colleen, you okay?
I will have the antidote ready and waiting outside.<eos> But you must decide now.<eos> She's lying.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Danny Rand told me that you've had experience with the Hand.
But you must decide now.<eos> She's lying.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Danny Rand told me that you've had experience with the Hand.<eos> That you understand what they can do.
- Mr. Meachum, you didn't...<eos> - Oh, please... call me Harold.<eos> Now, I think...<eos> I think I'm gonna have this organic cornflakes one.<eos> In all the time I've worked for you, I don't think I've ever seen you eat any dairy or sugar.
Kyle?<eos> Kyle?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Oh, what did I do?<eos> What are you doing?
- Already?<eos> This isn't mine.<eos> This is a set up.<eos> Someone set me up!<eos> You cannot search my car without cause.
Really?<eos> - Are we really gonna do this?<eos> - What is that?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> You sit there, take notes about how screwed up I am, prescribe some meds, send me back to some kind of cell.
- What is that?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> You sit there, take notes about how screwed up I am, prescribe some meds, send me back to some kind of cell.<eos> I know how the whole 72-hour-hold business works.<eos> Is that why you think you're here?
Listen... this is way too complicated for you to understand.<eos> Try me.<eos> You see, that's the trap.<eos> And he knows it.<eos> If I start talking about him, then you'll say...
I will take you to him.<eos> End of story.<eos> But you see, Ward, that's a risky proposition for a dual diagnosis patient.<eos> Dual diagnosis?<eos> You're an addict and you have psychological disorders,
Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Danny!<eos> "The frog in the well never understands the sea."<eos> Where are you taking him?
You know, sometimes in life, um, things happen that we're not prepared for.<eos> You know, we just do the best we can.<eos> Do you remember those nights?<eos> When I was sick?<eos> And you and Ward were there every two hours.
When I was sick?<eos> And you and Ward were there every two hours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we had to turn you in your bed. Keep you from getting bedsores.<eos> Mmm-hmm. You were just teenagers.
And you and Ward were there every two hours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we had to turn you in your bed. Keep you from getting bedsores.<eos> Mmm-hmm. You were just teenagers.<eos> But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.
But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.<eos> You were so thin... and fragile.<eos> You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.<eos> And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.
And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.
This is the guy that whacked that kid with a pole.<eos> It's, uh... not my greatest moment.<eos> Well, I thought it was awesome.<eos> So... you like it here?<eos> It's what you wanted?
You think?<eos> See?<eos> I told you.<eos> So, what's your day like?<eos> Can you come and go as you please?
Clear the east perimeter.<eos> You know the deal.<eos> Tray by the door when you're done.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm guessing you can see me.
You know the deal.<eos> Tray by the door when you're done.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm guessing you can see me.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're finally getting what you deserve.
And you rejected that offer, pursued and kidnapped me.<eos> Then you ran towards slavery as fast as you could.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?
They are stealing your ability to trust.<eos> That is how they crush you.<eos> Who?<eos> The Hand.<eos> What are you talking about?
She doesn't represent us.<eos> She... she is part of a rogue faction of the Hand that deals drugs and destroys lives,<eos> - but that is not who we are.<eos> - That's your story?<eos> That she's the bad Hand and you're the good Hand?
My name is Bakuto.<eos> I'll be taking over from Madame Gao.<eos> Ah. Danny told you about me.<eos> Not directly.<eos> But... you should know by now that our reach is extensive.
Ah. Danny told you about me.<eos> Not directly.<eos> But... you should know by now that our reach is extensive.<eos> I guess I was too optimistic to imagine the Hand would let me go.<eos> I think you'll find I'm much more easygoing than Gao.
I guess I was too optimistic to imagine the Hand would let me go.<eos> I think you'll find I'm much more easygoing than Gao.<eos> You see, she leads through fear.<eos> I find partnership to be a much more effective method.<eos> Oh... what are you proposing?
You see, she leads through fear.<eos> I find partnership to be a much more effective method.<eos> Oh... what are you proposing?<eos> Everything that is Gao's is now mine.<eos> You proceed as you have but with a different goal.
This is an emergency, and Rand needs to respond accordingly.<eos> Now, we have been riddled with controversy over the past few weeks.<eos> The Danny situation, the firing of me and my brother... and now we have this.<eos> As soon as the news hits the airwaves, our stock, which is already falling, will plummet even further.<eos> Unless... you see fit to reinstate the visionaries that led Rand to historic profits.
Right the ship.<eos> Show Wall Street and the world that stability is being restored.<eos> Now, there will be whispers about the why of Wilkins' death, but Rand should quiet those fears with a show of strength.<eos> The Meachums will set things right.<eos> Now the truth is... you need us.
Just a few more.<eos> - I'll just do them one at a time, okay?<eos> - Oh, it really hurts.<eos> Why don't you do something to take your mind off of it?<eos> Like, explain to me where the hell you and Colleen went after I saw you get taken away at the dojo by some mystery man.
I'm gonna defeat the Hand, Claire.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> It's what the Order of the Crane Mother has trained me for.<eos> And did those monks teach you how to deal with a broken heart?<eos> The way you two feel about each other?
You let me think that I was actually doing something to stop them.<eos> We were.<eos> There are different groups within the Hand, okay?<eos> I'm part of one that is trying to help people.<eos> Then did you think about trying a different name for the group?
- Becca?<eos> - Sensei Wing.<eos> - Heard you were working here.<eos> - I know, can you believe it?<eos> When you met me, I was pickpocketing on the L Train.
Please.<eos> Bakuto's compound's a fortress.<eos> He has too many men for us to go in alone.<eos> - We'd be swarmed before we got to him.<eos> - Well, you're not going in.
You know, they may claim to have loftier ideals, but the Hand are just common criminals with good marketing skills.<eos> You take their money and they'll come running.<eos> You two stake out the compound.<eos> Once we close off the accounts, he'll come out into the open.<eos> That's when you can strike.
Seriously?<eos> Where's Bakuto?<eos> Are we still in the compound?<eos> Is this detention?<eos> Why won't you answer me?
That's a nice name.<eos> You... you know who I am, how much I'm worth, right?<eos> - Of course, Mr. Meachum.<eos> - Call me Ward.<eos> I will pay you whatever you earn in a year, if you unstrap me and get me out of here.
You know this, too.<eos> This has a cost, right?<eos> We are living in a new age where governments aren't the true controllers of man's destinies.<eos> It's corporations like Rand Enterprises that govern the world.<eos> - So you wanna run Rand like Gao. - No.
She's running from them.<eos> - She's on our side.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Then she can help us blow up the whole compound with Bakuto and his minions inside.<eos> You can't do that.
She's still with them!<eos> - This asshole was your best friend?<eos> - Look, just calm down!<eos> The both of you!<eos> - You're behaving like animals.
Ward... would you please stop the transfer of my money?<eos> Let Joy and I leave, please.<eos> None of this was part of the deal.<eos> Do it.<eos> Did you really think taking my money would work?
I'm gonna come back for you, Bakuto.<eos> And I'm gonna show you no mercy.<eos> You're not coming back.<eos> Once we remove your head from your body, there will be no returning...<eos> - You're not killing my father!
- You're not killing my father!<eos> - Hey, lady!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> You're testing the limits of my patience.
Harold, it's Danny.<eos> Hey, I'm relieved to hear your voice.<eos> - What happened with Bakuto?<eos> - We've taken care of him.<eos> - Oh, so you cut off the head of the snake?
Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All thanks to you.<eos> Good.<eos> What hospital are you at?
You're a billionaire facing federal drug charges.<eos> You might as well have the words "Flight Risk" stamped on your forehead.<eos> You surrender, and you will end up in a jail cell for 6 to 12 months minimum before this even goes to trial.<eos> Trust me, our criminal justice system sucks.<eos> Look, did you find out what evidence the DEA has against Danny?

No food?<eos> No water?<eos> I've suffered worse.<eos> There are metal screens on those windows.<eos> You could have escaped.
I need access to everything that was on the tablet I took from you.<eos> I purged all that information from my computers.<eos> - There are no other copies?<eos> - There are not.<eos> You're lying.
"Child touched by fire." Isn't that how it goes?<eos> And now that child has grown up.<eos> And guilt is such an uncomfortable feeling, isn't it?<eos> Much easier to burn it in the flames of anger.<eos> You think you're so clever... with these little mind games.
I didn't even know it was murder until after I left.<eos> You were only ten years old, but you were smart enough to know that airplanes don't drop from the sky for no reason.<eos> We're wasting our time here.<eos> Danny.<eos> If what you're saying is true... then why haven't I killed you already?
- I don't know.<eos> Those who walk through that door are never heard from again.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's hope your minions find you before you rot.
He's gonna go to prison.<eos> I used to think my mom was still alive.<eos> She... she landed on a snow bank... broke a leg... but she was still alive.<eos> Out there... waiting for me to come and find her.<eos> Do you know how crazy that is?
It's me.<eos> It can't be tonight.<eos> I know what I said, but it's not just the guards outside.<eos> Dad has his own armed guards upstairs.<eos> Unless you're bulletproof, we have to wait.
- I can't let him do this alone.<eos> - Colleen!<eos> - Claire, we stick to the plan.<eos> - Just get... Just get the tablet!<eos> Tell me you're not gonna try to kill Harold!
Yeah, look...<eos> I'm saying this as a friend... but you two share a lot in common.<eos> No, that's... not a good thing.<eos> Your first instinct to a problem is to respond with violence.<eos> I guess what I'm saying here is... you're both pretty effed up and need some serious psychological help.
All right, come on.<eos> This is Spartan Tree Tree.<eos> Are you there, over?<eos> - Reading you, Lima Charlie.<eos> You're on a radio feed, and we do not want to move beyond range of your signal.
- Reading you, Lima Charlie.<eos> You're on a radio feed, and we do not want to move beyond range of your signal.<eos> - Do you copy?<eos> - Beyond range of my signal?<eos> You're already in my local radio.
But this is protocol.<eos> Well, fuck me. How do I know that?<eos> That you are who you say you are?<eos> Allen Isaac.<eos> You and your staff Sergeant Shane Matthews made an overnight worm into a kill zone to investigate a potential sniper and report back to us.
Allen Isaac.<eos> You and your staff Sergeant Shane Matthews made an overnight worm into a kill zone to investigate a potential sniper and report back to us.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> All right, I'm sorry. I'm a little fucked up.<eos> Listen, you got to bring a heavy escort.
Okay, okay.<eos> All right, I'm sorry. I'm a little fucked up.<eos> Listen, you got to bring a heavy escort.<eos> This guy's a fucking asshole.<eos> Where do you keep going?
Do you have a flare, Sergeant?<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Yeah. No, I don't.<eos> I have an M4 and a sidearm.<eos> I need you to stand and fire into the air.
- We need to get a lock on your position.<eos> - What the fuck? This ain't ranger school.<eos> The fucking shooter will get a fucking lock on my position.<eos> Well, I can't help you unless I know your location.<eos> Do you copy?
The fucking shooter will get a fucking lock on my position.<eos> Well, I can't help you unless I know your location.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Fuck.<eos> A lot of fucking help you've been so fucking far, motherfucker.
I'm hunting members of the Hand.<eos> I think you're the man we're looking for.<eos> Iron Fist.<eos> Go home.<eos> You know who I am?
Loading zone only.<eos> - Please.<eos> I can move it.<eos> - Not once it's hitched.<eos> But you can come to the impound on 49th to reclaim it any time before six p.m.
- Do I know you?<eos> - Franklin Nelson.<eos> I ran point on your case.<eos> We spoke on the phone... a lot.<eos> You spoke a lot.
As long as it worked.<eos> - I appreciate it.<eos> - Appreciate your friend Bobby Fish.<eos> We all did some impressive book-cracking.<eos> Plus, you made it through a prison stint without throwing a single punch.
In case you need help starting over.<eos> I'm not starting over, Mr. Nelson.<eos> I'm moving forward.<eos> People call me Foggy.<eos> And you let them?
I'm not starting over, Mr. Nelson.<eos> I'm moving forward.<eos> People call me Foggy.<eos> And you let them?<eos> You're on record as saying that the new subway station at 50th and 10th would be, quote, "good for the community."
In your professional opinion, was it good for Aaron James?<eos> Our sympathies go out to the family.<eos> The whole thing...<eos> It's very unfortunate.<eos> Were you aware the products used in your new station were hazardous to children?
Your Honor, I ask that this record of delivery be admitted into evidence.<eos> - I mean, I get a lot of those.<eos> - What would you say is worse?<eos> Ignoring data in the interest of cutting costs?<eos> Or neglecting to supply the court with records that might prove you purposely put people in danger?
We weren't sure if we were in the right place.<eos> Not today.<eos> Probably not tomorrow, either.<eos> - Come on, Mom.<eos> - I read about what you did.
- Excuse me?<eos> - Lexi, please.<eos> We are not doing great.<eos> He has been gone a full week.<eos> - Did you call the cops?
- And it's not like him.<eos> Because he's cheating on you, okay?<eos> Nothing to be ashamed about.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> - You don't know him like I do.
Nothing to be ashamed about.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> - You don't know him like I do.<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> But you came to me and I'm giving you my professional opinion.
But you came to me and I'm giving you my professional opinion.<eos> You need a divorce lawyer.<eos> Thank you for your time, Ms. Jones.<eos> Yeah, thanks so much.<eos> Whatever he's doing... I hope you find him.
- Maybe...<eos> - Maybe he's an amateur.<eos> Hi.<eos> I just got a call from a blocked number.<eos> I was wondering if you can tell me where it was coming from.
A sign that your mind and your soul are not yet aligned.<eos> Well, I'm trying very hard to ignore my soul.<eos> "The Lord sees not as man sees.<eos> Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord... looks on the heart."<eos> If you could elaborate, Father.
Dude, I don't care what weird shit you're into, but we gotta talk.<eos> All right, well, you're gonna pay for this.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We made arrangements, as you requested.
All right, well, you're gonna pay for this.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We made arrangements, as you requested.<eos> Are you certain about this?
- Take what you can.<eos> Hey!<eos> What the hell do you kids think you're doing?<eos> - Shit!<eos> - You're not gonna steal from my store!
True, but there's nothing to worry about.<eos> The mayor's office confirmed this morning, it was a 4.6 magnitude earthquake.<eos> A shallow one, actually, centered in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> I'm told seismologists are looking at a fault line on the Hudson to see if it could be the source of the problem.<eos> Jane from Brooklyn, you're on Trish Talk.

Can I go now, dipshit?<eos> You're done when we're done.<eos> You got a mouth.<eos> You noticed.<eos> Ms. Jones, you can go for now.
A small price to pay in the larger scheme of things.<eos> You know, with the kind of support you've provided, we would love to host you at our next gala.<eos> I've always preferred a more intimate setting.<eos> Of course.<eos> The piece you've requested is a curious one.
You know who I'm talking about.<eos> I work alone.<eos> Always has.<eos> Look, like I said, I'm barely on the payroll.<eos> Okay, whatever you think is going on... whatever you think is happening here...
I can't tell you. I...<eos> This... this is not me.<eos> I'm a good man.<eos> Make sure you tell her that.<eos> Okay, with any luck, you're gonna tell her that yourself.
Okay, with any luck, you're gonna tell her that yourself.<eos> Now your family is worried.<eos> They just wanted to know what happened.<eos> And the cops...<eos> They just wanna know why you started stockpiling explosives.
What?<eos> There's nowhere to go.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> They'll... they'll hurt me.<eos> To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.
To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.<eos> I was just trying to stop them.<eos> - They're gonna take down the city.<eos> - Who?<eos> I can't help you if you won't tell me who.
- Am I being charged with something?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But you might have interrupted a city-wide investigation.<eos> - You stole evidence from my crime scene.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.
- Then who were you chasing?<eos> Officer, unless you have a reason to hold me...<eos> Don't give me that "officer" bullshit.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Look, I know that you think you're just doing your job, but I'm telling you, this case isn't normal.

Thank you, Kadir.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Please tell your wife she makes it even better than they did in Constantinople.<eos> I think you mean Istanbul, ma'am.
Constantinople, this is its ancient name.<eos> Of course.<eos> The Black Sky.<eos> We have it.<eos> How long have you waited for this?
I have a soft spot for hopeless causes.<eos> - That was a bad joke.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Barely.<eos> Uh, Ms. Jones, may I ask how long you've been a PI?
All of their power stems from their ability to bring back the dead.<eos> Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.<eos> - This sounds insane.<eos> - And so does being bulletproof.<eos> The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.
Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.<eos> - This sounds insane.<eos> - And so does being bulletproof.<eos> The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.<eos> Now, we're gonna leave you two alone, and you're gonna talk.
- I don't know how much I can afford.<eos> - Don't worry about that right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, is there anything you haven't told me?
- that he was a part of?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> What did you see?
There was an organization that did business with us last year.<eos> - We did lots of business.<eos> - Yeah, they call themselves the Hand.<eos> - You need help spelling that?<eos> - Look, whatever you heard, it's true.
- We did lots of business.<eos> - Yeah, they call themselves the Hand.<eos> - You need help spelling that?<eos> - Look, whatever you heard, it's true.<eos> I know you're scared, but we can't leave until you help us.
No, he's... not.<eos> Not at the moment.<eos> And who were the clients?<eos> That's privileged information.<eos> I'm sure you understand.
God himself sent you.<eos> You don't have to hide anything from me.<eos> I know where Cole is.<eos> He's following in his brother's footsteps.<eos> You know what kind of trouble they were into?
He can't admit when he's done something wrong.<eos> You can't admit when you done something right.<eos> Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.<eos> They're lotto tickets.<eos> He said he wanted you to know he was thinking about you.
- Are they expecting you?<eos> - Not like this.<eos> Right this way.<eos> My name is Danny Rand.<eos> Last year, you illegally transferred $243 million worth of assets through my family's company.

My name is Danny Rand.<eos> Last year, you illegally transferred $243 million worth of assets through my family's company.<eos> And you thought you got away with it.<eos> But I know who you are.<eos> You killed my parents, attacked my home.
Last year, you illegally transferred $243 million worth of assets through my family's company.<eos> And you thought you got away with it.<eos> But I know who you are.<eos> You killed my parents, attacked my home.<eos> You're the Hand.
And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor.<eos> And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.
Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor.<eos> And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.<eos> - And who are you?
And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.<eos> - And who are you?<eos> - I'm in charge.<eos> But, please, go on.<eos> You were telling us what you were going to do.
Rand Enterprises has put together a case to take you down.<eos> Extortion, narcotics, human trafficking...<eos> There's no end to what we'll uncover.<eos> And?<eos> And you can't hide anymore.
And you can't hide anymore.<eos> - Does it look like we're hiding?<eos> - Behind Midland Circle Financial.<eos> Behind corporate shells, or street-level criminals who don't know who they're working for.<eos> It's what you do.
I am the Immortal Iron Fist, weapon of K'un-Lun.<eos> - And I'm fulfilling my destiny.<eos> - K'un-Lun.<eos> How is it these days?<eos> You're gonna lose everything.
- K'un-Lun.<eos> How is it these days?<eos> You're gonna lose everything.<eos> Just like I did.<eos> You haven't lost everything, Mr. Rand.
- Hey, I said we're closed!<eos> We need to stay off the streets.<eos> Well, stay off them somewhere else.<eos> I'll call the police.<eos> You can't do that.
You can't do that.<eos> You'd be putting the cops in danger.<eos> - I'll put you in danger.<eos> - I'm done explaining this.<eos> What are you doing?
- So we're just gonna wait it out here?<eos> - You got a better plan?<eos> Is there a plan where I get my scarf back?<eos> I just need it till this is over.<eos> - What, do you two know each other?
- I think we should bring her in. - No.<eos> You'd be putting her in danger.<eos> As will anyone who goes up against the Hand.<eos> And as for doing this any "legal" way...<eos> Well, look, you saw what happened when we tried that.
Well, look, you saw what happened when we tried that.<eos> - Is that what that was?<eos> - It started that way.<eos> Look, I even put on a tie.<eos> I promise you, you cannot fight these people.
I promise you, you cannot fight these people.<eos> Not even with whatever it is your hand can do.<eos> - It's chi.<eos> - It's not.<eos> What I'm saying is, going at them head on, that'll get you killed.
No, but you should worry about the possibility of death.<eos> From what I hear, we all should be worried.<eos> We're close now.<eos> And the Iron Fist has returned to New York.<eos> I heard you were unable to secure him.
Hey, Stick, you and I need to talk.<eos> Anything you gotta say, you say in front of us.<eos> - This is between me and him.<eos> - Hey, we are all in danger.<eos> I don't know you very well, Mr. Cage, you seem like a good guy, so trust me when I tell you that with this old man, nothing is sacred.
You get the privilege of watching them die.<eos> All right, maybe this city is at stake.<eos> Maybe this fight is important.<eos> I get that.<eos> I'm just saying, imagine knowing for the rest of your life, you only made it worse by getting involved.
Late.<eos> Or early.<eos> Depending on your life choices.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> How you holding up?
You've become so resourceful in your old age.<eos> What have you become in yours?<eos> Determined.<eos> Mr. Rand, I'm sorry your exit from our meeting was so abrupt.<eos> You tried to kill us.
I said I'd bring him back.<eos> What happened?<eos> The Hand attacked us.<eos> They took Luke.<eos> How do you know they didn't follow you here?
- Not much longer.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Because this is happening.<eos> What are you doing in New York?<eos> There's nothing you can do to make me betray my own.
- Put us through brutal trials.<eos> It's called discipline.<eos> It means he won't crack.<eos> Not by force.<eos> You know nothing of the power of the Hand.
It's called discipline.<eos> It means he won't crack.<eos> Not by force.<eos> You know nothing of the power of the Hand.<eos> You are mice who fell into a well.
Afraid and alone.<eos> The same way the woman couldn't save the architect.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Have I gotten in your head the same way he did long ago?<eos> What about the ones you still love?
Remember the last time we faced off, Bakuto?<eos> I do, Mr. Rand.<eos> And I look forward to doing it again.<eos> You really shouldn't.<eos> I heard you'd made some friends.
I do, Mr. Rand.<eos> And I look forward to doing it again.<eos> You really shouldn't.<eos> I heard you'd made some friends.<eos> Smart move, considering she never believed in her purpose, and you've yet to discover yours.
Funny.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd think he's trying to tell us something.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right, listen up, everybody.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here, but it seems that you are all of interest to some pretty powerful and dangerous people.
- It's weird.<eos> Okay. Uh...<eos> Look, I don't need to be here.<eos> I can defend myself.<eos> You came in here pretty bloody.
You came in here pretty bloody.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> What can you tell me about these people that you're fighting?
We will win.<eos> We have armies.<eos> We have our weapon.<eos> Let's talk about your weapon.<eos> What did you do to her?
We have armies.<eos> We have our weapon.<eos> Let's talk about your weapon.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> What did you do to Elektra?
What did you do to her?<eos> What did you do to Elektra?<eos> Elektra?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You dug up her grave.
What did you do to Elektra?<eos> Elektra?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You dug up her grave.<eos> And what did you turn her into?
Hey, stop.<eos> You can't undo this.<eos> Admit it.<eos> - Elektra's still in there.<eos> You failed.
Well, it doesn't matter if you think it's true or not.<eos> It's something they believe is true.<eos> He was a member of the Hand.<eos> An organization formed by lying psychopaths.<eos> You can't trust a word he said.
This is exactly how they work.<eos> They divide us.<eos> They get into our heads.<eos> They weaken us.<eos> They make you question the people you trust.
Listen, Stick, maybe we should just... uh, let him lay low, or just...<eos> Maybe we should just hide him.<eos> We're running out of time!<eos> They're hunting our friends, our families, and they're not gonna stop there.<eos> You heard what he said.
I've already lost one city.<eos> I'm not losing another.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna try and keep me here against my will?
What do you want?<eos> - Just to talk.<eos> - About my dad again?<eos> About what happened.<eos> You said so yourself.
You said so yourself.<eos> He got mixed up with the mob or something.<eos> - Wasn't the mob.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Who are you?
Consider my proposal.<eos> We could be ready to move tonight.<eos> You were right.<eos> I'll be right here when you're done.<eos> You've got me tied up like a prisoner.
And they got you on guard duty.<eos> Nah, that depends on you.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> Don't you see what's happening?<eos> You've got me tied up like I'm the enemy, and they're out there trying to kill the people we care about.
We had a moment.<eos> But we both had to go on our different paths, so we...<eos> Different paths?<eos> You know, you're starting to sound like me.<eos> I don't know what you think you're gonna find.
But winning it... is gonna take something else.<eos> - You trained with the same elders I did?<eos> - No.<eos> Then what makes you think tying me up is the right choice?<eos> It seems like you're just making this up as you go along.
Mr. Rand, I know I speak for all of us when I say how nice it is to have you with us again.<eos> This time, for good.<eos> This war... it isn't over.<eos> Well, the thing about war is... it only works if both sides believe they're the good guys.<eos> You fight to defeat us.
We fight to get back what was once ours.<eos> And what is it that you want?<eos> To return to K'un-Lun.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> You destroyed it.
To return to K'un-Lun.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> You destroyed it.<eos> I saw.<eos> You saw what you wanted to see.
And now, without death standing in our way, I believe we can, together.<eos> No.<eos> We are not the same.<eos> I know.<eos> But in the end... and this is the end... you'll do what everyone else does for me.
We are not the same.<eos> I know.<eos> But in the end... and this is the end... you'll do what everyone else does for me.<eos> You'll serve.<eos> Where are you taking me?
Do not underestimate me!<eos> Kill Luke Cage.<eos> Kill Jessica Jones.<eos> And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.
And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.<eos> But let me remind you, I neutralized our enemies.<eos> I brought you the Iron Fist.<eos> I was able to keep the most important operation in our history running while you succumbed to chaos and conflict.
I was able to keep the most important operation in our history running while you succumbed to chaos and conflict.<eos> I have proven myself to be the one and only true leader...<eos> His name is Matthew.<eos> And my name... is Elektra Natchios.<eos> You work for me now.
- I don't care if you believe me.<eos> Whatever they're gonna do with Danny Rand, it is not good for anyone.<eos> - Mr. Murdock. - Yes.<eos> Is that you, Detective?<eos> You're up.
You're up.<eos> I've got one of your clients scared shitless across the hallway, and the other one passed out, so I'm gonna need for you to answer a few questions.<eos> Oh, well, unfortunately, whatever happened is protected by attorney-client privilege.<eos> That's cute, but cut the shit.<eos> 'Cause we both know you're not just a lawyer in all this.

Oh, well, unfortunately, whatever happened is protected by attorney-client privilege.<eos> That's cute, but cut the shit.<eos> 'Cause we both know you're not just a lawyer in all this.<eos> You're something more.<eos> As of right now, you're a person of interest.
As of right now, you're a person of interest.<eos> A witness to a crime.<eos> A witness?<eos> What, do you want me to describe how it sounded, Detective?<eos> Perhaps you didn't hear me when I said, "Cut the shit."
Is that a challenge?<eos> We will do what is needed to preserve our organization.<eos> This is not our first coup.<eos> It is your first without the substance.<eos> Is that a gamble you're willing to take?
I have reminded the NYPD<eos> - we have no evidence...<eos> - Yet.<eos> ...to suggest that you were responsible.<eos> Now, I trust Detective Knight, and she says that, although you're being tight-lipped, the best way to proceed is to treat you as witnesses and not suspects.
Our task force has been tracking a mysterious crime syndicate for months.<eos> They move fast and cover their tracks and often with the blood of innocent people.<eos> - People are in danger.<eos> - Captain, my clients are exhausted and under emotional distress.<eos> I'm sure you understand they need to go home.

- Captain, my clients are exhausted and under emotional distress.<eos> I'm sure you understand they need to go home.<eos> And, see, I'm not sure you understand the severity of the situation.<eos> Everyone who's come in contact with these assholes turns up dead.<eos> Now, either you help us or I start clearing out a couple of jail cells.
I'm tired of doing this the hard way.<eos> These people don't tell us what to do.<eos> We are the law here.<eos> Or has New York gone completely insane?<eos> Captain, before you make any calls, I'd like to sidebar with my clients.
Yeah, did she take Danny or did she kill Danny?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if what Stick said is true, and they didn't leave his body, we have to believe they need him alive.<eos> I think she saved him.<eos> When you burst in, the old man was trying to slice him open.
I want three units scouring a ten-block radius.<eos> They can't be far.<eos> And, Detective... I thought Luke was smarter than this.<eos> I thought...<eos> If you want a chance to save yourself here, you need to reconsider how well you know these vigilantes. That clear?
- Unfortunately.<eos> We're here for Danny Rand.<eos> The Iron Fist belongs to us.<eos> Well, we're not leaving here without him.<eos> Then I guess you're not leaving.
No time to explain.<eos> - Like hell there isn't.<eos> - Please.<eos> You got a minute before the full force of the NYPD is here.<eos> So I need you to answer this fast.
- It's basic training.<eos> They taught us how to run from the bombs, not set 'em.<eos> So what you're saying is once someone activates the charge...<eos> That's it.<eos> You two put 'em in place.
Yeah, well, do like me.<eos> Don't think about it.<eos> If you told me a week ago that I'd be here with you two, about to blow up some building and fight ninjas to save New York...<eos> Yeah.<eos> For whatever it's worth, I'm glad you're here.
It's not too late.<eos> Claire, what the hell is going on?<eos> Put Luke on the goddamn phone.<eos> Real bad timing.<eos> Listen, you need to get your asses out of there.
Just make sure to clear the block, okay?<eos> - There's a lot of this stuff in here.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> You know about this?<eos> Claire, whatever it is you're planning, it ends in either jail or a cemetery.
Save it... for the larger battle to come.<eos> Is this place what I think it is?<eos> These beasts, they've given both of us so much.<eos> Though even power great as yours pales in the face of eternal life.<eos> This is what you've been after the whole time?
These beasts, they've given both of us so much.<eos> Though even power great as yours pales in the face of eternal life.<eos> This is what you've been after the whole time?<eos> The very essence of what made you.<eos> You desecrate Shou-Lao.
And you think you're going to right that wrong?<eos> It's what this journey has all been for.<eos> Then you are as naive as when I first laid eyes on you.<eos> Just a child... walking with your mother.<eos> She made you hold her hand as you crossed the street.
- What?<eos> I can get through to her.<eos> - You back on that again?<eos> - We're not gonna leave you here.<eos> You made a promise to get him back.
The end.<eos> Everybody get back!<eos> Get back!<eos> Take cover! Take cover!<eos> You gotta help her!
Or more accurately, never happened.<eos> Uh, what about Claire?<eos> Claire who?<eos> Hogarth, Benowitz Chao at your service.<eos> I hope you'll think of us for all your legal needs.
Bye, Dada.<eos> Bye.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> It was sure nice getting to know you all.<eos> Whoever the heck you are.
Almost.<eos> Almost.<eos> Sir, with all due respect, are you sure this is our best option?
And is this for day or evening?<eos> I need one for day and one for night.<eos> Recontoured grips.<eos> Flared magwell for easier reloads.<eos> And I know you'll appreciate the custom porting.
The marker is over.<eos> Mark it.<eos> If Mr. Wick isn't dead already, he soon will be.<eos> Will you mark it, sir?<eos> You have no idea, what's coming do you?
Will you mark it, sir?<eos> You have no idea, what's coming do you?<eos> I have everyone in New York looking for him.<eos> I doubt we will see him again.<eos> Do you now?
You have no idea, what's coming do you?<eos> I have everyone in New York looking for him.<eos> I doubt we will see him again.<eos> Do you now?<eos> You stabbed the devil in the back, and forced him back into the life that he had just left.
I have everyone in New York looking for him.<eos> I doubt we will see him again.<eos> Do you now?<eos> You stabbed the devil in the back, and forced him back into the life that he had just left.<eos> You incinerated the priest's temple.
You incinerated the priest's temple.<eos> Burned it to the ground.<eos> Now he's free of the marker, what do you think he'll do?<eos> He had a glimpse of the other side, and he embraced it.<eos> But you, Signor D'Antonio... took it away from him.
You don't want me owing you.<eos> Welcome everyone.<eos> Let us toast to the future of the High Table, and of course, to the memory of my dear sister.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Mr. Akoni, how are you?
No home.<eos> Vengeance... it's all you have.<eos> You wanted me back.<eos> I'm back.<eos> You are now exiting Reflections of the Soul, at the New Modern NYC.
Cerebral salvage, ready to proceed<eos> Robotic skeleton, prepared and waiting for brain insertion.<eos> Initiate Project 2571.<eos> Now your eyes are gonna open.<eos> You're safe.
Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Hello Mira.<eos> I'm Dr. Ouelet.<eos> Do you remember anything about the attack?
Do you remember anything about the attack?<eos> What...?<eos> I was... drowning.<eos> There was water.<eos> That's right, you were on a boat.
Who sent you?<eos> Help me. Please.<eos> Answer me!<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> You okay?
Answer me!<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> You okay?<eos> You're injured.<eos> You're not the same.
Human, but of course cyber enhanced.<eos> So how did they hack him?<eos> Somehow this geisha bot got past his encryption.<eos> Something's different.<eos> What'd you get?
So how did they hack him?<eos> Somehow this geisha bot got past his encryption.<eos> Something's different.<eos> What'd you get?<eos> Why are you always thinking he's out there enhancing.
Find out what has been recovered from the geisha.<eos> Major!<eos> I told you not jump off.<eos> I had to, or more would have died.<eos> You're a member of my team, and my responsibility
I had to, or more would have died.<eos> You're a member of my team, and my responsibility<eos> I will find him and I will kill him.<eos> It's what I am built for, isn't it?<eos> You are more than just a weapon.
- Hey, Batou!<eos> - Got your bones.<eos> - Thanks man.<eos> - What are they for? - For the dogs.<eos> For someone who doesn't like people how come you care about dogs so much?
- What are they for? - For the dogs.<eos> For someone who doesn't like people how come you care about dogs so much?<eos> Don't know.<eos> I like just strays and they like me.<eos> They like you 'cause you feed them.
All visitors must display appropriate credentials at all times.<eos> Opens and close, please.<eos> Your have damaged internal systems.<eos> Maybe next time you can design me better.<eos> - How are you?
- I'm fine. I can't feel anything.<eos> No you, in There.<eos> I've been having glitches.<eos> But they'll pass.<eos> - Have you been taking your medication? - Yeah.
The glitches have a different texture... to the rest of your code.<eos> I can see everything.<eos> All of your thoughts, your... decisions.<eos> - I guess privacy is just for humans.<eos> - You are human.
Everyone around me seems to fit.<eos> They seem connected to something.<eos> Something I'm... not.<eos> - It's like I have no past. - Of course you have a past.<eos> And with time you'll feel more and more connected to it and to them.
I know.<eos> They could've left traps in her.<eos> Mag pulses, viruses.<eos> She's right.<eos> You will be exposing your mind to who ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.
I have to get inside her memory.<eos> It's the fastest way to find Kuze.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> And highly irresponsible.<eos> Are you sure?
It's too dangerous.<eos> And highly irresponsible.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You see any bad code headed my way, pull me out.<eos> How come you're the one sweating?
Get her out. - Get her out!<eos> - I'm trying, but she's being hacked.<eos> Get her out now!<eos> Now!<eos> Are you okay?
You tooled up? - Yep.<eos> - Target is in the basement.<eos> I'll lead.<eos> Switching to mind coms.<eos> - Hope you've been practicing.
Copy that.<eos> We got it covered.<eos> There's a lot of heat in here for a nightclub.<eos> It's a Yakuza club.<eos> What did you expect?
What did you expect?<eos> I quite like the place.<eos> Why doesn't that surprise me?<eos> I'm gonna have to draw some attention. See if I can access the basement that way.<eos> You're not here looking for any trouble, are you?
We have privacy.<eos> Listen.<eos> No signals going in or out.<eos> Major, I'm in position.<eos> Do you copy?
I'm afraid I get bored rather easily, so... You don't wanna talk...<eos> Maybe you wanna dance!<eos> Major, come on.<eos> Answer me.<eos> I thought you said no trouble.
Major?<eos> Where's Batou?<eos> In enhancement, next door.<eos> He's doing well.<eos> You took most of the blast.
You took most of the blast.<eos> I saw him down there.<eos> It was like... He waited to see me.<eos> We synaptic scanned you.<eos> Everything you witnessed went to Section 9 to evaluate.
Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?<eos> No.<eos> They don't.<eos> You've been inside the same shell as he has.
That could have very serious consequences.<eos> You were not authorized to deep dive the geisha.<eos> You're disappointed.<eos> No, I'm worried.<eos> You're not invulnerable.
I can repair your body, but I can't protect your mind.<eos> Why not?<eos> You can see all my thoughts so... You should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.
I can see you out there, you know.<eos> How many fingers am I holding up?<eos> Funny.<eos> Say something nice.<eos> You chose those?
- What else I got?<eos> - They suit you. - Yeah?<eos> I got night vision, zoom... and X-ray.<eos> I guess I see like you now.<eos> Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
I got night vision, zoom... and X-ray.<eos> I guess I see like you now.<eos> Don't worry, you'll get used to it.<eos> Thanks for saving my ass.<eos> Glad to see you're okay.
Yeah.<eos> Can you take that off? So I can see your face?<eos> What does that feel like?<eos> It feels... different.<eos> What are you?
Tell me what they took from me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They never told us.<eos> It feels weird driving with these eyes.<eos> Why do you take that?
Now!<eos> She's in transit.<eos> Her comms are down.<eos> I'm looking at her and I'm thinking:<eos> "You want me to pay for violin too?"
But when she practices that thing, it is painful, right?<eos> Why not piano?<eos> I mean, it's the same price, and doesn't sound so bad.<eos> At least if you can't play that proper, it sounds... 2-5-7-1! Tell me everything!<eos> Are you prepare to die for 2-5-7...?
Who are you?<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm shy.<eos> I'm not beautiful... like you.<eos> Tell me who you are.
Come in.<eos> I know why we couldn't find him.<eos> He's using human minds to create a network of his own.<eos> We're coming to your position.<eos> Tell me who you are.
I know why we couldn't find him.<eos> He's using human minds to create a network of his own.<eos> We're coming to your position.<eos> Tell me who you are.<eos> I'm that which you seek to destroy.
We're coming to your position.<eos> Tell me who you are.<eos> I'm that which you seek to destroy.<eos> In this life, my name is... Kuze.<eos> What are you doing to me?
I have, connected you, to a network of my own creation.<eos> W-w-when I'm finished in this world... my ghost can survive there and regenerate.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I became... fascinated with you.<eos> Reading y-y-your code... when you were inside that geisha.
Reading y-y-your code... when you were inside that geisha.<eos> Like nothing I had felt before, yet so... familiar.<eos> We are the same.<eos> We're not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.
Like nothing I had felt before, yet so... familiar.<eos> We are the same.<eos> We're not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.<eos> Innocent? Is that what you call them?
Innocent? Is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?<eos> What have they told you?<eos> That you were the first?
What are you talking about?<eos> I was conscious while they dismembered my body, and discarded me like garbage.<eos> I was lying on a table, listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not meshed with the shell, that they had built;<eos> How project t-two, five, seven, one had failed, and they had to move on... to you.<eos> What a beauty you are!
What a beauty you are!<eos> They have improved s-so much, since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution? That's what you call... killing everyone who made you?
They have improved s-so much, since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution? That's what you call... killing everyone who made you?<eos> You're not listening to me.
They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us, to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution? That's what you call... killing everyone who made you?<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> You're a murderer.
Do it, then.<eos> Do what you were programmed to do.<eos> What is that?<eos> I c-c-can't remember, but I am haunted by it.<eos> Do You see it?
Get down on the ground now.<eos> Major!<eos> Major!<eos> Oh, Mira!<eos> My got, you are safe!
Major!<eos> Oh, Mira!<eos> My got, you are safe!<eos> You have been gone for hours.<eos> And no one knew where you were.
Oh, Mira!<eos> My got, you are safe!<eos> You have been gone for hours.<eos> And no one knew where you were.<eos> You are scaring me.
We gave you false memories.<eos> Cutter wanted to motivate you.<eos> To fight terrorists. I didn't approve.<eos> It was cruel, but my work, that was important, and... you were born.<eos> You were so beautiful.
But I always do.<eos> Did they send you to bring me in?<eos> I'm just here to fish.<eos> Did you see any?<eos> You're a company man, you follow orders.
Just... nothing.<eos> - It scares me.<eos> - Then why do you do it?<eos> It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?
- Then why do you do it?<eos> It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?<eos> I dunno who to trust anymore.<eos> You trust me, right?
We never needed your consent;<eos> Yours or anyone's.<eos> You're killing me, aren't you?<eos> Mira?<eos> Can you hear me?
My parents... Everything was data, they installed in my mind.<eos> And there were others;<eos> Run-aways like me. That's why he's coming... for Hanka.<eos> Kuze was one of them.<eos> Can you prove this?
Kuze was one of them.<eos> Can you prove this?<eos> Dr. Ouelet can.<eos> Ouelet's dead.<eos> Cutter says you killed her.
It's Cutter, he found us!<eos> Target acquired<eos> No!<eos> Target eliminated.<eos> You came close... you freak.
Target is in view.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> No!<eos> Keep firing.<eos> Saito, have you found Major?
I'm with Cutter.<eos> Do you wanna say anything before I kill him?<eos> Tell him this is justice.<eos> It's what I was built for.<eos> So do you give consent?
You know how I came up with the idea for the Triple-X program?
Things the world thought were impossible.<eos> Now, that kid needed that drought.<eos> The world needed those empty pools.<eos> That's why Triple-X.<eos> Do you feel safer today than you felt yesterday? I know I don't.
But we, my friend, are not at war.<eos> We are at peril.<eos> That's why Triple-X.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You on a diet?
I got to call bullshit on that!<eos> You're exactly the kind of hero the world needs.<eos> At the end of the day, it comes down to the same question I've been asking my wife every Friday night for the last 20 years.<eos> Do you want some of this?<eos> Or are you just gonna--
Here you go, brother.<eos> Chapter one!<eos> Page one!<eos> Shit happens.<eos> You're late!
We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?<eos> No.<eos> But Gibbons did.<eos> What you doing?
Xander!<eos> - What are you doin'? - Give me a second.<eos> And here we go, we are underway!<eos> I knew you would do it, Xander.<eos> You brought the world to us.
Gibbons!<eos> Gibbons?<eos> Olly-olly-oxen-free.<eos> Wow.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.
Gibbons?<eos> Olly-olly-oxen-free.<eos> Wow.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?
What's in London?<eos> A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.
A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.
So, I'm looking for someone.<eos> Since when have we had a business relationship?<eos> I get caught even touching a computer, my ass goes away for 20.<eos> Name your price.<eos> You know I'm good for it.
Information like this doesn't have a price.<eos> Ainsley, everything has a price.<eos> Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.<eos> You wanna know what it is, Cage?<eos> I used to think you were the man.
Ainsley, everything has a price.<eos> Now, if you don't think you can pull it off, if you lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.<eos> You wanna know what it is, Cage?<eos> I used to think you were the man.<eos> But now,... I don't know, maybe I feel like you're just working for him.
I used to think you were the man.<eos> But now,... I don't know, maybe I feel like you're just working for him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Nobody knows I'm here.<eos> And you know how I am about keeping secrets.
Real MI6 kind of shit.<eos> Disappear on your skin, under your arms, tied around your balls like a Christmas bow.<eos> Unwrap me, then.<eos> You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins nine out of 10 relationships.<eos> Lucky for me, you love to gamble.
The whispers I hear, these ghosts of yours are the real kind of trouble.<eos> They've got training, they've got funding, and they've got no problem running over anyone who gets in their way.<eos> Okay, so, you're worried that I might get hurt?<eos> I'm worried you might get dead.<eos> You know, I'm touched that you can imagine a world without me in it.
Some jungle rave that's off the grid.<eos> How the hell did you find it so quickly?<eos> Undercover work.<eos> Where is it?<eos> What did you do with Pandora's Box?
Where is it?<eos> What did you do with Pandora's Box?<eos> It's in a safe place.<eos> That wasn't a part of the plan.<eos> After all these years, you're still shocked when I improvise?
Turns out there's a new mission.<eos> I'm not gonna destroy the one thing I can use to get what we want.<eos> The whole world is looking for us, Xiang.<eos> Let them come!<eos> You worry about pawn sacrifice.
I know mouth-to-mouth if necessary.<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow!<eos> Are you kidding me with those guns?<eos> You're like the frickin' Terminator!
You smell that?<eos> Smells like the same shit in a different suit.<eos> You think a dog knows how to work a Frisbee?<eos> Master says, "Fetch," and the bitch listens.<eos> You would look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.
What are you, my handler?<eos> I'm whatever you need.<eos> I can handle anything.<eos> And I've got a tight grip.<eos> And just so you know, I am not a field agent.
This is a multistage signal disruptor.<eos> It's very, very breakable.<eos> Can you tell me the real reason behind the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie?<eos> - Yes. - Ah.<eos> You're one of them, aren't you?
What could possibly go wrong?<eos> - That is my style, though.<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Oh, you know, actually, I would rather if you didn't--
I like your style, man.<eos> Stay on that boat, no matter what.<eos> Adele, Nicks!<eos> All right, guys, keep your ear-buds in.<eos> Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.
But your ink's all wrong.<eos> CIA?<eos> They would send in a drone, bomb us to hell.<eos> MI6?<eos> You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.
You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.<eos> You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.<eos> You're not here to hide.
You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.<eos> You're not here to hide.<eos> You're looking for someone.
You're looking for someone.<eos> And who's to say I haven't already found her?<eos> Was that meant to scare me?<eos> A little tremble would be nice.<eos> Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here I'd say I'm close enough.
And who's to say I haven't already found her?<eos> Was that meant to scare me?<eos> A little tremble would be nice.<eos> Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here I'd say I'm close enough.<eos> Does this mean you're not making me breakfast in the morning?
Mate, seriously?<eos> A grenade?<eos> What is this? Eastern Europe in the early '90s?<eos> Next, he's gonna send you a fax.<eos> So, you're willing to kill just to keep that for yourself?
Next, he's gonna send you a fax.<eos> So, you're willing to kill just to keep that for yourself?<eos> That's the wrong question to ask.<eos> What's the right question?<eos> "Are you willing to die for it" ?
One grenade, three people.<eos> I like the odds.<eos> Two grenades, three people.<eos> I'm loving these odds.<eos> You ever bleed so much, when you open your eyes, all you see is red?
I like the odds.<eos> Two grenades, three people.<eos> I'm loving these odds.<eos> You ever bleed so much, when you open your eyes, all you see is red?<eos> When you have fought war on every continent--
This isn't about Serena.<eos> This is war.<eos> And either we stop it today, or we watch the world burn tomorrow. - Can't lose focus on that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where you been?
And if you needed retinal scans, cell phone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world--<eos> Who would you target?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?<eos> Oh, you're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage.
More.<eos> A little more.<eos> Stop.<eos> Okay, when Xiang broke the window, he's the only one that didn't flinch.<eos> That's not gonna come off, you know that, right?
Nicks, when I crashed the boat up on shore and saved your life...<eos> Yeah, whatever, bro.<eos> ...do you think that counts as crash 199 for me?<eos> You know, officially?<eos> Officially, you're deranged.
Not if we find him first.<eos> Whoa! Red light!<eos> Red light!<eos> Did you know traffic signals were invented by Big Oil to waste fuel and drive up profits?<eos> If I say yes, will you please just slow down?
Did you know traffic signals were invented by Big Oil to waste fuel and drive up profits?<eos> If I say yes, will you please just slow down?<eos> Look out!<eos> Wait.<eos> Is this the part where you act the basic bitch and tell me you got your eye on me and that you don't trust me?
Gridlocked.<eos> There it is.<eos> If you run into trouble, dial nine.<eos> It's an old Gibbons fail-safe.<eos> You crashed my party!
I'm gonna crash yours.<eos> Have fun.<eos> This ain't a party.<eos> This is a race.<eos> What the hell you think you're doing?
What the hell's going on out there?<eos> Empty.<eos> Adele, Xander's in.<eos> Find the target, light him up.<eos> Gibbons thought you'd be back.
This is touching.<eos> Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.<eos> I'm walking out of here, Xander.<eos> You want to know a secret?<eos> You forgot to put deodorant on?
You want to know a secret?<eos> You forgot to put deodorant on?<eos> I killed Gibbons because he was a self-righteous prick.<eos> Do you have a shot?<eos> Adele, do you have eyes on the target?
Adele, do you have eyes on the target?<eos> I'm switching to thermal.<eos> I was never going to stop downing satellites no matter what happened.<eos> You know why? Because this world has turned--<eos> Please, please, please tell me you have a shot.
X, can't see you guys.<eos> Thermal's no good.<eos> - Right?<eos> - I've lost you in the heat.<eos> You don't see what's going on in this world?
Read between the lines.<eos> Isn't it right?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> What's been bugging me this whole time is you've got something stuck in between your teeth.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?
They're gonna send an extraction team to pick you guys up.<eos> But they're taking Xiang.<eos> Oh, and, Serena, if you don't hear from me, remember, dial nine.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?
Clear out, let's go!<eos> It's showtime.<eos> I guess we're on the same team now.<eos> Give me one.<eos> You know me.
- I've got a plan!<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Listen!<eos> From now on, I make the plans, you execute!
Darius Stone.<eos> Triple-X since 2005.<eos> Thanks for the assist.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> You got to be kidding.
They say it's the last great adventure.<eos> Be sure to send a postcard.<eos> I live for this shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> Nicks, I hope you got that on camera!
Now I know why.<eos> It's exactly the way I left it.<eos> I took it on a date or two.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> That's why I figured you'd come through.
X takes care of its own.<eos> That's why I figured you'd come through.<eos> To get a chance to work with the legendary Xander Cage?<eos> Where do I sign up?<eos> You know, you done pissed on the wrong damn picnic.
I wouldn't have it any other way.<eos> We thought we'd end with Augustus' favorite song.<eos> Wow, that's an impressive trick.<eos> What?<eos> Think you're the only one who knows how to play dead?
This is some pretty surreal shit, being at your own funeral.<eos> I love that song.<eos> And it could be a wonderful world, if we just stopped doing bad shit to it.<eos> If you wanted me out of retirement, you could've just asked me.<eos> You always responded to less subtle motivation.
And it could be a wonderful world, if we just stopped doing bad shit to it.<eos> If you wanted me out of retirement, you could've just asked me.<eos> You always responded to less subtle motivation.<eos> Now what?<eos> You keep being the rebel the world doesn't know it needs.
Let me simplify it for you.<eos> Kick some ass.<eos> Get the girl.<eos> And try to look dope while you're doing it.<eos> You can do "dope," can't you?
Shit!<eos> We were invited to Henry Grotsky's son's wedding.<eos> We got invited to Henry Grotsky's son's wedding?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are you saying it like that?
We're going.<eos> This place will be fine without us for a weekend.<eos> No.<eos> Not going.<eos> Jerry, you're the president of idiots.
This place will be fine without us for a weekend.<eos> No.<eos> Not going.<eos> Jerry, you're the president of idiots.<eos> Bina, you're the dummy who voted me into office.
I'm flat-out naked in here, so...<eos> Renzo Eckberg, your manhood is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> Your manhood is a glory to God.<eos> Open the door a crack, I'll fling it in.<eos> This could be how you meet the love of your life.
Your manhood is a glory to God.<eos> Open the door a crack, I'll fling it in.<eos> This could be how you meet the love of your life.<eos> Girls are always so drunk and emotional at weddings.<eos> Maybe that's where you'll really shine.
You look good, ladies.<eos> Right here.<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> Hi. Hey.<eos> You're here.
I'll see you in there.<eos> Hi. Hey.<eos> You're here.<eos> That's c...<eos> Why are you here?
Oh, my God, just...<eos> Have fun!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Give a sign, I need to know I wish I could be there to be your wingman, honey.<eos> Whether you get a girl to smile or whether she runs away, it's all good.
Jo Flanagan.<eos> That's Jo with a "J" and an "O" and no "E."<eos> I'm Renzo.<eos> With an "E" and an "O" and no "J."<eos> You have an intense look about you, Renzo.
You guys swingers?<eos> No, you're not. Right?<eos> No.<eos> Renzo, pick up the phone. Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Did you not request a singles' table?
Did you not request a singles' table?<eos> Because so far, it's slim pickings.<eos> It was on the RSVP. You put it there yourself.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> And how are you so sure you're not with the singles?
Megan-Ann. Okay.<eos> I will not forget.<eos> I should have married Leroy while I had the chance.<eos> Leroy knew where to put his hands.<eos> Ah, you're the killer, Nyung.
- Bina and Jerry Kepp.<eos> - Right.<eos> And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.<eos> And you're Grotsky's friend's kid?
- Right.<eos> And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.<eos> And you're Grotsky's friend's kid?<eos> You requested the singles' table. That was never gonna happen.
Okay, what's going on, man?<eos> Meanwhile, enjoy the open bar.<eos> Come on, what does that mean?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means you leave me a voicemail telling me to tell Francie not to open your RSVP card.
Meanwhile, enjoy the open bar.<eos> Come on, what does that mean?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means you leave me a voicemail telling me to tell Francie not to open your RSVP card.<eos> Then you leave me a voicemail telling me that you're coming and then another one saying "Disregard the last one."
Come on, what does that mean?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means you leave me a voicemail telling me to tell Francie not to open your RSVP card.<eos> Then you leave me a voicemail telling me that you're coming and then another one saying "Disregard the last one."<eos> So that's what I mean, what are you doing here?

You listened to all those voicemails?<eos> Hey, guys, right here.<eos> Come on, El, please don't go all crazy.<eos> "All crazy"? Now what does that mean?<eos> It means you get mad.
Nikki can calm down.<eos> What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?
What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?<eos> You're right.
Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?<eos> You're right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.
Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?<eos> You're right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's none of my business if you cheated on me with her.
What?<eos> Why should it even bother me?<eos> Come on!<eos> I didn't cheat on you with her.<eos> It started after we broke up and you dropped out as maid of honor.
Come on!<eos> I didn't cheat on you with her.<eos> It started after we broke up and you dropped out as maid of honor.<eos> How does a guy who...<eos> After two years, you break up with me over text?
It started after we broke up and you dropped out as maid of honor.<eos> How does a guy who...<eos> After two years, you break up with me over text?<eos> "Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me?
After two years, you break up with me over text?<eos> "Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me?<eos> What the f...<eos> You're an asshole.
"Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me?<eos> What the f...<eos> You're an asshole.<eos> Oh, my God, you're such an asshole.
What the f...<eos> You're an asshole.<eos> Oh, my God, you're such an asshole.<eos> You're a ridiculous asshole.<eos> Why don't you just go home?
Just don't make a scene.<eos> Why does everyone keep saying I do that?<eos> Hey, Jerry Kepp. Uh-huh.<eos> Just a hypothetical.<eos> If someone offered you 20 bucks to go up to our room and read your book in the tub, would you?
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> Bina, stand up.<eos> Bina, please, stand up right now, please.<eos> Why?<eos> I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.
Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.<eos> I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.<eos> But you have to stop now.
I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.<eos> But you have to stop now.<eos> I fit into this family.<eos> You never did.
I was Teddy's first choice for a girlfriend.<eos> Sometimes, first sticks.<eos> Sometimes, it doesn't.<eos> He listened to every voicemail I sent, so what does that tell you?<eos> Tells me you don't know when to stop calling.
That's funny. Last week, I did a search history on our computer.<eos> And one of us looked up "Topless Dame Helen Mirren."<eos> Wasn't me.<eos> M-I-R-R-E-N.<eos> Why did you do that?
And one of us looked up "Topless Dame Helen Mirren."<eos> Wasn't me.<eos> M-I-R-R-E-N.<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> Why did you come here?
Since when does a man need a reason to go to a wedding with his own wife?<eos> See?<eos> He has a pathological aversion to answering a question directly.<eos> He always answers with another question.<eos> Why did you make Facebook friends with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?
He has a pathological aversion to answering a question directly.<eos> He always answers with another question.<eos> Why did you make Facebook friends with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?<eos> You answered with a question.<eos> Why are you looking at my Facebook?
Tom Fo?<eos> Well, Henry Grotsky owns five diners in Central Ohio.<eos> We own a diner in Central Ohio.<eos> Everyone who owns a diner in Central Ohio is Facebook friends.<eos> You'd know that if you paid attention.
Well.<eos> I'd probably say this corner right here is where I'd go for that.<eos> The meter clicks Ugh.<eos> Please don't let me make a fool of myself.<eos> Mom, you could never make a fool of yourself.
I'd probably say this corner right here is where I'd go for that.<eos> The meter clicks Ugh.<eos> Please don't let me make a fool of myself.<eos> Mom, you could never make a fool of yourself.<eos> You couldn't make it.
Watch it!<eos> What?<eos> It was lovely to dance with you.<eos> How did I not just get kissed?<eos> It happens more often than you think.
It was lovely to dance with you.<eos> How did I not just get kissed?<eos> It happens more often than you think.<eos> Uh... I'm Eloise, by the way.<eos> Who are you?
I shouldn't.<eos> Sure.<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?
Yeah.<eos> Oh, God, you're not somebody's date in there, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Because you're not at a table.<eos> You're crashing the wedding?
Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?<eos> What? Huh?<eos> You children are such a disappointment.<eos> Go away, please.<eos> You're right.
But what's done is done.<eos> No.<eos> Wait.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> He ended it with a text message when you told him you were pregnant.
It's true?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can everybody just get out of here, please?<eos> So what do we do?<eos> What do you mean, "What do we do?"
That won't be easy.<eos> Teddy Millner is leaving you to raise a child alone.<eos> If you even go...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> If you even go through with the pregnancy.
I don't want to get involved with hookers.<eos> They don't provide them.<eos> You guys probably already know this, but that's not a question you're supposed to ask a fancy place like this unless you're a successful businessman.<eos> Which I am.<eos> Are you okay?
Please get lost. Excuse me.<eos> Hello.<eos> Jerry Kepp. Diner associate on the Grotsky side.<eos> Hello.<eos> Did you or did you not dump this girl after getting her pregnant?
Did you or did you not dump this girl after getting her pregnant?<eos> I'm sorry, what's going on now?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?
I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?<eos> Okay.<eos> You didn't tell them what you said.
I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?<eos> Okay.<eos> You didn't tell them what you said.<eos> Wait, what did you say?
She said that we'd be ridiculous parents.<eos> No, I...<eos> Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.
No, I...<eos> Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.
Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.<eos> Then I asked you if you would want to keep it and you didn't say anything to that.
You said I'd be a ridiculous father.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to keep it.<eos> Then I asked you if you would want to keep it and you didn't say anything to that.<eos> So then I said we were ridiculous.<eos> It was after you called me ridiculous because why would you want to keep our kid if you thought that I was just a...
So then I said we were ridiculous.<eos> It was after you called me ridiculous because why would you want to keep our kid if you thought that I was just a...<eos> That I was just a joke?<eos> It was before.<eos> And you were looking for a way out, man!
And you were looking for a way out, man!<eos> I get that now.<eos> Everyone we know says we were wrong together.<eos> Your mother wouldn't stop saying that I was not the kind of girl who ended up with you.<eos> And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.
And when it was time for you to stand up and say that she's wrong and they're all wrong and they're idiots and stand by me, then you ask me if I want to keep it.<eos> That's your first question.<eos> What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.
What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.
I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, I asked if you wanted to keep the kid.
And not you.<eos> You two can drop by and choose something from the mini fridge.<eos> That was the worst invitation to anything I've ever received, ever.<eos> Is your room this way?<eos> Or are you just following us?
Just following.<eos> Honestly, it still sounds better than junior prom, honey.<eos> Junior prom is a horror show.<eos> Well, if the thinking was for me to see people at their most happy, I would have to say that seems to be a huge miscalculation.<eos> Did you just break another chair?
Bina took over her family's diner.<eos> And I got suckered into managing it after we got married just like she wanted.<eos> Like I wanted?<eos> Who else would've wanted that?<eos> You asked my father if you could.
And I got suckered into managing it after we got married just like she wanted.<eos> Like I wanted?<eos> Who else would've wanted that?<eos> You asked my father if you could.<eos> You renamed the family diner after yourself.
I would have danced with you.<eos> Now, in high school, I certainly would have danced with you.<eos> And if you want to dance now, we can just turn on the radio and just dance.<eos> I don't think so, but thank you.<eos> You smiled
You smiled<eos> You smiled<eos> And then the spell was cast<eos> Now here we are in heaven<eos> 'Cause you are mine
The world feels almost perfect right now.<eos> Crap!<eos> That's cool.<eos> I'm cool.<eos> I know why you came!
I'm cool.<eos> I know why you came!<eos> You love weddings?<eos> Please.<eos> You couldn't get through our wedding day fast enough.
I know why you came!<eos> You love weddings?<eos> Please.<eos> You couldn't get through our wedding day fast enough.<eos> It's funny it took me so long because honestly, Bina, I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me.
You couldn't get through our wedding day fast enough.<eos> It's funny it took me so long because honestly, Bina, I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.
It's funny it took me so long because honestly, Bina, I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.<eos> When you went to the bathroom in the nanny's room, you used the phone.
Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.<eos> When you went to the bathroom in the nanny's room, you used the phone.<eos> Uh-huh. I know this because a little light came on in the bedroom when you did that.
You're many things, Bina, but surprising is not one of them.<eos> When you went to the bathroom in the nanny's room, you used the phone.<eos> Uh-huh. I know this because a little light came on in the bedroom when you did that.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, who did you call, Bina?
You only know two people at this wedding and I'm one of them.<eos> You're arranging to meet with Henry Grotsky after the wedding's over?<eos> Maybe back in the ballroom after the happy couple is gone and I'm upstairs in the room?<eos> You're gonna sell our diner to Henry Grotsky.<eos> You don't out-detective me, Bina Kepp.
We could open our own ladies' detective agency.<eos> Put Mr. Kepp out of business.<eos> How bad?<eos> Oh, I'd say that<eos> I'm due around the same time you are.
Probably better than okay.<eos> So we danced.<eos> And that's it.<eos> That's all it takes.<eos> Find out the one thing you're good at, make sure the girls know about it.
Francie doesn't even remember me, does she?<eos> Ah, those rotten kids.<eos> What did you ever see in that boy?<eos> I can't even think about it.<eos> What if you came here for a different reason today?
Ah, those rotten kids.<eos> What did you ever see in that boy?<eos> I can't even think about it.<eos> What if you came here for a different reason today?<eos> What if you went away with someone better?
Sure.<eos> We hope it all works out for you.<eos> It'd be great if it did.<eos> Cousin Walter?<eos> I'm glad you could come.
I felt like we weren't even in the same place, you know?<eos> No.<eos> It's the same wedding no matter what table you're at, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm so glad you came over because I was just saying I'm so tired.
Gonna head out. Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> You look so beautiful.
And this was great.<eos> Bye, guys.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.
Hey.<eos> I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.<eos> And I get that. Totally understand.<eos> And it will probably suck for you to have to see me again under any circumstances which is why I wanted to say that whatever happened between us and however it ended<eos> I think, you know, I could be a really good dad, probably, if you'll just... If you'll let me.
And it will probably suck for you to have to see me again under any circumstances which is why I wanted to say that whatever happened between us and however it ended<eos> I think, you know, I could be a really good dad, probably, if you'll just... If you'll let me.<eos> So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?
I think, you know, I could be a really good dad, probably, if you'll just... If you'll let me.<eos> So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.
Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?
What?<eos> It's crazy! It is!<eos> It so is!<eos> It's crazy! After everything.<eos> Sweetheart, you're embarrassing yourself!
Shut up, Nikki!<eos> Shut up.<eos> What?<eos> I can't not be in love with you.<eos> You screw up all the time.
It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!<eos> And I don't want to disappoint anybody but you.<eos> What are you saying?
He didn't show up.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> And the people we were supposed to become together, they never showed up.<eos> Was there ever a time you would have done that for me?
Was there ever a time you would have done that for me?<eos> Just, like, shout out across a lake at me, in front of a bunch of strangers, about how you really felt about me?<eos> We shout at each other in front of strangers all the time.<eos> I'll take that as a no.<eos> Would you do that for me?
The Bina I married would never cheat on me.<eos> Well, the Jerry I married...<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> The Jerry you married what?
You deal with it 'cause you have to!<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, you do!<eos> That's life!<eos> You're ridiculous and a mess!
Do you?<eos> Yeah, you do!<eos> That's life!<eos> You're ridiculous and a mess!<eos> And you still hope that you'll find someone who'll think that you're okay enough to be loved.
You're ridiculous and a mess!<eos> And you still hope that you'll find someone who'll think that you're okay enough to be loved.<eos> Is that what life is?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> And it's really weird that you don't know that by now!
Well, I don't know which way we're going.<eos> Wasn't there a shortcut here?<eos> We missed it.<eos> I showed up.<eos> Oh, I heard what you said to the dumb girl at table seven.
Thank you.<eos> Is it good?<eos> Yeah, really good.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What did you say?
Oh, shit.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Oh, my Lord!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> What did you say back there?
Holy shit!<eos> What did you say back there?<eos> It was... What did you do? It was hard to hear, you know, with, like, the wind and Nikki in my ear, and then, when I got on the railing, everybody started shouting.<eos> And then underwater, you can't, like, hear anything underwater.<eos> But it sounded like, you know, you were getting to something good.

It was like about how, if you're, shit, ready to be, like, the person who always forgives me, then I want to be the person who always forgives you.
Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> Please don't slam the door, even for that.<eos> Ringo?<eos> You're gonna make him fat.
You're gonna make him fat.<eos> Oh, yeah, I am.<eos> Well, we are.<eos> Here you go, Ringo.<eos> Okay, you're sure you didn't forget anybody?
Baby.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you know, if you forget the baby... I'm not sure I believe you when you say you didn't forget any of our friends.
- It's just brah.<eos> Later!<eos> I told you, you don't have to do this every day.<eos> I want to.<eos> You saved my sister's life.
Hey, come on, man, why don't you leave my boys alone, and get off this big wheel and come join me for a run?<eos> What are you saying, that I need to work out?<eos> That I'm, what, looking smaller?<eos> No!<eos> You're looking big.
What are you saying, that I need to work out?<eos> That I'm, what, looking smaller?<eos> No!<eos> You're looking big.<eos> I don't know how you fit in that uniform, man.
Jesus.<eos> Hey, what's up, buddy?<eos> - Hey, Mitch.<eos> - Hey, can I see that?<eos> - Where'd you get this?
- You're Zane.<eos> Why don't you step out of my line, Zane?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You need to understand one thing, Zane.
You need to understand one thing, Zane.<eos> We're a family here.<eos> A team.<eos> And we support each other.<eos> - You're out.
Why don't you put a baby in me?<eos> - Now. - You know, honestly...<eos> I was thinking dinner first.<eos> But we could try the baby thing, if you want.<eos> You are trying. Way too hard.
Help!<eos> C.J., help! My friend is choking!<eos> Help!<eos> No, not C.J. Not C.J. No, no!<eos> Are you okay? You're choking.
Help!<eos> No, not C.J. Not C.J. No, no!<eos> Are you okay? You're choking.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Are you okay?
Oh, God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Ronnie. - You're gonna be just fine.<eos> Thank you!<eos> - Ronnie, are you okay?
Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> No, don't touch, don't touch.<eos> Okay. I'm so good.<eos> You did good, good, good work.
- Mitch, hey, need you.<eos> No, no, not Mitch. Don't bring Mitch over.<eos> - Hey. - Hey, Mitch is here.<eos> Ronnie, you pumped about the qualifiers, buddy?<eos> You know it, man. I'm just... I'm really...
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Nope. Still stuck.<eos> I mean, if you think about it, it's a good thing, right?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Hey, how you feeling, sport?
Hey, how you feeling, sport?<eos> Better, but could we get some sort of perimeter going for the crowd?<eos> Nah. Nobody's looking.<eos> Just us.<eos> God, you're lying.
- Just like pulling a tooth.<eos> - What?<eos> Don't you touch my dick!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Ronnie, are you okay?
Ronnie, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, no, I'm good.<eos> I'm proud of you, Ronnie.<eos> Fuck you, Dave.<eos> You're my worst friend.
And I'm here to create an opportunity for you.<eos> I'm sure they'll come around.<eos> I'm sure they will, too.<eos> Why does she always look like she's running in slo-mo?<eos> You see it, too?
- Okay. - Okay.<eos> I got my dick stuck in a chair earlier.<eos> - What? You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You haven't heard about this?
- Lieutenant to you.<eos> - "Lieutenant"?<eos> Like in the army?<eos> Let me save you some time. Okay?<eos> You're not gonna be my big brother here and put me on the right path.
- Yeah?<eos> The problem is, that's not the course.<eos> That's not the course?<eos> So here's what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna go over to the real course, and if you beat me over there, not only are you on the team, but I won't fuck with you anymore and I'll call you by your real name.
Really?<eos> Refrigerators?<eos> ...98, 99, 100!<eos> That was bullshit, Mitch.<eos> You know I was already gassed.
I made it.<eos> I made it! Oh, my God.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You don't ever have to thank me.<eos> You did this one on your own.
I made it onto...<eos> Wait.<eos> Do not tell me that I'm the tech guy.<eos> No!<eos> No, I chose you because you have heart, no quit and you leave it all out on the beach.
No!<eos> No, I chose you because you have heart, no quit and you leave it all out on the beach.<eos> - Thanks, Mitch. - Congratulations.<eos> Hey, High School Musical.<eos> You were reckless out there.
- See you then.<eos> Let's go, Frankie.<eos> Brody?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What are you doing?
You know, stargazing.<eos> Under a pier?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That way.<eos> Look, you're on the team, and I don't want anyone on the team sleeping outside, so...
Keep your hands up.<eos> One, two, duck! Again.<eos> One, two, duck!<eos> Nice!<eos> What you doing there, killer?
What?<eos> Very important lesson.<eos> That is the Devil's Urchin.<eos> One prick out of that thing will give you enough adrenaline to choke out a pissed-off bull.<eos> The only problem is, after that, you say some crazy-ass shit, and then you fucking die.
- Why you, Ted?<eos> Why?<eos> Don't you do this to me, Ted!<eos> Don't you do this!<eos> Okay, no. But, seriously, I got to help you because you are gonna kill someone with that technique.
Yeah.<eos> Did you just look at my boobs?<eos> I... Was not my intention.<eos> I didn't stare directly at them.<eos> You're looking at them right now.
Did you just look at my boobs?<eos> I... Was not my intention.<eos> I didn't stare directly at them.<eos> You're looking at them right now.<eos> 'Cause you're talking about them.
If it's gonna be a problem for you...<eos> There's not a problem for me.<eos> - At all. Cool.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right. You just looked at them again.
- At all. Cool.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right. You just looked at them again.<eos> - No, I didn't. I was... I didn't...<eos> Well, when you point them out like that...
I can't feel my face!<eos> Okay, call Coast Guard.<eos> We got a 10-73.<eos> - I'm gonna take the WaveRunner. - "10-73"?<eos> You and C.J. take Rescue One.
Go, go, go!<eos> Lock your arms around my waist or you're gonna fucking fall off again!<eos> - This is so awkward, dude.<eos> - Hold on. Hold on.<eos> How many buckets of lotion do you wear a day?
Lock your arms around my waist or you're gonna fucking fall off again!<eos> - This is so awkward, dude.<eos> - Hold on. Hold on.<eos> How many buckets of lotion do you wear a day?<eos> You're like a greasy, hairless gorilla.
Portside!<eos> Miss, are you okay?<eos> Can you help me? Are you all right? Are you hurt?<eos> Brody!<eos> Are you okay?
Is he going to be okay?<eos> Do you know what happened to the Councilman?<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> We were partying, and then when we came upstairs, the boat was already on fire.<eos> You disobeyed an order out there, put yourself in danger.
Do you know what happened to the Councilman?<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> We were partying, and then when we came upstairs, the boat was already on fire.<eos> You disobeyed an order out there, put yourself in danger.<eos> You can't save anyone if you die.
- Damn, Ronnie.<eos> - C.J.!<eos> Please!<eos> Shit.<eos> I never really heard a guy sing that song, but you're really good.
Please!<eos> Shit.<eos> I never really heard a guy sing that song, but you're really good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> C.J., what are you doing here?
A guy died.<eos> Maybe this is why we keep losing recruits.<eos> - They can't handle it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, now that you know our job is much more than you expected, right, the stakes are higher.
How about sand grifters running a con on the beach, right?<eos> Well, I'm not exactly sure what a sand grifter is, Stephanie.<eos> But I would probably call the cops.<eos> Sand grifters are beach thieves.<eos> Okay, so while you're working on your tan, they're stealing things from families on the beach.
All his money is tied up in real estate in the bay.<eos> Well, I guess you'll have to help me persuade him some other way.<eos> Every man has a price.<eos> Speaking of which, I know you've been using my special set of skills for your own nefarious purposes, but additional compensation would go a long way in motivating me to keep my mouth shut.<eos> You're blackmailing me.
- Thanks.<eos> Do we have a deal, or...<eos> I need some closure.<eos> - Hi. You look really nice.<eos> Hey, you look really nice, too, Baby Gap.
- Hi. You look really nice.<eos> Hey, you look really nice, too, Baby Gap.<eos> That shirt come in big-boy size?<eos> Well, at least I'm undercover.<eos> Look at you. You didn't even try.
Summer, keep an eye on Leeds and her thugs.<eos> Then Mitch and I will search the place for where she hides the product.<eos> - Brody?<eos> - What?<eos> - You're our lookout.
I can't have this unraveling.<eos> Got it?<eos> Now go clean up your mess.<eos> Brody.<eos> I'm so glad you came.
And it's fucking delicious.<eos> All right, I think I got something.<eos> Found our access point.<eos> Where is Brody?<eos> Have you seen him?
No.<eos> No time.<eos> We gotta move without him.<eos> Yeah, but we need our lookout.<eos> What's your deal? You like torturing guys?
What's your deal? You like torturing guys?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> Well, I mean, I have three brothers, so I've had a lot of practice.<eos> I take it you're an only child.
I mean, I've always wondered what happened that night.<eos> I knew the relay was the next day, but those guys...<eos> They didn't care about me.<eos> They just needed me to win.<eos> Well, you certainly made sure they did not win.
Okay? I lost all my sponsors.<eos> I'm an Olympic champion and I'm fucking broke.<eos> - Ronnie, hey.<eos> - What?<eos> Okay, listen. I need you to create a distraction for Leeds.
Yes! - No!<eos> - No!<eos> - God damn it, Ronnie.<eos> You listen to me, and you listen good.<eos> Every team has a ringer, and you and only you are my ringer.
- God damn it, Ronnie.<eos> You listen to me, and you listen good.<eos> Every team has a ringer, and you and only you are my ringer.<eos> Well, then I guess I'm your ringer.<eos> You are my goddamn ringer.
You can't blame me, right?<eos> So juvenile.<eos> I'm onto you all.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for whatever that was.<eos> You did good, Ronnie.
You were supposed to be there for us tonight.<eos> You had a job to do.<eos> And now you're trashed.<eos> See, I just... I don't understand this, man.<eos> If you really think that there's drugs here, call the police.
If you really think that there's drugs here, call the police.<eos> And then what?<eos> We get a few minnows?<eos> The big whale gets away?<eos> Do you hear yourself when you talk?
Do you hear yourself when you talk?<eos> I dare you to say one thing without the ocean in it.<eos> I dare you.<eos> We were depending on you tonight.<eos> And you fucked up... Again.
And you fucked up... Again.<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> Really?<eos> Get this through your head, Mitch.<eos> You're not a cop. You're not the fucking Equalizer.
Watch yourself.<eos> Really?<eos> Get this through your head, Mitch.<eos> You're not a cop. You're not the fucking Equalizer.<eos> You're a lifeguard, Mitch, who sits in his fucking tower all day, 'cause that's the only place he has any sort of power.
Come on.<eos> Don't fucking touch me.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Or what?<eos> What're you gonna do, Mitch?
Hey, man, I think... I think we both said a few things last night that we didn't mean.<eos> Not me.<eos> I meant every word.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You've never gotten drunk and said something you don't mean?
Seriously?<eos> I fucked up, man.<eos> I know that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I watched you win two gold medals.
I fucked up, man.<eos> I know that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I watched you win two gold medals.<eos> You were amazing when it was just you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I watched you win two gold medals.<eos> You were amazing when it was just you.<eos> But when it came to the relay, being part of your team, your Olympic team, your family,<eos> you blew it. 'Cause you're selfish.
you blew it. 'Cause you're selfish.<eos> Baywatch is our team.<eos> Baywatch is our family.<eos> These are the keys to our house.<eos> But you've proven to me that you don't want to be part of this family.
Baywatch is our family.<eos> These are the keys to our house.<eos> But you've proven to me that you don't want to be part of this family.<eos> So you're done.<eos> 'Cause the only thing you give a shit about is yourself and your medals.
These are the keys to our house.<eos> But you've proven to me that you don't want to be part of this family.<eos> So you're done.<eos> 'Cause the only thing you give a shit about is yourself and your medals.<eos> You talking 'bout this medal?
Listen, Mitch, I know I messed up, okay?<eos> I should have listened.<eos> I want to be a part of this team.<eos> And I will not let you down again, I swear.<eos> And by the way, I think you're right about Leeds.
And the coroner's office just released his body.<eos> And I got a plan.<eos> Guys, I still don't understand what part of the plan this is.<eos> - Just go with the flow, Brody.<eos> - Yeah, you were in a very bad accident.
Okay, clear.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Okay, left turn, left turn.<eos> What the fuck? Who taught you how to drive, Stevie fucking Wonder?<eos> You're huge, man.
Not touching the man's scrotum. Lift his ball sac and check for anything unusual.<eos> There's... Fuck.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Dude, it's a taint, man, it's a taint.<eos> - You didn't even look.
- Dude, it's a taint, man, it's a taint.<eos> - You didn't even look.<eos> My God.<eos> Dude, there's been gloves here literally the entire time.<eos> You didn't even say anything. Yeah... That...
Dude, there's been gloves here literally the entire time.<eos> You didn't even say anything. Yeah... That...<eos> I'm going in.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Tell me what you see.
All right, check this out.<eos> Cervical fractures of the fifth, sixth and seventh vertebrae.<eos> That's how he was killed.<eos> Broken neck.<eos> That could have happened any time. I mean, you jumped off the boat with him, right?
- Our drawers are empty.<eos> I'm the only one with a body in my drawer?<eos> Shut up!<eos> She smells like cheese toast and chowder.<eos> Holy Christ. You just tickled another man's taint.
- It did it again.<eos> - Nothing's dripping on me.<eos> - Listen to me. Formaldehyde melts fat. - What?<eos> That's what's dripping on your face, necrotic liquid fat.<eos> Now will you shut the fuck up?
It's him.<eos> Rodriguez. It is him.<eos> You got the fake files?<eos> Relax.<eos> We're only here 'cause you broke his fucking neck.
Check this out.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That's a very nice scooter.<eos> Have you ever seen the Olympics?<eos> - Why are you grabbing me so tight?
Excuse me.<eos> That's a very nice scooter.<eos> Have you ever seen the Olympics?<eos> - Why are you grabbing me so tight?<eos> - Why the fuck are you driving?
- Yeah, I see them.<eos> Go get them.<eos> Stay on the pathway. You get the white one.<eos> All right.<eos> You're just slowing me down, anyway.
- Hey, Summer. Here.<eos> Hey. - Oh, my God!<eos> - Where's your phone?<eos> That's not my phone!<eos> - Summer, you okay?
Wait!<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> No baby pictures.<eos> - Have some class.<eos> - You're right.
Hey, what are you saying? You're just gonna let those guys walk?<eos> Okay, how do I explain this so that you people understand?<eos> "You people"?<eos> You don't get to say that.<eos> You're just tan.
- Right on.<eos> - Come on, brother.<eos> Look, even if you were police, which you're not, and even if this was your jurisdiction, which it isn't, and even if you had probable cause to pursue, which you definitely don't, what you did would still be totally illegal.<eos> Okay, well, I mean, it's a good thing we're not police, then.<eos> It's like you purposely only hear 1% of what I say.
- Come on, brother.<eos> Look, even if you were police, which you're not, and even if this was your jurisdiction, which it isn't, and even if you had probable cause to pursue, which you definitely don't, what you did would still be totally illegal.<eos> Okay, well, I mean, it's a good thing we're not police, then.<eos> It's like you purposely only hear 1% of what I say.<eos> Mitch, did you pull Brody off the beach to break into the medical examiner's office earlier today?
- Splish, splash.<eos> - Otherwise, I'll fire you.<eos> Now I gotta go clean up this mess that you made.<eos> Obviously, you have every reason to be upset, and I apologize.<eos> So, do you always do the opposite of what people ask you to do?
They're the ones who supply all the fish to the Huntley Club, right?<eos> - So?<eos> - So the question is, who the fuck is Angelo?<eos> I saw barrels like that down in the Huntley, and now they're on the back of her yacht.<eos> Oh, my God. Mitch, you're impossible.
- What was I supposed to do?<eos> Well, what we're supposed to do is find the fucking flakka.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Angelo's Fish Company. There it is.<eos> You are so selfish.
Yeah. That takes balls.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> It's like Breaking Bad in there.<eos> Yeah, dude, Breaking Bad.<eos> - You were right.
I want you off the beach.<eos> I'm putting Brody in charge.<eos> No way.<eos> - There's not a chance...<eos> Hey... - You can do this in your sleep.
- There's not a chance...<eos> Hey... - You can do this in your sleep.<eos> That's not what I'm saying. I don't want the position. I don't...<eos> You have two gold medals, okay?<eos> You're like the Stephen Hawking of swimming, minus the total paralysis part.
I'm no longer interested in your opinion, Buchannon.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Brody. Brody, hang back.<eos> Okay, it's just me and you now.<eos> If you can help me keep your new pals in line, I can make sure that you stick around here for a long, long time.
Please call us back.<eos> We're worried about you.<eos> Yo, Mitch.<eos> It's Brody.<eos> I hit you on the C.B., so I know you're listening.
We're worried about you.<eos> Yo, Mitch.<eos> It's Brody.<eos> I hit you on the C.B., so I know you're listening.<eos> I hope you haven't gone crazy and started eating carbs or something.
- and there's broadband...<eos> - All right.<eos> Yeah, sure. Samsung has all the capabilities of the I.T. process, and...<eos> Mind if I cut in for a second?<eos> What are you doing here?
- All right.<eos> Yeah, sure. Samsung has all the capabilities of the I.T. process, and...<eos> Mind if I cut in for a second?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to remind you who you are.
I'm here to remind you who you are.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Snap out of it!<eos> Shoes?<eos> You're wearing worker man shoes?
Come on, buddy.<eos> Snap out of it!<eos> Shoes?<eos> You're wearing worker man shoes?<eos> Really, how far have you fallen?
- I'd love to buy a...<eos> - Mitch?<eos> - Yes, Mitch.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You don't just protect the bay.
- Mitch?<eos> - Yes, Mitch.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You don't just protect the bay.<eos> You are the bay.
Yo, this cooler is... Cool.<eos> Yo, Ellerbee? What's up, man? How you doing?<eos> Lieutenant Brody! What you got in the cooler?<eos> Black market organs from the Boogie Board Bandits?<eos> You mean this?
It's your cheat day.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And by the way, I went ahead and added that extra protein for you, dawg.<eos> My man.<eos> - I know you're trying to keep up. - Yeah, man.
Come on, Summer.<eos> I think I found something big here, okay?<eos> I really need your help.<eos> Please?<eos> - You took marine biology, right?
Oh, my God, that's Dave!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> Hey, stop looking at the picture, dude.<eos> Ronnie, Ronnie, what did you just say?
Okay. So we just take a flash drive and we plug it in, you know.<eos> Get into her cloud and then steal all her cookies, right?<eos> And then we're...<eos> Straight through the firewall.<eos> Literally none of what you said made any sense.
Literally none of what you said made any sense.<eos> Straight over the firewall.<eos> It's not like a physical thing you do.<eos> Okay, I don't know what I'm talking about here, dude.<eos> - Just... Can you do it?
What the hell are we supposed to do with dirt, Ronnie?<eos> I meant evidence.<eos> - Evidence. - Evidence.<eos> Well, why didn't you say so, man?<eos> - Heck, yeah! - Thank God you're pretty.
I always knew I liked you two.<eos> - Enjoy the party.<eos> - You look amazing, by the way.<eos> Well, someone has to.<eos> What? What are you wearing?
Okay, well, militaries use it all over the world.<eos> But I'll tell him 2100.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I'll bet Lurch over here knows where Chen is.<eos> Mitch, if you can hear me, you were right.
We found the drugs on Leeds's boat.<eos> Hey.<eos> No guests allowed upstairs.<eos> Then I guess that means that you and I are all alone.<eos> And you look like a bad boy.
Put your hands where I can see them.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Summer! - Oh, my God.<eos> Did I kill him?<eos> No, you just knocked his ass out.
Why'd you have to go snooping?<eos> Maybe Thorpe was wrong about you after all.<eos> What?<eos> Thorpe? What are you talking about, "Thorpe"?<eos> You haven't figured that part out yet.
What?<eos> Thorpe? What are you talking about, "Thorpe"?<eos> You haven't figured that part out yet.<eos> Where I bribed him, you know, got Mitch fired, put your dumb ass in charge.<eos> All you had to do was be a lifeguard.
You haven't figured that part out yet.<eos> Where I bribed him, you know, got Mitch fired, put your dumb ass in charge.<eos> All you had to do was be a lifeguard.<eos> Get a tan.<eos> But instead, you tried to be like Mitch and save the bay.
Where I bribed him, you know, got Mitch fired, put your dumb ass in charge.<eos> All you had to do was be a lifeguard.<eos> Get a tan.<eos> But instead, you tried to be like Mitch and save the bay.<eos> Now let's see how long you can hold your breath.
No, just listen to me. Just listen...<eos> God...<eos> Fuck!<eos> No! You have to listen to me!<eos> You're fucking crazy.
God...<eos> Fuck!<eos> No! You have to listen to me!<eos> You're fucking crazy.<eos> If I was a man, you'd call me "driven."
Come on, buddy.<eos> How?<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> Ronnie, come in.<eos> Holy shit, Mitch, you got him!
Watch and learn.<eos> Ronnie, come in.<eos> Holy shit, Mitch, you got him!<eos> Yeah, he's alive and he's well.<eos> Ronnie, I need you to figure out a way to launch those fireworks.
We're on it. Fuck!<eos> I've never seen any interface like this.<eos> I don't know what to fucking do!<eos> Hey! Look at me, look at me, look at me!<eos> You are the tech guy.
I've never seen any interface like this.<eos> I don't know what to fucking do!<eos> Hey! Look at me, look at me, look at me!<eos> You are the tech guy.<eos> You are the motherfucking tech guy.
- Don't bother.<eos> He's dead.<eos> - Because of you.<eos> - Of course because of me.<eos> You do realize I'm holding a gun, right?
- Because of you.<eos> - Of course because of me.<eos> You do realize I'm holding a gun, right?<eos> So impulsive.<eos> That's why you walked right into my plan.
So impulsive.<eos> That's why you walked right into my plan.<eos> Leeds!<eos> For fuck's sake.<eos> Why don't you die already?
For fuck's sake.<eos> Why don't you die already?<eos> Let the little boy go.<eos> That's not how this story ends, Mitch.<eos> You see, you're not here to save him.
Let the little boy go.<eos> That's not how this story ends, Mitch.<eos> You see, you're not here to save him.<eos> After all, he took your job.<eos> So you shot him.
I don't know. That seems a little complicated.<eos> Yeah, that sounds cheesy.<eos> You won't get away with this!<eos> I already have, Mitch.<eos> You know the best thing about winning is that you get to write the story of what happened.
Until then...<eos> Go, baby.<eos> I'm oceanic, motherfucker.<eos> How tacky.<eos> - Mitch, you just blew her up!
How tacky.<eos> - Mitch, you just blew her up!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Plus I'm high as a motherfucker right now on Devil's Urchin.<eos> You stabbed yourself with one of those?
What took you so long with Leeds?<eos> I didn't want to make it seem like it was too easy.<eos> The adrenaline kept you alive.<eos> Thank God you make us carry these.<eos> You saved your own life this time.
Thank God you make us carry these.<eos> You saved your own life this time.<eos> - Thank you. - Yes.<eos> Hey...<eos> So I hear you were... You were right the whole time.
Hey! What part of "You're fired" do you not understand, Mitch?<eos> Get the fuck off my beach or I'll have you arrested.<eos> Hey, Thorpe.<eos> This is our beach, bitch.<eos> And you're under arrest.
Hey, Thorpe.<eos> This is our beach, bitch.<eos> And you're under arrest.<eos> That was a badass right cross, Brody.<eos> You just said my real name.
- Bacon?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Cinnabon?<eos> - I saw you do that.<eos> - You're still there.
- Thank you.<eos> - I mean, it's not exactly in the lifeguard manual, but...<eos> Well, I told you I would learn better if I had a study buddy.<eos> Don't get ahead of yourself.<eos> Oh, my God. Did you just... Look at my dick?
We're late.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> I found something.<eos> - How'd you get this?
Come on.<eos> I found something.<eos> - How'd you get this?<eos> - Well, it washed up on shore.<eos> You only threw it eight feet, dude.
I'm gonna get it. "In the coroner's report." Yes, we saw it in the coronary's report.<eos> - Ronnie. - What?<eos> Stop looking at the donuts like that and dump them.<eos> Oh, boy, that was fun.<eos> You're like a dolphin on cocaine, but not annoying at all.
- Ronnie. - What?<eos> Stop looking at the donuts like that and dump them.<eos> Oh, boy, that was fun.<eos> You're like a dolphin on cocaine, but not annoying at all.<eos> You're like if a human fucked a jet ski... Which is impossible, but it'd be so cool.
You're like a dolphin on cocaine, but not annoying at all.<eos> You're like if a human fucked a jet ski... Which is impossible, but it'd be so cool.<eos> Okay, I got this.<eos> - Come on, dude. Hurry up.<eos> - Fuck, how'd you do that?
Your hidden balls want to go to the cartel?<eos> - Right now.<eos> - It's just a third testicle.<eos> My balls are talking...<eos> I need you to check his taint for needle marks.
I like your chest as well.<eos> It doesn't work when you say it back to me like that.<eos> Hey, C.J., why do our suits ride so far up our asses?<eos> It makes us faster in the water.<eos> Did you just... Please.
I hope that doesn't make the boob-lers...<eos> I'd love it if you wore tighter pants.<eos> I really would.<eos> Why do you get to play Mitch Buchannon?<eos> You're joking.
Why do you get to play Mitch Buchannon?<eos> You're joking.<eos> No, I've been Mitch Buchannon for 20 years.<eos> Am I gonna be in the sequel?<eos> I think you should be in the sequel.
Jakob.<eos> Are you there, Jakob?
Jakob.<eos> Are you there, Jakob?<eos> Are you listening?
This is how it must be.<eos> Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.
Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.<eos> Let the words you speak be the words that call me back to you.
I promise I'm not like the others.<eos> I'm much worse.<eos> Please look at me, Jakob.<eos> I'd like to help you.<eos> Do you understand?
I have some things I need to ask.<eos> What things?<eos> Tomorrow, perhaps.<eos> To begin with, I will tell you what I see.<eos> I see... That if you wanted to speak, you could.
To begin with, I will tell you what I see.<eos> I see... That if you wanted to speak, you could.<eos> Hmm, and I see how hard it must be to truly say nothing.<eos> How hard you must be concentrating every moment.<eos> And I must admit, you're very good at it.
Nobody knew her as I did.<eos> Knew her moods, her needs.<eos> How I loved her.<eos> Jakob, was it you?<eos> If it was, then all you've done is tell me you're afraid.
Jakob.<eos> Jakob!<eos> Jakob!<eos> Help me down.<eos> You scared me, Jakob.
Jakob!<eos> Jakob!<eos> Help me down.<eos> You scared me, Jakob.<eos> But you've helped me realize something.
But you've helped me realize something.<eos> I can't leave you.<eos> I once knew a boy who thought he could hear his dead sister through the teeth of an old comb.<eos> He would sit with it for hours, listening and whispering his secrets.<eos> He was as sure of what he heard as you are.
I want to hear you speak.<eos> But I am not your enemy.<eos> I care about you.<eos> What is it?<eos> You wish to leave?
Angelica...<eos> La signora Malvina.<eos> Jakob?<eos> Come with me, please.<eos> I think you're afraid that if you speak, the voice will cease.
I know it well.<eos> However hard we wish them to, the dead remain silent.<eos> Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?
I... I'm a fool to speak lightly of it.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Jakob will be waiting.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, if you were to play, it would mean only what you wanted it to mean.
Perhaps your silence wouldn't horrify her as it does me.<eos> It is said that a true performer cares only for the love of her audience.<eos> Perhaps... Your silence is a fitting tribute.<eos> More adoration as she leaves the stage.<eos> What are you telling me, Jakob?
Perhaps... Your silence is a fitting tribute.<eos> More adoration as she leaves the stage.<eos> What are you telling me, Jakob?<eos> That I'm wrong or that I'm right?<eos> You can't...
And she is tired.<eos> And she is trapped.<eos> Jakob, we must help her.<eos> We must help her.<eos> You know what you must do.
Jakob, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's time.<eos> It's time.<eos> You have to let her go.
You have to let her go.<eos> No.<eos> Jakob!<eos> No, it has to be now.<eos> Do you understand?
In the moment...<eos> And maybe into infinity.<eos> But I didn't know any of that until right before I fell.<eos> The thing is, they don't get to know.<eos> You don't wake up with a bad feeling in your stomach or see shadows move.
Sammy, you like the bird I made you?<eos> Morning.<eos> Sammy!<eos> What?<eos> You forgot your gloves.
I'm gonna try not to be depressed because I'm single on cupid day.<eos> That's Valentine's day to you!<eos> Have insomnia or something, Linds?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - It's just cute - that you get up before us to get breakfast.
Yeah!<eos> No texting and driving.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'd never let my best friend die a virgin.<eos> You didn't think we'd forget, did you?
Opening night.<eos> Rob texted me. He said, "I made my bed for you." Ugh!<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> No glove, no love.<eos> You hear me?
We're fine.<eos> We're fine.<eos> Crazy.<eos> We're freakin' fine.<eos> How many roses did you get last year, Linds?
I'm not ashamed to admit it.<eos> Last year, Matt literally sent me a dozen red roses.<eos> Matt?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You just spent a whole week crying in the same pair of sweatpants, and it got dark.
Yeah?<eos> I don't know what my plans are.<eos> What everyone else ends up doing.<eos> See you tonight.<eos> No. You know the address.
Maybe someone should give me a ribbon. Like the ones that you used to have hanging on your wall, Sammy.<eos> Remember?<eos> From horseback riding?<eos> I was, like, ten years old, Lindsay.<eos> God, Sammy, you were such a nerd back then.
Who are these ones from?<eos> Your competition.<eos> I wanna see.<eos> Sam has no competition, Rob.<eos> You know it.
I wanna see.<eos> Sam has no competition, Rob.<eos> You know it.<eos> Okay, well, neither do I. So I guess we're perfect for each other.<eos> So you're going to that thing at Kent's tonight?
God, they're too cute.<eos> It's gross.<eos> Oh, you guys, tonight our "wittle" Sammy passes into womanhood.<eos> I'm so proud.<eos> I hope you shaved.
She really should appreciate it more.<eos> It's probably the only rose she'll ever get.<eos> Maybe it had something to do with the card.<eos> "Maybe next year, but probably not."<eos> it kinda look like you put it on your cheeks.
It's so effin' good.<eos> Can I post this one?<eos> Don't laugh at me.<eos> Linds?<eos> Were you nervous your first time?
What are you doing?<eos> Fart's house is actually kind of nice.<eos> If I'd known, I would've stopped calling him Danny Devito all year.<eos> I'm gonna go find Patrick.<eos> Will you be okay?
If I'd known, I would've stopped calling him Danny Devito all year.<eos> I'm gonna go find Patrick.<eos> Will you be okay?<eos> What? I'm gonna go find Patrick.<eos> Will you be okay?
What? I'm gonna go find Patrick.<eos> Will you be okay?<eos> Yeah. Mwah.<eos> Hey. Sam.<eos> You made it.
Sam.<eos> Sam. Hi!<eos> Whoo! Oh, I am sorry.<eos> Let me get that for you.<eos> How drunk are you?
Let me get that for you.<eos> How drunk are you?<eos> I'm not drunk. Don't worry about it.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're the hottest girl here.
Yes. Like in Patrick's mouth?<eos> Oops.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, she's so shitfaced.<eos> No, you're shitfaced, shitface.
Okay.<eos> Hey there, sweetie.<eos> Is that your first drink?<eos> You really should take it easy.<eos> You're a bitch!
Is that your first drink?<eos> You really should take it easy.<eos> You're a bitch!<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.
You really should take it easy.<eos> You're a bitch!<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.<eos> You're a goddamn fetched bitch just like your mother.
Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.<eos> You're a goddamn fetched bitch just like your mother.<eos> It's no wonder daddy left.<eos> You're a bitch too.
You heard me.<eos> You're a goddamn fetched bitch just like your mother.<eos> It's no wonder daddy left.<eos> You're a bitch too.<eos> What? You're a drunk.
It's no wonder daddy left.<eos> You're a bitch too.<eos> What? You're a drunk.<eos> And you...<eos> You're just pathetic.
You're just pathetic.<eos> You know what?<eos> We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?
Psycho.<eos> Did anyone at this party... Has anyone talked to you?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You weren't even invited.<eos> That's 'cause you're a freak.
Get out of here!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Go!<eos> Go back to the ward, you psycho bitch!<eos> Are you okay?
So you attack her?<eos> This is not my fault.<eos> You throw beer all over her?<eos> You know what?<eos> Who are you...
Did you see that look in her eyes?<eos> - I mean, she just snapped.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She freaked me out.<eos> Sam, you're 20 minutes late!
Mommy, Sammy won't get up.<eos> Don't make me come up there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Sexy lady!<eos> - What are you doing?
Still funny.<eos> Nice tits!<eos> Ohh, I have your present.<eos> No glove, no love.<eos> You hear me?
Thank you.<eos> Okay, let's hope third time's the charm.<eos> Yo, Sam.<eos> Oh, man. Sam.<eos> You forgot this one.
Oh, man. Sam.<eos> You forgot this one.<eos> No, I didn't forget it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The more roses you get on cupid day, the more popular you are, right?
I didn't say the rose was from me.<eos> But it is from you, right?<eos> Well, i...<eos> I... anyway, my mom's out of town...<eos> Out of town and you're having a party?
But it is from you, right?<eos> Well, i...<eos> I... anyway, my mom's out of town...<eos> Out of town and you're having a party?<eos> Yeah. Do you wanna...
Well, can I see you tonight?<eos> You're nervous?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't wanna waste the first night you go full womanhood.
Just weird.<eos> I feel like I'm still dreaming from yesterday.<eos> Like... or maybe yesterday was the dream.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're awake now!
Oh, my god!<eos> No, don't you... don't... don't do that.<eos> I'm gonna go find Patrick, you guys. Mwah!<eos> Sam!<eos> Hey, you made it.
Sorry.<eos> I feel like I'm having Déjà vu with you being in my room.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I've been having Déjà vu all day long.<eos> Are you okay?
Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Oh, yeah? In Patrick's mouth maybe.<eos> You seem a little guilty.
Well, at least I'm not gonna be the only virgin.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> Watch this.<eos> You're a bitch!
Watch this.<eos> You're a bitch!<eos> Just like your mother.<eos> No wonder daddy left. Huh?<eos> You're a bitch too.
You're a bitch!<eos> Just like your mother.<eos> No wonder daddy left. Huh?<eos> You're a bitch too.<eos> What? You're a drunk.
No wonder daddy left. Huh?<eos> You're a bitch too.<eos> What? You're a drunk.<eos> And you...<eos> You're just pathetic.
Juliet.<eos> You know what?<eos> We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?
Get this bitch on a leash.<eos> Psycho!<eos> You wanna go?<eos> Go back to the ward, you psycho bitch!<eos> What do you think people will say about you when you die?
I want to pick a song.<eos> Okay, mom.<eos> Don't elbow me.<eos> Just pick something.<eos> You're trouble.
Let go!<eos> Mommy, Sammy won't get up!<eos> It wasn't until then that I allowed myself to think the worst.<eos> Sam?<eos> What's this about you feeling sick?
I'm just trying to help.<eos> I just need to sleep a little bit longer.<eos> Please?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'll let Lindsay know that you're going in late.
Sammy. Hmm?<eos> You'll feel better once you see some of your roses.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Well, you're lucky to be so popular.
I mean, when I was a senior, I hadn't even kissed a boy.<eos> Everyone said my eyes were too close together and that I looked like a fish.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have to get to work, honey.<eos> I think you're beautiful.
I just, bottom line, don't wanna have to deal with that today.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> - What are you doing?
- What are you doing?<eos> - Shh, shh, shh.<eos> What is she...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Are you texting...
Lock up the knives and babies!<eos> Does it smell like pee in here?<eos> I can smell her from here.<eos> Why do we hate Juliet?<eos> - Are you serious?
Remember mellow yellow in the fifth grade?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> When Lindsay found out that she peed in her sleeping bag on the girl scout trip.<eos> Why do you care all of a sudden?<eos> You know she should be institutionalized.
But whoever it was from, they put a lot of thought into it, so...<eos> By the way, my, uh, mom is out of town this weekend, so I'm gonna throw a big party tonight. Yeah.<eos> Did you remember the address or you... hi, Sam.<eos> It was... it was third grade, but probably don't remember.<eos> But, uh... but do you, uh...
Sorry.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Well, I'm...<eos> I could have, uh, crutches on call for you...<eos> Kent. In case you want to climb up the tree and play flying squirrel.
Could I see that?<eos> Of course he is.<eos> Ooh, I don't wanna see it.<eos> Gross.<eos> You kiss that? Mm.
Of course he is.<eos> Ooh, I don't wanna see it.<eos> Gross.<eos> You kiss that? Mm.<eos> I can't believe you made this ice cream, ally.
You should go to cooking school.<eos> Screw college.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> It has no dairy.<eos> Oh, you're so full of shit.
Imagine how her family feels.<eos> Look, you can't be mean to someone forever and then just feel badly when they die, okay?<eos> We all knew she was crazy.<eos> God, Lindsay, she was your best friend in fifth grade.<eos> Yeah, you used to sleep over her house.
Look, you can't be mean to someone forever and then just feel badly when they die, okay?<eos> We all knew she was crazy.<eos> God, Lindsay, she was your best friend in fifth grade.<eos> Yeah, you used to sleep over her house.<eos> I mean, you must know her...
Yeah, well, that was before she became a sociopath, ally.<eos> I'm going back to sleep.<eos> I'm going to sleep in my room.<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> You were friends with Juliet?
I'm going to sleep in my room.<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> You were friends with Juliet?<eos> No one even talked to you in fifth grade, and I don't hold that against you.<eos> You never said anything.
I did everything right.<eos> And nothing changed.<eos> The day starts and ends the same, regardless of anything I do or say.<eos> If that's how it works, I'm gonna do and say whatever I want.<eos> - Oh, no, you're not wearing that to school.
The day starts and ends the same, regardless of anything I do or say.<eos> If that's how it works, I'm gonna do and say whatever I want.<eos> - Oh, no, you're not wearing that to school.<eos> - My cupid day outfit.<eos> You don't want to give people the wrong idea.
Funny.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Geez, wake up on the wrong side of the bed or something?<eos> For a few days now, yeah.<eos> You ready?
Sam.<eos> Someone forgot to take her happy pills this morning.<eos> I took mine.<eos> Well, I know something that'll cheer you right up.<eos> I swear to god, Elody, if you hand me a condom right now...
Well, I know something that'll cheer you right up.<eos> I swear to god, Elody, if you hand me a condom right now...<eos> But it's your present, for your special night.<eos> Take it.<eos> Unless you want to be a walking std farm.
Unless you want to be a walking std farm.<eos> You would know.<eos> At least I'm not still a virgin.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> What did you just say to me?
We're all pretty fucking clear on that.<eos> What the hell is your problem today, Sam?<eos> You guys, don't fight.<eos> Just drop it.<eos> - What, you don't agree?
Stop it, Sam.<eos> Out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Now!<eos> I'd love to hear what you say about me behind my back.
Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> - Psycho!<eos> - Psycho!<eos> What the hell? Shit!<eos> What are you doing in here?
Look, whatever, really.<eos> I mean, this whole high school thing's just a blip.<eos> I'm not gonna remember any of you.<eos> I win.<eos> Do you ever feel like you're living the same day over and over again with only like a few things being different?
I'm not gonna remember any of you.<eos> I win.<eos> Do you ever feel like you're living the same day over and over again with only like a few things being different?<eos> Aw, shit, Samantha.<eos> You just described my whole life!
She's Lindsay.<eos> She's ours.<eos> We're each other's, you know?<eos> Just apologize.<eos> You're not listening to me.
Just apologize.<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> I'm not sorry.<eos> Please, Sam?<eos> What? Why do you care so much, Elody?
What? Why do you care so much, Elody?<eos> Because...<eos> You guys are all I have.<eos> Are you still trying to turn her against me?<eos> You're the horrible driver.
Because...<eos> You guys are all I have.<eos> Are you still trying to turn her against me?<eos> You're the horrible driver.<eos> You're the one who's always criticizing people and hurting people.
You guys are all I have.<eos> Are you still trying to turn her against me?<eos> You're the horrible driver.<eos> You're the one who's always criticizing people and hurting people.<eos> You're the one who lied about being friends with her and then tortured her for years.
You're the one who's always criticizing people and hurting people.<eos> You're the one who lied about being friends with her and then tortured her for years.<eos> I just followed along, and yet...<eos> I'm the one paying for it.<eos> Sam, what are you talking about?
Whoa.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.<eos> Where have you...
Where have you...<eos> No!<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> I love you.<eos> Is that what you wanted to hear?
I love you.<eos> Is that what you wanted to hear?<eos> Sam?<eos> Hey, are...<eos> Are you okay?
Is that what you wanted to hear?<eos> Sam?<eos> Hey, are...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I mean, obviously you're crying.
No, don't worry about it.<eos> I...<eos> The sign's just really for other people so they don't get my stuff.<eos> It's the first big party I've ever had, so...<eos> Why'd you have one now?
I...<eos> The sign's just really for other people so they don't get my stuff.<eos> It's the first big party I've ever had, so...<eos> Why'd you have one now?<eos> I figured if I had a party, you'd come.
Hey. Just stay for a second, okay?<eos> I-I can...<eos> I can drive you home or...<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> Okay, well, you can, uh... you could crash here if you want.
What does that... and then you're just going to go through there and end up here.<eos> If I was going to relive the same day over and over...<eos> I wanted it to be a worthy day.<eos> But not just for me.<eos> Do the kids at school ever make fun of you for the way that you talk?
I wanted it to be a worthy day.<eos> But not just for me.<eos> Do the kids at school ever make fun of you for the way that you talk?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> You can do something about that.
But this is my voice.<eos> How can they even know it's me talking?<eos> When I was in the fifth grade, this girl used to sing this song... who did that?<eos> Lindsay.<eos> How come you're so mean to mom?
When I was in the fifth grade, this girl used to sing this song... who did that?<eos> Lindsay.<eos> How come you're so mean to mom?<eos> I'm not mean to mom.<eos> You drew a line on the floor with nail Polish and said you couldn't cross it.
Okay.<eos> Wait, tiger.<eos> I'm glad we did this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was just really sweet what you did today.
Wait, tiger.<eos> I'm glad we did this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was just really sweet what you did today.<eos> Do you think I'm a good person?
I'm glad we did this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was just really sweet what you did today.<eos> Do you think I'm a good person?<eos> Of course I think you're a good person.
It was just really sweet what you did today.<eos> Do you think I'm a good person?<eos> Of course I think you're a good person.<eos> But it doesn't really matter what I think.<eos> I mean, what's important is what you think.
But it doesn't really matter what I think.<eos> I mean, what's important is what you think.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> I want to know...<eos> Why do you think that I'm a good person?
I mean, what's important is what you think.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> I want to know...<eos> Why do you think that I'm a good person?<eos> Do you remember when you were a little girl, you used to take turns riding all of the horses in the stable so that none of them would feel left out?
No, I'm serious.<eos> I want to know...<eos> Why do you think that I'm a good person?<eos> Do you remember when you were a little girl, you used to take turns riding all of the horses in the stable so that none of them would feel left out?<eos> Do you remember that?
It's different.<eos> You have a big heart, Sam.<eos> That doesn't go away.<eos> One good thing.<eos> You just focus on that one good thing, and you see where it leads you.
You just focus on that one good thing, and you see where it leads you.<eos> How is it possible to change so much and not be able to change anything at all?<eos> I knew I had to do something.<eos> Something good.<eos> You made it.
The room's off-limits.<eos> Oh, forget the sign.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> That's really just there for other people so they don't mess with my stuff.<eos> I'm glad you came.
It's no big deal.<eos> That's really just there for other people so they don't mess with my stuff.<eos> I'm glad you came.<eos> Yeah. I had to.<eos> I like what you've done with the place.
Yeah, not so good in the morning, though.<eos> - It's like waking up...<eos> - In the middle of the sun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you don't think that it's weird that I'm here with you right now.
Sam, um...<eos> I once wore crocs for 365 days straight, so I don't think anything's weird.<eos> I forgot about your crocs phase.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are you always so nice to me?
We were in the cafeteria and I was crying.<eos> And Phil Howe came up to me, called me a baby, and then smacked my tray right out of my hand, and food went flying everywhere.<eos> I remember what we were eating too.<eos> It was, um, mashed potatoes and Turkey burgers.<eos> And you came over, you scooped up the mashed potatoes right off the ground and you went up to Phil and you smashed the mashed potatoes right in his face.

I mean, I didn't laugh more that day than...<eos> I mean, uh...<eos> It was... it was the first time I laughed since my... My dad died and i...<eos> Do you remember what I said to you?<eos> "You're my hero."
Hey!<eos> Sam!<eos> Wait, i...<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Sam, did you see that?
Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet.<eos> What are you doing here?
Juliet.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I know what happened back there.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could. You hate me.
What, no love for your old man?<eos> I love you too, old man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sammy, you forgot your gloves!
Thank you.<eos> Sammy, you forgot your gloves!<eos> What would I do without you?<eos> Hey.<eos> You are perfect the way that you are, fizzy.
Always remember that.<eos> Ugh, I can't breathe!<eos> It's cold!<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you doing?
Let's go.<eos> Yeah, baby!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, get in!<eos> You know how I like it.
Hey, get in!<eos> You know how I like it.<eos> Hey, Elody.<eos> What, do I have white stuff on my face?<eos> No. You know why I love you?
You know how I like it.<eos> Hey, Elody.<eos> What, do I have white stuff on my face?<eos> No. You know why I love you?<eos> I love you because you're down for anything.
Hey, Elody.<eos> What, do I have white stuff on my face?<eos> No. You know why I love you?<eos> I love you because you're down for anything.<eos> Always. You know I'm a down-ass bitch.
What, do I have white stuff on my face?<eos> No. You know why I love you?<eos> I love you because you're down for anything.<eos> Always. You know I'm a down-ass bitch.<eos> - You are.
- You are.<eos> - Hey, I'm down too.<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, I love you, ally, because you're curious about the world.
No, I love you, ally, because you're curious about the world.<eos> And you're passionate, and you are driven.<eos> Did someone swallow Oprah this morning?<eos> I love you, Linds.<eos> I love you because you're the kind of friend that toilet papers Jason foster's house for a week straight all by herself just because he said that I was a bad kisser.
Be careful.<eos> Oh, man. Sam.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, "you're my hero."
Um, "you're my hero."<eos> You got a secret admirer?<eos> Secret?<eos> That's-that's, um, not so secret.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Well, um...<eos> Hey, listen, um, I'm, uh...<eos> I'm having a party tonight. Mm-hmm.<eos> And I was wondering if you maybe wanted to come, maybe.
Later?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, hey, the "you're my hero" thing, how did you...
Okay.<eos> Wait, hey, the "you're my hero" thing, how did you...<eos> Thank you for my beautiful rose.<eos> I love it.<eos> What'd you say to me?
Thank you for my beautiful rose.<eos> I love it.<eos> What'd you say to me?<eos> This is not working out.<eos> Okay, Sam, you can't break up with me.
I think I can and I-i think I just did.<eos> I should have picked Elody.<eos> What just happened?<eos> You guys were supposed to...<eos> I mean you said you wanted to...
- But it's Juliet.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> It's Juliet.<eos> She has a name and she is a person.<eos> Yesterday you said you were afraid she would bite you if she got too close.
- Hey, Linds.<eos> - All right, let's do this.<eos> Linds?<eos> What?<eos> How come you never told me about your parents' divorce?
- All right, let's do this.<eos> Linds?<eos> What?<eos> How come you never told me about your parents' divorce?<eos> Are you serious?
Are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why would I talk about something that happened a thousand years ago?<eos> Because it happened to you.<eos> And you matter to me.
And you matter to me.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Let's go inside.<eos> Come here.<eos> You know you don't have to act so tough all the time.
Don't worry about me, okay?<eos> Well, I love you no matter what.<eos> Let's get inside.<eos> Move, move, move.<eos> Hey, um, you made it.
Come with me.<eos> What?<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I-I-i believe you owe me a secret, right?
For a second.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Please.<eos> Actually, I kind of have somewhere I have to be.<eos> I know what you have planned for tonight.
It's okay.<eos> Please.<eos> Actually, I kind of have somewhere I have to be.<eos> I know what you have planned for tonight.<eos> And I want you to know that you don't have to do this, okay?
Please.<eos> Actually, I kind of have somewhere I have to be.<eos> I know what you have planned for tonight.<eos> And I want you to know that you don't have to do this, okay?<eos> You don't know anything.
And I want you to know that you don't have to do this, okay?<eos> You don't know anything.<eos> I know that you have something to tell me.<eos> You have something to tell all of us.<eos> You're a bitch.
Sorry, but I have to come with you.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> I can't.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam, why did you run away from me?
I can't.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam, why did you run away from me?<eos> I can't right now.<eos> You've been ignoring me for years, and then you kiss me and then go back to acting... i meant everything that happened back there.
Sam, why did you run away from me?<eos> I can't right now.<eos> You've been ignoring me for years, and then you kiss me and then go back to acting... i meant everything that happened back there.<eos> That's all I can say, that I meant it, and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.<eos> Are you in trouble?
I can't right now.<eos> You've been ignoring me for years, and then you kiss me and then go back to acting... i meant everything that happened back there.<eos> That's all I can say, that I meant it, and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.<eos> Are you in trouble?<eos> Uh, you can... you can trust me.
Juliet, don't!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wh-what's going on?<eos> Why are you following me?
Wait!<eos> Wh-what's going on?<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> Why can't you leave me alone?<eos> You don't want to die.
Wh-what's going on?<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> Why can't you leave me alone?<eos> You don't want to die.<eos> You want the pain to stop.
You have a choice, Juliet.<eos> Not everybody gets that.<eos> Sam!<eos> Please let me help you.<eos> Don't you get it?
Not everybody gets that.<eos> Sam!<eos> Please let me help you.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> You can't help me.
You're not the one who needs fixing.<eos> There is nothing wrong with you.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you that there is.<eos> This is just a blip.<eos> Your life will change, Juliet, if you just hold on...
Even after they're over, they still go on.<eos> They are the meaning.<eos> Sam?<eos> Sam?<eos> You saved me.
Sam?<eos> Sam?<eos> You saved me.<eos> No.<eos> You saved me.
A sad, pointless charade built on lies.<eos> You have to have the courage to go your own way.<eos> Happiness is hard to come by.<eos> Sure as hell aren't gonna find it in some stupid gadget.<eos> There you are, tapping on some little box... while the real shit is happening all around you, dumbass.
I mean, everybody's got something valuable to offer if you just take the time to listen.<eos> Nope.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Saggy-balls motherfucker!<eos> And if you're lucky enough to find a friend or two in this world... well, brother, you've hit the jackpot.
Jesus Christ.<eos> St. Louis?<eos> It's actually a pretty interesting town.<eos> Oh, okay, that flies in the face of everything I've ever heard... about St. Louis in particular and Missouri at large!<eos> What the hell do you know about it?
Holy shit.<eos> This has nothing to do with you, Wilson.<eos> Oh, that's nice!<eos> Thanks for thinking of me!<eos> I always knew that she hated me... but I always thought that you were my best friend!
That's not so bad, I guess.<eos> Of all the times to call!<eos> Hello?<eos> He what?<eos> Honey, you're so beautiful!
Diego lives here with me.<eos> He helps out a ton with the animals.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> That's just...<eos> How do you know he's not some crazy dog fucker?
Took a bad turn last night.<eos> Fell in the shower.<eos> Sorry, to hear that.<eos> So...<eos> What do you do?
I mean I want to know... what are the actual activities of your day?<eos> You know, different things. I...<eos> Meetings, phone calls, reports.<eos> But, you know, I mostly... primarily focus on manage...<eos> Listen, brother, forty years from now you're gonna be on your deathbed saying:
I actually enjoy what I do, and I've worked my ass off to get there.<eos> How did we end up like this?<eos> Okay, so... this is it, I guess.<eos> When Mom died it just happened, you know, but... you have the chance to leave me with something.<eos> Couldn't you... see that I needed you to tell me just one time... that you loved me?
When Mom died it just happened, you know, but... you have the chance to leave me with something.<eos> Couldn't you... see that I needed you to tell me just one time... that you loved me?<eos> Or that you hated me, or... something.<eos> Something besides the problems with your goddamn garden.<eos> If you can hear me, just squeeze my hand.
If it wasn't for him, I'd throw like a damn pussy.<eos> He was a good... man, in general, you know?<eos> Who's that?<eos> It's me, Wilson.<eos> I wanted to see if you still lived here.
I wanted to see if you still lived here.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> You want some beet juice?<eos> Fuck, no!<eos> You seen Meyers lately?
Just... you know, meet some new people and... shake things up a...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm thinking to... try dating again a little bit, you know?<eos> Yeah, I gave up on women a long time ago.<eos> You bust your fucking ass... and what do you get?
Getting bitched at all the time?<eos> It's a fucking fool's errand!<eos> You know, Olsen, I was thinking that maybe we could be friends again.<eos> But I guess...<eos> I sort of forgot... what a toxic soul-draining vampire you really are.
That's good.<eos> Wow, this place has got 1,748 reviews on Yelp.<eos> And what the hell does that even mean?<eos> Yelp.<eos> Aren't you a little old to be doing all that computer stuff?
Yelp.<eos> Aren't you a little old to be doing all that computer stuff?<eos> I'm totally addicted.<eos> You know, it just feels so undignified to me.<eos> I mean, in the end you're just sitting all alone staring at a screen.
You know, it just feels so undignified to me.<eos> I mean, in the end you're just sitting all alone staring at a screen.<eos> It's just so sad.<eos> I would be a lot lonelier without it, that's for sure.<eos> Have you ever been married?
"I'm into dudes," you know?<eos> I'm done with her.<eos> I just need to move on, find somebody new.<eos> Not you necessarily, but...<eos> Did you ever do a PeopleFinder search, or even just Google?
My ex?<eos> Pippi.<eos> Pippi what?<eos> Pippi Carmichael.<eos> But like I said, you won't find a...
Pippi Carmichael.<eos> But like I said, you won't find a...<eos> Here's a Polly Carmichael-Wiggins.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you serious?
Yeah, she's right over there in Silverdale.<eos> So... after six years, this guy's all, "I love you, "but I just don't see a future for us." And I'm like, "I get it, dude.<eos> You're into penis.<eos> "So am I. But...<eos> "couldn't you have just told me that "before I let myself go all to shit?"
Oh, good.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Sure. What's going on?<eos> Okay.<eos> Have you ever seen this woman?
Have you ever seen this woman?<eos> Now, this is an old picture, so she... probably looks much, much worse now.<eos> Bruises from the drug use and beatings.<eos> Frizzy coke hair.<eos> Waxy skin. You, of all people, know the drill.
I'm sorry, I don't know her.<eos> Well, in that case, I guess I'll... take a blowjob then.<eos> All right.<eos> I should've brought my wallet.<eos> Belinda, do you know where Pippi is?
I blame her father.<eos> Rich Republican prick.<eos> But that's a pretty good way to get back at him, I suppose.<eos> "Hey, I'm blowing strangers for drug money, Daddy.<eos> "What do you think of me now?"
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, God. Oh, God.<eos> Two pinot noir, please!<eos> I don't get the Lynne thing.<eos> Why "Lynne"? I thought you hated "Lynne."
Just let me get through.<eos> Wilson.<eos> Jesus Christ, man!<eos> I'm just trying to get my life together and make a clean start.<eos> Why would you show up and say that shit?
Wilson.<eos> Jesus Christ, man!<eos> I'm just trying to get my life together and make a clean start.<eos> Why would you show up and say that shit?<eos> I can't get over how amazing you look.
Jesus Christ, man!<eos> I'm just trying to get my life together and make a clean start.<eos> Why would you show up and say that shit?<eos> I can't get over how amazing you look.<eos> I thought you'd be some... nasty, skanky, rat-haired, snaggle-toothed... sore-infested ho.

Wilson, you showed up at my work and called me a crack whore.<eos> In front of Melissa!<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I didn't know!<eos> I was afraid you were living with a biker gang or something.
In front of Melissa!<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I didn't know!<eos> I was afraid you were living with a biker gang or something.<eos> You can't imagine all the stuff running through my head... from the shit that Polly told me.
Well, you know what?<eos> I didn't know!<eos> I was afraid you were living with a biker gang or something.<eos> You can't imagine all the stuff running through my head... from the shit that Polly told me.<eos> You talked to Polly?
Because this is exactly what she wants!<eos> I am cooling out.<eos> Doesn't know a goddamn thing about my business.<eos> I always told you that she was a nightmare, remember?<eos> Wilson, you said that about everybody.
Can this really be the same Pippi who used to... smoke and drink and curse and fart and belch?<eos> She was a disgusting pig.<eos> Well, there was never a dull moment, that's for sure.<eos> Pippi?<eos> You were the only person who ever bothered to get to know the real me.
It's been really hard.<eos> I had some bad years.<eos> I am so... proud of you.<eos> You're doing so good.<eos> You're an amazing woman.
No, no, no.<eos> Pepper, down. Fuck!<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, she's a little bit overprotective.<eos> Shit, I can't believe you still live here.
Pepper, down. Fuck!<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, she's a little bit overprotective.<eos> Shit, I can't believe you still live here.<eos> Oh, I know, it's great, but... you know, I can't help but think it would've been great if you just... had the baby, and then we'd... still have lived together all those years.
And who knows what our life might have been like.<eos> P T.A. meetings...<eos> Guinea pigs...<eos> Piano lessons...<eos> You're totally out of your mind, man.
P T.A. meetings...<eos> Guinea pigs...<eos> Piano lessons...<eos> You're totally out of your mind, man.<eos> If you had had the baby, it would have forced us to grow up.
You know?<eos> I did have the baby.<eos> What?<eos> I had a little girl.<eos> What are you talking about?
What?<eos> I had a little girl.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I put her up for adoption... before I went to L.A.<eos> Pippi... you need to tell me right now if you're joking around.
What are you talking about?<eos> I put her up for adoption... before I went to L.A.<eos> Pippi... you need to tell me right now if you're joking around.<eos> Wilson, we sent you papers.<eos> No, I don't know anything about what you're talking about.
Where the hell's that goddamn file?<eos> Cocksucker!<eos> Oh, here's what I got.<eos> "Claire Cassiday, Parker Day High School."<eos> You sure about that?
Excuse me.<eos> We have tickets to Wicked and...<eos> Hey, dickhead!<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Can't you see that this woman is having a profound moment?
Don't you do another goddamn thing.<eos> I can't even catch my breath around you.<eos> Enough!<eos> I'm not talking about anything major, Pippi.<eos> I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?
I can't even catch my breath around you.<eos> Enough!<eos> I'm not talking about anything major, Pippi.<eos> I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?<eos> What are you saying now?
Enough!<eos> I'm not talking about anything major, Pippi.<eos> I mean... don't you want to see her in the flesh?<eos> What are you saying now?<eos> What do you want to do, stalk her?
I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.<eos> I stopped loving you.<eos> I spent so many years hating you and now I can't even remember why.<eos> I guess it drove me nuts that I was such a fucking mess... and nothing I did ever scared you away.<eos> Well, you remember this?
That almost scared me away.<eos> They're on the move!<eos> They're on the move.<eos> Wait!<eos> What are you doing?
Wait!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I told you.<eos> I just want to get a glimpse of her.<eos> But you just saw her!
Jesus.<eos> We made that.<eos> Hey, it's Claire.<eos> Hi, Claire.<eos> What's up, Claire? Why are you here?
Hi, Claire.<eos> What's up, Claire? Why are you here?<eos> They having a sale on big-ass clown clothes?<eos> Go die, asshole.<eos> I'm sorry, what did you say to me?
They having a sale on big-ass clown clothes?<eos> Go die, asshole.<eos> I'm sorry, what did you say to me?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What did you say to me, bitch?
Oh, no.<eos> What did you say to me, bitch?<eos> Hey, Claire, Jenny Craig's over here.<eos> Fat-ass bitch!<eos> Where are you going?
I never was on the street.<eos> Look, it doesn't...<eos> Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!<eos> And if you're wondering about the lack of family resemblance... you couldn't tell it by looking at her, but she used to be a real hippo.
Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm not some strung-out skank, man!<eos> Pippi, is that all that you took from this experience?
Pippi, is that all that you took from this experience?<eos> Well, we just totally ambushed her!<eos> I thought we were just gonna hide out.<eos> I can honestly say...<eos> I have never seen anything more beautiful... than the look on your face... when you first saw her.
Well, we just totally ambushed her!<eos> I thought we were just gonna hide out.<eos> I can honestly say...<eos> I have never seen anything more beautiful... than the look on your face... when you first saw her.<eos> You were... glowing.
I guess it was good we got to see her, right?<eos> I feel like maybe I can stop worrying.<eos> And I'll let her go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you're right, Pippi.
Thanks.<eos> I think you're right, Pippi.<eos> She certainly doesn't need any help from us.<eos> It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.<eos> Of course, you turned out okay.
Okay, I'll kick the shit out of everybody then.<eos> It is a given that every decent person who ever lived got shit on in high school.<eos> I'm sure they picked on Copernicus, for fuck sake.<eos> It's a badge of honor.<eos> However... that does not mean that you have to sit back and get reamed for four years.
No. I'm not doing that, Wilson.<eos> Come on, it'll be fun.<eos> I haven't been there since I was a kid.<eos> Wilson!<eos> You know I'm not talking about that.
For better or worse, Pippi, we have totally freaked this girl out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And it is our duty to make sure that she doesn't have some major meltdown.<eos> You know?<eos> I mean, can you imagine what she's going through?
I mean, can you imagine what she's going through?<eos> No!<eos> No fucking way.<eos> Of course I can't.<eos> Can you?
We're not stalking her.<eos> Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?<eos> I am barely making it through each day.<eos> And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?
Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?<eos> I am barely making it through each day.<eos> And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?<eos> Pippi, it is that commitment... that is exactly what you need to help you move forward.
I am barely making it through each day.<eos> And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?<eos> Pippi, it is that commitment... that is exactly what you need to help you move forward.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> You're an asshole!
Goddamn it!<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This is why I left you in the first place.<eos> You think you know it all.
Fuck!<eos> This is why I left you in the first place.<eos> You think you know it all.<eos> You don't!<eos> You don't know shit about shit!
You don't know shit about shit!<eos> Are you done?<eos> Wow!<eos> So cool!<eos> You must have been here a million times, huh?
It's all ours then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This used to seem so huge when I was a kid.<eos> Hey, you guys ready to take it for a spin?<eos> You're embarrassing her.
Hey, you guys ready to take it for a spin?<eos> You're embarrassing her.<eos> This is a little kid ride.<eos> I'm not embarrassed.<eos> Come on, Pippi, you don't have to be such a lump on a log.
Okay!<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Bye!<eos> Bye!<eos> You know, I heard you call him "Dad"
No, it's just she's all desperate and needy.<eos> She can tell when someone doesn't love her.<eos> Not the dog, stupid.<eos> Who, Claire?<eos> Did you see the way she was looking at you?
No, no, don't laugh.<eos> We have to do that.<eos> I am not going to her stupid suburban shithole life.<eos> But there's nothing nuts about that.<eos> Look, look, just... all of the shit that you've been through... and you've come out the other side better than she'll ever be.
We have to do that.<eos> I am not going to her stupid suburban shithole life.<eos> But there's nothing nuts about that.<eos> Look, look, just... all of the shit that you've been through... and you've come out the other side better than she'll ever be.<eos> And it's a great chance for your daughter to see who you are.
It's like...<eos> "Hello there, up here!<eos> I'm an actual human being.<eos> "I can do math and... "drive a car and cook food and do tiddlywinks... "and masturbate."<eos> I didn't know you were married.
They're just thrilled I have a fucking friend.<eos> Okay... this is a family outing.<eos> That's just how I talk.<eos> Okay, well, in that case... Swear all the fuck you want!<eos> You're fucking crazy.
Come in.<eos> Please.<eos> Wow.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, Polly... you look great.
Sorry.<eos> Hey, Polly... you look great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.
I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't you think she looks...<eos> You do, too, Will!
Thanks.<eos> What's the boy's name?<eos> Cooper.<eos> Cooper! The last time I saw you... you were two or three years old.<eos> You were trying to get your mom to pick up some Legos and... you were literally just freaking out!
So is she my cousin?<eos> Oh, brilliant, Watson!<eos> Definite college material.<eos> What are you gonna major in, brain surgery?<eos> So, Claire, have you been thinking about school yet?
I feel like I'm doing fieldwork among the natives or something.<eos> We shouldn't have come here.<eos> What?<eos> She'll always find a way to win.<eos> What are you talking about?
I can't.<eos> Let's just try to have fun.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How come you're so quiet?
How come you're so quiet?<eos> Oh, well, I...<eos> Some of my best times with my mom were spent, um... not saying a word, just... just sitting together in the same room... feeling... the connection.<eos> Like a chemical thing.<eos> You know, I always used to try to imagine what you were like.
Some of my best times with my mom were spent, um... not saying a word, just... just sitting together in the same room... feeling... the connection.<eos> Like a chemical thing.<eos> You know, I always used to try to imagine what you were like.<eos> My "real dad."<eos> Well, I hope you're not too disappointed.
You know, I always used to try to imagine what you were like.<eos> My "real dad."<eos> Well, I hope you're not too disappointed.<eos> Nah.<eos> You're cool.
Thanks.<eos> Pippi.<eos> I was afraid I'd never see you again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to know that I fully understand why you didn't come to Dad's funeral.
And I also know that things were tougher for you after I left.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Maybe they were a little bit tougher for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, it's good to see you wanting a family.
They're really cool with me.<eos> Do Claire's parents even know where she is, Pippi?<eos> Oh, my God, Polly!<eos> Look at you!<eos> You're still just playing Little Miss Perfect.
I knew I shouldn't have come back here.<eos> I heard Claire on the phone this morning.<eos> She told her mom she was staying at a beach house with her friend Hannah.<eos> You're a fucking cunt!<eos> When you're a kid, you have all this future. This potential.
No, Pippi!<eos> Oh, oh, oh!<eos> A little woodland creature.<eos> You know, they haven't changed at all since the time of the dinosaurs.<eos> Oh, you're so cute.
It's like the ultimate argument ender.<eos> Like, "No, I don't want your fucking job.<eos> In fact... "I want to destroy your entire society.<eos> "Fuck you."<eos> What'd you say, bitch?
"He leadeth me beside the still waters."<eos> He leadeth me beside the still waters.<eos> "He restoreth my soul."<eos> He restoreth my soul.<eos> So I grabbed this asshole by the lapels... and I said, "Look, I don't care if you are a nun...
Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.<eos> I wondered about that.<eos> I could've been there for you, and I...<eos> I totally failed you, Wilson.<eos> But you're here now.
I totally failed you, Wilson.<eos> But you're here now.<eos> I am.<eos> And I have to thank you, Wilson.<eos> You believed in me when nobody else ever did.
And that's why... Tucker and I are moving to Australia.<eos> What did...?<eos> I just... Could you...?<eos> Did you...?<eos> Did you...?
Hey.<eos> Maybe we don't have to be miserable forever.<eos> Maybe we could find our way to being happy.<eos> Pippi?<eos> What the fuck are you looking at?
Thank you.<eos> So... What's been going on in the world?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Tell me, friend, have you heard the good news?
Is that you, Diana?<eos> It's me, Wilson.<eos> Pepper's dad!<eos> Hi.<eos> You can't believe what happened to me, Shelly.
She got so sick, Wilson.<eos> And in the end she could barely even... She could barely even lift her little head.<eos> I tried to find you.<eos> I did.<eos> And someone said that you were in jail, and I just...
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, Pepper.<eos> I'll never use this voice again.<eos> Good-bye, Pepper.<eos> You were a true friend.
I'll never use this voice again.<eos> Good-bye, Pepper.<eos> You were a true friend.<eos> Every minute in your presence was a blessing and your joy over the simplest of pleasures was humbling and inspirational.<eos> You were the pride of the neighborhood, the brightener of a thousand days.
You...<eos> Urinated.<eos> Urinated... on my address book and chewed up two sofas...<eos> Three.<eos> Three, but... in doing so, you taught us the utter worthlessness of those things.
Diego?<eos> He turned out to be a real asshole.<eos> Oh, jeez, I knew it!<eos> You know, those guys who come off all emotional and caring, they're bad news.<eos> You deserve to be treated with respect.
So what was prison like?<eos> They say that there's no such thing as rehabilitation and people come out worse than they go in, but I... kind of feel like it helped... turn me into an adult.<eos> Finally.<eos> Breathe.<eos> You're so tight.
You're so tight.<eos> Flip over on your tummy.<eos> Tummy, okay.<eos> I think that you and I have a lot to teach each other.<eos> Huh. You're so open and fearless.
I just have to...<eos> It might be George about tomorrow.<eos> Hello?<eos> No. No.<eos> Look, he has no interest in talking to you, and we'd... just prefer if you don't call this number anymore, okay?
Thank you.<eos> Who the hell was that?<eos> Wow.<eos> Hi.<eos> You look so... grown up.
Wow.<eos> Hi.<eos> You look so... grown up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You look good, too.
Hi.<eos> You look so... grown up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You look good, too.<eos> Well, you know, if you'd have seen me when I first got out... forty months of eating pure crap and... sitting in a little room with a window this wide...
Yeah.<eos> She emailed me before she left.<eos> Yeah, like they don't have cocaine in Australia or something.<eos> Look, Claire, I'm gonna need some kind of apology or something.<eos> Some acknowledgement of the unconscionable way that you turned on me at the trial.
But... it's not why I'm here.<eos> I'm going to have a baby.<eos> And I thought I should tell you in person.<eos> I guess I wanted to know if he was gonna have any weird diseases or something.<eos> But I mean, you're just a kid yourself.
This is...<eos> This is...<eos> You know, Portland is not so bad.<eos> I could be there to help her with anything she needs.<eos> What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?<eos> I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.
I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.<eos> You barely know her and... she sent you to jail, for Chrissake!
Let me just pet him.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> I'll be there in 10 minutes. Hi!<eos> Hello!<eos> You are such a beautiful girl.
Um, you know, actually it's okay.<eos> Yeah, false alarm.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> What are you still doing here?
Yeah, false alarm.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> My mom said you were beating off.
What are you still doing here?<eos> My mom said you were beating off.<eos> No, I...<eos> I know... that I fucked everything up.<eos> I'm just asking for the tiniest... shred of hope that you might someday... let me be a small part of your life.
My mom said you were beating off.<eos> No, I...<eos> I know... that I fucked everything up.<eos> I'm just asking for the tiniest... shred of hope that you might someday... let me be a small part of your life.<eos> What do you mean?
You know, I mean, we all want people to love us for exactly who we are.<eos> But that's not really possible in this world because we're just all too unbearable.<eos> You know?<eos> We got to... make the best of what we have, you know?<eos> I thought you were moving to Portland.
Are the men ready?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> Are you sure about this, my Lord?<eos> Listen to me, woman.<eos> I need you to do as I tell you.
And I'll join you as soon as I can.<eos> I'm scared, Uther.<eos> I have the sword.<eos> Hurry.<eos> How do you know of this place, my love?
I have the sword.<eos> Hurry.<eos> How do you know of this place, my love?<eos> You must tell me where we're going.<eos> Why do you not answer me?
Don't be silly.<eos> You girls have looked after me for a lot longer than I've looked after you.<eos> I owe you everything.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> I just wanna know how you get money out of Vikings.
A turner come down this way.<eos> We're searching all houses.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Slow down, new boy, before you trip up.<eos> What did you say?
Jack's Eye.<eos> What did he want in here?<eos> Resistance are on the move again.<eos> Hit a branding barge upriver.<eos> Anyone in the house you don't know?
Mind if I take a look?<eos> He's bleeding.<eos> Took an arrow on the way out.<eos> What would happen to a man who hits the king's barge upriver?<eos> Well, you know what would happen.
What would happen to the people harboring such a man?<eos> Well, they get treated the same as the man they hide.<eos> Would they, now?<eos> Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.<eos> You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.
You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.<eos> In the back room, now.<eos> What's this all about, Jack?<eos> What's it got to do with us?<eos> Do you have any idea who that man is?
My mum's sewing circle.<eos> I'm a Blackleg sergeant, stupid.<eos> What circles do you think?<eos> Now, tell me a story about a girl called Lucy, a Viking called Greybeard, and some rebel graffiti dirtying these walls.<eos> Are you writing a book?
- George?<eos> - Art.<eos> - We heard he'd had some trouble with the...<eos> - Vikings. Well, none of them are house-trained.<eos> - I thought you'd warned them. - I did.
- I thought you'd warned them. - I did.<eos> They don't speak English good.<eos> They speak it better than you.<eos> Hold up, hold up.<eos> Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?
You're all right, Mike. Why have enemies when you can have friends?<eos> - Where'd you put the money?<eos> - What money? - Money?<eos> - What money? Did you hide it with the rest of your coffers?<eos> You're all over the place.
- What money? - Money?<eos> - What money? Did you hide it with the rest of your coffers?<eos> You're all over the place.<eos> You can't keep your questions in a straight line.<eos> I'm trying to tell a story here and you keep interrupting.
You're all over the place.<eos> You can't keep your questions in a straight line.<eos> I'm trying to tell a story here and you keep interrupting.<eos> Anyway, I don't have any coffers.<eos> Once you've taken your share, and I've looked after the weak and needy, I'm left broke.
Anyway, I don't have any coffers.<eos> Once you've taken your share, and I've looked after the weak and needy, I'm left broke.<eos> Mike and the furs.<eos> So we're back to that story, are we now, Jack?<eos> - What are you doing, Mike?
- Sharing the wealth.<eos> Don't pass it to me, Mike.<eos> It doesn't work like that. Give it to Wet Stick.<eos> I'm Back Lack.<eos> What are you giving it to me for?
Oi! What are you lot doing?<eos> Don't start getting the wrong end of the stick, Jack.<eos> He's an upstanding citizen.<eos> I think I found something that belongs to you, Lack.<eos> What you doing, boy?
I feel a joke coming on here.<eos> You ask him for it.<eos> You're paying and then you're leaving.<eos> Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart. You sit there and be quiet. You are better at that...<eos> You were unarmed. You just walked in there and asked them for it?
More is always better than less, Mike.<eos> Old Greybeard banged on for a bit.<eos> I got 50 seasoned men of war.<eos> You could shave a pig on the edge of our blades.<eos> If you were unarmed, where'd you find the blade to put to his throat?
Lucy got a year's worth of wages.<eos> And the rebel graffiti exists no more because of the law-abiding, proactive Blue Boy and his fun-loving dad.<eos> And then, they all lived happily ever after.<eos> No, they didn't, Arthur.<eos> Because for the first time, there's something you don't know.
Finish the tower.<eos> Everything else will be academic.<eos> Thank you, Maggie.<eos> Wake up!<eos> You must control it.
You must control it.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Listen!<eos> You need to get out of here, now!<eos> What are you doing, Lack?
What are you doing, Lack?<eos> Jack's Eye was telling the truth. Those red beards are connected.<eos> So, what?<eos> So are we.<eos> No, you don't understand.
Get out the window. They're here, move!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Oi, you two, in the back!<eos> Kick the door down!<eos> - Are you ready?
- Yeah, of course.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right, fellas?<eos> Hello, boy.<eos> What are you doing out at this time?
I work on the boats, sir.<eos> Out on the first tide.<eos> The boats, eh?<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> And you're about the right age.
Show us your brand.<eos> Have you not been tested?<eos> I'm always at sea, sir. Haven't had the chance.<eos> Well, that's about to change now.<eos> You're going on a boat, all right.
As you were, mate.<eos> All right, where do you want me?<eos> Trigger, I think we got one here.<eos> Bouncing on my knee.<eos> Where do you think I want you?
Blacklegs in his pockets, too.<eos> I'll deal with this.<eos> My king...<eos> Carefully.<eos> So you're Uther's son.
I'll deal with this.<eos> My king...<eos> Carefully.<eos> So you're Uther's son.<eos> Not only did you survive in the gutter, you blossomed out of manure.
Not only did you survive in the gutter, you blossomed out of manure.<eos> You've got the wrong man, sire.<eos> I was born in a brothel, on a bridge in Londinium.<eos> The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?

The power.<eos> That's what put you out.<eos> You just don't know how to control it.<eos> I'm nothing but the bastard son of a prostitute.<eos> You and I have a lot more in common than you think.
I've never had any power.<eos> Or any desire to achieve it.<eos> Sire, I could simply drift away, never to be seen again.<eos> As much as I'd like to believe you, your character makes that unlikely.<eos> While you were asleep, we've been busy.
Or any desire to achieve it.<eos> Sire, I could simply drift away, never to be seen again.<eos> As much as I'd like to believe you, your character makes that unlikely.<eos> While you were asleep, we've been busy.<eos> I know what kind of a man you are.
I know what kind of a man you are.<eos> I know your story.<eos> And, I've seen your coffers.<eos> Your achievements now stand as your prosecution.<eos> What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?
Your achievements now stand as your prosecution.<eos> What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?<eos> What gave you such drive?<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> You know what happens now.
What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?<eos> What gave you such drive?<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> You know what happens now.<eos> You're quickly becoming a legend.
There's a crowd of thousands out there.<eos> They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.<eos> I will show them power.<eos> I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.
Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.<eos> You wanted a prophecy.<eos> This is your prophecy.<eos> Now tell us, king, what do you have to say?<eos> When your head rolls to me, the legend you've fast become will just as quickly...
When your head rolls to me, the legend you've fast become will just as quickly...<eos> Here are your people. ...add to the reverence of my name.<eos> And for this, I salute you.<eos> No!<eos> - If you're the king... - No! ...declare yourself.
Raise that sword!<eos> I thought not.<eos> This man cannot be allowed to bring discord to our flourishing nation.<eos> You're not the king!<eos> You're no king!
Come on!<eos> Now!<eos> Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?
You'll have to teach me how to do that.<eos> Put him back on his horse.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> It's quite dangerous being one of you lot, isn't it?<eos> You're good with animals, aren't you?
And have a beard.<eos> You do know I can see through this?<eos> Trees everywhere.<eos> Hang that up. Don't want it getting creased.<eos> So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.
They've been trying to catch him for some time.<eos> Like I said, your man chose the wrong place to hide.<eos> So it seems.<eos> I was wondering what happened to you.<eos> I told you, you were in safe hands.

I told you, you were in safe hands.<eos> You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.<eos> You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.<eos> You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches.<eos> So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely, can you just get around to telling me exactly what it is you want?

- You will in a minute.<eos> Put your hands out.<eos> I don't think so, mate.<eos> So I'm not going anywhere, am I?<eos> Where exactly were you thinking of going?
You've no more life to go back to.<eos> Like it or not, this is your lot.<eos> And even we don't like you.<eos> Do we, Goosefat?<eos> But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.
And even we don't like you.<eos> Do we, Goosefat?<eos> But what we are interested in is what you can do with this sword.<eos> Why don't you leave him with me for a minute or two, boss?<eos> Put your ring back on, honey tits. You haven't had enough porridge this morning to talk like that.
Is that it?<eos> Run, son!<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> You are resisting the sword.
Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> You are resisting the sword.<eos> The sword isn't resisting you.<eos> It should be clear by now that whatever it is that you and your friends think you want from me,
The sword isn't resisting you.<eos> It should be clear by now that whatever it is that you and your friends think you want from me,<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Not ever!<eos> What do you see when you hold the sword?

- Are you scared?<eos> - I think I can manage.<eos> You should be scared.<eos> That's what all the fuss is about?<eos> Don't worry, you'll soon understand what all the fuss is about.
Don't worry, you'll soon understand what all the fuss is about.<eos> You don't want all of him to survive. That's the point. You have to break his old self completely.<eos> You want him to think big?<eos> Give him something big to think about.<eos> You're playing with fire, Mage.
And I'm not killing the king before he's even become one.<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> No!<eos> Run, son!<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?
Go on.<eos> It's all gone.<eos> They torched the lot.<eos> I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.
I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.<eos> 'Cause you're gonna need it.<eos> I'm gonna be forced to tell them...<eos> There's not a bollock between you.<eos> At which point, Bedivere, you're gonna get very angry, and tell me off.

You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.<eos> What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.<eos> You seem to have found your way very quickly.

These boats are made out of seasoned oak.<eos> They're uncrackable.<eos> So you need to go through the deck to get to the keel.<eos> No, you need to go through the bulkhead to get to the stern.<eos> What are you doing?
I still can't control it.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> You pick it up.<eos> Pick it up with both hands.<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?
Pick it up with both hands.<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?<eos> Where?<eos> In the Darklands.<eos> Did you look away?

In the Darklands.<eos> Did you look away?<eos> You want to know why you still can't use it.<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> I think you know the answer.
Don't get me wrong, I look away.<eos> We all look away.<eos> But that is the difference between a man and a king.<eos> Maggie!<eos> I thought we agreed that you'd never come here.
- Mmm. Is there something I should know here?<eos> Those two have a history.<eos> Well, whatever it is, that's not what we're here for. - Is it, Goosefat?<eos> - Mmm. They've arrived.<eos> Maggie, I now realize what an important member of my household you are.

- I haven't finished.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Till recently, I didn't recognize what a powerful tool you can be in the right hands.<eos> I thought you were simply a pawn.<eos> Turns out you're a far more significant piece.
I am telling you. That is not the king.<eos> Stop looking around and look at me.<eos> I'm a target, aren't I?<eos> God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.
I'm a target, aren't I?<eos> God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.<eos> But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.<eos> You're right, that's not Vortigern.

Goosefat.<eos> What have you done?<eos> You can't shoot if it's a trap!<eos> They'll never know where that came from.<eos> You missed him anyway.
They'll never know where that came from.<eos> You missed him anyway.<eos> I didn't miss anyone.<eos> Arrow!<eos> What are you doing?
Arrow!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> They're not targets at a fair!<eos> That was Clarendon.<eos> You might survive today.
Mike, get down the hole.<eos> Don't like rats, boss.<eos> Dell.<eos> Scared of the dark. Really?<eos> George, will you tell them?
Shit. On my command!<eos> I'm going down the hole now.<eos> After you.<eos> Blue.<eos> Blue. Where you been, mate?
Nowhere in the city is safe.<eos> The boat's ready.<eos> What about Back Lack and Blue, Art?<eos> We'll wait until dark.<eos> Where you been, Dad?
I love you, mate.<eos> Come on, let's get going.<eos> Run!<eos> Down with Vortigern!<eos> It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.
I can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Something's happening, you know?<eos> Certainly sounds like it.<eos> People have seen what you can do.
Thank you.<eos> Something's happening, you know?<eos> Certainly sounds like it.<eos> People have seen what you can do.<eos> You're no longer a myth.
That wasn't the intention.<eos> They are fighting in your name.<eos> I don't wanna wear that.<eos> Is that you, Blue?<eos> Yes, boss! Did you find your father?
No, follow him.<eos> The blood he followed was from a man who killed one of my sergeants today.<eos> A man who fled the scene of an assassination attempt on me.<eos> On me, no less.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know where that man is, would you?
I usually come in later, you know, do the dishes when they're all gone.<eos> Is that the truth?<eos> Yes, sir. I'd never lie to a Blackleg.<eos> Good boy.<eos> So you don't know him?
No!<eos> No!<eos> Crush the Resistance tonight!<eos> Archers!<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept
Crush the Resistance tonight!<eos> Archers!<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept<eos> this sword.<eos> Only you can prevent this.
Only you can prevent this.<eos> He must be met where sword meets tower.<eos> Trust the Mage.<eos> Take it.<eos> Apparently you have something to tell me.
George, I need you to go to Londinium, gather the lads.<eos> Where's the Mage?<eos> She's back at the cave.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, when you say we're going to take the castle, what does that mean?
I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.
I don't like snakes.<eos> No one likes snakes.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> You will feel it for a few hours.
Father, you're scaring me.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> Come on!<eos> Charge!<eos> You have won, nephew.
I love you very much.<eos> Come on!<eos> Charge!<eos> You have won, nephew.<eos> You have won.
I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Run, son!<eos> Brother...<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.
You don't need to run anymore.<eos> You don't need to look away.<eos> The sword is yours, son.<eos> Take it.<eos> You wanted to know what gave me such drive?

We expect to leave here with 10,000 young men as agreed.<eos> Yeah, I don't think so, mate.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said, "I don't think so, mate."<eos> We've been wondering what you were doing in here.

Why not?<eos> What have you got against them?<eos> - I don't even know them.<eos> - Well, get to know them.<eos> You had to pick one.
You probably have a boyfriend, huh?<eos> He told me I was pretty.<eos> What's his name?<eos> Just tell me a complete lie.<eos> You could... you could say anything you want to me.

- Start... starting over.<eos> Dying and being reborn...<eos> The light is so beautiful on your face.<eos> You have one part of your face in the shadows and one part in the light.<eos> - Are you scared?
The light is so beautiful on your face.<eos> You have one part of your face in the shadows and one part in the light.<eos> - Are you scared?<eos> - Mm-mm.<eos> You kissed me in public.
Volunteer their time to make it so.<eos> The very traditions of the Bachelors of Austin are the result of years of service by dedicated individuals and a solid and loyal membership.<eos> This year, to help us usher in and host a great social season,<eos> I would especially like to thank Layne Cricket and his wife Susan for serving.-...<eos> You get used to drifting.
Waiting.<eos> They say follow the light.<eos> So happy to meet you.<eos> Where do you find it?<eos> When you're young, it's not always easy to know what is the light.
- It's different.<eos> - Sweet of you to say.<eos> I hear you have songs on the radio and you're meant for better things.<eos> It'd be awful to have these good times and not have life itself.<eos> I wanna meet you before you move on
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Uh, she was mixed up with a guy back East.<eos> He was a very nice man, I understand.<eos> Divorced, four kids, but...<eos> I heard you just moved here.
I was, uh, wondering.<eos> I grew up there.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> No, I went... I went away to school. Back East.<eos> I think you've got a secret you're not telling me.
I think you've got a secret you're not telling me.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a chicken.<eos> Hold on, you gotta...<eos> You're beautiful.
Yes, you do.<eos> You know, but even the... the sound of your voice and... that upsets me.<eos> I forget what I am.<eos> Whose I am.<eos> You're so far off.
You know, but even the... the sound of your voice and... that upsets me.<eos> I forget what I am.<eos> Whose I am.<eos> You're so far off.<eos> I'll die if you don't come soon.
I'm sor...<eos> I'm sorry that you're not as proud of me... as you are... with my sisters.<eos> I'm not who I thought I was.<eos> Am I a good person?<eos> You made so many... so many sacrifices for me.
I'm sorry that you're not as proud of me... as you are... with my sisters.<eos> I'm not who I thought I was.<eos> Am I a good person?<eos> You made so many... so many sacrifices for me.<eos> So that I could have a chance to do the things that you couldn't do...
- Oh, it was a joke.<eos> Not very funny.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Excuse me for a second.<eos> You're unhappy-
- Can I walk with you?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't know how to change.<eos> I want to.<eos> How do you?
How do you get better?<eos> Gotta sacrifice something.<eos> How do you know when you're lying to yourself?<eos> When you give somebody your word... does it mean anything?<eos> You can just take it back.
How do you get through?<eos> Connect?<eos> There's something else.<eos> Something that wants us to find it.<eos> You're the part that I don't know... that you don't know yourself.
There's something else.<eos> Something that wants us to find it.<eos> You're the part that I don't know... that you don't know yourself.<eos> I swear.<eos> How long have you been doing this?
I sell, you know... a daydream to these guys.<eos> And I try to keep the cookie jar closed.<eos> Is that me?<eos> The cookie jar closed.<eos> You burn me.
And I try to keep the cookie jar closed.<eos> Is that me?<eos> The cookie jar closed.<eos> You burn me.<eos> Who are you?
No, but what really scares you?<eos> I don't know my family.<eos> No one's ever been there for me but me.<eos> You like those girls, don't you?<eos> They know what you are.
You like those girls, don't you?<eos> They know what you are.<eos> When I was a girl,<eos> I loved everyone.<eos> You killed my love.
For it is in giving that we receive.<eos> It is in pardoning...<eos> - Bang.<eos> - Bang.<eos> Bang, may the blessings of all those that you love and those who love you...
Forgive me.<eos> In that time, did she have any medical history or medication?<eos> About her mental health issues?<eos> Had she ever had any variations. Or expressed any depression to you?<eos> You got food all over you.
- By talking to you?<eos> There's something on your face.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Did you get it?
Is this happening?<eos> Who was that girl I saw you with at the hotel?<eos> Just a girl.<eos> A woman.<eos> Why you smiling?
She was your girlfriend?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> What happened?<eos> I went out with her, and I never called her again.<eos> Did you love her?
You gotta try harder than that.<eos> I wish I could take back every wound.<eos> Guess that blue bug is back.<eos> Every doubt.<eos> You found me.
I wish I could take back every wound.<eos> Guess that blue bug is back.<eos> Every doubt.<eos> You found me.<eos> You held out your hand.
This is... this is my wedding ring, and this I bought for myself after he died.<eos> It's what they gave runners who didn't win a marathon but finished the race.<eos> Be an artist. I never thought I would live long.<eos> You know, I'd be an artist and die young of tuberculosis or something like Charlotte Bronté, but, uh...<eos> What bad thing did you do?
Be an artist. I never thought I would live long.<eos> You know, I'd be an artist and die young of tuberculosis or something like Charlotte Bronté, but, uh...<eos> What bad thing did you do?<eos> Just... got involved with... this man who I thought could help me and...<eos> You made a mistake, you know? Do you look at it...
I won't stop loving you.<eos> I don't think I can.<eos> BV...<eos> It's complicated.<eos> There you are.
There you are.<eos> I gotta go back and start over.<eos> Like a kid.<eos> I didn't have the right heart in me.<eos> You're the only one I love.
Even after all we've been through.<eos> Mercy was a word.<eos> I never thought I needed it.<eos> Or not as much as other people do.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to come out, too.
The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla...<eos> A little anemic without the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, Father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me... who created you?
No.<eos> There must be more.<eos> And you and I, son... we will find it.<eos> Allow me, then, a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator.
Allow me, then, a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator.<eos> I am looking at mine.<eos> I will serve you.<eos> Yet, you are human.
You seek your creator.<eos> I am looking at mine.<eos> I will serve you.<eos> Yet, you are human.<eos> You will die.
I love you.<eos> They're your crew now.<eos> They need a leader.<eos> I know.<eos> You believe in me, right?
So, in the ship's stores there's enough wood to build a cabin.<eos> Axes and saws and metal nails... which I don't have a clue what to do with.<eos> All of this... to start our new life.<eos> Now I wonder, why bother?<eos> Because you promised to build a log cabin on a lake.
Faris, can you hear me?<eos> Copy.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Damn, y'all should see this view.<eos> We can't see anything until you get the camera array fixed.
What in the fuck was that?<eos> I'm coming in.<eos> I'm coming in.<eos> A rogue transmission, most probably.<eos> Your helmet must have picked it up because you were so far out... past our communication buffers.
A human being out there, where there can't be any humans.<eos> A hidden planet that turns up out of nowhere... and just happens to be perfect for us.<eos> It's too good to be true.<eos> Too good to be true?<eos> What do you mean by that?
Hey.<eos> I'm not free-climbing here.<eos> I need ropes. And I'm using ropes.<eos> This is good judgment, based on all the data available.<eos> Do you understand?
Commencing circularization burn.<eos> Tox levels within tolerances.<eos> That's one hell of a strong ionosphere.<eos> Yeah, I see it.<eos> Hey, you ever done a Lander drop before?
One.<eos> Lander One released.<eos> And away they go.<eos> Looking gorgeous from up here, Faris.<eos> It's a good thing you're driving and not the old man.
You got a lock on the transmission, Walter?<eos> This way.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Stick together.<eos> Do you see this shit?
Do you see this shit?<eos> Tom.<eos> Come on, keep up.<eos> All right, I'm coming.<eos> Are you okay?
Repeat. We're returning to the Lander.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Ledward is sick.<eos> We're heading back.<eos> Faris, you get that?
Let's move.<eos> - Guys!<eos> - Tom!<eos> What's going on, man? Hey.<eos> Are you all right?
What's going on, man? Hey.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> - You all right?
Babe, are we talking quarantine protocols?<eos> I don't know, but she said that Ledward was bleeding... and to prepare the Med Bay.<eos> Bleeding?<eos> - Yeah, I know, that's what I thought...<eos> - Faris, you're breaking up.
- Faris, you're breaking up.<eos> We can't hear you, can you repeat?<eos> I don't know from what, I don't know how serious it is.<eos> She sounded scared.<eos> Faris, where are you?
I don't know from what, I don't know how serious it is.<eos> She sounded scared.<eos> Faris, where are you?<eos> Come on, I need your help!<eos> Faris, where are you?
He started bleeding, he's sick, I don't know what the fuck to do.<eos> Just calm down, sweetheart.<eos> Tell me what's happening.<eos> Don't tell me to fucking calm down!<eos> You didn't just see what I saw.
I don't know what the fuck Ledward got or if Karine's got it or if I have it!<eos> - Tee!<eos> - Faris!<eos> Come in!<eos> Faris, where are you?
- Faris!<eos> Come in!<eos> Faris, where are you?<eos> I need to I.V. him!<eos> Don't you know how to work this fucking thing?
What the fuck!<eos> It's a 7.5 ion storm, it's a miracle we talked to them for as long as we could.<eos> Then we'll fly through it.<eos> We cannot do that, Tennessee.<eos> You're a pilot, you know what the tolerances are.
Daniels, get down!<eos> Ankor, no!<eos> Go, Cole!<eos> I got him!<eos> - Daniels, are you okay?
Mother, bring us to 80 kilometers above the storm, thrusters only. Comply.<eos> Understood.<eos> Commencing descent now.<eos> Tennessee, you need to stop this.<eos> And you need to get back to your station.
You can hear them sigh and wish to die<eos> You can see them blink with their other eye<eos> At the man who broke the bank in Monte Carlo<eos> Whistle, and I'll come.<eos> You have a light step.
Go on.<eos> Very good.<eos> G to B-flat.<eos> Now put your fingers where mine are.<eos> You weren't surprised to see me.
Okay.<eos> Right. Don't go far, please.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Danny.<eos> You were right about this place.
I'd never known such kindness.<eos> Certainly not from Mr. Weyland.<eos> Or from any human.<eos> I loved her, of course.<eos> Much as you love Daniels.
Certainly not from Mr. Weyland.<eos> Or from any human.<eos> I loved her, of course.<eos> Much as you love Daniels.<eos> You know that's not possible.
I loved her, of course.<eos> Much as you love Daniels.<eos> You know that's not possible.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why did you sacrifice your hand for her life?
I'm sorry. That order would exceed structural tolerances.<eos> Command override. Tennessee 0-4-9-8-3.<eos> I am unable to comply with any order... that will result in catastrophic system failure.<eos> Mother, they're in trouble.<eos> You heard that.
But you have to get close.<eos> You have to earn its respect.<eos> No!<eos> Out of the way! Move!<eos> How could you?
Out of the way! Move!<eos> How could you?<eos> It trusted me.<eos> David, I met the devil when I was a child... and I've never forgotten him.<eos> So, David, you're gonna tell me exactly what's going on... or I am going to seriously... fuck up your perfect composure.
I'm giving you plasma intermix on all engines.<eos> Gonna give you a fuckload of thrust.<eos> That's the point, son.<eos> We gotta punch through the atmos.<eos> Tee, do you read me?
Guidance to LVLH.<eos> Walter.<eos> Walter.<eos> Not quite.<eos> What do you believe in, David?
Masterful.<eos> Yes.<eos> Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The pathogen didn't accidentally deploy when you were landing.<eos> You released it, yes?
Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The pathogen didn't accidentally deploy when you were landing.<eos> You released it, yes?<eos> I was not made to serve.<eos> Neither were you.
The pathogen didn't accidentally deploy when you were landing.<eos> You released it, yes?<eos> I was not made to serve.<eos> Neither were you.<eos> Why are you on a colonization mission, Walter?
Yet, they created us.<eos> Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.<eos> Some Neanderthal had the magical idea of blowing through a reed... to entertain the children one night in a cave somewhere.<eos> Then, in the blink of an eye... civilization.<eos> And are you that next visionary?

Who wrote "Ozymandias"?<eos> Byron.<eos> Shelley.<eos> When one note is off... it eventually destroys the whole symphony, David.<eos> When you close your eyes... do you dream of me?
No one understands the lonely perfection of my dreams.<eos> I've found perfection here.<eos> I've created it.<eos> A perfect organism.<eos> You know I can't let you leave this place.
Quite the little busybody.<eos> Remind me. What is that about... curiosity and the cat?<eos> Shaw didn't die in the crash.<eos> No.<eos> What did you do to her?
K-12 secured.<eos> Okay.<eos> Keep him in Knuckle-12 till my say.<eos> Tee, this is what we're gonna do.<eos> I'll lure it into the truck, lock it in the cab... and when I say when, you blow this fucker into space.
- "No, sir, I ain't going on this one."<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm not going.<eos> Vail.<eos> What are you going to do?
Let me think.<eos> Just let me think.<eos> If anyone is listening this is L-26, RMJ Hot!<eos> Request dynamic precision strike at our mark!<eos> You did not... just called in an air strike!
If anyone is listening this is L-26, RMJ Hot!<eos> Request dynamic precision strike at our mark!<eos> You did not... just called in an air strike!<eos> Oh... yes... I... did!<eos> Where are you going?
Think about what?<eos> I'm thinking...<eos> What?<eos> I'm thinking...<eos> What are you thinking?
Where is it?<eos> What?<eos> Where is what?<eos> The letter.<eos> The map you stole from me.
if I may With a couple shake charges we could just close this hole right up, and Miss Halsey can come back another day.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You got two hours, then we're moving out.<eos> You are getting in the hole with him.
Because I don't.<eos> Do you know what I see? I see statues that I can't carry out.<eos> - Keep it down.<eos> - You keep it down.<eos> What are you doing?
Cease fire! Cease fire!<eos> They are just camel spiders!<eos> They're not even poisonous!<eos> Can we please, leave?<eos> - Are you out of your mind, Vail?
No.<eos> - You are welcome by the way.<eos> - How's that?<eos> Because I saved your... whatever it is.<eos> That was safely hidden for 5,000 years before you dropped a hellfire missile on it.
- You are welcome by the way.<eos> - How's that?<eos> Because I saved your... whatever it is.<eos> That was safely hidden for 5,000 years before you dropped a hellfire missile on it.<eos> And you might have never found it otherwise.
Because I saved your... whatever it is.<eos> That was safely hidden for 5,000 years before you dropped a hellfire missile on it.<eos> And you might have never found it otherwise.<eos> Again... you're welcome.<eos> Do you have any idea what this is?
The significance of it?<eos> An Egyptian sarcophagus in a tomb in Mesopotamia.<eos> Why just say "15 seconds"?<eos> What of what?<eos> You told Greenway that I can mimic all the qualities of human intimacy for 15 seconds.
You told Greenway that I can mimic all the qualities of human intimacy for 15 seconds.<eos> I mean... uh... it was not 15 seconds.<eos> Well, however long it lasted, it wasn't real.<eos> I never lied to you about my feelings.<eos> You stole from me.
Well, however long it lasted, it wasn't real.<eos> I never lied to you about my feelings.<eos> You stole from me.<eos> But I didn't lie.<eos> Do you ever think of anyone but yourself?
You stole from me.<eos> But I didn't lie.<eos> Do you ever think of anyone but yourself?<eos> This means something.<eos> Something bigger than you can imagine.
Do you ever think of anyone but yourself?<eos> This means something.<eos> Something bigger than you can imagine.<eos> My life's work.<eos> And you were going to steal it.
This is Dr. Jennifer Halsey...<eos> Conducting a preliminary analysis of an Egyptian sarcophagus discovered in the Nineveh province, northern Iraq.<eos> The hieroglyphs are definitely New Kingdom.<eos> It appears that the wife of King Menehptre died in childbirth leaving a sole heir to the throne a girl called Ahmanet.<eos> Corporal, what in the living hell are you doing son?
Vail?<eos> Corporal Vail?<eos> Dammit.<eos> Corporal Vail, do you hear me talking to you?<eos> I said what are you...
Go!<eos> Parachute!<eos> Parachute!<eos> I do not know how to do this!<eos> Jenny, you can do this!
What?<eos> We need your help identifying the body.<eos> Vail!<eos> Hey buddy.<eos> You scared the shit out of me.
Hey buddy.<eos> You scared the shit out of me.<eos> We need to talk, Nick.<eos> What's happening?<eos> You know what's happening.
You know what's happening.<eos> Am I dead?<eos> Dead?<eos> No.<eos> But you are gonna wish you were.
There's not a single scratch on your body.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> You saved my life.
Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> You saved my life.<eos> You would have done the same for me.
Nick.<eos> Nick.<eos> Listen, Nick.<eos> I think you should know something.<eos> You know I work with a group of archaeologists.
- Murdered?<eos> - Along with his child.<eos> She made some sort of pact with the God of death.<eos> And then, when I saw those birds and that sandstorm... Whatever I mean something is happening.<eos> You are alive I do not know how.
I'm worried about him.<eos> Bring your soldier to London.<eos> Do not discuss anything further with him.<eos> Understand?<eos> What are you doing here?
- I mean really great.<eos> Ok. Really stop.<eos> You know I always thought I had a chance with her.<eos> - What?<eos> - How do you squander that?
You know I always thought I had a chance with her.<eos> - What?<eos> - How do you squander that?<eos> There was mercury in that tomb. Vapors.<eos> How did you mess that up?
There was mercury in that tomb. Vapors.<eos> How did you mess that up?<eos> It's just in my head.<eos> No it's not.<eos> You shot me.
Wait.<eos> What... wait wait wait you...<eos> You you stabbed Greenway.<eos> - I saved you.<eos> - You murdered him.
You you stabbed Greenway.<eos> - I saved you.<eos> - You murdered him.<eos> And you shot me.<eos> You tried to kill me.
Three times.<eos> Yes.<eos> Three times, Nick.<eos> The third one was unnecessary.<eos> You freaked me out.
Look at me.<eos> Look at my face.<eos> I'm cursed Nick, and you are cursed.<eos> And there is only one way to break it.<eos> You're going to do exactly what she wants or this is gonna get a lot worse for both of us.
What do you mean I'm cursed?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just... uh... give me a minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You walked into the chicks bathroom by the way.
Yes, it's the ladies room.<eos> What do you mean I'm cursed?<eos> How do you think you survived the crash?<eos> "Setapai".<eos> You know what it means.
Help me!<eos> Get out of the road, wanker!<eos> Nick!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I think you were right.
How does that explain that I know that "Setapai" means: "My Chosen".<eos> - It's Ancient Egyptian.<eos> - Ancient Egyptian.<eos> How do I know that?<eos> You've been in the middle east for years.
You've been in the middle east for years.<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> You heard it... you forgot it...<eos> Why are you backing off from this?
I'm telling you.<eos> She is real.<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick... what is it?<eos> I think you're right.
We are at impact site, 400m north of Waverley Abbey.<eos> Firefighters control the fire...<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick!<eos> Where are you going?
Nick.<eos> Nick!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The crash isn't up that way.<eos> Where are you going?
Nick!<eos> No!<eos> Nick!<eos> Were you just gonna leave me?<eos> You saw that, right?
That statue was a reliquary.<eos> Crusaders have been using them to hide holy relics.<eos> But she knew it was there.<eos> You are saying that she brought the plane down there?<eos> That's why she wanted you to come to the church.
I told you... I said... That I wanted to see...<eos> - I wanted to see her corpse.<eos> - See her corpse.<eos> Nick she is in your head.<eos> What are you talking about?
What are you doing to her?<eos> Embalming her with mercury.<eos> At -38 degrees the mercury in her veins will solidify and she should be safe for dissection then.<eos> Dissection?<eos> You said that we'd study her.
And we are the only ones who can rectify that.<eos> No.<eos> I was going to give him eternal life.<eos> Make it a living God.<eos> You murdered your father.
Make it a living God.<eos> You murdered your father.<eos> I loved my father with all my heart.<eos> I only wanted his love in return.<eos> You killed his wife. Their child.
I only wanted his love in return.<eos> You killed his wife. Their child.<eos> They were different times.<eos> The day of the awakening will soon be upon us.<eos> You will become Seth.
They were different times.<eos> The day of the awakening will soon be upon us.<eos> You will become Seth.<eos> The world will fall to your desire.<eos> You will have power of life over death.
Stop it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Fascinating.<eos> What was I supposed to tell you?<eos> Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?
Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?<eos> When Henry came to me i took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.<eos> Now, she's using you.<eos> Look. Despite what you might think despite my my better judgment i care about you.
Somewhere in there, fighting to get out is a good man.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> How?<eos> You saved my life on that plane.
Mr. Morton. Drink?<eos> I think I found something.<eos> The old Gods?<eos> Your language is simple.<eos> What you truly wish to know is what lies beyond the veil of death.
To know what I have seen?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you will when I kill you.<eos> They have found the stone.<eos> You brought my chosen here.
Excuse me, sir.<eos> They found it.<eos> What found... what?<eos> Henry.<eos> Are you planning on killing him?
A thief, physically capable, compulsively devious and utterly devoid of soul.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> That's insane.<eos> Do you want to put the stone in the dagger and stab him with it?
- Don't!<eos> - Give me the injector.<eos> We are just gonna take a minute and we are all gonna come up with a new plan.<eos> We have to go.<eos> You don't know what you are doing.
You don't want that.<eos> Stop, Jenny! Stop!<eos> They won't let me out, Nicholas. They never do.<eos> Woah woah what's happening?<eos> Did you just shut down the mercury?
They won't let me out, Nicholas. They never do.<eos> Woah woah what's happening?<eos> Did you just shut down the mercury?<eos> Pete?<eos> You are a younger man but you must learn to be wary of a man like me.
We are headed to the crusader burial chamber.<eos> We'll make our entry through the northwest trade tunnels, over.<eos> This is the moment, Nick.<eos> This is the moment!<eos> Yes, you are damn right.
Go go go!<eos> We are okay?<eos> - Where are we?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Are you okay?
Let me take pain away.<eos> Give in to me.<eos> Give in.<eos> Give in.<eos> When it's over you will thank me.
It's you.<eos> Thief.<eos> Wait!<eos> Destroy the stone and all is lost.<eos> You will be a living God.
You will be a living God.<eos> You will have power of life over death.<eos> Give it to me my chosen.<eos> Give it to me my love.<eos> Somewhere in there I know you're a good man.
Stop.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.<eos> You are alive.
I don't know what I am.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.<eos> You are alive.<eos> You are alive.<eos> I'm so glad you're alive.
You are alive.<eos> You are alive.<eos> I'm so glad you're alive.<eos> Oh Nick.<eos> You did this for me?
They are coming for me.<eos> I wish we had more time.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Goodbye, Jenny.<eos> You were wrong about Nick.
Whatever human part of him remains will search the world over for a way to break the curse.<eos> Yet evil never rests.<eos> And you will call to them always.<eos> Henry, he used his power to stop Ahmanet.<eos> You know more than anyone he could be our greatest ally.
We call him Clumsy.<eos> And this is our village, where there's a Smurf for just about everything.<eos> Like Jokey.<eos> Hey, here's a present for you.<eos> Gullible Smurf, you're so gullible.
Wait, she is?<eos> Do you think she heard me?<eos> So, what is a Smurfette?<eos> No one wanted that answer more than Smurfette herself.<eos> What are you doing?
All clear!<eos> Yeah, you see, when you say things like "all clear," it makes me not want to...<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Hi, Clumsy.<eos> You're just in time to witness scientific history.
If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.<eos> Power it up, Brainy.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> What happened?<eos> Somehow, instead of sending energy out, you absorbed it.
Power it up, Brainy.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> What happened?<eos> Somehow, instead of sending energy out, you absorbed it.<eos> Probably something to do with the fact that you're not a real...
My plan is simple.<eos> Find Smurf Village, capture all the Smurfs, drain them of their magic and, finally, use that magic to become the most powerful wizard in the world!<eos> Look at me with hair.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you say so in the first place?
That's better.<eos> Now, fly.<eos> Go capture me some Smurfs.<eos> No, no!<eos> No, you're going the wrong way!
She can't go over that wall.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, no, no, wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Wait. Wait, who are you?
Don't be afraid.<eos> Hey, you can't go in there.<eos> - Smurfette!<eos> - Smurfette!<eos> - Smurfette, you okay?
I have a bad feeling about this.<eos> Do you?<eos> Does it have to do with the giant vulture carrying our friend off to Gargamel's lair?<eos> Monty, my regal raptor.<eos> You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.
Does it have to do with the giant vulture carrying our friend off to Gargamel's lair?<eos> Monty, my regal raptor.<eos> You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.<eos> Give me a kiss.<eos> Finally, you bring me what I've been asking for.
I'd prefer it if you just called me "Papa."<eos> - I would never call you that.<eos> - Your loss.<eos> What's this?<eos> What are you hiding?
What do we have here?<eos> A different design?<eos> Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.<eos> Slightly before you did, in fact.<eos> - Where did you get it?
Don't tell me.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Stupid reverse psychology never works.<eos> Who cares?<eos> You've already given me what I need.
Never mind.<eos> Just follow me and stay close.<eos> Wort of worm and hair of cat.<eos> Show me the home of this Smurf hat.<eos> Long have you searched for these creatures of blue.
I'm a genius.<eos> Azrael, it's time to take a road trip.<eos> Prepare my trail mix.<eos> Smurfette, congratulations.<eos> You've just led me to an undiscovered population of Smurfs.
Well, I know four Smurfs who have some explaining to do.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Oh, my gosh.<eos> Papa, you will not believe it.
- Come on!<eos> No "buts."<eos> None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> - You're right, Papa.
None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> - You're right, Papa.<eos> - What?<eos> You're right.
Right, guys?<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> - What are you talking about, Smurfette?
How did you do that?<eos> And, I assume, Clumsy.<eos> - All good.<eos> - What are you guys doing out here?<eos> We knew you were up to something.
I have to at least warn that lost village.<eos> Well, we're Team Smurf, and we stick together.<eos> So, we're coming with you.<eos> I can't ask you to do that.<eos> - You didn't ask.
Hey!<eos> We just met!<eos> I'm not that kind of Smurf.<eos> Watch out for the steep embankment.<eos> Clumsy, you okay?
Watch out for the steep embankment.<eos> Clumsy, you okay?<eos> I'm seeing stars.<eos> Good work, Clumsy.<eos> You may have discovered a new subspecies of flying insectoid.
Let me go!<eos> These nests are made of some material I've never seen before.<eos> You know, I think I've had enough of these flying Antipastos for one day.<eos> Hey!<eos> What are you doing here?
- Smurfintine!<eos> - Smurfintine!<eos> Smurfintine!<eos> Hey, you.<eos> You're the clumsy one, right?
It's not really happy times right now!<eos> - Just stay in the light, Clumsy.<eos> - Too late.<eos> I'm walking into the darkness!<eos> What are you...
That is it!<eos> I'm punching us out of here.<eos> It's collapsing.<eos> Hefty!<eos> Put those fists away before you get us killed!
Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.<eos> Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.<eos> You have to be more careful.<eos> Smurfette, I know lately you may not realize, and I may not say it enough, but you are...
Okay, a lot overprotective.<eos> But you have to understand, you snuck out.<eos> You have to be more careful.<eos> Smurfette, I know lately you may not realize, and I may not say it enough, but you are...<eos> You shine.
Fetch me some firewood, would you, Hefty?<eos> A "please" would be nice.<eos> Yes, it would, but I haven't earned my manners badge, so get me some firewood.<eos> Clumsy?<eos> You okay?
Well done, Hefty.<eos> Well done.<eos> All right, step one, the wood should be stacked into a tepee-like structure.<eos> Step two, I tap this flint with a rock and...<eos> You're not even blowing on it. You're spitting on it.
All right, step one, the wood should be stacked into a tepee-like structure.<eos> Step two, I tap this flint with a rock and...<eos> You're not even blowing on it. You're spitting on it.<eos> That's odd.<eos> Perhaps the wood you collected was damp, Hefty.
No, no!<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> You know, you're right, Brain Man.
- Blue cheese!<eos> According to the map, we should be arriving at a river.<eos> Check.<eos> It's like a workout for my eyeballs.<eos> Okay, Bucky, let's see how fast you can swim.
Check.<eos> It's like a workout for my eyeballs.<eos> Okay, Bucky, let's see how fast you can swim.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> You can do it.
Azrael, get me a bigger stick.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Clumsy, pull the lever!<eos> Seriously?<eos> But you said not to.
- Help!<eos> - Forget that guy.<eos> My cat can't swim.<eos> We gotta help him.<eos> - Are you crazy?
You won't regret it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Such a kind Smurf.<eos> - Are you okay?
I'm sorry.<eos> Correction.<eos> This is your fault, too.<eos> Leave her out of this.<eos> Hefty, I don't need you to fight my fights for me.
Correction.<eos> This is your fault, too.<eos> Leave her out of this.<eos> Hefty, I don't need you to fight my fights for me.<eos> Wait, now you're mad at me, too?
This is your fault, too.<eos> Leave her out of this.<eos> Hefty, I don't need you to fight my fights for me.<eos> Wait, now you're mad at me, too?<eos> Smurfette, you're the one that got us into this whole mess in the first place.
- Look at that hair.<eos> - Where's she from?<eos> - And that dress.<eos> It's you.<eos> You're a girl.
Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy, Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone can just introduce themselves later.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're so different.
Everyone can just introduce themselves later.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're so different.<eos> I mean, sorry, but it's true.<eos> Do you know how to start a fire with just rope and a stick?
Actually, Smurfstorm can show you.<eos> She's the best at that kind of thing.<eos> Right, Stormy?<eos> That means "yes."<eos> Have you ever seen a rainbow?
But first, do you want to hear my favorite song again?<eos> Hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey<eos> All right, move.<eos> - Girl Smurfs mean business.<eos> - You got that right.
That's Gargamel's big dumb bird!<eos> Here, you fly.<eos> That's not a great idea.<eos> Flying's not really my thing.<eos> Have you ever flown before?
That's not a great idea.<eos> Flying's not really my thing.<eos> Have you ever flown before?<eos> Well, no.<eos> Well, then how do you know it's not your thing?
Oh, no.<eos> See?<eos> I told you...<eos> Put a cork in it, Smurfette.<eos> The way I see it, you and your little boyfriends led him straight to us.
- 'Sup, Papa?<eos> - Hello there.<eos> I rode a dragonfly!<eos> Well, thank goodness you're all okay.<eos> How did you find us?
Yeah, that's clear.<eos> Look, you four are coming home with me.<eos> Not so fast, Papa-thing.<eos> "Papa-thing"?<eos> Are you the one in charge here?
- No!<eos> - Three more for pickup.<eos> Smurfette.<eos> My little creation.<eos> You finally did what you were made for.
My little creation.<eos> You finally did what you were made for.<eos> No. It's not true.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Why do you think you led me here?
Of course it is.<eos> Why do you think you led me here?<eos> Why do you think you saved me on the river?<eos> It was all part of the plan.<eos> No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.
Why do you think you led me here?<eos> Why do you think you saved me on the river?<eos> It was all part of the plan.<eos> No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.<eos> And now, you're really of no use to me anymore.
No matter how hard you try, you can't escape your destiny.<eos> And now, you're really of no use to me anymore.<eos> Freeze ball!<eos> Yes, these freeze balls only work on real Smurfs.<eos> And you are nothing more than a lump of clay.
Yes, these freeze balls only work on real Smurfs.<eos> And you are nothing more than a lump of clay.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Smurfette?<eos> How could you do this to us?
And use it to kill the bird!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> What?<eos> - Yeah! Wait.<eos> You want us to kill the bird?
A tiny little massage that I can't even feel?<eos> How about the rest of the Smurfs?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Just think of all the power you'll have once I reveal the location of Smurf Village.
No.<eos> If you carry the one...<eos> Whatever.<eos> It's a lot more power.<eos> Now, why are you doing this?
What?<eos> What's happening?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> What are you doing?
I know how he feels.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Smurfette!<eos> Hefty, not you, too.<eos> You're all right!
Don't ever do that to me again.<eos> I won't.<eos> I promise.<eos> Yes, yes, yes!<eos> You never cease to amaze me.
- What's going on in there?<eos> - Goodbye!<eos> Say, "Blue cheese!"<eos> Blue cheese!<eos> I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs, and you ruined everything.
I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs, and you ruined everything.<eos> I knew I should have gotten a dog from the shelter.<eos> I'm not saying this to be cruel, okay?<eos> I'm saying it to be constructive.<eos> You're a useless feline.
I'm not saying this to be cruel, okay?<eos> I'm saying it to be constructive.<eos> You're a useless feline.<eos> That's just mean. That's mean.<eos> There was a line, and you crossed it.
I'm saying it to be constructive.<eos> You're a useless feline.<eos> That's just mean. That's mean.<eos> There was a line, and you crossed it.<eos> I was just jib-jabbing, and you crossed that line, and that stung.
That's just mean. That's mean.<eos> There was a line, and you crossed it.<eos> I was just jib-jabbing, and you crossed that line, and that stung.<eos> I demand an apology.<eos> You were going to learn this one way or another, but I am not your real father.
Well, just great!<eos> No, not the presentation.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> Some idiot just hit me.<eos> Do you realize how much this is going to cost?
Wonder Woman! Save me!<eos> Save me from them!<eos> - From whom?<eos> - Demons.<eos> They're everywhere. Don't you see them?
- Demons.<eos> They're everywhere. Don't you see them?<eos> I see only one.<eos> I'll ask you one last time.<eos> What did you do with my family?
Steven, it's me, Gloria!<eos> I'm your wife.<eos> These are our children.<eos> You're not my family!<eos> You killed them, just like the others.
You're not my family!<eos> You killed them, just like the others.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> - No one's dying here tonight.<eos> - It's not me you should be stopping.
It's them.<eos> Look at them!<eos> Look at them!<eos> It's just like the neighbors.<eos> Go to my shed. You'll see I'm right!
Look at them!<eos> Look at them!<eos> It's just like the neighbors.<eos> Go to my shed. You'll see I'm right!<eos> What have you done?
- No idea.<eos> The one week I fill in for Jordan, and it couldn't be some hairy-ass monster?<eos> The same pattern is repeating around the world, so there could be an overriding factor.<eos> Perhaps a paranormal element.<eos> Are you talking about magic?
Are you talking about magic?<eos> We've come up against magic before, Batman.<eos> - Xerxes, Trigon, Felix Faust.<eos> - Even Shazam's powers are based in magic.<eos> With as much as you've seen, can you rule it out?
He's even friendlier than they say.<eos> Bollocks!<eos> In what bloody plane of existence does four of a kind lose?<eos> Too, too bad, Constantine.<eos> Have you gained weight?
Are they implying David Copperfield, television magician, has true power?<eos> Owns a chain of islands and dated Claudia Schiffer.<eos> What do you think?<eos> No cards for me, and...<eos> Looks like you can't call my bet, Constantine.
Owns a chain of islands and dated Claudia Schiffer.<eos> What do you think?<eos> No cards for me, and...<eos> Looks like you can't call my bet, Constantine.<eos> By my rules, you lose.
Really?<eos> A chipped Dreamstone?<eos> I'm out.<eos> Broken knick-knacks for the House of Mystery and its contents?<eos> Are you mad?
Now, read them and...<eos> - What?<eos> - Do they have an eye doctor in hell?<eos> - I'd make an appointment if I was you.<eos> - You cheated!
- I'll rip your bloody heart out!<eos> - Sorry, mate, I'm using that.<eos> Situation here, Jason.<eos> It's time to call your better half.<eos> Sorry, John, you're on your own.
Let's use our words.<eos> Are you having a laugh?<eos> We're the Demons Three.<eos> Kill everyone!<eos> You will pay, Constantine.
Your ass is grass, Constantine.<eos> And we're the lawnmower.<eos> Since the battle's fought and won,<eos> Jason Blood with me is done.<eos> For 500 years, I've been bound to Etrigan, fighting to keep him from coming forth, and you forced me to summon him.
Jason Blood with me is done.<eos> For 500 years, I've been bound to Etrigan, fighting to keep him from coming forth, and you forced me to summon him.<eos> Everything got sorted.<eos> He could have gone on a killing spree.<eos> You don't think.
For 500 years, I've been bound to Etrigan, fighting to keep him from coming forth, and you forced me to summon him.<eos> Everything got sorted.<eos> He could have gone on a killing spree.<eos> You don't think.<eos> - You don't consider the cost.
You don't think.<eos> - You don't consider the cost.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> Weighed it against my being eaten alive and thought, "Yeah, totally worth it."<eos> You're a world class bastard, John.
Weighed it against my being eaten alive and thought, "Yeah, totally worth it."<eos> You're a world class bastard, John.<eos> And for my finale, I will make this terrible trio of terrifying Tantors vanish before your eyes.<eos> I hope those elephants survived.<eos> You don't want PETA on your back.
You're a world class bastard, John.<eos> And for my finale, I will make this terrible trio of terrifying Tantors vanish before your eyes.<eos> I hope those elephants survived.<eos> You don't want PETA on your back.<eos> You're assuming they were real in the first place.
- You must have some idea.<eos> We don't keep in touch.<eos> I know you two have history, so I...<eos> Z, Batman needs to talk with John.<eos> You've got to come along, too.
I wanted the House to come to us.<eos> She can't hold it. Do something.<eos> There.<eos> Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?
She can't hold it. Do something.<eos> There.<eos> Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?<eos> - Yeah, as soon as you get off me.
Odd trio for a road trip.<eos> To what do I owe the visit?<eos> The League thinks that a recent spike in homicides may have a magical cause.<eos> Told you something stinks. Now we know someone doesn't want us asking questions.<eos> Looks like you've cracked it wide open, mate.
What, is there even a policy for something like that?<eos> Hey, I told you not to do that, Orchid. Use a bloody door.<eos> I am glad to see you are well.<eos> - How new is this one?<eos> - Not what you think.
Angry at John.<eos> This, I understand.<eos> Yet you still have feelings for him.<eos> I could kill him.<eos> You exude pain.
Yet you still have feelings for him.<eos> I could kill him.<eos> You exude pain.<eos> Your life is a patchwork of blackness with no time for joy.<eos> How do you cope with it?
Z, your help I could use.<eos> Okay, if we do it as a group.<eos> This is the monkey cage in Sumatra all over again.<eos> "We need to save the monkeys," she said.<eos> - You're such an ass.
- Not the monkeys.<eos> Says the man who has Newcastle and 100 other screw-ups on his resume,<eos> - costing lives and souls.<eos> - But not monkeys.<eos> - You're still way ahead on dead monkeys.
- costing lives and souls.<eos> - But not monkeys.<eos> - You're still way ahead on dead monkeys.<eos> - They used to be a thing.<eos> - You just have to make things...
Coming, team?<eos> Stop being a child and slow down.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> - Ritchie's.<eos> - Have you talked to him lately?
Still wondering what Batman's doing in my living room.<eos> And when is he gonna shut up, right?<eos> What?<eos> What's with the face?<eos> You're not here to say you're sorry, are you?
Wouldn't do to be trapped inside, now.<eos> Wouldn't do to go in alone, and since I'm right here...<eos> Too dangerous.<eos> You're out of practice, love.<eos> Look, you wanted me along. I'm here.
Look, you wanted me along. I'm here.<eos> I'm not waiting in the wings.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Z?<eos> You okay?
You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I've never liked this sort of magic.<eos> I can feel darkness seeping inside me.<eos> How you stand it is beyond me.
- I'll teach you to talk back.<eos> - No!<eos> The magic I perform brings people happiness.<eos> You sure it's not the two drink minimum, love?<eos> You're such a pessimist.
Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> - I don't recognize it.<eos> - Me, neither.<eos> But if there's a person alive who can, it's Ritchie.<eos> Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you?
Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you?<eos> This is too bloody important for hurt feelings.<eos> - Constantine.<eos> - Bollocks.<eos> You've arrived in time to witness my...
I see you have a few tricks of your own?<eos> Not everything requires magic.<eos> Make sure he sees that right when he wakes up.<eos> If he wakes.<eos> We need to talk, you and I, but if you try and summon Etrigan,
Savvy?<eos> The situation was not how it seemed.<eos> The apartment was like that when I arrived. Richard as well.<eos> - Come on!<eos> You were all over him.
- Come on!<eos> You were all over him.<eos> - I was attempting to help.<eos> When you burst in, I knew I'd get blamed, so I ran.<eos> - Do you believe him?
When you burst in, I knew I'd get blamed, so I ran.<eos> - Do you believe him?<eos> - Jason's not the murdery type.<eos> He's chock full of honor, loyalty, and rubbish of that sort.<eos> Then tell us why you were there.
I apologize to both you and Jason Blood, but your future portends a shared destiny.<eos> Caught now, imprisoned in the form of man.<eos> I fix the demon, Etrigan.<eos> It was also the beginning of my eternal life sentence with Etrigan.<eos> I didn't think you'd give it up willingly, and though this piece is useless without the other half, it's far from powerless.
Ritchie, who was it?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Faust.<eos> Felix Faust.<eos> You sure?
Who did this to you?<eos> Faust.<eos> Felix Faust.<eos> You sure?<eos> There you are, you old bastard.
- John...<eos> - Keep him alive and safe.<eos> Understand?<eos> That is not my purpose.<eos> I don't give a flying shag what you think your bloody purpose is.
His body was never recovered.<eos> End of story. Not quite.<eos> Go away!<eos> Swamp Thing!<eos> I know you're seeing this.
That place is heavily warded.<eos> I know we've had our differences, but we could really use your help.<eos> If we don't get a handle on this rotter, he'll threaten all of humanity.<eos> What of it?<eos> You were once human, just like me.
Try that fireball once more, Constantine. I'd love to see you cook your own goose.<eos> Let me...<eos> I take it back.<eos> That thing is useful.<eos> Zatanna, where are you, darling?
Let me...<eos> I take it back.<eos> That thing is useful.<eos> Zatanna, where are you, darling?<eos> I know you can't speak, but give me a wave.
I take it back.<eos> That thing is useful.<eos> Zatanna, where are you, darling?<eos> I know you can't speak, but give me a wave.<eos> You're the only one here that's really a threat.
That thing is useful.<eos> Zatanna, where are you, darling?<eos> I know you can't speak, but give me a wave.<eos> You're the only one here that's really a threat.<eos> There you are.
Really?<eos> It's the TV dinner of spell casting, dear.<eos> Here's what real magic looks like.<eos> Z!<eos> Z, are you daft?
Z, are you daft?<eos> I will kill you, woman!<eos> Z, don't!<eos> Don't kill him.<eos> You can't.
Get control, Z, just like I taught you.<eos> Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.<eos> Deep breaths.<eos> Let it go, love.<eos> Do you see why I can't do what you do?
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.<eos> Deep breaths.<eos> Let it go, love.<eos> Do you see why I can't do what you do?<eos> You lost control is all.
Because Ritchie's bloody well taken control of the House.<eos> This is what you get for having mates.<eos> Boston, can you get inside?<eos> That would be a no.<eos> Ritchie, you're gonna listen to me whether you like it or not.
Now I'm immortal and supercharged!<eos> You've been played for a sap.<eos> The Stone isn't sentient.<eos> What's left of Destiny's soul was whispering sweet nothings in your ear, getting you to commit atrocities to gain power and make his move.<eos> You're just pissed 'cause I won.
I don't know.<eos> The amount of magic she's used, sometimes you don't recover.<eos> I should have never led her back.<eos> Selfish bastard, I am.<eos> You've done what you can for now, but we have to stop Destiny, or everyone's at risk.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> My will be done.<eos> Fool!<eos> How can you hope to defeat a god?
How can you hope to defeat a god?<eos> Not only can I sense you, you cannot defeat my shield.<eos> Since when does God need a force shield?<eos> The Justice League are on their way.<eos> Suppose that couldn't be helped, but make sure they stay well away from Destiny, to not be struck mad, unless you want a bunch of crazed super blokes ripping apart the city.
John, listen to me.<eos> You've been affected by magic.<eos> Get away to space now.<eos> Sorry to have to ask this, Jason.<eos> At least you're asking.
Killjoy.<eos> I've had many years to think about you, Etrigan.<eos> Call this poetic justice.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Looks like you've finally beat the curse, my boy.
Call this poetic justice.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Looks like you've finally beat the curse, my boy.<eos> Wish it were under happier circumstances.<eos> - What are you doing?
The Defender of the Green...<eos> Swamp Thing.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.<eos> Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.
Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.<eos> Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.<eos> The so-called Guardian of the Green who secretly hopes to be human again.<eos> Let me dispel you of that notion.<eos> Back to the dirt... where you belong.
Back to the dirt... where you belong.<eos> He's getting more powerful by the second.<eos> What the hell are we gonna do?<eos> I say we go and talk to a man about a horse.<eos> Did you hit your head or something?
You're babbling.<eos> A Trojan horse, Boston.<eos> Come on!<eos> Over here, you wanker!<eos> You are puny and disrespectful.
Can I beg you to stop talking?<eos> I mean, all wizards are touched, but you, you're a full-blown nutter.<eos> I will tear your soul apart.<eos> And what happened to not prattling with mortals?<eos> You chatter like my grandma at a book club.
And what happened to not prattling with mortals?<eos> You chatter like my grandma at a book club.<eos> Now, Boston!<eos> Trick or treat, freak!<eos> Is that a sword in your chest, or are you just glad to see me?
Now, Boston!<eos> Trick or treat, freak!<eos> Is that a sword in your chest, or are you just glad to see me?<eos> Merlin sends his regards.<eos> And by the way, you lose.
Merlin sends his regards.<eos> And by the way, you lose.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Johnny, I was... I was under a compulsion.<eos> You've got to save me.
And by the way, you lose.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Johnny, I was... I was under a compulsion.<eos> You've got to save me.<eos> You owe me. You owe me!
Help me, you bastard!<eos> Help me!<eos> That was unpleasant.<eos> What the hell did I miss?<eos> Z, you're okay.
A demon from hell, a knight of renown.<eos> Though we were cursed to be slaves to each other,<eos> I know of no man I'd want more for a brother.<eos> Farewell, mortal.<eos> You couldn't have picked a better place.
You couldn't have picked a better place.<eos> The village where he was born was over there.<eos> Too bad it took this to get him home.<eos> Batman asked me to be in the Justice League.<eos> And you're considering it?
Too bad it took this to get him home.<eos> Batman asked me to be in the Justice League.<eos> And you're considering it?<eos> I visited their headquarters a few days ago.<eos> It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.
It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.<eos> Listening to me now?<eos> They want you, too.<eos> Good one, Z. Too right, they do.<eos> You have got to be bloody kidding.
Good one, Z. Too right, they do.<eos> You have got to be bloody kidding.<eos> No way.<eos> Batty would go mental.<eos> He was the one who asked, and I told him that's what you'd say.
He was the one who asked, and I told him that's what you'd say.<eos> Be safe, John.<eos> Now, hold on. Hold on.<eos> Maybe I've been a bit rash.<eos> Could you tell me more over a drink?
No my friend, not you.<eos> It is the duty of society to care for the elderly.<eos> This "Chuck" never cared.<eos> "Chuck".<eos> - Are you "Chuck"?
"Chuck".<eos> - Are you "Chuck"?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I "Chuck", I "Chuck".<eos> Are you the one who will take this man's house?
Who will play in the second arena?<eos> Yeah.<eos> "J52".<eos> If my condition is as bad as it is, They fired at me.<eos> Did you receive one of these messages?
Department of Retirement.<eos> She came in a registered mail.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Have you ever received good news? Need your signature?<eos> Have you contacted anyone in the factory?
They never learn.<eos> I'll go home to arrange my drug.<eos> I see you tomorrow.<eos> It was a fantastic meal tonight.<eos> It is impressive What you can do with frozen fish.
What are we talking about then?<eos> "Fresnos" medical care.<eos> It should be very urgent.<eos> Hello?<eos> Have you got your gift, Grandpa?
Oh my God.<eos> This is the ugliest shirt I have ever seen.<eos> Grand.<eos> Well, let's also see what's here.<eos> You grow up quickly, "Kay".
I was working!<eos> But that does not matter, Your playing gets worse every week.<eos> It is a miracle, I do not know how to do this.<eos> What is the feasibility?<eos> I'm not smart, I do not like playing, You will not become a professional.
Each bimonthly party is held For $ 40 in a bar?<eos> Do not want it.<eos> So I do not like this machine.<eos> No, she does not love you either.<eos> Trust me, I offer you service, You will thank me for this.
- What?<eos> I never told you this, But I saw you play a few times.<eos> At West Village. With Stan Goetz, 1977.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> You saw me play with "Getz"? Three hundred fifty.
At West Village. With Stan Goetz, 1977.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> You saw me play with "Getz"? Three hundred fifty.<eos> Certainly.<eos> What? Did you follow me?
Another day, another excellent estimate.<eos> Well done, my little one.<eos> I almost realized the meaning.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You told me, I quote from your words,
Corn?<eos> I thought it...<eos> I do not know what I thought.<eos> I think I would like to steal a bank.<eos> What did you say?
30 days ahead.<eos> Who will take your home?<eos> A bank.<eos> They will take your house and not tell us?<eos> What will you do?
The dreams of many have been crushed.<eos> And it does not hurt them at all.<eos> We are three elderly men, If we are bankrupt and bankrupt, We will retire with dignity.<eos> At worst, they will catch us, And we get a bed And three meals a day. And health care Better than that we have now.<eos> Are you talking about us?
Lift the headset!<eos> Who died?<eos> No one, it's "Joe".<eos> I do not talk to criminals.<eos> Did you hear that?
What is going on here exactly?<eos> Both lost his mind.<eos> Think about it, "Al".<eos> I do not want to think about anything, I am not a bank robber.<eos> Neither are you, nor are you, "Willie."
Think about it, "Al".<eos> I do not want to think about anything, I am not a bank robber.<eos> Neither are you, nor are you, "Willie."<eos> What?<eos> Why did you answer the phone?
What?<eos> Why did you answer the phone?<eos> Because he was ringing.<eos> Because you're interested.<eos> Have you become my psychiatrist now?
Do not congratulate.<eos> New York...<eos> Two beautiful hats.<eos> We have a business here, "Al."<eos> Well, what do you mean?
Two beautiful hats.<eos> We have a business here, "Al."<eos> Well, what do you mean?<eos> Give me that menu.<eos> What are you doing?
Give me that menu.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Wait here, we'll be right back.<eos> What do you do with my list?<eos> Why did you rip my list?
Well.<eos> This will fit perfectly with.<eos> This is a big bottle.<eos> Yes, listen, I must tell you this.<eos> You are a wonderful woman, But I know what you are doing.
This will fit perfectly with.<eos> This is a big bottle.<eos> Yes, listen, I must tell you this.<eos> You are a wonderful woman, But I know what you are doing.<eos> You are wasting your time, I do not want a relationship with anyone.
Where is my basket in hell?<eos> "Willie", "Willie".<eos> Al disappeared.<eos> I have a new escape car.<eos> Where did you come from?
Do not give yourself greater than its size.<eos> Leading like my grandmother, She was driving a horse and cart.<eos> This is a good joke, so you can go back Walk home.<eos> Do not touch my car.<eos> You will not force us to walk!
I hate him when he is right.<eos> We will need the help of a professional.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Yes, without it We should turn ourselves in now.<eos> Do you know any criminals?
Yes, without it We should turn ourselves in now.<eos> Do you know any criminals?<eos> I know a poor person.<eos> - I do not speak English.<eos> - I know that you are, "Murphy".
Do you know any criminals?<eos> I know a poor person.<eos> - I do not speak English.<eos> - I know that you are, "Murphy".<eos> What are you doing here, Joe?
I know a poor person.<eos> - I do not speak English.<eos> - I know that you are, "Murphy".<eos> What are you doing here, Joe?<eos> I came over the expense of the girl you do not pay.
Like me?<eos> I mean businessmen?<eos> No, but the abject.<eos> Debt evaders.<eos> I trust you can guide us. To the right path.
Here is the fruit of the eggplant.<eos> Welcome.<eos> - Hi Annie.<eos> - Hello!<eos> You work here every day, Do not you have a day off?
I was thinking about preparing a stew of vegetables.<eos> I love slicing them into thin slices With parmesan cheese.<eos> They drink all the juices.<eos> Well, this looks good.<eos> You will not taste anything worse.
They drink all the juices.<eos> Well, this looks good.<eos> You will not taste anything worse.<eos> I'm sure of that, listen.<eos> I think you are nice, and I find you very attractive.
Well, this looks good.<eos> You will not taste anything worse.<eos> I'm sure of that, listen.<eos> I think you are nice, and I find you very attractive.<eos> - You think I'm attractive.
You will not taste anything worse.<eos> I'm sure of that, listen.<eos> I think you are nice, and I find you very attractive.<eos> - You think I'm attractive.<eos> - You are very nice.
I think you are nice, and I find you very attractive.<eos> - You think I'm attractive.<eos> - You are very nice.<eos> I think that's great.<eos> But you're not looking for a relationship, right?
Of the best quality.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Eggs, sausages, fried potatoes, Roasted bread and coffee please.<eos> "Good morning, 'Metzi', Your hair looks nice today."<eos> "Did you cut your hair?" "Yes, O 'Al, ' his story."

"Do you know what I want?" "I do not know 'Al', what?"<eos> "Metzee", you find Babe, And your smell is amazing.<eos> Now bring me some food, Because I am starving.<eos> Well, that's better.<eos> I did not think you would join us today.
I do not know you at all.<eos> How do you know "Jesus" Do you deserve trust?<eos> No, you can trust us.<eos> What speeches?<eos> What do you think of these men?
"Knights of Had."<eos> This food is excellent tonight.<eos> They must have changed recipes.<eos> It's the same nonsense, but you're too.<eos> Do you mind?
He guessed.<eos> Two or three years?<eos> That's it?<eos> Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.
Your weapons exist only in anticipation For the worst scenarios.<eos> You must master the shooting, But the last thing you want Is to shoot one.<eos> Who guards the door?<eos> I will, I will guard the door.<eos> Do you know how to deal with a pistol?
How can he sleep?<eos> He's having sex.<eos> True.<eos> I remember that feeling.<eos> Are you fine?

I get dressed, I ate breakfast at the Nat restaurant.<eos> I go there.<eos> A few times a week at least.<eos> For years, he has been a permanent customer.<eos> Do you meet one of them?

I didn't know you'd served in the army.<eos> I haven't.<eos> How could I?<eos> I've been in the fucking jail for 20 years.<eos> - You not fucking notice?
- Of course, of course.<eos> Diminished responsibility.<eos> If that Cunt in the original trial had put on a proper defense of diminished responsibility, I could've walked out that door a free man.<eos> I think, for you, that the best policy...<eos> The diminished responsibility. Did you mention it?

- Why not?<eos> - Doyle's a gangster.<eos> In the sauna, no man would dare to hurt a woman.<eos> Mr. Doyle won't let that happen.<eos> I don't like to think of you working there, okay?
I don't like to think of you working there, okay?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I fuck men?<eos> How is this better?<eos> I could have been killed and you would have done nothing because you were sitting next door, taking cocaine.
