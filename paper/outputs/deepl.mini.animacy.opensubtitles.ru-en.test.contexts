Ghost catcher. And my coat, too. I almost forgot how beautiful the view is from up here. I see you found your coat. You promised you'd keep it for me.
In other words, he bought a new car. The world hasn't stood still since your death, Cage. Onboard drones, air defense countermeasures... and fuel tanks that let you fly around the world three times without refueling. You can turn in your fur coat. You have my word, no one will steal it.
Serena deceived us. Betrayed us. Serena's not that important. This is a war. And either we stop it today, or tomorrow the world burns to the ground.
That's what this table is. I told Francie Millner a story with no end when she was five. Taught her to sing a dozen rock 'n' roll songs. Gave her her favorite toy in the world. A golden bird, she loved it, and I'm sure she still has it.
Do you still have that golden bird? Oh, Nanny Joe. You don't even remember what it is? Of course I do. I don't know why I should be ashamed of it, but I lost it almost as soon as you gave it to me.
Where'd they go? You're going the wrong way. I don't know where we're going! Was there a shortcut? We didn't see it.
As much as I know about laptops, I don't know anything about computers. Dave had access to Leeds' server. To her network. Yeah, the network. We take the thumb drive and plug it in.
But one man didn't give up. - Who? - Chen. If anything happens to him, his property goes to the city. And who would they sell it to?
You and I have more in common than you think. Not only do we share blood, but we have similar interests. - We both have a penchant for power. - I have no power. Or a hunger for it.
Ready! Ignore that idiot. You're going to have a great time. Can I borrow your camera? Yeah, but, uh. If you drop it, you'll have to dive for it.
- Lisa, calm down! Stop it. - No, I can't. - I can't. - I can't. Please. I'm gonna take a deep breath, take it off, swim out, and you hand it back to me, okay?
Stop it. - No, I can't. - I can't. - I can't. Please. I'm gonna take a deep breath, take it off, swim out, and you hand it back to me, okay? What if you can't put it back on?
Please respond! Lisa, open the cage! Open the cage! It was a shark! I can't open it!
You see? We're replaceable. They fired Irv. This school wants to fuck me? I'm gonna fuck her!
No. No way. It's not like you're-- We love each other. I just regurgitated a pasta and ate it.
You see! I was right. No. I've seen this before. We need to find something to replace it with.
Spit it out! Come on! Disgusting! The beast's hide is too thick to pierce from the outside. I must tear it from the inside.
Wow! But I wanted more. I longed for meaning. "There must be other life out there in the vastness of the universe besides me," I thought. And then I set out to find it.
We're eternal. Can't eternity get boring? Not if you have a purpose, Peter. And that's why you're here. I told you how, years ago, I felt an irresistible urge to search for life. What I didn't tell you is that when I finally found it, I was sorely disappointed.
Sleep! I didn't think she'd make it. She looks so weak and puny. I don't know how long I can hold it. The layer of metal is too thick. For the bomb to work, it has to be placed on the core of the Ego.
Okay, but don't be a drag today. We're doing something out of the ordinary, and you could ruin it. Am I that big of a problem? You have a nice smile. Use it.
I don't need to know why. Ward's management has led Rand to success time and time again, and.... Why do you ask? When I got to the monastery after the disaster, I learned of an important position. A powerful, important job, and I wanted it.
I never really thought about what it meant for my life. - Did you get the job? - Yeah. I fought hard. I earned it.
What makes you so sure? It's not certainty. Doubt leads to death. Tell me the legend again. Why are you so eager to hear it again?
No, I can't wait till the doctor comes in the morning. Okay, well, thanks for not helping. Oh, my God. Aah, my arm. I pinched it.
Rand has a lab, right? Yeah, so? Sodium Pentothal. Truth serum. If you can get it, we can dope Gao.
That's what Iron Fist is. Why are you so interested in Iron Fist? I've spent my entire life in various dojos and monasteries, training with masters of all stripes, listening to their stories and legends about Immortal Weapons. I thought they were children's stories until I was given this tape. When I watched it, I became obsessed with learning everything I could about the Iron Fist.
Pretend they don't exist. The gun has no feelings. Danny should have been back by now. His chi may be more damaged than we thought. But Master Lei Kun will be able to restore it when we return to K'un-L'un.
But your ability to get through it and become stronger is a hundred times more significant than putting a smile on your face and pretending everything is fine. Do you understand? Look. No one can give you your life back, Aaron. You have to-- You can get it back.
Little mistakes. Personal relationships. That's what they'll use to finish you off. What happened to your hand? I cut it off to free myself.
Hundreds of years ago. Thousands. It doesn't matter. But, long ago, the Kun-Lun elders gathered to learn how to curb their Qi. The very energy of life. They wanted to use it for healing.
Before I went on pilgrimage to Kun-Lun. Before I knew what I was. And before she led the organization. She was smart, she was kind. And death took her from me before I knew how to defeat her.
- Don't worry. He didn't go as Matt. You gave him a suit? I wasn't trying to open the door for him. I was giving him a chance to slam it.
What's going on? Claire! Shit. You're wasting your energy. Save it for a bigger fight.
I know your limits. You can't do me irreparable harm. Especially since the Iron Fist has already given us the original gift. Life without end. I'm giving you one last chance to experience it with me.
No. That's because you still feel it. Based on your talk of embracing the darkness, I don't think you want to be alone in this. - I've seen death. - And you're afraid of it.
I still have nightmares. And I'm an adult. What did she say to you? No, no, no, no, no. That crow was wounded, and all I did was put it out of its misery. And I tested the limits of a crow's neck strength.
Is that me? I'll tell you what to do with cats. Who took this? Dennis? This is what you do with cats. One time in a Vietnamese sweatshop, we found a cat and threw it right into the soup.
All right. - Try to get some rest. - Okay. [Cell phone rings] Look, you have a panic button. Don't be afraid to use it.
Mary, I know you like math. That's why you'll find a sold-out edition of Charles Zimmer's "Movements in Higher Algebra." Yeah. It's a great book. Have you read it?
It also says Mary Eileen Adler. Same name as your daughter. Born on the same day. There's a photograph. In your defense, you wouldn't have recognized her.
- No. Then what did she do all the time? She loved math. Passionately. She preferred it to everything else.
A year ago, a tragic event occurred. Many lives were lost unjustly, inexplicably and unexpectedly. But today, the souls of those we lost are in another world, looking at us. And they see that on days like today we remember them and honor them. And to keep this memory alive, to root it within us, and in this very place, today we unveil this monument, this memorial to all the victims.
I said I'd give it a try. Yeah, only that was six years ago. Well, it took me a while to get used to the idea. I wanted to congratulate you on winning the game. We never finished it.
The entire province is only 4% of the country's population. It doesn't make strategic sense. I would back away from that idea. The problem with guerrilla warfare is that it's pointless. We tried it in Vietnam.
His mother conjured him. To fill the void she felt after the Wild Hunt in Canaan. Mom. What if sheriff stilinski feels a void? And he's filling it with Claudia?
- No! Oh, no! It's okay, it's okay. Where is he? If this is all your magic, you'd better try it on me, because I know no mercy.
How...do you know how it works? I built this machine. - You did? Yeah. To get back to your house, but the Wizard took it away.
- In what way? - Underhill Plantation. The largest and richest property on the island. Over two hundred slaves live on it. It's well defended. I couldn't take it on my own.
No, no, no, no, ...... I'm a grown man. That's not gonna work. You broke my cigarette. Did I? You threw it away.
You were chosen because of the physical excellence you have enjoyed all your life. With your innate gift and our determination, we can be a part of something greater. Something perfect. The coagulation procedure is a man-made miracle. We, in turn, have been creating it for years. And not so recently, it's been perfected. with the help of my own flesh and blood.
I had to wonder about that. At first I thought he was doing what the Norwegians do. But then I noticed the way he sorts his cards. The first card he shifts indicates the suit. If he slides it all the way to the left, it's spades.
It was at our intersection. The accident happened at the same intersection. I said I didn't want to discuss it. I thought you called the police about the sign. We don't know that he called it.
I'll be back. No, no, stay. You can help me. Do you know how to open a keg? Cause all the guys are like, "let's get a keg," and then when you have to open it.
So, are we gonna have dinner or-- That's a great idea. Bring a beer. If you're hungry, honey, I'll give you a 20, you can go get a pizza. We can have it delivered here.
What the fuck happened to your face? I'll show you. Can't this wait till after school? Make a copy of this tape. I'll pick it up after class.
We all let her go. She walked out of school. went home. finished some chores. She returned her uniform to Crestmont, where we worked together. She didn't say anything. She threw it on the register and left.
Yes, master. Yes, boy! Get down! The mortal has a gift. When I eat her whole, I will absorb the power and use it as I wish.
Jared, come on, get up! Let's get out of here. Can I-- Can I have my cane back, please? Someone gave it to me.
- No. May I, then? If you don't mind, can I walk you to the cabin? No! We have a meeting tonight, but I can skip it.
There's a future in it. You're right. I know how it ends. Let's go. We'll risk your ass for someone else. I'll rip it to shreds for a friend.
We want his support. - I strongly advise against you and the governor leaving us at a time like this. - We are so close to winning this war and pulling Nassau out of the darkness. But we cannot win alone. We need help, and there is no other way to get it.
- I strongly advise against you and the governor leaving us at a time like this. - We are so close to winning this war and pulling Nassau out of the darkness. But we cannot win alone. We need help, and there is no other way to get it. - We both know that there are people in both camps who are so deeply involved in this war that they are more afraid of ending it than they are of losing it.
And Flint? It seems like the war is over, but until they're caught, it's far from over. And if we win in Nassau, what happens to our former friends who were so close to the governor? I offer you the opportunity to return our friendship. Or to put it more accurately, to buy it.
Am I in a book? Yes. Is it about my life? Yes. Just give it to me.
Get the book. Where's the fucking book, Michael? No, no, no! He's not ready. - He's gonna destroy it.
I have a meeting with the director this afternoon, and everyone will want to know how that asshole we locked up got out. And what are you gonna tell them? Everything, including how you used that tape between me and my C.I. to free your terrorist. Which is why I need to know, uh. that tape. How did you get it?
Fucking open the door! ...from the dozens of arrests made in connection with the attempted plot and assassination of the President earlier this month. What the fuck? According to David Wellington, the President's chief of staff, these arrests include officials from all branches of government, including the Department of Defense, the State Department, and the Central Intelligence Agency. Today, the President sent a clear message to the people of America that our democracy is strong and resilient, and that we will do whatever it takes to protect it.
I just came by to pay my respects. He and Michael were friends. John, I read your book. You did? Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom, I picked it up, and 20 minutes flew by in a flash.
You did? Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom, I took it, and twenty minutes flew by in a flash. It's incredible. Have a good day. I didn't leave it in the bathroom.
I'm afraid Jeannie's gonna have to wait for you because you're on duty. Yes, Warden. Yeah. Okay. My car is covered in kangaroo brains, so wash it.
I'm sorry to hear that, Kevin. I'm really glad you called. Can you send me a photocopy of the book? Я... gave you the original. - I threw it away.
I got it. You took your book. It's not mine, it's Matt's. But it's about you. Are you finally gonna read it?
You want to be a Jesus superstar because you're important then. You like it? I love it! It's awesome! I read it cover to cover!
And we're very grateful for that, Lori. Very grateful? - Yes. But with all due respect, I don't think you understand what's going on here. Look, three years ago, my ex-husband was having delusions and trying to kill himself. Instead of recognizing his illness, you turned it into scripture.
Said he was upset. About what exactly? Cause I don't think we know the whole story. No, the whole story, Matt, is your stupid book that you somehow convinced my husband and son-in-law not to show me. They didn't show it to you because they knew you'd react that way.
I think, uh. I'll lie down over there. It's a distraction. We need to focus on Kevin. Where's my book? I threw it overboard.
It was a terrible mistake, and I will take full responsibility for what I've done. I don't think she understands. I do. You want to drown Kevin so he can go to the dead. And there, one of the dead will teach him a song, he'll come back to you with a song so you can sing it and stop tomorrow's biblical flood.
For your own sake. A terribly self-destructive habit. That's why it's so cool. My lighter? Can you give it back, please?
Can you bring her back, please? I thought you said you dumped her. Yeah. Then you don't need her. Give her back, please.
The ones you lost, like my mom and sister? I don't know, Ben. Maybe you'll get to say what you want to say when they're around. - Or maybe this is the only life you have. And maybe you shouldn't waste it.
It's an androgen enhancer. And it inhibits entactogens. Exactly. It's the antipode of dimethyltryptamine. It blocks the empathic synaptic connection, not stimulates it.
Yeah, and they miss you, too! I miss them. I miss you. I miss my life. And I'm trying to get it back.
That's why two million dollars worth of these babies are sold every year. Because they give you the confidence that when the time comes, you can take on the challenge. Some of you do. There's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. But if I threw this can in the audience right now, no one would take it.
Even pathetic profits, outflows of investor money, and the rise of quant funds lit our way to the other side of the world, we still refused to change. In the vast expanse of time, we've been dead for a long time. I know this, even if you haven't realized it yet. But in this microsecond, while we're still breathing, I'm going to fight inevitability. If you have a card in front of you, pick it up and hold it up to your face.
- I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. - Everyone has memory lapses. No, the combination is made up of the girls' birthdays. I remember exactly how we came up with it.
You guys do the daily cleaning, right? Normally, yes, but we're short-staffed this month. How many people have been in stall two since Ms. Palfrey's death? None. We closed it out of respect.
In confidence. Did he say it was off the record? I didn't have to, but that's not the point. It's about what you could only find out from my notebook. Are you accusing Ms. Knight of stealing it?
Their last name was King. And how did you come from that to Castle? His writing's on the wall. Rook beats knight. Rook is the correct name for a chess piece, only many people call it a tourney.
Hodgins, slow down. Talk to me. I can see you're upset. I'm telling you, if I could get down to the basement, that needle wouldn't be evidence. I'd stick it in his neck so it would pierce every organ in its path.
I'm wondering if this has anything to do with Mayor Richards applying for a permit to build a hotel on this very beach. And what does that have to do with Stephen Langham? Maybe you haven't noticed, Officer Myers, but this beach is at the base of a volcano. And this land was previously designated as an observation post for scientific purposes. Until Richards bought it?
Did you tell her it was your business? No. No, I didn't. She must have thought so because of my natural grasp of aura and knowledge. You can take your aura and shove it right up your--
- I called you yesterday. - I was busy. What happened? - The game board. When did we decide to move it to my house?
Well. there's no "D" in that word, but whatever. I hear you. Are you sure it's legal? It's been reposted almost 500 times in the last half hour. What if Claudia Greco's already reading it?
What is it? It's you. You're telling me that you and the girls fell for this-- The game came in a couple days ago, after school for the blind. We hid it in Spencer's barn.
You're welcome. You're standing on quicksand. The more you resist, the faster it will drag you down. I'm offering you a rope. Take it.
Because there's a second book. It was done much later. It was about turning revenge into a game. A game? I came back here today because I didn't want whoever sent that note to get it.
Ali's baby. No, no. No one's gonna tell Ali about this. Did you see this book with your own eyes? Yeah, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.
No one's gonna tell Ali about this. Did you see this book with your own eyes? Yeah, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it. Where is it now? They put it back.
And I realized you were the one who shredded it. When the cops left, I took the canister out of the shredder and threw it in the dumpster, just in case. How'd you know? One night when you were asleep, I, uh. found her.
It's just that girls are easy prey. Please look me in the eye and tell me Hanna's not in trouble. No... she's not in trouble. Sheila, that swing has been in that tree since we bought the house. I have no idea how to take it down.
Well, think again. Because we're gonna walk out of here and we're gonna go to the police. You're gonna tell them how you made everyone's lives a living hell. But first, we're gonna take the game so they can see your handiwork. I don't have it anymore.
Because we're gonna walk out of here and we're gonna go to the police. You're gonna tell them how you made everyone's lives a living hell. But first, we're gonna take the game so they can see your handiwork. I don't have it anymore. Somebody stole it from me, somebody keeps taking it.
We at Fillmore-Graves are not going to rest in peace. - (liv) So what are you planning? - (vivian) For starters, we're heavily armed and trained. And we're the proud owners of the Superfly formula. No one else can have it.
Was she anorexic? She was 14 years old, that's the last time I saw her happy. How many of these did you take? One Sunday, I took her out to play with the old car one Sunday to give her a fake ride.
I don't buy that peace and harmony bullshit. You want to get out of here? I do. But first I have to learn how to control my power. And I like that you don't have to keep it a secret around here.
It belonged to Grammy Davenport. It should be signed by her. She read it to her students the year the Titanic sank. Damn it. My mom read it to me. I read it to you.
As much as I'd love to do it, that ship has sailed. We'll never get them back, no matter what. I'm afraid we can't take a detour. Chuck, if the tape is useless within the law, and won't help change public opinion, what's the point? Because I can't imagine how we could use it.
I got an internship. What kind of internship? Working with illegal immigrants? Oh, yeah. You got it?
There is, of course. Mountains of evidence. And it all points to Annalise Keating. Atwood's lying. They have evidence against Frank, and if I find it, I'll get Annalise released.
That doesn't mean it includes wes' murder. - Are you sure? Yes! I'll have proof soon. Oliver made a copy of the data and he's running it now.
If you don't believe me, I don't care. Why did you go to New York yesterday? Are you following me now? I didn't say that. I went to interview with Anthony and Levin to salvage what was left of my career after Annalise ruined it.
What are the options? Going to court is expensive. And very damaging to HCM's reputation. I don't suppose any of us want that. The firm could decide to buy me off by paying me a sum that would almost certainly bankrupt it.
Get some coffee, boys. It's no good sleeping on duty. Did you take care of that battery? Yeah. It did die, but we replaced it a couple hours ago.
They control their urges. You think of Lucian Graymark, mages like Magnus Bane, and even Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon? No matter how good they try to be, the inhabitants of the Lower World will never be able to control their demon blood. If that blood is so horrible, why did you add it to mine?
Like "Blame the Stars," only in life. That's a totally inappropriate twist to this book. - Is it? - No. I've never read it.
Let's go. You know if you touch the Sword, the whole Underworld will end, Simon too. No, Valentine needs a power source. He needs lightning. He's got it.
I don't know. I just had an old piece of wood. I thought it would be a cool prop. - Where is it? - I gave it to the prop guy, George.
And I was very proud. My son honored that commitment. He sacrificed his life. So by wearing this uniform, I honor his memory, just as you honor the memory of all officers who have died in the line of duty. Wear it with pride.
Did you come here to tell me that, or are you just wasting time? I'll see you around. Oh, the pain. Fascinating, isn't it? Some people will do anything to avoid it.
I'll see you around. Oh, the pain. Fascinating, isn't it? Some will do anything to avoid it. Others will embrace it, even relish it, like you.
I hope she's doing what I think she's doing. So do I. What do you know about the wand that healed me? No more than they told you. Does he always wear it?
Me, too. What do you know about the wand that healed me? No more than they told you. Does he always carry it? No. He took it out to help you.
No more than they told you. Does he always carry it? No. He took it out to help you. Pulled it out from where? He kept it in his hiding place, wrapped in a cloth.
No. He pulled it out to help you. Pulled it from where? He kept it in his hiding place, wrapped in a cloth. I forgot I had it. Nick left it on the bed when he got the wand to heal you.
I don't want to drag you into this any more than you already are. I don't like it, but okay. We're still searching Laurelhurst, but so far, nothing. We've already combed a few blocks from the car we found. He left it there on purpose.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there. the same ones on the fabric. Maybe there's more, we just can't see it. Do you still have the wand? Yeah. I'm not sure you should carry it around with you all the time.
MILLER: We need those scientists alive! Nothing can happen to him! The protomolecule didn't get here by accident. If we master it, we can use it.
Crowe's woods. Well, you might as well bring me some mushrooms, then! You know there's 100 acres of woods here. We've got about as much chance of finding Winnie the Pooh. And even if she had a bag, maybe the killer stole it.
- That's true. Speaking of President Laura Montez, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in Tibet, right? That's unprecedented. What do you make of her speech? I didn't get a chance to watch it because I....
I know. But that doesn't mean she doesn't exist. No, it doesn't. I knew where that line was today, Alfred. I didn't cross it.
You must be the first person in history to kill to find a life growth coach. Maybe you should give up riddles. No. A good riddle reveals who's asking it. To solve it is to unravel the mystery of the one who poses it.
Ballistics report came back. No matches. But the wound had microscopic cuts made postmortem. So what does that mean? Someone removed the bullet that killed your uncle and replaced it with another.
When I find out what you did, I'll make sure you pay for it. And enjoy it. Jim, hey! Where's the riddle? Lucius and I have been trying to solve it, but maybe you'll have better luck.
Due to circumstances completely beyond our control, the owl was trashed. But we can try to recover the owl you stole, then maybe we can find Bruce and the bomb. You kept the pieces? Are you kidding me? After everything I went through to get it. Of course I did.
Okay. There she is. Is that an owl? What the hell happened to it? Jerome Valeska smashed it to pieces when he broke into the estate, didn't he?
There she is. Is that an owl? What the hell happened to it? Jerome Valeska smashed it to pieces when he broke into the estate, didn't he? Can you rebuild it?
No, the reason she left so quickly was because she was unhappy that I wasn't having sex with her. Yeah, I don't believe you. No one would say no to a girl like that. I don't understand myself, believe me. But, uh, speaking of your package, Burt. I don't have it.
- Gather your men. He needs to be taken out. - It's a beautiful song. It's mesmerizing. - Yeah. I wrote it for her.
And heck, why don't we learn a thing or two from Barry and Michelle? I want to see the world with you, Cookie. I want to write a new page in our history so it's free of slander and drama. - You created that drama by bringing your sons together. - Yes, I did. But together we can destroy it.
I won't let any of you die. I will not let you sacrifice yourselves. You mean too much to me and to the universe. Yes, you made a deal. A stupid deal, and I broke it.
My name is... my name. My name is... My name is... Gideon Lochlin's address is in the accountant's file. If the book is there, I'll find it.
I don't think we've ever seen anything like this before. Shall we sing about it? Hello, Monty. Tough oak barrier! They've broken through!
"used by so many writers that it has become a cliché," although the phrase "meanwhile at the ranch" is used to connect what is happening in one part of the story to another part of the story, and has nothing to do with cows or greasy salad dressing. When I say "meanwhile at the ranch," I mean mean meanwhile in the Snake Room the adults were having an adult conversation. If we make a path out of peaches leading to the cage, maybe the snake will crawl up it and we can lock it in the cage.
Really. Remember that PEM. Slow down. Polymer electrolytic membrane. You bought it for me online.
I had to go all the way to the-- Listen when I'm talking! I'm listening. I found him at my sister's house. He came at me with a hockey stick, and I saw this bat, and I grabbed it.
I figured out the odds. The stick is much longer than the bat. And here's where it gets interesting. You know what I did? I threw it to him.
Given your community ties, I have no objection to your release on bail, which I set at $2,500. I screwed up. Chuck's got me fooled again. This tape? He made sure Ernie heard it, didn't he?
I screwed up. Chuck's got me fooled again. That tape? He made sure Ernie heard it, didn't he? Because he knew that Ernie would freakin' tell me about it, and I'd show up to try to destroy it or steal it or whatever.
No, it's nothing like that. He pushed me back into the office. Did he have a weapon? As I mentioned, he used a poker to break into my desk. But he would never use it on me.
- Yeah, that's right. You know what I'm doing in there? Take a guess. Crisis management. I've been meeting with clients three times a day for the last two weeks. Trying to restore the firm's reputation after you and Jimmy dragged it through the mud.
If I had a soccer game, would you let me go? Yes, because you love soccer. You respect it. But my music, from the moment I told you about it, you don't care. You don't take it seriously.
In that case, Mom, I'm sorry, but no. Whatever you want to explain what's going on between you and Archie's dad, I don't want to get involved. When you play it, it sounds perfect. We wrote a good song, Archie. I can't wait to sing it with you in public.
Are you in? Dad, I have a legendary bike, and now you're giving me a car! I'm in! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You can fix it up and take Charlie out to dinner.
I need to get a book. There's only one book you should read. All the smart young people are crazy about it. Я... I've already read it twice.
I've been bugging him a lot. Yeah, that's what I thought. However, there's no way you could have left a fingerprint in one place. Under the stamp. We had to peel it off very carefully, but there was a small area on the stamp where the glue hadn't quite set.
Is there anything else I can do for you before I go? I want to get rid of the stroller. Kevin's not a baby anymore. I only used it to keep him warm for the next one. Now I need someone to take it away.
No one knows where the soul is. Maybe it lives in the heart? In the brain? What part of our body is it hiding in? What surrounds the soul, and how can we protect it?
Since when does my mother hang out with your stepfather? Something's wrong. I declare open the meeting of the shadow wedding lodge. As you know, it is our sacred duty to secretly oversee every aspect of this wedding. Together, we will transform it from a youth party into a normal, traditional wedding. Normal and respectful.
Near Ramadi. Special Forces. How did you know? Meadows had a tattoo. You recognized it.
You have to accept yourself. Have fun with Holden version 2.0. But first, turn on the damn lamp. (sighs) Okay. - Well, at least I turned it on.
Look, I just need a new card. Is that really necessary? I said wait. Sorry, I lost my wallet. Buy a boat. Buy it and we'll go on a trip.
Our mothers communicated less and less as time went on. But there was one night I'll never forget. Your mom called my mom the night you were born. They talked for a while, and when my mom hung up, she was so happy. She pulled out some cupcake that was a hundred years old, then she looked for candles, but she couldn't find any, so she took a match and stuck it in the cupcake.

- Thank you. - Do you mind? - Uh, sure. To be honest, I'm a little confused. Why are we here? Dr. Barrett's interested in the farm. He wants to buy it?
But he will. And then what? Then we take her. Cortázar will help us understand her. And the nightmare will begin again. If the protomolecule is in the Belt, it can't be used against us.
Jacob's asleep. Let's go. Fuck. You want to see what Audrey and your sisters did to my car? They scratched it up.
Otherwise it would have been a lot worse. Roger that. It's your C-4, Lieutenant. We believe that this large flower vase that was next to your father's grave was the bomb's target. And your ex-husband planted it in the cemetery.
- Ex-wife, sir, is a technicality. And Ortiz left the bomb at her father's house. - Maybe to detonate it-- There was blood on the bomb that couldn't have come from a gunshot wound. Why leave a bomb to kill his wife and then frame it so we can take it into evidence?
Doesn't look like the work of a trained Marine. Too small for a guy Ortiz's size. - Very petty. But didn't Ortiz's lawyer have all this information? I'm sure his public defender never got it.
- Red. - Red. So make her that way. Change it. Turn the wall red, Mary. Just make it red.
You stole my chopper. - You didn't use it. It needed a cartridge. - Which I bought. After you stole it!
We don't need her bullshit, Hap. She's cute in a suit. She stole your car, remember? No. She sold it to a salvage yard.
Seems like a strange coincidence. You think I wanted to turn in my son? I don't know what to think. Something strange was going on in your department, and I need to know what it was before I hand you a badge and a gun. When Phyllis died, I knew we had a leak, but it wasn't my job to find it.
I'm interested in his partner who escaped. Let's not make a big deal out of this. We cover the crash zone, tell a convincing story, and in a week, no one on my block will even remember it. According to recent intelligence reports, there's a growing resistance movement outside the colony. What if this was an attempt to find the missing gauntlet and get it off the block?
Word on the street is that I'm a bit of a snorer, so if I start to encumber, push me. Are you expecting someone? I'm looking at the stars. Have you thought that if the Lord God is missing, maybe He had a reason? Yes, and I want to find out.
We saved your life. So we're even. I know we've had our differences. But if you find a protomolecule on Ganymede-- We're certainly not bringing it back to you.
I don't remember. Something to do with Brahm, perhaps a spring flowing through the valley. Then why did he have a tarot card in his pocket? I laid out the cards for him. And he took it.
Nick, maybe she's right. Maybe she's right. - Listen to me. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the wand. So it's up to me to decide whether or not to use it.
Maybe, uh. - Listen to me. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the wand. So it's up to me to decide whether or not to use it. Well, it's safe here, so there's no harm in putting it away for a while. if you can.
Grab your stuff, let's get out of here. These are the signs I saw on a dead man's face in hell. Or wherever he was trying to drag me off to. Only Diana can see the rest. The crusaders made these marks on the cloth, or the designs were already there when they were found. I don't know if the cloth had a wand on it when they found it. But the spectral analysis didn't show anything.
But it's like. you're used to carrying your gun, and then suddenly it's gone and you feel like you've lost a piece of yourself. - I know, but we have a license for guns. I'm trying to stop thinking about her, but I'm not doing a very good job. Where is she? Got her back in the tunnel.
- I know, but we have a gun license. I'm trying to stop thinking about her, but I'm not doing a very good job. Where is she? Put her back in the tunnel. Don't you think we should bury it somewhere deeper?
- What's going on? - Now. Dan Wells, Portland P.D.! Open the door. Dan, if you don't open the door, we're gonna break it down.
Spit it out. Dr. Deirdre Hampton, professor of biochemistry and regenerative medicine, was working in the lab last night when something went wrong. It went wrong right here. Looks like nothing was taken. Her bag by the door, must have dropped it there. It's locked.
Skull. - That's it. So that's what this is all about. Maybe the blood on the mirror kept something worse from happening. Probably best not to wipe it off, then.
She said they're dangerous. Nick! What was that? At the spice shop, a hand came out of the mirror? First I saw it, then I felt it.
We brewed a special ointment. "Reptilian humanoids: pathology, diagnoses, treatment." Here! "Vle di Bouyi." It smells disgusting, and it's only bad for creatures with scales. Grimms in the south used it to lure scaly creatures out of the swamps and cut their heads off.
Can you tell me more about blood magic? One of your mother's books says that blood is associated with passing to the next world, as with warriors on the battlefield, or a hunter's prey in agony... human sacrifice on an altar.... and sometimes blood is currency. - What if blood could serve as payment for passage to another world? Blood magic is very dangerous. All we have to do is use it to cross over to another world.
We need to find out what the hell is going on on the other side. There's only one way. What's that? We go there. We need to find that thing and kill it.
He didn't kill just me, or he couldn't..... I don't know. Bullets don't take him. I still have the wand. That's probably why I'm still alive. I tried to use it on Wu and Hank. but it didn't work.
- No way. - He spared you again? Must be the wand. There's no other explanation. I tried to use it on her.
What the hell is going on? Take it. No, Nick! You can't give it to that lying satanic brat. If he wants the wand so badly, why doesn't he just take it?
Take it. No, Nick! You can't give it to that lying satanic brat. If he wants the wand so badly, why doesn't he just take it? Why is he asking for it when he can just take it from you?
What's he not telling you? You can ask your kids what to do. Nick, you can't give her to him. I want my loved ones back. - Take her!
She felt it, too. We're all descendants of the first Grimm. The wand you found. The one our Grimm ancestors buried is part of a much more powerful force. Keep it safe.
I went out to get a terrycloth robe, there were a bunch of people there, I asked them where to find the store, before I knew it they were putting green stuff on my finger and some old lady who smelled like cumin started hugging me. - Mine smelled like paprika. - Jesus! I can't have anyone noticing this. I can't lose this job, Gary, but I can't keep it either.
I'm sorry, I can get anyone. No, you're a genius. Talia, you've become close with Gina Porter. Does she like music? Yeah, she loves it.
But I yelled at him, too. It's just like that all the time, you know? He'll do something, then I'll do something back, and so on. That kind of friendship? I don't even know how to describe it.
- You're back. - And you're lucky, because now I know what you do and why you do it. I don't think you've found much, Mr. Specter. Judge for yourself. VelocityData stole your technology and marketed it, so you want to buy their company and take it back.
- Maybe. It's got a rental QR code on it. It's probably got tracking software, right? That's what I was getting at. Track it down and find it fast.
Those who have had their legs broken. Abigail would like to remind you that money can't fill the Source. And without it, Fillory will disappear. Okay, we've been over this. When someone lays a maggot in a public pool, they send a guy with a net to catch it.
How did this happen? I have an idea... how to help you. Some kind of loophole? And, oddly enough, you're gonna leave me here to find it.
I shouldn't have told your mom we were trying to have a baby. (sighs) I'm sorry. It's okay. CSU found encrypted correspondence on Todd Curry's computer. Something neither Curry nor his contact wanted to show. They're trying to crack it.
I'm looking for April. She's on a break. But I can answer any question. My wife had a necklace, a gift from her mother. И... she never took it off, but the clasp broke in the accident.
И... she never took it off, but the clasp broke in the accident. And I know she'd want it on her. I understand that. It could be in her hands during surgery. I'll make sure April puts it down.
There's a new therapy called stimulation, but I'd recommend you go with the traditional methods first. Stimulation? Transcranial magnetic stimulation. So far, it's only been approved for depression, but there's interesting evidence that it can help people with spectrum disorder. And I only mention it because our hospital has it.
- Just in case. Hey, Sarah, you got a minute? I hear most psychologists are in therapy. (Chuckles) Have you been in therapy?
You rely on them too much. Man is the ultimate machine. And I'm an extraordinary man. I'm told you refuse to talk. and that you welcome pain. I love pain, too. And I like to make others feel it using the old ways.
- Now! Okay. - That's a lot of blood. - Did you cut the radial artery? I was very careful not to nick it.
Sir, photographic plates have been switched, transportation is ready. There's no way HYDRA can track the bus. Quick work. What about the SAT radio? I noticed the bus has a communication system, so I decrypted it and synchronized it with this.
- We have to be ready for anything. - On my command. I was so sure. I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing. No, she's building it here, just not in this world.
I want Darkhold. - What? No! No one else is gonna read the damn book. I don't want to read it.
- What? No! No one else is gonna read the damn book. I don't want to read it. I want to use it as bait.
To4ka Translate Did you sleep here? I'm getting used to the new office. You think a bike rack will look good on this wall? You hang a bike rack here, and your first free case will be defending itself after I shove it up your ass.
- Thank you, Katrina. You're welcome. I won't interrupt. All I'm saying is, I feel like you're in a hurry. I mean, when you overthrow a dictator, you don't leave his statue in the square. You tear it the hell down.
We hurried. We were deceived. You were right, William. He found someone who looked like him, and he killed him. So he took the bullet out of his shoulder and put it in the body.
Jeff! We gotta go. Where's your car? What, you didn't bring your car? Yes, Matthews, the valet will be right with it.
Where's your car? What, you didn't come in your car? Yes, Matthews, the valet will be right with it. No, I didn't bring my car. You and Lara Croft drove it out the front gate.
On the beach. Far away. Can't you hear it? Listen! Is that the maximum volume the cousin can get? Can't he turn it up?
You would literally be left with nothing - no house, no cool motorcycle. You had to think fast. You knew where Nadine's car was. You also knew she kept a gun in the car. And after the murder, you put the gun and Julie's bloody scarf in Nadine's car, then pushed it into the sea.
- Be nice, Susie. I don't know his name. White, dark hair, bad leg. Oh, yeah. He broke it.
So... In this little book, we have a list of your clients. Now, Todd 13 had a pretty big shipment. You supplied him with various drugs the day Julie Anne died. I've never seen this little book before. One of your cops must have planted it.
- That sounds amazing! So, kids, can I leave you alone for a couple hours? He wants to have an egg sandwich with me. -I met a man, a gentleman, at the city market and at the zoo. He has a hard life, and we'll discuss it over an egg sandwich.
That should get my former team's attention, and when they come back to rescue him, I'll be waiting for them with open arms. Not too open arms, I hope. No, don't worry, Mr. Thawne. I have no lingering attachments. In that case, kill them all, take their part of the Spear of Destiny and bring it to me.
Wynn's device worked. But Supergirl's still in there. We're running out of time, Agent Danvers. The positronic cannon is ready to fire. You need to use it.
Do you hear that music? Is it playing here? Oh, my God. Thank you. But I can still hear it.
My brain is overloaded. Why a phone booth? - I already told you. I know it's a disguise. But why leave it like that?
I know it's a disguise. But why leave it like that? Why do you like it? Who says I like it? It's not like you changed it.
Hence, if light is only a wave, then.... Space isn't empty? Exactly. And like sound waves, light waves must travel through a medium in space. Scientists call it ether, an invisible but all-encompassing substance that permeates the universe.
- How do you know? - From the governor of the Central Bank. - Really? - Nigeria's oil industry is weaker than officially reported. It could be blown away by the wind.
A couple of times, I did a guy a favor. He comes in here. with an envelope or something, and I hide it in the church, and I call the other guy and let him know it's there. Go on. About two weeks ago, I was supposed to leave an envelope, uh. with a letter to a POW camp. Call him. let him know you got another package for him, he's supposed to pick it up today.
The last two semesters. I rewrote them for you. Keep them. Hopefully. They'll help me undo what I've done. И... If you want my help, I'll be happy to give it to you.
What if instead of gassing up, we studied a cup of coffee? You really need to get some sleep, Albert. Jacob Vant-Goff's 1901 paper. Particles in solution behave like a gas. When sugar dissolves in coffee, the water surrounds the glucose and pulls it out of the sugar crystal, right?
Unless... It's not Maxwell that's been defeated, it's Newton. What are you talking about? Time is not absolute. Jesus Christ. I'll write the article, Michele, please ignore it.
So you're saying he might have gotten on someone's nerves. I'm not sure, but, uh. I just wasn't listening. I was supposed to calm him down, and I indulged him. Okay, every article he worked on, printed or not, you need a copy.
God, I don't think I'd want that. I mean, there's another part of me, you know. What, the vampire part? The undying part. If you could have it, would you want it?
Consider it done, sir. - Call off the missile. - Call it off. It's already launched! - Then redirect it.
It's already running! - Then reroute it. - Where-- What do we do? Where do we send it?
Please, Emma, get us out of here. I'll try. I promise. Do you still have the SIM card? Can you give it to Yusef's nephew that you met?
- It won't be long now. You'll do great. Drinks? Would you like to see Linda's room? I'd like to show it to you.
- (liv) Which was stolen from Devon's house, completely suppressing his positive energy. - (babino) This witness just I.D.'d you. Oh, and another thing. The beer bottle you were sipping on the first time we met. I pulled it out of the trash, and guess whose DNA is on it?
You're welcome. - (Watson) What the fuck? - (Cindy) Hey, bring it over here. Oh, shit! Thank you for your help, I appreciate it.
What the fuck is wrong with you? Everything, I guess. Where'd you get a goddamn gun? I don't know. He brought it.
Good God, you don't eat at all? Nobody eats with this war. You need to rest, you're exhausted. The solution to relativity is just around the corner. I almost touched it.
Albert. Nobel Prize winner in chemistry. That's something. I'm not a genius like you, Albert. I was just given a problem, and I found a way to solve it.
I have a proposition for you. I can't afford to make it in public. You can be assured of my discretion. Have you read the article exposing relativity? I think you support it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Einstein. Questions for your husband. How did you meet Chaim Weizmann? It's okay, Haim, you can admit you don't understand. Albert, you've been explaining relativity for over three hours, and I'm pretty sure you understand it.
Yeah, but then we don't know exactly where she is. Does that make sense? No, sir. - Of course not. According to my colleague, the particle doesn't exist at all. Not until we see it.
But we can measure the velocity of the second particle. And since they are mathematically related, we can determine the velocity of the first particle. And we'll know both its velocity and its location without a direct determination. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle refuted by certainty. You lose, sir. - But... What if the action of measuring the first particle affects the second particle and somehow changes it during the measurement?
She had a strategy. I'm not Elsa. Yes, you are. You only show enthusiasm for hiding the phone from me. You haven't seen her, have you?
- Albert, we've discussed this many times. - No, no, no, no. Yes. That's different. It seems that the more physicists accept my theory, the more you deny it.
McKee. By doubting the Bureau's credibility, you're doubting my credibility. And that kind of doubt Could get you into a lot of trouble. Give Einstein a word and he'll be sunk by the patriotic citizens of this great country. It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and only a moment to destroy it.
Pour it out. I'll be there in a minute. - It's my song. - I know it's your song. - I love it.
I'll be there in a minute. - It's my song. - I know it's your song. - I love it. - And you sing it so well.
Uh-oh. Vincent has his own strategy. Does she know? Rosie, show Mr. Dunbar Jr. the door. Don't open it.
This is a literary club, right? - I wrote a book. "Hold the Helm Tight." - That's right. I devoured it in one sitting.
But let's not talk about prison, let's talk about peace. - Well, I'm having trouble with municipal bonds. - I'm aware of that. They gave the gaming license to someone else. You want it back.
Your armor is genetically locked so no one else can use it. You want to know how I found you? No. Not anymore. I guessed the instant drive was transmitting a subspace signal. The key was to find a frequency to jam it.
Their leader? Is he a friend of yours? I like him. Why didn't you tell us before? I wanted to, but they trusted me with their secret, and I felt there was no harm in keeping it.
It would take advanced intelligence to recognize it, and it would take approximately 87,560 hours to decipher. Ten years. Roughly. However, there are illogical aspects to this puzzle that are better approached with an intuitive approach. So the fastest person to decipher it is the one with android logic and emotional intelligence?
Imagine they are in danger. They turn to you for help, but the situation looks hopeless, when suddenly.... You discover a technology that could change everything. What would you do to get it? Anything. Now imagine you had that technology, a way to save your people, but someone took it away from you.
2-AYA: Android, Fifth, how's it going in there? We've made a few changes to the instant engine that should supposedly neutralize the damage done by Ishida's scientists. How do we know for sure? First we run a full diagnostic. Then we run a series of simulations. If there's any instability left, we'll be able to detect it long before we test it in real life.
Oh, shit. So much for the "easy ride." Why? It's not my fault. She said the station was abandoned, not destroyed. Apparently, when Novina had to abandon the station, they decided to flood it.
I understand. But they can't imagine what you'll have to do to save the Ishida house. Unlike me. If you want to take my life. I'll give it to you gladly. Knowing that I did it for the good of the Empire.
I would say "the one and only," but lately that hasn't been the case. What's going on in there? Access to the system is blocked. Apparently, their android installed some kind of protection. I can bypass it, but I need to get to the bridge.
Sounds awful, doesn't it? No, not at all. It's not easy to replace an entire world, you know. Why didn't you tell me that time on Hyperion 8? What was I supposed to say? "You had a good family, but you blew it"?
When my comrade Boone woke up, he said it was a portal. He also said he could hear voices. Maybe he does. He was possessed by a creature like that. We were able to get it out, but what if it was affecting him?
You can disarm the warhead before impact. We've got a man down there. CAPTAIN ARASHI: We have men there too, "Raza." But we were given orders from above. There's nothing we can do. If you don't disarm the bomb, we'll be forced to shoot it down.
What's this? It's a roller key. - Yeah. Talked to my cousin brother who works for the police. Picked it up from the vault. Sorry, I tried to get your bomb, but it got blown up.
- Here, come on. - Untie it, untie it. It's the water. Over the years, the water has absorbed the moissanite. You drink it, you grow crops.
What was that? You were using a protomolecule on children. What were you doing? We made the protomolecule do what we wanted it to do. We modeled it in our own image.
We'll see about that. Here it is. In the agro-dome. Turn on the FTL and give me control. Why kill it?
The IMCF is providing a corridor for the incoming ship. Those scientists packed up to leave with that thing. Apparently, it was their transportation. They're not gonna be happy when they find out their lab rat escaped. All the more reason to destroy it.
It is instantly absorbed through the skin, leaving no residue. Cardiac arrest. An act of God. This stuff was amazingly effective. But the Brussels Act banned it.
Cardiac arrest. God's Providence. That thing was amazingly effective. But the Brussels Act banned it. But, as you can see, I used it anyway.
I gotta go. Get some rest. - Hall! - Sandycote will not be getting a gaming license. The commission has decided to give it to a town in the Catskill Mountains.
He makes decisions that if you confront them, the whole universe fucking explodes. But that's an exaggeration. Derivatives. They can't describe the indescribable truth. Or express what I'm feeling. It's no lie to say that Bobby Axelrod is the man who gave me life. Or kept it alive.
- At the end of the year? - No, now. Extra bonus. Normal bonus up front. - Move their desk closer to the Beemer? - Good for a head of analytics who understands the job and is willing to do it.
That's why mom sold the horse. Write it down. What? No, no, no. Your father sold it to get the IRS off his back.
- May I, please? - Well, since you're asking. I want to say something about my paella. It's so good, what happens when you taste it, Will? I want to take her to church and marry her, Rog.
Okay, that's-- That's it! What do you want me to say, Selina? What do you want me to say, Tom? That when I was in the Senate, I only supported S-473 because I was in love with you? That when we were in Los Angeles and we walked out on that stage to accept the party nomination and you grabbed my hand and raised it high in the air, I thought, "Oh my God, he's holding my hand."
But I'd like to tell you a story. It's one of my favorite memories of the south. That day my father took me rabbit hunting for the first time. I have to tell you, the rifle was bigger than me. I was quite fragile and tiny. But the second amendment definitely guaranteed my right to use it.
I certainly have nothing to apologize for. Okay, look, politicians borrow things from other politicians all the time. - Personal stories? - Absolutely. I think you should be flattered that I thought your story was special enough to use.
Blaine had it in a couple days. - (Major) Okay. (Ravi) You know, I had a whole speech prepared. Sincere and funny. Deep. But what's the point if you're gonna forget it anyway?
Seems to me those kids would do anything to get out of the house. - I mean, Mia came by quite often. - Yeah? Why is that? Her parents took the rent in cash. She'd take it, so you wouldn't find that in the books, you know.
How is that any consolation? The money will come with a note saying she's dead. Look, there's no way we're gonna bring that poor girl back to life. - I know, but, uh. - Even with the help of a voodoo witch who flies in from Haiti every year, at great expense, for Grandma's birthday and shakes her sad fuckin' face! So the best we can do is stuff the car full of dynamite and push it off a cliff.
- Why are you doing this? Oh, my God, they're raiding our building. Okay, Professor, let's get out of here. No, there's a Lumen in there. The book will be fine, they'll never find it.
Keep your head down. I was a fool. Now I realize that what's easy to get can be just as easy to lose. The book is safe, Professor. We'll come back and get it as soon as we get out of here.
I think the sick leave was good for him. I'm not going on sick leave. Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend hurt you, and then tried to inject you with poison. I think you deserve a couple days of sick leave. You've been working on that leopard tattoo for two weeks. maybe Sandstorm didn't put it on Jane because it's a bummer.
Stepulov targeted Erin because I used his son. No, not just your daughter. There's hundreds more civilians, people from all over the country. It was his plan all along. And he timed the attack so he could call it off if his son survived, or not if he didn't...
Attached to the rack is a converted cell phone. Incoming call triggers an explosion. Okay. (cell phone ringing) If I can override the cell tower signal, the bomb won't go off. 90 seconds, how do we stop it?
What's "our formula"? Okay, between you and me, it's an old Daedalus tradition. It's a risk-benefit algorithm we use to determine what kinds of risks are worth taking. Cheating on exams, shoplifting...unprotected sex..... all kinds of fun stuff. But some graduates also use it in life after college to justify some shady business dealings.
Are you serious? Check out his harness. That's Willy Wonka's golden ticket. It opens every door in this building. That's great, but how are you gonna get it?
Anybody anything... Nothing. Ron? Was it that bad? I have to say that when Olivia disappeared and Kevin decided to finance the play himself instead of the one who wrote it, I said to myself Ron, man, you won three Tonys and here you are, directing a failed sitcom, a project where actors disappear.
That's not what this is about. I literally ruined my entire life for this play. That's why I'm here, sir. And the crazy thing is, it's really good, it is. But no one's coming to see it unless you tell them, so I'm begging you, please. give us another chance.
See? Fresh meat. You can go in and pick out a chicken. - He kills the chicken. - What? He plucks it, washes it, and then he wraps it up for you.
All right, well, let's go over the plan. - All right. Uh-huh. - The bartender's an old man. He's not very smart. Every night at 9:30, he starts closing his shift. He opens the register and pulls out the cash so Ray and his guys can pick it up later.
No, I want to sing. They're gonna make good decisions. It's just a meeting with the director, okay? - It doesn't mean I'm gonna get the part. - Don't be like that. I want you to get it.
Valliere. Thanks to his information, we learned of a secret Allied training base in Canada known as Camp X. Why haven't you approached anyone with your plan to act as a triple agent? As a precaution against potentially disloyal elements within our own ranks. The safest course of action was to get as much information as possible to begin with, then send it directly to Berlin.
You know what the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia is? - The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it. That's the problem. It takes you away from reality. The disease convinces you that you don't have it.
Heard about the hand. Congratulations. Sherman, don't jinx it. It won't be mine for two days. In East Peck, if no one claims a body part for two weeks, you can keep it.
Our situation is not "intolerable." It is "intolerable." Aunt Josephine has left us in the care of Captain Sham, and I don't know how to fix it. I wish we hadn't read that note to Mr. Poe. We could tear it up and write a new one in Auntie's handwriting, with no mention of--
Count Olaf didn't break into Aunt Josephine's house. He disguised himself and Aunt Josephine fell for his hook, line and sinker. Please, Klaus, this is no time for fishing jokes. There's a very easy way to determine who wrote the note. We'll just compare it to your Aunt Josephine's handwriting.
1957. We are. That's how Olivia found out. It's all over that map. If anyone sees it.
The painting's on its way back from Austria. But the auction is tomorrow. We're not going to exhibit it. It's being offered to a private collection. But if two buyers are interested in it, I have to show it.
Shall we steal it before the auction? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Olivia will smell trouble. She has to buy the painting without us knowing we're here. We'll get it another way.
Here's to the Brigadefuhrer. I don't like vodka. It burns your throat. - Haha! - I didn't like it either. But since I've been working in Poland, I've learned to like it.
Shall we begin? While you are waiting, have you heard the story of the poor woodcutter and his wife? I don't think I have. One day the poor woodcutter and his wife found a crane caught in a net. Taking pity on the bird, they freed it from its bonds.
You had access to the timer. My brother was a paratrooper. Died in Kandahar. You really think wearing this on my arm I'd embarrass his victim by giving classified information to terrorists? I don't think you gave it away.
My brother was a paratrooper. Died in Kandahar. You really think wearing this on my arm I'd embarrass his victim by giving classified information to terrorists? I don't think you gave it away. I think you sold it.
- Names don't matter. What matters is that we both have something the other needs. I propose a trade. You want to see your colleague alive again, bring our system to Cornerstone Park, east exit, in half an hour. And make sure you bring it in one piece, or for every missing piece, I'll cut a piece off Agent Nawabi.
Father Brown did it. Catherine warned me about him. Said he was corrupt, evil, selfish. Father Brown is the nicest man I've ever met. And if you say another bad word about him, I'll shove your stupid plaque where no one can read it.
Why was he digging a hole? He was burying something. A wooden box. It was a nice, carved thing. Anyway, he didn't want it, so I waited until he left and then I dug it up.
Look at her. I can dream, can't I? Not for long. Otherwise the inspector will suspect where I've been. A man was seen burying it in the woods yesterday morning.
Hello, I'm Bunty. You're so cute. Oh, thank you. I like your hat. Well, you can borrow it from me whenever you want.
You're so cute. Thank you. I like your hat. Well, you can borrow it from me whenever you want. You should wear it to one of my parties.
- Is this your memoir? - Yes. I finished my book. It's a story about my sisters. I called it "Dark Child (Black Orphan)."
What the hell happened to me? I promise I'll tell you everything, but only in person. Roman, check your pocket. There's a coin in there, a very special coin. I gave it to you when we were kids.
It's mostly vascular repair. I'll check for organ damage. I'll take care of the extremities. I'm concerned about her right leg. She severed it pretty badly.
The neighbor called 911, and the fire department opened the gate. Look, they saved your life. Damn barbed wire. I took most of it off, and then I fell down the stairs into a barbed pile. You took it off?
Look, Not-Doctor Grey, I don't care what you did. Dr. Grey found my tumor. She told me about it. She held my hand while I cried. She told me how she was gonna remove it.
I'm sure there's more to it than that. Well, what Bailey did is wrong. You can't just put someone in charge of general surgery. Kepner's good, but Grey's done a lot for this job, right? She deserves it.
At the cost of her own life? She came in here feeling fine. If you'd found the stenosis a minute later, we wouldn't even be having this discussion. He would've had the kidney by now. Yeah, but he didn't, and if we don't give it to her soon, she'll die and no one will have it, so who are we giving it to?
You keep saying, "I'm Avery, I'm Avery," but it's not true, not in the way you're trying. The name doesn't mean anything. It's the person who bears it that matters. Yes, I took your father's last name, but only what I, wearing it, did, what I, wearing it, accomplished.
You'll get a call from this firm in a couple hours with a good deal on the Kendall case. Yeah, I agree. You just need to know that one of the lawyers discovered a key piece of evidence that solved the case, and she just got fired. You forgot. Give it to someone who needs it.
The interrogator is just trying to make it easier for the deceiver to admit the truth, that's all. So you tend to minimize crime? Yes. According to Mr. Diardian's testimony, he explained to the suspect that the theft wasn't the problem. They just wanted to investigate it.
Your Honor, I'd like to cross-examine. This is not a full trial. This is just a motion to recuse. Yes, I know, but this information just came to us. We were hoping to use it at trial, but we think we can save the court a lot of time and money if we use it now.
Oh, great. Phil passed out. - Claire. - They would have found out anyway. I didn't spend $15 on a picture to hide it.
This contract. Confirmation of transfer of 12 eggs from Lake Drive. Lab confirmation of one egg transfer to you. And why do you need an egg? Client wants to fertilize her.
Lab confirmation of one egg transfer to you. And what do you want the egg for? The client wants to fertilize it. Alas, there's a problem. Have you destroyed it yet?
Laura, the problem is. the last egg has already been fertilized. By who? That's the question. We don't know. We traced it to Chicago Poly-Tech, the genetics lab, and we're subpoenaing them.
Thank you. That was fantastic. You were fantastic. Did you see his face when you asked him to read the date? You made him read it.
Basically, some people are just better at something than others. Coding makes you realize that. The number 7 is the number 7. Calling it a digit 8 doesn't make it a digit 8, it just makes it confusing.
You could have protected yourself. - Please don't. ...and instead you protected me. You gave me this job. You earned it.
Rutger... ate Josh's beluga. Wait, this squiggly thing is a fish? Draw waves on top so it's underwater. That's a good idea. - It doesn't matter, the fish wasn't underwater when he ate it.
I can't believe I gave away all the money. If it's any consolation, you haven't been yourself lately. Yeah. I gotta ask-- what's the last thing you remember? I was in New Mexico for work, went into a Navajo gift shop. I saw a beautiful buckle, and I picked it up. next thing I know, I woke up strapped to a gurney next to you.
It's a chevral something. It's expensive, so it must be good. I didn't expect you and your, uh. deadly light would be back so soon. Something's been bothering me. When you first saw my wound, you asked me if Lucifer did it.
About the car bomb. It's like his guards were told where to look. - And you think I told him? - No one else knew. Except the bomb maker and the mechanic who planted it.
Maybe he will. How? The police radio is on the same frequency as Maggie's hearing aid, which could cause interference. Switch to 154.4 and turn it on. Keep it on.
I doused Nikolai's shoes to scare away the bullies at daycare. - Did it work? - No, now they're calling him a pussy. He's in even worse shape. But wolf urine will definitely deter rats. We'll use it to trap them.
Okay? You may have a broken wrist. I think we're gonna need a splint. The main first aid kit's in the ship's kitchen. - I can get it.
Plus, I was in the hallway. I figured I should move a huge, horrible tumor or something. - I have a huge, horrible tumor. - What? I was up all night studying it, and I think I found a way out.
Of course she does. You don't know? I'm a faggot. God's love is everywhere. We must embrace it.
covered you with a blanket and left you alone to fall asleep. - Let me touch your hand. - No. I want to show you that nothing happened. I'll touch it and let it go.
Are you wearing my jacket? Yes! We're twins! No, that's not how it works! You told me where you bought it.
I know our enmity is as old as the world and can be insurmountable. But I call upon both our armies to become allies for one moment and cease firing so that the wounded can be taken from the battlefield. Perhaps there will come a day when courage will leave us, when we will forget our friendship and break the bonds of brotherhood, but today is not that day. And perhaps by showing our humanity. We can save her.
Rude! All right, ladies. Star City is very grateful to you. It's our job, Mr. Mayor. Yeah, but you do it so well, so classy.
I'll never stop fighting. Of course you will. Kill her. Dispose of the body. But I'll take the mask to add to my collection.
You know what? You both need to listen, put all your bullshit aside. This girl's situation with the kid, and you're cleaning up the mess, and you're looking for that John Doe. When something bad happens, we try to take control of the situation. But sometimes it's better to leave a person with their pain for a while. Get over it, you know?
No. Apologize to the principal for me. - I'm listening. - She has to keep working. Three days ago you laughed when we suggested surgery, and now you're suggesting we put her in a cage with a lion?
It's getting late. Please be seated. Gentlemen, you have devised a plan to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. We learned of it from a French citizen you tricked into your actions. We could use this information, sell it to the Iranian authorities.
I think he gave her a gift. A ring. They left together on a motorcycle. I love this job. I just want to do it well.
You said you had a case. Your government's witness protection program had a list stolen. Do you know the thief? No, but I know who's gonna steal it next. A luxury car stolen in Atlanta was relentlessly monitored by mercenaries guarding it.
- That doesn't happen. - Yes, it does! Like a good wine. Jesus Christ! I can't wait to get back to Cheesik. Yeah, 'cause London piss is like soda, you just drink it again.
That's the thing. We don't know what happened, right? Maybe somebody slipped, and the shoe came off. Maybe an old gentleman with Alzheimer's. Goes for a walk and doesn't know where he left it.
Jacqueline, someone somewhere has lost a shoe, and if I can bring that shoe and the person together, I've accomplished my goal. David. Let's pretend for a second. Let's say I'm the one who lost the shoe. I go back to look for it, but it's not there because of you, you took it back to the house.
We need to track down that man in the Panama hat. I agree. I'm gonna hit some hat stores. Hat stores? He bought it somewhere, right?
"A tragedy for her, and for me, an amazing path to deliverance." That's interesting. Do you think this book could be connected to the murder? It's possible. If Mrs. Rudge read it, she knew the show was staged and could have canceled it.
And that you borrowed our priceless oil lamp to determine value. Well, I thought you'd be okay with that, considering it's a criminal matter. So? He tried to deceive me. He claimed that your oil lamp wasn't Robert Harper's, that Robert didn't give it to you himself.
I have no idea. He's an agricultural expert. Did he tell you anything about insects? No. He knows about wheat and what can kill it.
He'll be fine. Elizabeth, how's he taking it? The same way I do... it's frustrating. So am I. Well, if it turns out to be some kind of super wheat, I think getting it would be good for us.
A documentary series about the Larry Henderson court case. Carol Ann Keane believes Larry's missing cane was the murder weapon. Tries to find it like a dog trying to find a bone.
A documentary series about the Larry Henderson court case. Carol Ann Keane believes Larry's missing cane was the murder weapon. Tries to find it like a dog tries to find a bone. Ironically, Larry's dog finds it, mistaking it for a bone.
In fact, my wife has never been happier. I'd like to remind you that I'm offering a 50,000 reward to anyone who finds the murder weapon, Larry Henderson's murder cane. In fact, if it's the murder weapon, we should give it to the prosecution. They won't find anything on the cane, will they, Larry? I told you, it was probably buried by a dog.
Well, let's go, come on. It's going to be expensive to drain this lake. Of course, you can always take a dip and find the club yourself, but I wouldn't recommend it. I'm not afraid of you. We'll find a way to get it.
They're standing up for something far more important than themselves, and that takes courage. And you showed courage, too. I didn't do anything. Yes, you did. Despite all the mess you've been dealing with, you demanded the truth, and you accepted it.
- No, but I've seen them rearrange your book 39 times. If the time loop exists, then I agree with Sarah Connor, "There is no destiny but the one we make for ourselves." Okay, I'll grab your book. I'll find it myself.
Is that with the cactus? Not cactus, Murray, it's with the cactus. Chief, why aren't we drilling? There's water in the ground. For God's sake, let's get it out of there,
Fred? Does that sound like the actions of a sane person? But I'm not the judge of that, am I? David Morgan founded this colony. And now he's leading it to ruin.
- Aah! I just remembered this has been in my car for weeks. Only waxes can kill you. I'll get you another one. Aldous was so proud to publish this book, and yet P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.
You know your power. You've used it your whole life. I always thought I was, uh. divinely lucky. Yeah, you used it instinctively, but now I'm here. I can teach you how to control it.
Doesn't that smell racist? Racist? You can't portray African-Americans as that shade of black! That's the first time it's offended anyone. How many black people has she seen?
You can't portray African Americans with that shade of black! This is the first time it's offended anyone. How many black people has she seen? I haven't had any African-American guests. So of those who have seen it, I have the darkest skin and I'm the most offended?
We don't need him. We need his energy. - You're born with great energy, you die with even more, especially a demigod. That's why we're here, people, for the energy. Right now, he's just a leather sack hiding it from us.
Execute him. No. But I'm flattered you want to. We'll throw the note back into the dirty dishes. He'll find it and lead us to F-rati's camp.
try to understand. Listen. What don't I understand? Explain it to me. Explain to you that it's very hard to take your whole life and throw it away?
And it would be a shame if it ended right here. They kidnapped my brother. And they're gonna kill him if I don't pay up. So let me help you, okay? But let's start by you putting your gun down before I take it away and feed it to you.
It's supposed to raise your heart rate and relax you at the same time. - Oh, my God. - Uh-huh. Should I close the door? I think you should open it a little in case I need to be revived.
He has a consciousness. It's Wild West World. Hold on, Sarge. I don't see that room. Let me find it.
Definitely. To pick up so many men, do you think she could have made a mistake and picked the wrong one? While the sketch artist paints the portraits, another first-class passenger is due at the station later. No. I'm going to a party with my boyfriend, and I can't miss it.
Flynn jumped to Sacramento in the present. Spent about an hour there, then jumped back to 1780 New York. I don't get it. How can Flynn jump without a break? Vegas atomic bomb. If he's using it as a battery.
The monks are not our friends. They've taken over the Earth and made humans slaves. They hold power through a powerful transmitter...broadcasting myths and lies that they've always been here. In fact, they've only been here a few months and have distorted and falsified our history. Our mission is to interrupt their broadcast and replace it with the true history of Earth...which will weaken and undermine the power of the monks.

Uh, Lieutenant. I heard you found a sensor on Kelly's car, and that it was installed by carjackers. Yeah, my team is looking into it, but we still don't have enough to release. - Why? - Well, the carjackers may have put the sensor on Kelly's car, intending to steal it later.
I agree. There's a toxic air filtration system in here. It runs every half hour. It'll release bacteria into the atmosphere. Turn it off.
- Why? - You lied. You stole our trip. It was our family tradition, and you may think it's stupid, but it's ours. And tonight, we're gonna get it back.
We have a couple more questions. Starting with, uh. why is Dan's missing painting for sale here? This is the first time Lady Wellin Marsapple, heroine of the Ogden Tweedlehut series, has appeared in print. And who says she's missing? Dan bet me she was.
These arrests are my arrests, too. And this is about both of us, okay? You made a mistake, a big one. But you're gonna figure out a way to live with it. And every day you keep doing your job, you're gonna do it right.
Really? I guess I have a lot to catch up on. All right, JP, what do you got? Sir, the victim's purse was found here. I've been going through it.
Enjoying the book, sir? Very much. Did you enjoy it too, Dwayne? Me? Yeah, what did you think when you first read it?
Yeah, the note move wasn't bad. The fact that it only had Esther's fingerprints on it is very resourceful. And we already knew Esther was helping you organize the festival. I'm sure there were tons of papers with her prints on them. All you had to do was use gloves to pick up the sheet, type the note and sign it.
It must have been pretty easy to get a copy of Esther's signature. And then all you had to do was plant a fake note in her purse after you killed her. But as resourceful as it was, the suicide note also exposed you. It was typed, which means it somehow didn't inspire confidence. And also the fact that Esther's signature was in Byro's pen, not the fountain pen she always used, confirmed that she didn't write the note or sign it.
And I heard you took care of him yourself. - I did, sir. - Uh, good. Sir, I'd like to renew my application for field training. I'll review it as soon as I catch up.
OK! Good. Alistair thought his classroom education made him a genius - always making "improvements" in the process without telling anyone. After the fire, I discovered he had changed the system. The pipe cracked, Robert tried to fix it, but, yes, the fire was Alistair's fault.
Archer knows the truth. I can't live knowing what I did to you, and knowing you'll find out the truth, I can't live with that guilt. Goodbye, son. Love, Dad." When you found the note and read it, you realized exactly what had happened.
All bodies are good. Yeah. What do you mean? You love "Game of Thrones." I mean, you uploaded a cut of all the nude scenes and called it "scenes to plot"... which was very clever.
Okay. He strapped Wonder Woman to the rocket. The D.A. said he tied her up, but if he did, where's the rope, Teddy? - Where's the rope? - Find it.
So twenty minutes ago we offered it to them.... They turned it down? Absolutely not. Petrov doesn't want us to see what's on board. I realize it's a difficult decision, but lives are at stake, and if we arrive with help, Petrov will have to accept it.
If they do. We deprive them of their trump card - the supposed reliability of the armed forces. It's cases like this that decide elections. Whatever the cost, it's worth it. Get the tape and check it out.
She had several broken bones and significant burns on the right side of her body. On her body, we found glass and metal shards and fragments of skin. Maybe the remains of a suitcase? Maybe she was carrying a bomb. Carrying it?
Reproductive manipulation? Demeter is trying to fertilize an egg outside the womb? - I don't know how successful. You could ask her, though. She'd be happy to discuss her work with someone who understands it.
I understand. I want to help. Thank you. Just to clarify. the last couple of days, you were all with Mr. Lewis and Ms. Boyd on their boat? Yes, we rented it for the week.
Then you should know. It was found on the boat where Mr. Lewis was killed. My uncle collected cufflinks, he had about 100 pairs. I know it doesn't seem that unusual, except he only had one hand. Yeah. He lost it.
If the Flagship falls into the hands of Rittenhouse... ANTHONY: It's too dangerous. Flynn. Apparently, he recognized the one trying to do the right thing. Help me steal a time machine to save my wife. RUFUS: He's got her back, no damage!
It's okay. Scully. Are you upset about Cindy or do you feel at home in a body bag? We're using the same medicated powder. I smelled it.
She just shot him. He's dead. I have diplomatic immunity. And this purse is the property of the diplomatic mission. You're legally obligated to give it back to me. She's right.
The truth. I cherish it. I didn't kill your accountant. Your deal was falling apart. Then I stepped in and intercepted it.
Honestly, it's great. I've been thinking about what you said, about why I need this. Honestly, I still don't know. But I do know that this family is the most important thing in my life. I don't want to lose it.
Ogre. "Ogres aren't real"? I don't know, looks human. Okay, I have a theory. That stupid story about the bear in the woods, you made that up, right?
Okay, so there are three council members alive, including Al-Khatib, the dude with the money. He might know about John's plans. Where do we find him, Rachel? You can eliminate the council, John, but we still need protection. We'll get it.
When I get back, we'll talk. We're coming with you. - What's going on? - Our friend Calvin tried to jump up and pull the fire escape down. He grabbed it, but it fell on top of him.
I've got 10 cases here that I haven't even read yet. Oh, thank you. I had some medical records in here somewhere. You want to see it? Save it.
There was a Latino thing. But you know how it is. Nobody saw anything. What happened to the gun? I never found it.
But you know how it is. Nobody saw anything. What happened to the gun? I never found it. They must have taken it after they shot him.
The one circled. "Kimball Factory: Child sex den"? The article was published a few weeks ago on the Anders Report website. I printed it out.
Well, it's not perfect, but it'll do. Yeah. Thank you. And, you know, I, uh. I know you didn't ask, but this Palmer thing, whether you accept it or not,
- Mr. Beckett also signed an affidavit stating that he was under the influence of phenylcyclidine and fell down the stairs accidentally. Mr. Beckett. Thank you, Your Honor. Rodney, how's your hand? I still can't quite get it straight.
It's a timing device. You take a paper bag, you fill it with oxidizer-- cat litter or chlorine. Then you take a light bulb, you fill it with fuel-- gasoline, vegetable oil, whatever. See the hole? That's where you fill it up.
Enough! All resources are being utilized. Even the city attorney's on his way. The DEA has information for us. We can hear it, or we can yell at each other.
I know it's a small apartment, but I think we can find a place. No, Sheldon. We're not buying a full-size Spider-Man statue. We do still have Sheldon's old room. If he really needs a place to live, I think we should offer it to him.
We have to deal with it. We need to fix her. Cure her, okay? The answer's in here somewhere. We're gonna find it.
- Ma'am! - Son! Let them work. Let them work. We gotta get her out.
I'm not going anywhere and I'm not leaving you. I knew you'd be here. I knew you'd find me. You've been following me. Well. Journalism may be dead in America, but where I come from, if you want to find a story, you have to go and find it.
I thought you were a gym teacher! Oh, my God! Is that my money? - Give me the card! - I don't have it.
- Give me the card! - I don't have it. - Give me the goddamn card! - I wouldn't do that! I don't have it with me!
- Give me the goddamn card! - I wouldn't do that! I don't have it with me! It's at the post office. I sent it to your wife.
That's where you're wrong. You think everyone cares about the truth, but that's a relic of the past. No one wants boring facts. They want a good story. And the better the story. The more faith they have in the person telling it.
All of us trapped in this bunker, we're the ones Shepard wants to use. "Truman protocol." Phase two is us. - No, no, no, no. Phase two of the attack has already happened. We stopped it.
Captain Holt's mother. Creator. Widowed at 39, Laverne Kinnebrew Holt single-handedly raised two children and still managed to become the first black female federal judge. Somebody read her wikipedia page. No, Jake, I wrote it.
Shame. - Blind? This room is swanky. It's like a Swedish airport. Everyone's gonna love it.
Hysterical. - You're the hysterical one, asshole! - No, you! - Gina, as you know, my pen gets its nib changed in Germany. Yes, and that's not up for discussion. And because of her absence, I took Amy's favorite pen, and I lost it. lost it.
- Santiago! You did it! - And you're sick of listening to fucking classical music all day. It's too loud! We can all hear it!
Because I'm a rebel and we're in love. It's obvious. Diaz, I've been calling you. Why didn't you pick up? I don't have one.
Okay. Let's close the tab. Here's the article. Hawkins drove you out of New York and took your life. If you help us, maybe we can give it back to you.
- He won't leave her side. - I did. Horse cancer. Your meeting with Emily is about to start. She wants to hold it in her office.
There's no hope anymore. No. There is hope. It's everywhere. I've seen it. Everyone you've met, the people you've helped.
A letter arrives from some service: "You must come, and..." No, I mustn't - I'll kill myself. You can do that. Just once. And here's the interesting thing: even when life is bad, people usually choose it over nothing.
- Do you know anything about a dog? - He's afraid of pennies. So we think someone threw handfuls of coins in his face. That's it. So you just take this strange dog and you let it into your house with your family! And you watch her character unfold.
- Anyway, here's what we need you to do. We need you to teach the kids math. - Wow! They want to know math? You have to force them to do math against their will.
And violating the nondisclosure agreement could get you expelled from the board, and if we find out that you did it... - No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you. Like you said, I exploited a loophole. Because I'm a good lawyer, and I'm also an ethical lawyer. So if this firm is getting inside information from Pearson-Specter, they're not getting it from me.
I signed a treaty that says I will not interfere. I can't cross that line. - Jesus Christ, Mike. Are you saying you care more about some signed piece of paper than these people's lives? No, I'm not, but I signed it.
I only listen to a third of what you say. Hi. - Hey. Hey. - I just realized I never asked how the meeting at the Plaza went. I canceled it.
How do you know? Because I didn't spend all morning practicing my kissing skills. Then you also know that lockwood environmental division has only been around for three months. They stole the technology. Which is why you have to sign a contract with me so I can get it back.
Lockwood is putting out solar panels? Since when are they in the renewable energy business? Since they stole Galvadain's technology. That can't be right. They didn't steal it.
It can't be. They didn't steal it. How do you know? Because there's only six people capable of that kind of work, and if any of them did, I'd know. Well, they got it somehow, and I need to know how.
It doesn't matter, Louis. We can charge any client for it, right? Cause nobody cares about anything but making money. Mike, what happened? What happened is the only reason I came back was because of my deal with Harvey, and within a week, he's tearing it up.
Mr. Smiles doesn't see it that way. Maybe he would have if he hadn't been buried. - What's the Duke's complaint? - A small tumor. Thinks it's time to remove it.
I don't know exactly. I just remember getting there. I remember the orange carpet. And that song. Frankie. he played it over and over and over and over.
Hopefully something good, I only have four hours to sleep. Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh. Cora. That song changed something in her. When she hears it, something happens.
I've been brought here to be punished? Not at all. I have a gift for you. Your life, Belmont. Take it and go.
So did I. He was wearing a leather jacket. A leather jacket is a waste of money. Maybe we shouldn't spend so much money on chicken. If we were stealing it, we could afford to buy you a jacket. Listen.
We went out to dinner, and I thought as friends. But you're right. He was flirting with me. Oh, my God. Nope, mom. We can't let that happen! I'm gonna tell you, it's not gonna happen. I realized I'm not sexually attracted to him. Okay. I feel really weird about that, but I'll take it, because it's for the best.
Ghost catcher. And my coat, too. I almost forgot how beautiful the view is from up here. I see you found your coat. You promised you'd keep it for me.
In other words, he bought a new car. The world hasn't stood still since your death, Cage. Onboard drones, air defense countermeasures... and fuel tanks that let you fly around the world three times without refueling. You can turn in your fur coat. You have my word, no one will steal it.
Serena deceived us. Betrayed us. Serena's not that important. This is a war. And either we stop it today, or tomorrow the world burns to the ground.
That's what this table is. I told Francie Millner a story with no end when she was five. Taught her to sing a dozen rock 'n' roll songs. Gave her her favorite toy in the world. A golden bird, she loved it, and I'm sure she still has it.
Do you still have that golden bird? Oh, Nanny Joe. You don't even remember what it is? Of course I do. I don't know why I should be ashamed of it, but I lost it almost as soon as you gave it to me.
Where'd they go? You're going the wrong way. I don't know where we're going! Was there a shortcut? We didn't see it.
As much as I know about laptops, I don't know anything about computers. Dave had access to Leeds' server. To her network. Yeah, the network. We take the thumb drive and plug it in.
But one man didn't give up. - Who? - Chen. If anything happens to him, his property goes to the city. And who would they sell it to?
You and I have more in common than you think. Not only do we share blood, but we have similar interests. - We both have a penchant for power. - I have no power. Or a hunger for it.
Ready! Ignore that idiot. You're going to have a great time. Can I borrow your camera? Yeah, but, uh. If you drop it, you'll have to dive for it.
- Lisa, calm down! Stop it. - No, I can't. - I can't. - I can't. Please. I'm gonna take a deep breath, take it off, swim out, and you hand it back to me, okay?
Stop it. - No, I can't. - I can't. - I can't. Please. I'm gonna take a deep breath, take it off, swim out, and you hand it back to me, okay? What if you can't put it back on?
Please respond! Lisa, open the cage! Open the cage! It was a shark! I can't open it!
You see? We're replaceable. They fired Irv. This school wants to fuck me? I'm gonna fuck her!
No. No way. It's not like you're-- We love each other. I just regurgitated a pasta and ate it.
You see! I was right. No. I've seen this before. We need to find something to replace it with.
Spit it out! Come on! Disgusting! The beast's hide is too thick to pierce from the outside. I must tear it from the inside.
Wow! But I wanted more. I longed for meaning. "There must be other life out there in the vastness of the universe besides me," I thought. And then I set out to find it.
We're eternal. Can't eternity get boring? Not if you have a purpose, Peter. And that's why you're here. I told you how, years ago, I felt an irresistible urge to search for life. What I didn't tell you is that when I finally found it, I was sorely disappointed.
Sleep! I didn't think she'd make it. She looks so weak and puny. I don't know how long I can hold it. The layer of metal is too thick. For the bomb to work, it has to be placed on the core of the Ego.
Okay, but don't be a drag today. We're doing something out of the ordinary, and you could ruin it. Am I that big of a problem? You have a nice smile. Use it.
I don't need to know why. Ward's management has led Rand to success time and time again, and.... Why do you ask? When I got to the monastery after the disaster, I learned of an important position. A powerful, important job, and I wanted it.
I never really thought about what it meant for my life. - Did you get the job? - Yeah. I fought hard. I earned it.
What makes you so sure? It's not certainty. Doubt leads to death. Tell me the legend again. Why are you so eager to hear it again?
No, I can't wait till the doctor comes in the morning. Okay, well, thanks for not helping. Oh, my God. Aah, my arm. I pinched it.
Rand has a lab, right? Yeah, so? Sodium Pentothal. Truth serum. If you can get it, we can dope Gao.
That's what Iron Fist is. Why are you so interested in Iron Fist? I've spent my entire life in various dojos and monasteries, training with masters of all stripes, listening to their stories and legends about Immortal Weapons. I thought they were children's stories until I was given this tape. When I watched it, I became obsessed with learning everything I could about the Iron Fist.
Pretend they don't exist. The gun has no feelings. Danny should have been back by now. His chi may be more damaged than we thought. But Master Lei Kun will be able to restore it when we return to K'un-L'un.
But your ability to get through it and become stronger is a hundred times more significant than putting a smile on your face and pretending everything is fine. Do you understand? Look. No one can give you your life back, Aaron. You have to-- You can get it back.
Little mistakes. Personal relationships. That's what they'll use to finish you off. What happened to your hand? I cut it off to free myself.
Hundreds of years ago. Thousands. It doesn't matter. But, long ago, the Kun-Lun elders gathered to learn how to curb their Qi. The very energy of life. They wanted to use it for healing.
Before I went on pilgrimage to Kun-Lun. Before I knew what I was. And before she led the organization. She was smart, she was kind. And death took her from me before I knew how to defeat her.
- Don't worry. He didn't go as Matt. You gave him a suit? I wasn't trying to open the door for him. I was giving him a chance to slam it.
What's going on? Claire! Shit. You're wasting your energy. Save it for a bigger fight.
I know your limits. You can't do me irreparable harm. Especially since the Iron Fist has already given us the original gift. Life without end. I'm giving you one last chance to experience it with me.
No. That's because you still feel it. Based on your talk of embracing the darkness, I don't think you want to be alone in this. - I've seen death. - And you're afraid of it.
I still have nightmares. And I'm an adult. What did she say to you? No, no, no, no, no. That crow was wounded, and all I did was put it out of its misery. And I tested the limits of a crow's neck strength.
Is that me? I'll tell you what to do with cats. Who took this? Dennis? This is what you do with cats. One time in a Vietnamese sweatshop, we found a cat and threw it right into the soup.
All right. - Try to get some rest. - Okay. [Cell phone rings] Look, you have a panic button. Don't be afraid to use it.
Mary, I know you like math. That's why you'll find a sold-out edition of Charles Zimmer's "Movements in Higher Algebra." Yeah. It's a great book. Have you read it?
It also says Mary Eileen Adler. Same name as your daughter. Born on the same day. There's a photograph. In your defense, you wouldn't have recognized her.
- No. Then what did she do all the time? She loved math. Passionately. She preferred it to everything else.
A year ago, a tragic event occurred. Many lives were lost unjustly, inexplicably and unexpectedly. But today, the souls of those we lost are in another world, looking at us. And they see that on days like today we remember them and honor them. And to keep this memory alive, to root it within us, and in this very place, today we unveil this monument, this memorial to all the victims.
I said I'd give it a try. Yeah, only that was six years ago. Well, it took me a while to get used to the idea. I wanted to congratulate you on winning the game. We never finished it.
The entire province is only 4% of the country's population. It doesn't make strategic sense. I would back away from that idea. The problem with guerrilla warfare is that it's pointless. We tried it in Vietnam.
His mother conjured him. To fill the void she felt after the Wild Hunt in Canaan. Mom. What if sheriff stilinski feels a void? And he's filling it with Claudia?
- No! Oh, no! It's okay, it's okay. Where is he? If this is all your magic, you'd better try it on me, because I know no mercy.
How...do you know how it works? I built this machine. - You did? Yeah. To get back to your house, but the Wizard took it away.
- In what way? - Underhill Plantation. The largest and richest property on the island. Over two hundred slaves live on it. It's well defended. I couldn't take it on my own.
No, no, no, no, ...... I'm a grown man. That's not gonna work. You broke my cigarette. Did I? You threw it away.
You were chosen because of the physical excellence you have enjoyed all your life. With your innate gift and our determination, we can be a part of something greater. Something perfect. The coagulation procedure is a man-made miracle. We, in turn, have been creating it for years. And not so recently, it's been perfected. with the help of my own flesh and blood.
I had to wonder about that. At first I thought he was doing what the Norwegians do. But then I noticed the way he sorts his cards. The first card he shifts indicates the suit. If he slides it all the way to the left, it's spades.
It was at our intersection. The accident happened at the same intersection. I said I didn't want to discuss it. I thought you called the police about the sign. We don't know that he called it.
I'll be back. No, no, stay. You can help me. Do you know how to open a keg? Cause all the guys are like, "let's get a keg," and then when you have to open it.
So, are we gonna have dinner or-- That's a great idea. Bring a beer. If you're hungry, honey, I'll give you a 20, you can go get a pizza. We can have it delivered here.
What the fuck happened to your face? I'll show you. Can't this wait till after school? Make a copy of this tape. I'll pick it up after class.
We all let her go. She walked out of school. went home. finished some chores. She returned her uniform to Crestmont, where we worked together. She didn't say anything. She threw it on the register and left.
Yes, master. Yes, boy! Get down! The mortal has a gift. When I eat her whole, I will absorb the power and use it as I wish.
Jared, come on, get up! Let's get out of here. Can I-- Can I have my cane back, please? Someone gave it to me.
- No. May I, then? If you don't mind, can I walk you to the cabin? No! We have a meeting tonight, but I can skip it.
There's a future in it. You're right. I know how it ends. Let's go. We'll risk your ass for someone else. I'll rip it to shreds for a friend.
We want his support. - I strongly advise against you and the governor leaving us at a time like this. - We are so close to winning this war and pulling Nassau out of the darkness. But we cannot win alone. We need help, and there is no other way to get it.
- I strongly advise against you and the governor leaving us at a time like this. - We are so close to winning this war and pulling Nassau out of the darkness. But we cannot win alone. We need help, and there is no other way to get it. - We both know that there are people in both camps who are so deeply involved in this war that they are more afraid of ending it than they are of losing it.
And Flint? It seems like the war is over, but until they're caught, it's far from over. And if we win in Nassau, what happens to our former friends who were so close to the governor? I offer you the opportunity to return our friendship. Or to put it more accurately, to buy it.
Am I in a book? Yes. Is it about my life? Yes. Just give it to me.
Get the book. Where's the fucking book, Michael? No, no, no! He's not ready. - He's gonna destroy it.
I have a meeting with the director this afternoon, and everyone will want to know how that asshole we locked up got out. And what are you gonna tell them? Everything, including how you used that tape between me and my C.I. to free your terrorist. Which is why I need to know, uh. that tape. How did you get it?
Fucking open the door! ...from the dozens of arrests made in connection with the attempted plot and assassination of the President earlier this month. What the fuck? According to David Wellington, the President's chief of staff, these arrests include officials from all branches of government, including the Department of Defense, the State Department, and the Central Intelligence Agency. Today, the President sent a clear message to the people of America that our democracy is strong and resilient, and that we will do whatever it takes to protect it.
I just came by to pay my respects. He and Michael were friends. John, I read your book. You did? Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom, I picked it up, and 20 minutes flew by in a flash.
You did? Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom, I took it, and twenty minutes flew by in a flash. It's incredible. Have a good day. I didn't leave it in the bathroom.
I'm afraid Jeannie's gonna have to wait for you because you're on duty. Yes, Warden. Yeah. Okay. My car is covered in kangaroo brains, so wash it.
I'm sorry to hear that, Kevin. I'm really glad you called. Can you send me a photocopy of the book? Я... gave you the original. - I threw it away.
I got it. You took your book. It's not mine, it's Matt's. But it's about you. Are you finally gonna read it?
You want to be a Jesus superstar because you're important then. You like it? I love it! It's awesome! I read it cover to cover!
And we're very grateful for that, Lori. Very grateful? - Yes. But with all due respect, I don't think you understand what's going on here. Look, three years ago, my ex-husband was having delusions and trying to kill himself. Instead of recognizing his illness, you turned it into scripture.
Said he was upset. About what exactly? Cause I don't think we know the whole story. No, the whole story, Matt, is your stupid book that you somehow convinced my husband and son-in-law not to show me. They didn't show it to you because they knew you'd react that way.
I think, uh. I'll lie down over there. It's a distraction. We need to focus on Kevin. Where's my book? I threw it overboard.
It was a terrible mistake, and I will take full responsibility for what I've done. I don't think she understands. I do. You want to drown Kevin so he can go to the dead. And there, one of the dead will teach him a song, he'll come back to you with a song so you can sing it and stop tomorrow's biblical flood.
For your own sake. A terribly self-destructive habit. That's why it's so cool. My lighter? Can you give it back, please?
Can you bring her back, please? I thought you said you dumped her. Yeah. Then you don't need her. Give her back, please.
The ones you lost, like my mom and sister? I don't know, Ben. Maybe you'll get to say what you want to say when they're around. - Or maybe this is the only life you have. And maybe you shouldn't waste it.
It's an androgen enhancer. And it inhibits entactogens. Exactly. It's the antipode of dimethyltryptamine. It blocks the empathic synaptic connection, not stimulates it.
Yeah, and they miss you, too! I miss them. I miss you. I miss my life. And I'm trying to get it back.
That's why two million dollars worth of these babies are sold every year. Because they give you the confidence that when the time comes, you can take on the challenge. Some of you do. There's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. But if I threw this can in the audience right now, no one would take it.
Even pathetic profits, outflows of investor money, and the rise of quant funds lit our way to the other side of the world, we still refused to change. In the vast expanse of time, we've been dead for a long time. I know this, even if you haven't realized it yet. But in this microsecond, while we're still breathing, I'm going to fight inevitability. If you have a card in front of you, pick it up and hold it up to your face.
- I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. - Everyone has memory lapses. No, the combination is made up of the girls' birthdays. I remember exactly how we came up with it.
You guys do the daily cleaning, right? Normally, yes, but we're short-staffed this month. How many people have been in stall two since Ms. Palfrey's death? None. We closed it out of respect.
In confidence. Did he say it was off the record? I didn't have to, but that's not the point. It's about what you could only find out from my notebook. Are you accusing Ms. Knight of stealing it?
Their last name was King. And how did you come from that to Castle? His writing's on the wall. Rook beats knight. Rook is the correct name for a chess piece, only many people call it a tourney.
Hodgins, slow down. Talk to me. I can see you're upset. I'm telling you, if I could get down to the basement, that needle wouldn't be evidence. I'd stick it in his neck so it would pierce every organ in its path.
I'm wondering if this has anything to do with Mayor Richards applying for a permit to build a hotel on this very beach. And what does that have to do with Stephen Langham? Maybe you haven't noticed, Officer Myers, but this beach is at the base of a volcano. And this land was previously designated as an observation post for scientific purposes. Until Richards bought it?
Did you tell her it was your business? No. No, I didn't. She must have thought so because of my natural grasp of aura and knowledge. You can take your aura and shove it right up your--
- I called you yesterday. - I was busy. What happened? - The game board. When did we decide to move it to my house?
Well. there's no "D" in that word, but whatever. I hear you. Are you sure it's legal? It's been reposted almost 500 times in the last half hour. What if Claudia Greco's already reading it?
What is it? It's you. You're telling me that you and the girls fell for this-- The game came in a couple days ago, after school for the blind. We hid it in Spencer's barn.
You're welcome. You're standing on quicksand. The more you resist, the faster it will drag you down. I'm offering you a rope. Take it.
Because there's a second book. It was done much later. It was about turning revenge into a game. A game? I came back here today because I didn't want whoever sent that note to get it.
Ali's baby. No, no. No one's gonna tell Ali about this. Did you see this book with your own eyes? Yeah, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.
No one's gonna tell Ali about this. Did you see this book with your own eyes? Yeah, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it. Where is it now? They put it back.
And I realized you were the one who shredded it. When the cops left, I took the canister out of the shredder and threw it in the dumpster, just in case. How'd you know? One night when you were asleep, I, uh. found her.
It's just that girls are easy prey. Please look me in the eye and tell me Hanna's not in trouble. No... she's not in trouble. Sheila, that swing has been in that tree since we bought the house. I have no idea how to take it down.
Well, think again. Because we're gonna walk out of here and we're gonna go to the police. You're gonna tell them how you made everyone's lives a living hell. But first, we're gonna take the game so they can see your handiwork. I don't have it anymore.
Because we're gonna walk out of here and we're gonna go to the police. You're gonna tell them how you made everyone's lives a living hell. But first, we're gonna take the game so they can see your handiwork. I don't have it anymore. Somebody stole it from me, somebody keeps taking it.
We at Fillmore-Graves are not going to rest in peace. - (liv) So what are you planning? - (vivian) For starters, we're heavily armed and trained. And we're the proud owners of the Superfly formula. No one else can have it.
Was she anorexic? She was 14 years old, that's the last time I saw her happy. How many of these did you take? One Sunday, I took her out to play with the old car one Sunday to give her a fake ride.
I don't buy that peace and harmony bullshit. You want to get out of here? I do. But first I have to learn how to control my power. And I like that you don't have to keep it a secret around here.
It belonged to Grammy Davenport. It should be signed by her. She read it to her students the year the Titanic sank. Damn it. My mom read it to me. I read it to you.
As much as I'd love to do it, that ship has sailed. We'll never get them back, no matter what. I'm afraid we can't take a detour. Chuck, if the tape is useless within the law, and won't help change public opinion, what's the point? Because I can't imagine how we could use it.
I got an internship. What kind of internship? Working with illegal immigrants? Oh, yeah. You got it?
There is, of course. Mountains of evidence. And it all points to Annalise Keating. Atwood's lying. They have evidence against Frank, and if I find it, I'll get Annalise released.
That doesn't mean it includes wes' murder. - Are you sure? Yes! I'll have proof soon. Oliver made a copy of the data and he's running it now.
If you don't believe me, I don't care. Why did you go to New York yesterday? Are you following me now? I didn't say that. I went to interview with Anthony and Levin to salvage what was left of my career after Annalise ruined it.
What are the options? Going to court is expensive. And very damaging to HCM's reputation. I don't suppose any of us want that. The firm could decide to buy me off by paying me a sum that would almost certainly bankrupt it.
Get some coffee, boys. It's no good sleeping on duty. Did you take care of that battery? Yeah. It did die, but we replaced it a couple hours ago.
They control their urges. You think of Lucian Graymark, mages like Magnus Bane, and even Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon? No matter how good they try to be, the inhabitants of the Lower World will never be able to control their demon blood. If that blood is so horrible, why did you add it to mine?
Like "Blame the Stars," only in life. That's a totally inappropriate twist to this book. - Is it? - No. I've never read it.
Let's go. You know if you touch the Sword, the whole Underworld will end, Simon too. No, Valentine needs a power source. He needs lightning. He's got it.
I don't know. I just had an old piece of wood. I thought it would be a cool prop. - Where is it? - I gave it to the prop guy, George.
And I was very proud. My son honored that commitment. He sacrificed his life. So by wearing this uniform, I honor his memory, just as you honor the memory of all officers who have died in the line of duty. Wear it with pride.
Did you come here to tell me that, or are you just wasting time? I'll see you around. Oh, the pain. Fascinating, isn't it? Some people will do anything to avoid it.
I'll see you around. Oh, the pain. Fascinating, isn't it? Some will do anything to avoid it. Others will embrace it, even relish it, like you.
I hope she's doing what I think she's doing. So do I. What do you know about the wand that healed me? No more than they told you. Does he always wear it?
Me, too. What do you know about the wand that healed me? No more than they told you. Does he always carry it? No. He took it out to help you.
No more than they told you. Does he always carry it? No. He took it out to help you. Pulled it out from where? He kept it in his hiding place, wrapped in a cloth.
No. He pulled it out to help you. Pulled it from where? He kept it in his hiding place, wrapped in a cloth. I forgot I had it. Nick left it on the bed when he got the wand to heal you.
I don't want to drag you into this any more than you already are. I don't like it, but okay. We're still searching Laurelhurst, but so far, nothing. We've already combed a few blocks from the car we found. He left it there on purpose.
I saw these symbols on his face when I was there. the same ones on the fabric. Maybe there's more, we just can't see it. Do you still have the wand? Yeah. I'm not sure you should carry it around with you all the time.
MILLER: We need those scientists alive! Nothing can happen to him! The protomolecule didn't get here by accident. If we master it, we can use it.
Crowe's woods. Well, you might as well bring me some mushrooms, then! You know there's 100 acres of woods here. We've got about as much chance of finding Winnie the Pooh. And even if she had a bag, maybe the killer stole it.
- That's true. Speaking of President Laura Montez, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in Tibet, right? That's unprecedented. What do you make of her speech? I didn't get a chance to watch it because I....
I know. But that doesn't mean she doesn't exist. No, it doesn't. I knew where that line was today, Alfred. I didn't cross it.
You must be the first person in history to kill to find a life growth coach. Maybe you should give up riddles. No. A good riddle reveals who's asking it. To solve it is to unravel the mystery of the one who poses it.
Ballistics report came back. No matches. But the wound had microscopic cuts made postmortem. So what does that mean? Someone removed the bullet that killed your uncle and replaced it with another.
When I find out what you did, I'll make sure you pay for it. And enjoy it. Jim, hey! Where's the riddle? Lucius and I have been trying to solve it, but maybe you'll have better luck.
Due to circumstances completely beyond our control, the owl was trashed. But we can try to recover the owl you stole, then maybe we can find Bruce and the bomb. You kept the pieces? Are you kidding me? After everything I went through to get it. Of course I did.
Okay. There she is. Is that an owl? What the hell happened to it? Jerome Valeska smashed it to pieces when he broke into the estate, didn't he?
There she is. Is that an owl? What the hell happened to it? Jerome Valeska smashed it to pieces when he broke into the estate, didn't he? Can you rebuild it?
No, the reason she left so quickly was because she was unhappy that I wasn't having sex with her. Yeah, I don't believe you. No one would say no to a girl like that. I don't understand myself, believe me. But, uh, speaking of your package, Burt. I don't have it.
- Gather your men. He needs to be taken out. - It's a beautiful song. It's mesmerizing. - Yeah. I wrote it for her.
And heck, why don't we learn a thing or two from Barry and Michelle? I want to see the world with you, Cookie. I want to write a new page in our history so it's free of slander and drama. - You created that drama by bringing your sons together. - Yes, I did. But together we can destroy it.
I won't let any of you die. I will not let you sacrifice yourselves. You mean too much to me and to the universe. Yes, you made a deal. A stupid deal, and I broke it.
My name is... my name. My name is... My name is... Gideon Lochlin's address is in the accountant's file. If the book is there, I'll find it.
I don't think we've ever seen anything like this before. Shall we sing about it? Hello, Monty. Tough oak barrier! They've broken through!
"used by so many writers that it has become a cliché," although the phrase "meanwhile at the ranch" is used to connect what is happening in one part of the story to another part of the story, and has nothing to do with cows or greasy salad dressing. When I say "meanwhile at the ranch," I mean mean meanwhile in the Snake Room the adults were having an adult conversation. If we make a path out of peaches leading to the cage, maybe the snake will crawl up it and we can lock it in the cage.
Really. Remember that PEM. Slow down. Polymer electrolytic membrane. You bought it for me online.
I had to go all the way to the-- Listen when I'm talking! I'm listening. I found him at my sister's house. He came at me with a hockey stick, and I saw this bat, and I grabbed it.
I figured out the odds. The stick is much longer than the bat. And here's where it gets interesting. You know what I did? I threw it to him.
Given your community ties, I have no objection to your release on bail, which I set at $2,500. I screwed up. Chuck's got me fooled again. This tape? He made sure Ernie heard it, didn't he?
I screwed up. Chuck's got me fooled again. That tape? He made sure Ernie heard it, didn't he? Because he knew that Ernie would freakin' tell me about it, and I'd show up to try to destroy it or steal it or whatever.
No, it's nothing like that. He pushed me back into the office. Did he have a weapon? As I mentioned, he used a poker to break into my desk. But he would never use it on me.
- Yeah, that's right. You know what I'm doing in there? Take a guess. Crisis management. I've been meeting with clients three times a day for the last two weeks. Trying to restore the firm's reputation after you and Jimmy dragged it through the mud.
If I had a soccer game, would you let me go? Yes, because you love soccer. You respect it. But my music, from the moment I told you about it, you don't care. You don't take it seriously.
In that case, Mom, I'm sorry, but no. Whatever you want to explain what's going on between you and Archie's dad, I don't want to get involved. When you play it, it sounds perfect. We wrote a good song, Archie. I can't wait to sing it with you in public.
Are you in? Dad, I have a legendary bike, and now you're giving me a car! I'm in! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You can fix it up and take Charlie out to dinner.
I need to get a book. There's only one book you should read. All the smart young people are crazy about it. Я... I've already read it twice.
I've been bugging him a lot. Yeah, that's what I thought. However, there's no way you could have left a fingerprint in one place. Under the stamp. We had to peel it off very carefully, but there was a small area on the stamp where the glue hadn't quite set.
Is there anything else I can do for you before I go? I want to get rid of the stroller. Kevin's not a baby anymore. I only used it to keep him warm for the next one. Now I need someone to take it away.
No one knows where the soul is. Maybe it lives in the heart? In the brain? What part of our body is it hiding in? What surrounds the soul, and how can we protect it?
Since when does my mother hang out with your stepfather? Something's wrong. I declare open the meeting of the shadow wedding lodge. As you know, it is our sacred duty to secretly oversee every aspect of this wedding. Together, we will transform it from a youth party into a normal, traditional wedding. Normal and respectful.
Near Ramadi. Special Forces. How did you know? Meadows had a tattoo. You recognized it.
You have to accept yourself. Have fun with Holden version 2.0. But first, turn on the damn lamp. (sighs) Okay. - Well, at least I turned it on.
Look, I just need a new card. Is that really necessary? I said wait. Sorry, I lost my wallet. Buy a boat. Buy it and we'll go on a trip.
Our mothers communicated less and less as time went on. But there was one night I'll never forget. Your mom called my mom the night you were born. They talked for a while, and when my mom hung up, she was so happy. She pulled out some cupcake that was a hundred years old, then she looked for candles, but she couldn't find any, so she took a match and stuck it in the cupcake.
But there was one night I'll never forget. Your mom called my mom the night you were born. They talked for a while, and when my mom hung up, she was so happy. She pulled out some cupcake that was a hundred years old, and then she looked for candles, but she couldn't find any, so she took a match and stuck it in the cupcake. Lit it.
- Thank you. - Do you mind? - Uh, sure. To be honest, I'm a little confused. Why are we here? Dr. Barrett's interested in the farm. He wants to buy it?
But he will. And then what? Then we take her. Cortázar will help us understand her. And the nightmare will begin again. If the protomolecule is in the Belt, it can't be used against us.
Jacob's asleep. Let's go. Fuck. You want to see what Audrey and your sisters did to my car? They scratched it up.
Otherwise it would have been a lot worse. Roger that. It's your C-4, Lieutenant. We believe that this large flower vase that was next to your father's grave was the bomb's target. And your ex-husband planted it in the cemetery.
- Ex-wife, sir, is a technicality. And Ortiz left the bomb at her father's house. - Maybe to detonate it-- There was blood on the bomb that couldn't have come from a gunshot wound. Why leave a bomb to kill his wife and then frame it so we can take it into evidence?
Doesn't look like the work of a trained Marine. Too small for a guy Ortiz's size. - Very petty. But didn't Ortiz's lawyer have all this information? I'm sure his public defender never got it.
- Red. - Red. So make her that way. Change it. Turn the wall red, Mary. Just make it red.
You stole my chopper. - You didn't use it. It needed a cartridge. - Which I bought. After you stole it!
We don't need her bullshit, Hap. She's cute in a suit. She stole your car, remember? No. She sold it to a salvage yard.
Seems like a strange coincidence. You think I wanted to turn in my son? I don't know what to think. Something strange was going on in your department, and I need to know what it was before I hand you a badge and a gun. When Phyllis died, I knew we had a leak, but it wasn't my job to find it.
I'm interested in his partner who escaped. Let's not make a big deal out of this. We cover the crash zone, tell a convincing story, and in a week, no one on my block will even remember it. According to recent intelligence reports, there's a growing resistance movement outside the colony. What if this was an attempt to find the missing gauntlet and get it off the block?
Word on the street is that I'm a bit of a snorer, so if I start to encumber, push me. Are you expecting someone? I'm looking at the stars. Have you thought that if the Lord God is missing, maybe He had a reason? Yes, and I want to find out.
We saved your life. So we're even. I know we've had our differences. But if you find a protomolecule on Ganymede-- We're certainly not bringing it back to you.
I don't remember. Something to do with Brahm, perhaps a spring flowing through the valley. Then why did he have a tarot card in his pocket? I laid out the cards for him. And he took it.
Nick, maybe she's right. Maybe she's right. - Listen to me. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the wand. So it's up to me to decide whether or not to use it.
Maybe, uh. - Listen to me. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the wand. So it's up to me to decide whether or not to use it. Well, it's safe here, so there's no harm in putting it away for a while. if you can.
Grab your stuff, let's get out of here. These are the signs I saw on a dead man's face in hell. Or wherever he was trying to drag me off to. Only Diana can see the rest. The crusaders made these marks on the cloth, or the designs were already there when they were found. I don't know if the cloth had a wand on it when they found it. But the spectral analysis didn't show anything.
But it's like. you're used to carrying your gun, and then suddenly it's gone and you feel like you've lost a piece of yourself. - I know, but we have a license for guns. I'm trying to stop thinking about her, but I'm not doing a very good job. Where is she? Got her back in the tunnel.
- I know, but we have a gun license. I'm trying to stop thinking about her, but I'm not doing a very good job. Where is she? Put her back in the tunnel. Don't you think we should bury it somewhere deeper?
- What's going on? - Now. Dan Wells, Portland P.D.! Open the door. Dan, if you don't open the door, we're gonna break it down.
Spit it out. Dr. Deirdre Hampton, professor of biochemistry and regenerative medicine, was working in the lab last night when something went wrong. It went wrong right here. Looks like nothing was taken. Her bag by the door, must have dropped it there. It's locked.
Skull. - That's it. So that's what this is all about. Maybe the blood on the mirror kept something worse from happening. Probably best not to wipe it off, then.
She said they're dangerous. Nick! What was that? At the spice shop, a hand came out of the mirror? First I saw it, then I felt it.
We brewed a special ointment. "Reptilian humanoids: pathology, diagnoses, treatment." Here! "Vle di Bouyi." It smells disgusting, and it's only bad for creatures with scales. Grimms in the south used it to lure scaly creatures out of the swamps and cut their heads off.
Can you tell me more about blood magic? One of your mother's books says that blood is associated with passing to the next world, as with warriors on the battlefield, or a hunter's prey in agony... human sacrifice on an altar.... and sometimes blood is currency. - What if blood could serve as payment for passage to another world? Blood magic is very dangerous. All we have to do is use it to cross over to another world.
We need to find out what the hell is going on on the other side. There's only one way. What's that? We go there. We need to find that thing and kill it.
He didn't kill just me, or he couldn't..... I don't know. Bullets don't take him. I still have the wand. That's probably why I'm still alive. I tried to use it on Wu and Hank. but it didn't work.
- No way. - He spared you again? Must be the wand. There's no other explanation. I tried to use it on her.
What the hell is going on? Take it. No, Nick! You can't give it to that lying satanic brat. If he wants the wand so badly, why doesn't he just take it?
Take it. No, Nick! You can't give it to that lying satanic brat. If he wants the wand so badly, why doesn't he just take it? Why is he asking for it when he can just take it from you?
What's he not telling you? You can ask your kids what to do. Nick, you can't give her to him. I want my loved ones back. - Take her!
She felt it, too. We're all descendants of the first Grimm. The wand you found. The one our Grimm ancestors buried is part of a much more powerful force. Keep it safe.
I went out to get a terrycloth robe, there were a bunch of people there, I asked them where to find the store, before I knew it they were putting green stuff on my finger and some old lady who smelled like cumin started hugging me. - Mine smelled like paprika. - Jesus! I can't have anyone noticing this. I can't lose this job, Gary, but I can't keep it either.
I'm sorry, I can get anyone. No, you're a genius. Talia, you've become close with Gina Porter. Does she like music? Yeah, she loves it.
But I yelled at him, too. It's just like that all the time, you know? He'll do something, then I'll do something back, and so on. That kind of friendship? I don't even know how to describe it.
- You're back. - And you're lucky, because now I know what you do and why you do it. I don't think you've found much, Mr. Specter. Judge for yourself. VelocityData stole your technology and marketed it, so you want to buy their company and take it back.
- Maybe. It's got a rental QR code on it. It's probably got tracking software, right? That's what I was getting at. Track it down and find it fast.
Those who have had their legs broken. Abigail would like to remind you that money can't fill the Source. And without it, Fillory will disappear. Okay, we've been over this. When someone lays a maggot in a public pool, they send a guy with a net to catch it.
How did this happen? I have an idea... how to help you. Some kind of loophole? And, oddly enough, you're gonna leave me here to find it.
I shouldn't have told your mom we were trying to have a baby. (sighs) I'm sorry. It's okay. CSU found encrypted correspondence on Todd Curry's computer. Something neither Curry nor his contact wanted to show. They're trying to crack it.
I'm looking for April. She's on a break. But I can answer any question. My wife had a necklace, a gift from her mother. И... she never took it off, but the clasp broke in the accident.
И... she never took it off, but the clasp broke in the accident. And I know she'd want it on her. I understand that. It could be in her hands during surgery. I'll make sure April puts it down.
There's a new therapy called stimulation, but I'd recommend you go with the traditional methods first. Stimulation? Transcranial magnetic stimulation. So far, it's only been approved for depression, but there's interesting evidence that it can help people with spectrum disorder. And I only mention it because our hospital has it.
- Just in case. Hey, Sarah, you got a minute? I hear most psychologists are in therapy. (Chuckles) Have you been in therapy?
You rely on them too much. Man is the ultimate machine. And I'm an extraordinary man. I'm told you refuse to talk. and that you welcome pain. I love pain, too. And I like to make others feel it using the old ways.
- Now! Okay. - That's a lot of blood. - Did you cut the radial artery? I was very careful not to nick it.
Sir, photographic plates have been switched, transportation is ready. There's no way HYDRA can track the bus. Quick work. What about the SAT radio? I noticed the bus has a communication system, so I decrypted it and synchronized it with this.
- We have to be ready for anything. - On my command. I was so sure. I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing. No, she's building it here, just not in this world.
I want Darkhold. - What? No! No one else is gonna read the damn book. I don't want to read it.
- What? No! No one else is gonna read the damn book. I don't want to read it. I want to use it as bait.
To4ka Translate Did you sleep here? I'm getting used to the new office. You think a bike rack will look good on this wall? You hang a bike rack here, and your first free case will be defending itself after I shove it up your ass.
- Thank you, Katrina. You're welcome. I won't interrupt. All I'm saying is, I feel like you're in a hurry. I mean, when you overthrow a dictator, you don't leave his statue in the square. You tear it the hell down.
We hurried. We were deceived. You were right, William. He found someone who looked like him, and he killed him. So he took the bullet out of his shoulder and put it in the body.
Jeff! We gotta go. Where's your car? What, you didn't bring your car? Yes, Matthews, the valet will be right with it.
Where's your car? What, you didn't come in your car? Yes, Matthews, the valet will be right with it. No, I didn't bring my car. You and Lara Croft drove it out the front gate.
On the beach. Far away. Can't you hear it? Listen! Is that the maximum volume the cousin can get? Can't he turn it up?
You would literally be left with nothing - no house, no cool motorcycle. You had to think fast. You knew where Nadine's car was. You also knew she kept a gun in the car. And after the murder, you put the gun and Julie's bloody scarf in Nadine's car, then pushed it into the sea.
- Be nice, Susie. I don't know his name. White, dark hair, bad leg. Oh, yeah. He broke it.
So... In this little book, we have a list of your clients. Now, Todd 13 had a pretty big shipment. You supplied him with various drugs the day Julie Anne died. I've never seen this little book before. One of your cops must have planted it.
- That sounds amazing! So, kids, can I leave you alone for a couple hours? He wants to have an egg sandwich with me. -I met a man, a gentleman, at the city market and at the zoo. He has a hard life, and we'll discuss it over an egg sandwich.
That should get my former team's attention, and when they come back to rescue him, I'll be waiting for them with open arms. Not too open arms, I hope. No, don't worry, Mr. Thawne. I have no lingering attachments. In that case, kill them all, take their part of the Spear of Destiny and bring it to me.
Wynn's device worked. But Supergirl's still in there. We're running out of time, Agent Danvers. The positronic cannon is ready to fire. You need to use it.
Do you hear that music? Is it playing here? Oh, my God. Thank you. But I can still hear it.
My brain is overloaded. Why a phone booth? - I already told you. I know it's a disguise. But why leave it like that?
I know it's a disguise. But why leave it like that? Why do you like it? Who says I like it? It's not like you changed it.
Hence, if light is only a wave, then.... Space isn't empty? Exactly. And like sound waves, light waves must travel through a medium in space. Scientists call it ether, an invisible but all-encompassing substance that permeates the universe.
- How do you know? - From the governor of the Central Bank. - Really? - Nigeria's oil industry is weaker than officially reported. It could be blown away by the wind.
A couple of times, I did a guy a favor. He comes in here. with an envelope or something, and I hide it in the church, and I call the other guy and let him know it's there. Go on. About two weeks ago, I was supposed to leave an envelope, uh. with a letter to a POW camp. Call him. let him know you got another package for him, he's supposed to pick it up today.
The last two semesters. I rewrote them for you. Keep them. Hopefully. They'll help me undo what I've done. И... If you want my help, I'll be happy to give it to you.
What if instead of gassing up, we studied a cup of coffee? You really need to get some sleep, Albert. Jacob Vant-Goff's 1901 paper. Particles in solution behave like a gas. When sugar dissolves in coffee, the water surrounds the glucose and pulls it out of the sugar crystal, right?
Unless... It's not Maxwell that's been defeated, it's Newton. What are you talking about? Time is not absolute. Jesus Christ. I'll write the article, Michele, please ignore it.
So you're saying he might have gotten on someone's nerves. I'm not sure, but, uh. I just wasn't listening. I was supposed to calm him down, and I indulged him. Okay, every article he worked on, printed or not, you need a copy.
God, I don't think I'd want that. I mean, there's another part of me, you know. What, the vampire part? The undying part. If you could have it, would you want it?
Consider it done, sir. - Call off the missile. - Call it off. It's already launched! - Then redirect it.
It's already running! - Then reroute it. - Where-- What do we do? Where do we send it?
Please, Emma, get us out of here. I'll try. I promise. Do you still have the SIM card? Can you give it to Yusef's nephew that you met?
- It won't be long now. You'll do great. Drinks? Would you like to see Linda's room? I'd like to show it to you.
- (liv) Which was stolen from Devon's house, completely suppressing his positive energy. - (babino) This witness just I.D.'d you. Oh, and another thing. The beer bottle you were sipping on the first time we met. I pulled it out of the trash, and guess whose DNA is on it?
You're welcome. - (Watson) What the fuck? - (Cindy) Hey, bring it over here. Oh, shit! Thank you for your help, I appreciate it.
What the fuck is wrong with you? Everything, I guess. Where'd you get a goddamn gun? I don't know. He brought it.
Good God, you don't eat at all? Nobody eats with this war. You need to rest, you're exhausted. The solution to relativity is just around the corner. I almost touched it.
Albert. Nobel Prize winner in chemistry. That's something. I'm not a genius like you, Albert. I was just given a problem, and I found a way to solve it.
I have a proposition for you. I can't afford to make it in public. You can be assured of my discretion. Have you read the article exposing relativity? I think you support it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Einstein. Questions for your husband. How did you meet Chaim Weizmann? It's okay, Haim, you can admit you don't understand. Albert, you've been explaining relativity for over three hours, and I'm pretty sure you understand it.
Yeah, but then we don't know exactly where she is. Does that make sense? No, sir. - Of course not. According to my colleague, the particle doesn't exist at all. Not until we see it.
But we can measure the velocity of the second particle. And since they are mathematically related, we can determine the velocity of the first particle. And we'll know both its velocity and its location without a direct determination. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle refuted by certainty. You lose, sir. - But... What if the action of measuring the first particle affects the second particle and somehow changes it during the measurement?
She had a strategy. I'm not Elsa. Yes, you are. You only show enthusiasm for hiding the phone from me. You haven't seen her, have you?
- Albert, we've discussed this many times. - No, no, no, no. Yes. That's different. It seems that the more physicists accept my theory, the more you deny it.
McKee. By doubting the Bureau's credibility, you're doubting my credibility. And that kind of doubt Could get you into a lot of trouble. Give Einstein a word and he'll be sunk by the patriotic citizens of this great country. It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and only a moment to destroy it.
Pour it out. I'll be there in a minute. - It's my song. - I know it's your song. - I love it.
I'll be there in a minute. - It's my song. - I know it's your song. - I love it. - And you sing it so well.
Uh-oh. Vincent has his own strategy. Does she know? Rosie, show Mr. Dunbar Jr. the door. Don't open it.
This is a literary club, right? - I wrote a book. "Hold the Helm Tight." - That's right. I devoured it in one sitting.
But let's not talk about prison, let's talk about peace. - Well, I'm having trouble with municipal bonds. - I'm aware of that. They gave the gaming license to someone else. You want it back.
Your armor is genetically locked so no one else can use it. You want to know how I found you? No. Not anymore. I guessed the instant drive was transmitting a subspace signal. The key was to find a frequency to jam it.
Their leader? Is he a friend of yours? I like him. Why didn't you tell us before? I wanted to, but they trusted me with their secret, and I felt there was no harm in keeping it.
It would take advanced intelligence to recognize it, and it would take approximately 87,560 hours to decipher. Ten years. Roughly. However, there are illogical aspects to this puzzle that are better approached with an intuitive approach. So the fastest person to decipher it is the one with android logic and emotional intelligence?
Imagine they are in danger. They turn to you for help, but the situation looks hopeless, when suddenly.... You discover a technology that could change everything. What would you do to get it? Anything. Now imagine you had that technology, a way to save your people, but someone took it away from you.
2-AYA: Android, Fifth, how's it going in there? We've made a few changes to the instant engine that should supposedly neutralize the damage done by Ishida's scientists. How do we know for sure? First we run a full diagnostic. Then we run a series of simulations. If there's any instability left, we'll be able to detect it long before we test it in real life.
Oh, shit. So much for the "easy ride." Why? It's not my fault. She said the station was abandoned, not destroyed. Apparently, when Novina had to abandon the station, they decided to flood it.
I understand. But they can't imagine what you'll have to do to save the Ishida house. Unlike me. If you want to take my life. I'll give it to you gladly. Knowing that I did it for the good of the Empire.
I would say "the one and only," but lately that hasn't been the case. What's going on in there? Access to the system is blocked. Apparently, their android installed some kind of protection. I can bypass it, but I need to get to the bridge.
Sounds awful, doesn't it? No, not at all. It's not easy to replace an entire world, you know. Why didn't you tell me that time on Hyperion 8? What was I supposed to say? "You had a good family, but you blew it"?
When my comrade Boone woke up, he said it was a portal. He also said he could hear voices. Maybe he does. He was possessed by a creature like that. We were able to get it out, but what if it was affecting him?
You can disarm the warhead before impact. We've got a man down there. CAPTAIN ARASHI: We have men there too, "Raza." But we were given orders from above. There's nothing we can do. If you don't disarm the bomb, we'll be forced to shoot it down.
What's this? It's a roller key. - Yeah. Talked to my cousin brother who works for the police. Picked it up from the vault. Sorry, I tried to get your bomb, but it got blown up.
- Here, come on. - Untie it, untie it. It's the water. Over the years, the water has absorbed the moissanite. You drink it, you grow crops.
What was that? You were using a protomolecule on children. What were you doing? We made the protomolecule do what we wanted it to do. We modeled it in our own image.
We'll see about that. Here it is. In the agro-dome. Turn on the FTL and give me control. Why kill it?
The IMCF is providing a corridor for the incoming ship. Those scientists packed up to leave with that thing. Apparently, it was their transportation. They're not gonna be happy when they find out their lab rat escaped. All the more reason to destroy it.
It is instantly absorbed through the skin, leaving no residue. Cardiac arrest. An act of God. This stuff was amazingly effective. But the Brussels Act banned it.
Cardiac arrest. God's Providence. That thing was amazingly effective. But the Brussels Act banned it. But, as you can see, I used it anyway.
I gotta go. Get some rest. - Hall! - Sandycote will not be getting a gaming license. The commission has decided to give it to a town in the Catskill Mountains.
He makes decisions that if you confront them, the whole universe fucking explodes. But that's an exaggeration. Derivatives. They can't describe the indescribable truth. Or express what I'm feeling. It's no lie to say that Bobby Axelrod is the man who gave me life. Or kept it alive.
- At the end of the year? - No, now. Extra bonus. Normal bonus up front. - Move their desk closer to the Beemer? - Good for a head of analytics who understands the job and is willing to do it.
That's why mom sold the horse. Write it down. What? No, no, no. Your father sold it to get the IRS off his back.
- May I, please? - Well, since you're asking. I want to say something about my paella. It's so good, what happens when you taste it, Will? I want to take her to church and marry her, Rog.
Okay, that's-- That's it! What do you want me to say, Selina? What do you want me to say, Tom? That when I was in the Senate, I only supported S-473 because I was in love with you? That when we were in Los Angeles and we walked out on that stage to accept the party nomination and you grabbed my hand and raised it high in the air, I thought, "Oh my God, he's holding my hand."
But I'd like to tell you a story. It's one of my favorite memories of the south. That day my father took me rabbit hunting for the first time. I have to tell you, the rifle was bigger than me. I was quite fragile and tiny. But the second amendment definitely guaranteed my right to use it.
I certainly have nothing to apologize for. Okay, look, politicians borrow things from other politicians all the time. - Personal stories? - Absolutely. I think you should be flattered that I thought your story was special enough to use.
Blaine had it in a couple days. - (Major) Okay. (Ravi) You know, I had a whole speech prepared. Sincere and funny. Deep. But what's the point if you're gonna forget it anyway?
Seems to me those kids would do anything to get out of the house. - I mean, Mia came by quite often. - Yeah? Why is that? Her parents took the rent in cash. She'd take it, so you wouldn't find that in the books, you know.
How is that any consolation? The money will come with a note saying she's dead. Look, there's no way we're gonna bring that poor girl back to life. - I know, but, uh. - Even with the help of a voodoo witch who flies in from Haiti every year, at great expense, for Grandma's birthday and shakes her sad fuckin' face! So the best we can do is stuff the car full of dynamite and push it off a cliff.
- Why are you doing this? Oh, my God, they're raiding our building. Okay, Professor, let's get out of here. No, there's a Lumen in there. The book will be fine, they'll never find it.
Keep your head down. I was a fool. Now I realize that what's easy to get can be just as easy to lose. The book is safe, Professor. We'll come back and get it as soon as we get out of here.
I think the sick leave was good for him. I'm not going on sick leave. Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend hurt you, and then tried to inject you with poison. I think you deserve a couple days of sick leave. You've been working on that leopard tattoo for two weeks. maybe Sandstorm didn't put it on Jane because it's a bummer.
Stepulov targeted Erin because I used his son. No, not just your daughter. There's hundreds more civilians, people from all over the country. It was his plan all along. And he timed the attack so he could call it off if his son survived, or not if he didn't...
Attached to the rack is a converted cell phone. Incoming call triggers an explosion. Okay. (cell phone ringing) If I can override the cell tower signal, the bomb won't go off. 90 seconds, how do we stop it?
What's "our formula"? Okay, between you and me, it's an old Daedalus tradition. It's a risk-benefit algorithm we use to determine what kinds of risks are worth taking. Cheating on exams, shoplifting...unprotected sex..... all kinds of fun stuff. But some graduates also use it in life after college to justify some shady business dealings.
Are you serious? Check out his harness. That's Willy Wonka's golden ticket. It opens every door in this building. That's great, but how are you gonna get it?
Anybody anything... Nothing. Ron? Was it that bad? I have to say that when Olivia disappeared and Kevin decided to finance the play himself instead of the one who wrote it, I said to myself Ron, man, you won three Tonys and here you are, directing a failed sitcom, a project where actors disappear.
That's not what this is about. I literally ruined my entire life for this play. That's why I'm here, sir. And the crazy thing is, it's really good, it is. But no one's coming to see it unless you tell them, so I'm begging you, please. give us another chance.
See? Fresh meat. You can go in and pick out a chicken. - He kills the chicken. - What? He plucks it, washes it, and then he wraps it up for you.
All right, well, let's go over the plan. - All right. Uh-huh. - The bartender's an old man. He's not very smart. Every night at 9:30, he starts closing his shift. He opens the register and pulls out the cash so Ray and his guys can pick it up later.
No, I want to sing. They're gonna make good decisions. It's just a meeting with the director, okay? - It doesn't mean I'm gonna get the part. - Don't be like that. I want you to get it.
Valliere. Thanks to his information, we learned of a secret Allied training base in Canada known as Camp X. Why haven't you approached anyone with your plan to act as a triple agent? As a precaution against potentially disloyal elements within our own ranks. The safest course of action was to get as much information as possible to begin with, then send it directly to Berlin.
You know what the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia is? - The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it. That's the problem. It takes you away from reality. The disease convinces you that you don't have it.
Heard about the hand. Congratulations. Sherman, don't jinx it. It won't be mine for two days. In East Peck, if no one claims a body part for two weeks, you can keep it.
Our situation is not "intolerable." It is "intolerable." Aunt Josephine has left us in the care of Captain Sham, and I don't know how to fix it. I wish we hadn't read that note to Mr. Poe. We could tear it up and write a new one in Auntie's handwriting, with no mention of--
Count Olaf didn't break into Aunt Josephine's house. He disguised himself and Aunt Josephine fell for his hook, line and sinker. Please, Klaus, this is no time for fishing jokes. There's a very easy way to determine who wrote the note. We'll just compare it to your Aunt Josephine's handwriting.
1957. We are. That's how Olivia found out. It's all over that map. If anyone sees it.
The painting's on its way back from Austria. But the auction is tomorrow. We're not going to exhibit it. It's being offered to a private collection. But if two buyers are interested in it, I have to show it.
Shall we steal it before the auction? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Olivia will smell trouble. She has to buy the painting without us knowing we're here. We'll get it another way.
Here's to the Brigadefuhrer. I don't like vodka. It burns your throat. - Haha! - I didn't like it either. But since I've been working in Poland, I've learned to like it.
Shall we begin? While you are waiting, have you heard the story of the poor woodcutter and his wife? I don't think I have. One day the poor woodcutter and his wife found a crane caught in a net. Taking pity on the bird, they freed it from its bonds.
You had access to the timer. My brother was a paratrooper. Died in Kandahar. You really think wearing this on my arm I'd embarrass his victim by giving classified information to terrorists? I don't think you gave it away.
My brother was a paratrooper. Died in Kandahar. You really think wearing this on my arm I'd embarrass his victim by giving classified information to terrorists? I don't think you gave it away. I think you sold it.
- Names don't matter. What matters is that we both have something the other needs. I propose a trade. You want to see your colleague alive again, bring our system to Cornerstone Park, east exit, in half an hour. And make sure you bring it in one piece, or for every missing piece, I'll cut a piece off Agent Nawabi.
Father Brown did it. Catherine warned me about him. Said he was corrupt, evil, selfish. Father Brown is the nicest man I've ever met. And if you say another bad word about him, I'll shove your stupid plaque where no one can read it.
Why was he digging a hole? He was burying something. A wooden box. It was a nice, carved thing. Anyway, he didn't want it, so I waited until he left and then I dug it up.
Look at her. I can dream, can't I? Not for long. Otherwise the inspector will suspect where I've been. A man was seen burying it in the woods yesterday morning.
Hello, I'm Bunty. You're so cute. Oh, thank you. I like your hat. Well, you can borrow it from me whenever you want.
You're so cute. Thank you. I like your hat. Well, you can borrow it from me whenever you want. You should wear it to one of my parties.
- Is this your memoir? - Yes. I finished my book. It's a story about my sisters. I called it "Dark Child (Black Orphan)."
What the hell happened to me? I promise I'll tell you everything, but only in person. Roman, check your pocket. There's a coin in there, a very special coin. I gave it to you when we were kids.
It's mostly vascular repair. I'll check for organ damage. I'll take care of the extremities. I'm concerned about her right leg. She severed it pretty badly.
The neighbor called 911, and the fire department opened the gate. Look, they saved your life. Damn barbed wire. I took most of it off, and then I fell down the stairs into a barbed pile. You took it off?
Look, Not-Doctor Grey, I don't care what you did. Dr. Grey found my tumor. She told me about it. She held my hand while I cried. She told me how she was gonna remove it.
I'm sure there's more to it than that. Well, what Bailey did is wrong. You can't just put someone in charge of general surgery. Kepner's good, but Grey's done a lot for this job, right? She deserves it.
At the cost of her own life? She came in here feeling fine. If you'd found the stenosis a minute later, we wouldn't even be having this discussion. He would've had the kidney by now. Yeah, but he didn't, and if we don't give it to her soon, she'll die and no one will have it, so who are we giving it to?
You keep saying, "I'm Avery, I'm Avery," but it's not true, not in the way you're trying. The name doesn't mean anything. It's the person who bears it that matters. Yes, I took your father's last name, but only what I, wearing it, did, what I, wearing it, accomplished.
You'll get a call from this firm in a couple hours with a good deal on the Kendall case. Yeah, I agree. You just need to know that one of the lawyers discovered a key piece of evidence that solved the case, and she just got fired. You forgot. Give it to someone who needs it.
The interrogator is just trying to make it easier for the deceiver to admit the truth, that's all. So you tend to minimize crime? Yes. According to Mr. Diardian's testimony, he explained to the suspect that the theft wasn't the problem. They just wanted to investigate it.
Your Honor, I'd like to cross-examine. This is not a full trial. This is just a motion to recuse. Yes, I know, but this information just came to us. We were hoping to use it at trial, but we think we can save the court a lot of time and money if we use it now.
Oh, great. Phil passed out. - Claire. - They would have found out anyway. I didn't spend $15 on a picture to hide it.
This contract. Confirmation of transfer of 12 eggs from Lake Drive. Lab confirmation of one egg transfer to you. And why do you need an egg? Client wants to fertilize her.
Lab confirmation of one egg transfer to you. And what do you want the egg for? The client wants to fertilize it. Alas, there's a problem. Have you destroyed it yet?
Laura, the problem is. the last egg has already been fertilized. By who? That's the question. We don't know. We traced it to Chicago Poly-Tech, the genetics lab, and we're subpoenaing them.
Thank you. That was fantastic. You were fantastic. Did you see his face when you asked him to read the date? You made him read it.
Basically, some people are just better at something than others. Coding makes you realize that. The number 7 is the number 7. Calling it a digit 8 doesn't make it a digit 8, it just makes it confusing.
You could have protected yourself. - Please don't. ...and instead you protected me. You gave me this job. You earned it.
Rutger... ate Josh's beluga. Wait, this squiggly thing is a fish? Draw waves on top so it's underwater. That's a good idea. - It doesn't matter, the fish wasn't underwater when he ate it.
I can't believe I gave away all the money. If it's any consolation, you haven't been yourself lately. Yeah. I gotta ask-- what's the last thing you remember? I was in New Mexico for work, went into a Navajo gift shop. I saw a beautiful buckle, and I picked it up. next thing I know, I woke up strapped to a gurney next to you.
It's a chevral something. It's expensive, so it must be good. I didn't expect you and your, uh. deadly light would be back so soon. Something's been bothering me. When you first saw my wound, you asked me if Lucifer did it.
About the car bomb. It's like his guards were told where to look. - And you think I told him? - No one else knew. Except the bomb maker and the mechanic who planted it.
Maybe he will. How? The police radio is on the same frequency as Maggie's hearing aid, which could cause interference. Switch to 154.4 and turn it on. Keep it on.
I doused Nikolai's shoes to scare away the bullies at daycare. - Did it work? - No, now they're calling him a pussy. He's in even worse shape. But wolf urine will definitely deter rats. We'll use it to trap them.
Okay? You may have a broken wrist. I think we're gonna need a splint. The main first aid kit's in the ship's kitchen. - I can get it.
Plus, I was in the hallway. I figured I should move a huge, horrible tumor or something. - I have a huge, horrible tumor. - What? I was up all night studying it, and I think I found a way out.
Of course she does. You don't know? I'm a faggot. God's love is everywhere. We must embrace it.
covered you with a blanket and left you alone to fall asleep. - Let me touch your hand. - No. I want to show you that nothing happened. I'll touch it and let it go.
Are you wearing my jacket? Yes! We're twins! No, that's not how it works! You told me where you bought it.
I know our enmity is as old as the world and can be insurmountable. But I call upon both our armies to become allies for one moment and cease firing so that the wounded can be taken from the battlefield. Perhaps there will come a day when courage will leave us, when we will forget our friendship and break the bonds of brotherhood, but today is not that day. And perhaps by showing our humanity. We can save her.
Rude! All right, ladies. Star City is very grateful to you. It's our job, Mr. Mayor. Yeah, but you do it so well, so classy.
I'll never stop fighting. Of course you will. Kill her. Dispose of the body. But I'll take the mask to add to my collection.
You know what? You both need to listen, put all your bullshit aside. This girl's situation with the kid, and you're cleaning up the mess, and you're looking for that John Doe. When something bad happens, we try to take control of the situation. But sometimes it's better to leave a person with their pain for a while. Get over it, you know?
No. Apologize to the principal for me. - I'm listening. - She has to keep working. Three days ago you laughed when we suggested surgery, and now you're suggesting we put her in a cage with a lion?
It's getting late. Please be seated. Gentlemen, you have devised a plan to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. We learned of it from a French citizen you tricked into your actions. We could use this information, sell it to the Iranian authorities.
I think he gave her a gift. A ring. They left together on a motorcycle. I love this job. I just want to do it well.
You said you had a case. Your government's witness protection program had a list stolen. Do you know the thief? No, but I know who's gonna steal it next. A luxury car stolen in Atlanta was relentlessly monitored by mercenaries guarding it.
- That doesn't happen. - Yes, it does! Like a good wine. Jesus Christ! I can't wait to get back to Cheesik. Yeah, 'cause London piss is like soda, you just drink it again.
That's the thing. We don't know what happened, right? Maybe somebody slipped, and the shoe came off. Maybe an old gentleman with Alzheimer's. Goes for a walk and doesn't know where he left it.
Jacqueline, someone somewhere has lost a shoe, and if I can bring that shoe and the person together, I've accomplished my goal. David. Let's pretend for a second. Let's say I'm the one who lost the shoe. I go back to look for it, but it's not there because of you, you took it back to the house.
We need to track down that man in the Panama hat. I agree. I'm gonna hit some hat stores. Hat stores? He bought it somewhere, right?
"A tragedy for her, and for me, an amazing path to deliverance." That's interesting. Do you think this book could be connected to the murder? It's possible. If Mrs. Rudge read it, she knew the show was staged and could have canceled it.
And that you borrowed our priceless oil lamp to determine value. Well, I thought you'd be okay with that, considering it's a criminal matter. So? He tried to deceive me. He claimed that your oil lamp wasn't Robert Harper's, that Robert didn't give it to you himself.
I have no idea. He's an agricultural expert. Did he tell you anything about insects? No. He knows about wheat and what can kill it.
He'll be fine. Elizabeth, how's he taking it? The same way I do... it's frustrating. So am I. Well, if it turns out to be some kind of super wheat, I think getting it would be good for us.
A documentary series about the Larry Henderson court case. Carol Ann Keane believes Larry's missing cane was the murder weapon. Tries to find it like a dog trying to find a bone.
A documentary series about the Larry Henderson court case. Carol Ann Keane believes Larry's missing cane was the murder weapon. Tries to find it like a dog tries to find a bone. Ironically, Larry's dog finds it, mistaking it for a bone.
In fact, my wife has never been happier. I'd like to remind you that I'm offering a 50,000 reward to anyone who finds the murder weapon, Larry Henderson's murder cane. In fact, if it's the murder weapon, we should give it to the prosecution. They won't find anything on the cane, will they, Larry? I told you, it was probably buried by a dog.
Well, let's go, come on. It's going to be expensive to drain this lake. Of course, you can always take a dip and find the club yourself, but I wouldn't recommend it. I'm not afraid of you. We'll find a way to get it.
They're standing up for something far more important than themselves, and that takes courage. And you showed courage, too. I didn't do anything. Yes, you did. Despite all the mess you've been dealing with, you demanded the truth, and you accepted it.
- No, but I've seen them rearrange your book 39 times. If the time loop exists, then I agree with Sarah Connor, "There is no destiny but the one we make for ourselves." Okay, I'll grab your book. I'll find it myself.
Is that with the cactus? Not cactus, Murray, it's with the cactus. Chief, why aren't we drilling? There's water in the ground. For God's sake, let's get it out of there,
Fred? Does that sound like the actions of a sane person? But I'm not the judge of that, am I? David Morgan founded this colony. And now he's leading it to ruin.
- Aah! I just remembered this has been in my car for weeks. Only waxes can kill you. I'll get you another one. Aldous was so proud to publish this book, and yet P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.
You know your power. You've used it your whole life. I always thought I was, uh. divinely lucky. Yeah, you used it instinctively, but now I'm here. I can teach you how to control it.
Doesn't that smell racist? Racist? You can't portray African-Americans as that shade of black! That's the first time it's offended anyone. How many black people has she seen?
You can't portray African Americans with that shade of black! This is the first time it's offended anyone. How many black people has she seen? I haven't had any African-American guests. So of those who have seen it, I have the darkest skin and I'm the most offended?
We don't need him. We need his energy. - You're born with great energy, you die with even more, especially a demigod. That's why we're here, people, for the energy. Right now, he's just a leather sack hiding it from us.
Execute him. No. But I'm flattered you want to. We'll throw the note back into the dirty dishes. He'll find it and lead us to F-rati's camp.
try to understand. Listen. What don't I understand? Explain it to me. Explain to you that it's very hard to take your whole life and throw it away?
And it would be a shame if it ended right here. They kidnapped my brother. And they're gonna kill him if I don't pay up. So let me help you, okay? But let's start by you putting your gun down before I take it away and feed it to you.
It's supposed to raise your heart rate and relax you at the same time. - Oh, my God. - Uh-huh. Should I close the door? I think you should open it a little in case I need to be revived.
He has a consciousness. It's Wild West World. Hold on, Sarge. I don't see that room. Let me find it.
Definitely. To pick up so many men, do you think she could have made a mistake and picked the wrong one? While the sketch artist paints the portraits, another first-class passenger is due at the station later. No. I'm going to a party with my boyfriend, and I can't miss it.
Flynn jumped to Sacramento in the present. Spent about an hour there, then jumped back to 1780 New York. I don't get it. How can Flynn jump without a break? Vegas atomic bomb. If he's using it as a battery.
The monks are not our friends. They've taken over the Earth and made humans slaves. They hold power through a powerful transmitter...broadcasting myths and lies that they've always been here. In fact, they've only been here a few months and have distorted and falsified our history. Our mission is to interrupt their broadcast and replace it with the true history of Earth...which will weaken and undermine the power of the monks.

Uh, Lieutenant. I heard you found a sensor on Kelly's car, and that it was installed by carjackers. Yeah, my team is looking into it, but we still don't have enough to release. - Why? - Well, the carjackers may have put the sensor on Kelly's car, intending to steal it later.
I agree. There's a toxic air filtration system in here. It runs every half hour. It'll release bacteria into the atmosphere. Turn it off.
- Why? - You lied. You stole our trip. It was our family tradition, and you may think it's stupid, but it's ours. And tonight, we're gonna get it back.
We have a couple more questions. Starting with, uh. why is Dan's missing painting for sale here? This is the first time Lady Wellin Marsapple, heroine of the Ogden Tweedlehut series, has appeared in print. And who says she's missing? Dan bet me she was.
These arrests are my arrests, too. And this is about both of us, okay? You made a mistake, a big one. But you're gonna figure out a way to live with it. And every day you keep doing your job, you're gonna do it right.
Really? I guess I have a lot to catch up on. All right, JP, what do you got? Sir, the victim's purse was found here. I've been going through it.
Enjoying the book, sir? Very much. Did you enjoy it too, Dwayne? Me? Yeah, what did you think when you first read it?
Yeah, the note move wasn't bad. The fact that it only had Esther's fingerprints on it is very resourceful. And we already knew Esther was helping you organize the festival. I'm sure there were tons of papers with her prints on them. All you had to do was use gloves to pick up the sheet, type the note and sign it.
It must have been pretty easy to get a copy of Esther's signature. And then all you had to do was plant a fake note in her purse after you killed her. But as resourceful as it was, the suicide note also exposed you. It was typed, which means it somehow didn't inspire confidence. And also the fact that Esther's signature was in Byro's pen, not the fountain pen she always used, confirmed that she didn't write the note or sign it.
And I heard you took care of him yourself. - I did, sir. - Uh, good. Sir, I'd like to renew my application for field training. I'll review it as soon as I catch up.
OK! Good. Alistair thought his classroom education made him a genius - always making "improvements" in the process without telling anyone. After the fire, I discovered he had changed the system. The pipe cracked, Robert tried to fix it, but, yes, the fire was Alistair's fault.
Archer knows the truth. I can't live knowing what I did to you, and knowing you'll find out the truth, I can't live with that guilt. Goodbye, son. Love, Dad." When you found the note and read it, you realized exactly what had happened.
All bodies are good. Yeah. What do you mean? You love "Game of Thrones." I mean, you uploaded a cut of all the nude scenes and called it "scenes to plot"... which was very clever.
Okay. He strapped Wonder Woman to the rocket. The D.A. said he tied her up, but if he did, where's the rope, Teddy? - Where's the rope? - Find it.
So twenty minutes ago we offered it to them.... They turned it down? Absolutely not. Petrov doesn't want us to see what's on board. I realize it's a difficult decision, but lives are at stake, and if we arrive with help, Petrov will have to accept it.
If they do. We deprive them of their trump card - the supposed reliability of the armed forces. It's cases like this that decide elections. Whatever the cost, it's worth it. Get the tape and check it out.
She had several broken bones and significant burns on the right side of her body. On her body, we found glass and metal shards and fragments of skin. Maybe the remains of a suitcase? Maybe she was carrying a bomb. Carrying it?
Reproductive manipulation? Demeter is trying to fertilize an egg outside the womb? - I don't know how successful. You could ask her, though. She'd be happy to discuss her work with someone who understands it.
I understand. I want to help. Thank you. Just to clarify. the last couple of days, you were all with Mr. Lewis and Ms. Boyd on their boat? Yes, we rented it for the week.
Then you should know. It was found on the boat where Mr. Lewis was killed. My uncle collected cufflinks, he had about 100 pairs. I know it doesn't seem that unusual, except he only had one hand. Yeah. He lost it.
If the Flagship falls into the hands of Rittenhouse... ANTHONY: It's too dangerous. Flynn. Apparently, he recognized the one trying to do the right thing. Help me steal a time machine to save my wife. RUFUS: He's got her back, no damage!
It's okay. Scully. Are you upset about Cindy or do you feel at home in a body bag? We're using the same medicated powder. I smelled it.
She just shot him. He's dead. I have diplomatic immunity. And this purse is the property of the diplomatic mission. You're legally obligated to give it back to me. She's right.
The truth. I cherish it. I didn't kill your accountant. Your deal was falling apart. Then I stepped in and intercepted it.
Honestly, it's great. I've been thinking about what you said, about why I need this. Honestly, I still don't know. But I do know that this family is the most important thing in my life. I don't want to lose it.
Ogre. "Ogres aren't real"? I don't know, looks human. Okay, I have a theory. That stupid story about the bear in the woods, you made that up, right?
Okay, so there are three council members alive, including Al-Khatib, the dude with the money. He might know about John's plans. Where do we find him, Rachel? You can eliminate the council, John, but we still need protection. We'll get it.
When I get back, we'll talk. We're coming with you. - What's going on? - Our friend Calvin tried to jump up and pull the fire escape down. He grabbed it, but it fell on top of him.
I've got 10 cases here that I haven't even read yet. Oh, thank you. I had some medical records in here somewhere. You want to see it? Save it.
There was a Latino thing. But you know how it is. Nobody saw anything. What happened to the gun? I never found it.
But you know how it is. Nobody saw anything. What happened to the gun? I never found it. They must have taken it after they shot him.
The one circled. "Kimball Factory: Child sex den"? The article was published a few weeks ago on the Anders Report website. I printed it out.
Well, it's not perfect, but it'll do. Yeah. Thank you. And, you know, I, uh. I know you didn't ask, but this Palmer thing, whether you accept it or not,
- Mr. Beckett also signed an affidavit stating that he was under the influence of phenylcyclidine and fell down the stairs accidentally. Mr. Beckett. Thank you, Your Honor. Rodney, how's your hand? I still can't quite get it straight.
It's a timing device. You take a paper bag, you fill it with oxidizer-- cat litter or chlorine. Then you take a light bulb, you fill it with fuel-- gasoline, vegetable oil, whatever. See the hole? That's where you fill it up.
Enough! All resources are being utilized. Even the city attorney's on his way. The DEA has information for us. We can hear it, or we can yell at each other.
I know it's a small apartment, but I think we can find a place. No, Sheldon. We're not buying a full-size Spider-Man statue. We do still have Sheldon's old room. If he really needs a place to live, I think we should offer it to him.
We have to deal with it. We need to fix her. Cure her, okay? The answer's in here somewhere. We're gonna find it.
- Ma'am! - Son! Let them work. Let them work. We gotta get her out.
I'm not going anywhere and I'm not leaving you. I knew you'd be here. I knew you'd find me. You've been following me. Well. Journalism may be dead in America, but where I come from, if you want to find a story, you have to go and find it.
I thought you were a gym teacher! Oh, my God! Is that my money? - Give me the card! - I don't have it.
- Give me the card! - I don't have it. - Give me the goddamn card! - I wouldn't do that! I don't have it with me!
- Give me the goddamn card! - I wouldn't do that! I don't have it with me! It's at the post office. I sent it to your wife.
That's where you're wrong. You think everyone cares about the truth, but that's a relic of the past. No one wants boring facts. They want a good story. And the better the story. The more faith they have in the person telling it.
All of us trapped in this bunker, we're the ones Shepard wants to use. "Truman protocol." Phase two is us. - No, no, no, no. Phase two of the attack has already happened. We stopped it.
Captain Holt's mother. Creator. Widowed at 39, Laverne Kinnebrew Holt single-handedly raised two children and still managed to become the first black female federal judge. Somebody read her wikipedia page. No, Jake, I wrote it.
Shame. - Blind? This room is swanky. It's like a Swedish airport. Everyone's gonna love it.
Hysterical. - You're the hysterical one, asshole! - No, you! - Gina, as you know, my pen gets its nib changed in Germany. Yes, and that's not up for discussion. And because of her absence, I took Amy's favorite pen, and I lost it. lost it.
- Santiago! You did it! - And you're sick of listening to fucking classical music all day. It's too loud! We can all hear it!
Because I'm a rebel and we're in love. It's obvious. Diaz, I've been calling you. Why didn't you pick up? I don't have one.
Okay. Let's close the tab. Here's the article. Hawkins drove you out of New York and took your life. If you help us, maybe we can give it back to you.
- He won't leave her side. - I did. Horse cancer. Your meeting with Emily is about to start. She wants to hold it in her office.
There's no hope anymore. No. There is hope. It's everywhere. I've seen it. Everyone you've met, the people you've helped.
A letter arrives from some service: "You must come, and..." No, I mustn't - I'll kill myself. You can do that. Just once. And here's the interesting thing: even when life is bad, people usually choose it over nothing.
- Do you know anything about a dog? - He's afraid of pennies. So we think someone threw handfuls of coins in his face. That's it. So you just take this strange dog and you let it into your house with your family! And you watch her character unfold.
- Anyway, here's what we need you to do. We need you to teach the kids math. - Wow! They want to know math? You have to force them to do math against their will.
And violating the nondisclosure agreement could get you expelled from the board, and if we find out that you did it... - No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you. Like you said, I exploited a loophole. Because I'm a good lawyer, and I'm also an ethical lawyer. So if this firm is getting inside information from Pearson-Specter, they're not getting it from me.
I signed a treaty that says I will not interfere. I can't cross that line. - Jesus Christ, Mike. Are you saying you care more about some signed piece of paper than these people's lives? No, I'm not, but I signed it.
I only listen to a third of what you say. Hi. - Hey. Hey. - I just realized I never asked how the meeting at the Plaza went. I canceled it.
How do you know? Because I didn't spend all morning practicing my kissing skills. Then you also know that lockwood environmental division has only been around for three months. They stole the technology. Which is why you have to sign a contract with me so I can get it back.
Lockwood is putting out solar panels? Since when are they in the renewable energy business? Since they stole Galvadain's technology. That can't be right. They didn't steal it.
It can't be. They didn't steal it. How do you know? Because there's only six people capable of that kind of work, and if any of them did, I'd know. Well, they got it somehow, and I need to know how.
It doesn't matter, Louis. We can charge any client for it, right? Cause nobody cares about anything but making money. Mike, what happened? What happened is the only reason I came back was because of my deal with Harvey, and within a week, he's tearing it up.
Mr. Smiles doesn't see it that way. Maybe he would have if he hadn't been buried. - What's the Duke's complaint? - A small tumor. Thinks it's time to remove it.
I don't know exactly. I just remember getting there. I remember the orange carpet. And that song. Frankie. he played it over and over and over and over.
Hopefully something good, I only have four hours to sleep. Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh. Cora. That song changed something in her. When she hears it, something happens.
I've been brought here to be punished? Not at all. I have a gift for you. Your life, Belmont. Take it and go.
So did I. He was wearing a leather jacket. A leather jacket is a waste of money. Maybe we shouldn't spend so much money on chicken. If we were stealing it, we could afford to buy you a jacket. Listen.
We went out to dinner, and I thought as friends. But you're right. He was flirting with me. Oh, my God. Nope, mom. We can't let that happen! I'm gonna tell you, it's not gonna happen. I realized I'm not sexually attracted to him. Okay. I feel really weird about that, but I'll take it, because it's for the best.
Where to start? - You don't like the scheme? - No, no, no. It's good. It's just that I've seen it before.
I spent all my money on a one-way ticket, and you're telling me about faith healing? You are a man who looks at the world through a keyhole. You have spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole to see and know more. Now, when you hear that it can be widened in ways you cannot comprehend, you deny the possibility. I deny it because I don't believe in fairy tales about chakras and energy centers or the power of faith.
You have a purpose. You're always happy. How's your book coming along? I've never written about myself before. I think it's my best book, but I don't even know why I'm writing it.
You're always happy. How's your book coming along? I've never written about myself before. I think it's my best book, but I don't even know why I'm writing it. The only person who can read it hates it.
Quickly pack your things and go to your sister's house. But this symbol is more common than anything else. Look at the resemblance. How can you not see its importance? It's not that I don't see it.
Looks like they're mobilizing. David, I hope it's not some kind of Trojan horse. I don't think it's dangerous to us. But I'm sure it's dangerous to them. He turned it on with a simple touch.
I'll hide in the back. Luis Roldan, Spain's most wanted man, the one seen on five continents, never left Paris... What did I tell you? I told you not to bring him the Spanish press. Throw it away.
Documents from Laos Belok and Pino got it wrong again. - Why? - It's a stamp from the mayor's office of the Laotian capital, not a ministry stamp. What should we do? Return it?
I don't know how I escaped. You're safe now. We're all safe. They put the machine in my loop. They put it in the basement of Blackpool Tower.
That's fantastic. Where did you find this? We didn't find it. We cut it off. That thing killed three people before we killed it.
I've come to take her back. - Don't you get it? - My blood. I want it back. Well, it doesn't work that way, we can't just give it back to you.
We just have to swim and swim and swim and swim And don't give up That's how we live Swim, swim, swim We swim, swim Swim, swim - We swim - Swim, swim - Swim and swim This song was taught to me by my parents! We sang it together.
We're floating We're floating, we're floating - We're floating - Float and float This song was taught to me by my parents! We sang it together. I thought I wrote it!
Stay in my shadow. - Why? - Do as I say. Praise thee, O great Ra, hello. In fact, when a bird lands on my boat, I kill it before it shits.
Not even half of it yet. All I want is the answer to the riddle of the Sphinx. Even a child would understand why you're here. Learn the riddle, come back and tell me. - I'll solve it.
I'm aware of that. Father. - I noticed the tower. It's impressive. - I built it for you.
- That was your test. - You didn't test him. I gave Osiris the crown of king of Egypt. When the time came, he didn't cling to the power. He handed it over quietly, he passed his test.
- But that's, uh. - 80 kilometers east. That's where we found him. Oh, I haven't read this book in ages. It's Natalie's book. I got it when I was learning to read.
I cry too. I can't stand it. Baby, we fucked that wedding. Yeah. We fucked her in the dick.
Baby, we fucked that wedding. Yeah. We fucked her in the dick. I don't like it when you say that. I know, but we fucked her hard.
Pardon me! I realize this is certainly no consolation, but you and I are surrounded by Chinese food. Yes? Guys! I'm afraid where we are, they don't call it Chinese food, they just call it food. food.
Where'd you learn that song, Dad? My parents taught it to me. And they learned it from their parents. And they learned it from theirs. And someday you'll sing it to your children, too.
I know what kind of mutants you're looking for. And I know where to find them. This is my first time in America. I'm very interested in your culture. You won't see it here.
Reacher. How's my office? I'm sitting in it right now. There's a big dent in the desk. They say you made it with someone's head.
Move your head. Can you feel my hand? - Yeah. Yeah? Can you feel it?
I'll fight you! Do you want to be fought? Battled? Look, this thing doesn't help you give life. It attracts death. If you don't take it away, it's gonna attract something bad.
Let him keep it. I got a better one. Yeah, I got-- Wait a minute. Okay, she took a seashell and rubbed glowing seaweed on it to distract me.
We're headed that way. If my parents find out I took it, they'll kill me. You've done this before? Every couple weeks. A boat's like a musical instrument. She doesn't like it if you don't use it.
I'm more afraid of being killed by a jellyfish than anything else in the world. You're afraid of being killed by a jellyfish? It's not funny. It happens. A buddy of mine caught a jellyfish, put it in a jar and went out drinking.
- I don't-- - Please. That's enough. Come. We will show you the true nature of Lycan soldiers. To do so, our honored guest Celine will play the Death Dealer who bravely defends our fortress, and I will be the villainous Lycan who comes to destroy it.
Too bad I was late, or I could have helped them. You did anyway. You did what I had hoped and planned for. If not more. You see, information is power. And I'm passionate about collecting it.
Once an outcast, I am now one of the chosen Elders. An outcast given the highest honor. I have lived 1,000 years. Perhaps I will live another 1,000 years. or die tomorrow. But I no longer fear death... because I have already experienced it.
You got it? I'm good. It's heavy. Turn your hands like this. Turn your hands like I did so you can catch it.
Party! It's Jake. - Are you a wolf? - Where's your jacket? I don't have it.
Let me help you. I'm curious. - What? Well, the blackmail note. When I hold it up to the magnifying glass, the font gets a lot bigger, but when I take it away, it goes right back to small.
Maybe Ali had to defend herself. I don't care why she did it. I just want to find a way to prove that she did it so we can get Hanna back. Okay, if the person who killed Charlotte was wearing a red sweatshirt, it could have Charlotte's blood on it. We'll go to her house to find her.
Pull back. Stop it. -What's he taking from the table? -A jar of red caviar. He took it off the shelf in the marketplace.
I use the other one. Metal detectors went off on the way out of the store. [Security came up and asked for the receipt. And they pull a flash drive out of my backpack. Go prove you didn't take it.
Can we go now? No one's entered the cell. That's weird. Has anyone touched the security camera? No one's touched it.
[Terribly unprofessional. Who can confirm that? The cameraman. There's a videotape. Just please don't show it to anyone.
Just when Ivanova was in the ward, we were celebrating the 50th anniversary of our hospital. I was preparing a photo album. I took pictures of wards, patients with their parents, that sort of thing. One day I was photographing the corridor, and Ivanova's father was in the frame. He silently came up to me, grabbed the camera, took out the film and lit it.
2 years ago my wife and I were in a car accident. The car burst into flames instantly. I got out, but my wife didn't. Her door was jammed. I tried to open the door, break it down.
You ruined my life's work. Why? We could have changed the world for the better! You can't change the world for the better through blood and murder. Human life is the highest value, and no one has the right to take it.
You want to know why I didn't take the money? Is that what you're asking? Yes, that's what I'm asking. Personally, I was hired to do a job. I did it.
No. How did they get in? Through the back door. It was open when I arrived for lunch. I was closing it. They must have hit it with a crowbar.
For New York's sake, we need to put aside our differences and work together. There's just one question. Is there something between you two or-- Come on. If this fluid was injected into Bebop and Rocksteady's bloodstream, it's possible that by isotopically characterizing it, I can find out where they are.
Now let's talk about the future and how we're going to change it. You're talking about preventing a Jacobite uprising? That's what we agreed on, isn't it? Didn't we? I thought we agreed to think about that. If there's a war with the British, shouldn't we be thinking about winning it, not stopping it?
- You're gonna leave me alone with the undertaker? - You'll be fine. - What's going on here, Mr. Day? - She threw a lit cigarette by the gas pump next to me. I put it out.
Is it, I don't know, some kind of biological weapon? Where's the tape from? The Phoebe, I think. - Phoebe Station. Where'd you get it?
Isabel, you need to talk to a priest. Just a blessing, Olga. I've always loved listening to your prayers. Our Father, Creator of all things visible and invisible, you have allowed new life to be born in your daughter's womb. Let Isabel keep this new life and keep her safe from all harm.
I'll get a patrol out there to check the place out. The bottle was found here. Why this square? Definitely not in Kattegat Strait. The current would never have sent it that way.
Go to the nearest restroom. Where are we? Take the next right. On the right is a red knob next to the door. Push it down and the door will open.
"Cop 1." The train is entering the woods. We're losing sight of it. Get ready to dump the bag in three seconds. I'll kill them if you don't dump it. now.
I believe now would be a good time for us to get you away from sin. We're fighting to protect Nassau. It's a war in which our most effective weapon is the fear we instill in our enemies. We have succeeded in giving Captain Flint the image of a fierce death in front of our enemies. The only way we can ensure that: this story will continue if he is the one to tell it.
You're rallying people to fight for the idea that these days everyone in Nassau should stand united. Either that means something or it doesn't. And how the hell am I going to convince them of the latter, just so they can avoid delay? Right now, any man who can tie a black flag and get a dozen fools to follow him can take the spoils. They can take it because of the fear that I and people like me have instilled in their victims.
And sooner or later, they'll be brought out into the open. Any fool who went after Hallandale deserves whatever end he earns in his company. You were right. The war is getting more and more dangerous. The strong among us must stick together and face it bravely.
Oh, shit, it's dark as fuck. - Where's the door? - I don't know. Where is it? Can you see it?
Mrs. Mallax and Susan? Yes. Those little fingers have an iron grip, Mrs. Mallax. She's holding a rattle, Dr. Turner, and a spoon! She can't put it in her mouth yet, but--
Yeah, I know. I already told them. Okay, I'll tell them. Okay, bye. They'll pick her up in a couple hours.
I already told them. Okay, I'll tell them. Okay, bye. They'll pick it up in a couple hours. Leave the keys, no one's gonna steal it.
But one day, you'll definitely want a cup of something hot and black.... Mr. Bulletproof. - I see you're getting into nicknames, Pop. You said your crazy broad pulled a gun on you. put it under your chin and pulled the trigger.
You think I wanted something like this? I was set up, beaten up. They put me in some kind of vessel like an exotic fish. The only thing that saved me was, uh. powers. They saved your life. More like ruined it.
Welcome. I'm so glad you're with us. Sit down, I'll explain. Tommy, this is Richard, my lead scientist. The machine will amplify your power and channel it, and you'll send everyone who wears one of these watches into the future.
I don't want to be chosen, you know, and, uh. and look like an idiot. Oh, crap. All right, kids. We have a very interesting topic today. One of the older students has written an original story for children, and he's going to read it to you now.
If Chang stays after the road is completed, don't count on me. I know you want to claim the Xie Yu contract from Mei Fong. I'm here to buy that contract at a fair market price. Any price within reason, Mr. Chang. Just name it.
There was a small bit of paint in the resin, the top layer of which was lead based. - Lead paint was banned in 1975! - Bingo. And this particular paint was only purchased by municipal facilities from 1973 through 1977. In those years, public facilities were required to either paint over lead paint or remove it altogether.
Uh, no, thank you. О. Jay left a suicide note. It's awful. I don't know what we should do with it. I mean, should we give it to the police?
Somehow these cops, this bunch of racist officers, dropped them off? From the Bronco murder scene to Rockingham? Who else? Let's go back. Isn't it odd that the glove ended up in Rockingham just as Detective Fuhrman was there and found it.
From the Bronco and Rockingham murder scene? Who else? Let's go back. Isn't it odd that the glove ended up in Rockingham just as Detective Fuhrman was also there and found it? Well, it's not strange if Simpson dropped it when he was climbing the wall to avoid being seen by the limo driver.
- Sir, step out of the car immediately. - Oh, come on! Sir, because of your hostile attitude, I'm going to cuff you. Officer, please. Take my license and run it.
Not the night we're talking about. No. Not that I can recall. Let me get this straight. In all your years as a detective, this would be the only time you took evidence from a crime scene, put it in your car, drove it home, and didn't put it in the report until the next day.
He's a real media whore. If you want to know where he's going to go, just watch the late night talk shows. Now, that's something you can't control. Stop watching so much TV. If you listen to all that crap, at some point you're gonna start bringing it to court.
- Yes, Bob. - I tried this glove on myself. It didn't fit. It's never gonna fit him! I think we should have him try it on in court.
But this verdict, it's the jury, it's their position. It's their vote. And I accept that verdict. But, uh. We came here for justice. And I think it's for you to judge, I think, whether we got it today.
Right. Three lords walk into a tavern-- Stark, Martell and Lannister. Onizakaliel, but when the bartender brings out mugs, each finds a fly in it. Lannister, furious, pushes the mug away and asks for another. Martell catches the fly and swallows it whole.
What's the deal with the hats? - You wouldn't understand. - You have to be in the thick of it. How's the food? Mac calls it "Mac's Famous Mac and Cheese."
Please. You can always talk to me if you need to. It was so hot. You were sweating. There was salt on your upper lip. I licked it off.
Shall I ask you, as the good wife, how was your day? No. I guess mine was luckier. Well, it depends on what you measure luck in. Personally, I measure it in sapphires.
- Keep us posted, all right, sis. - I will. Holy shit! So Arthur's telling Linda everything? She stole his soul and moved it someplace safe. on the outskirts. where men are honest with their wives.
Tommy, I'm sorry I'm late. We looked everywhere. All the way to Hay Mills. Nothing. Put four cans of gas in the trunk of my car and bring her back.
I want you to intimidate him with your badge and gun and make him drop the lawsuit. That's very illegal. He won't do it. I don't care. You have 48 hours to do it, and then I'll take your sperm and dump it in the East River.
Call Jake Peralta. Gina, hey, any luck holding him off? Yeah, the tow truck just arrived, so we'll have at least another hour. A tow truck? What the hell did you do to my car? Didn't I say I was gonna wreck it?
Everyone knows you break in when the owner is here. That guarantees you access to the safe, and you can knock his teeth out as a message. Okay, maybe you, uh. Sure, you could cut his throat open, but then what are you gonna do with all that blood? We leave it in the body where it lives because we're cops.
Don't you think that's perfect? Yes, it is. But judging by the quality, some 9-year-old girl had to sew it all day long while inhaling noxious fumes, because her tiny fingers are perfect for both sewing and getting stuck in the sewing machine. She's 90% off. Although you know, if you don't buy her, then what was it all for?
They would never know what happened to me. And Damien, he just came out of nowhere. And I have no idea what he said, but they let me go. I never told anyone that story. Why are you telling it now?
You'll be well soon. Mr. Reynolds, you're a very lucky man. If you hadn't choked, we wouldn't have been able to run the tests. We found something. You have a serious illness, but luckily, we found it.
- I'm determining. Especially in my exhibit. Then explain why there's art on the wall and this is trash? It's all about the backstory. The story behind each painting gives it depth.
It happens. I'm sorry, please. - Where do you want her to sit? - I don't know, there's plenty of places! - The molasses is getting cold in here. - I didn't bring it.
I'd be happy to explain the whole process to you. - Oh, my God. Ned, find the control panel on the left. Okay, I see it.
People who are unattractive to you have existed for thousands of years. - Millennia? - Since the dawn of mankind. In ancient Greece, non-josher-sexual love was considered normal. Plato called it the cornerstone of modern democracy.
You've lived for this moment. An eyewitness account. Put the gun down, Mr. Cole. God damn it. You have an unenviable fate, but the trouble is you're wasting your time not accepting it.
- You're welcome. I'll put them here. So, what happened? - I don't know. I remember the stupid alarm was blaring, and I got up to turn it off, and I woke up under the stairs on the floor.
That's it. Why did you go into the woods alone? I wanted to minimize possible damage to the crime scene. Why didn't you check the car for mines and stuff? Didn't you realize how risky it was to open it?
- Thanks, Sam. - You're welcome. Where's your sample bag? - Oh, I, uh. - I think you left it in the control room.
Where's your sample bag? - Oh, I, uh. - I think you left it in the control room. Uh, yeah, let me, uh. Excuse me, I'll go get it.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. He said no. And even if they wanted pizza for the hostages, which they don't, the criminals wouldn't eat it because they knew we'd put sleeping pills in it.
Spaniel Fly. - Uh-huh? - Pam, this shit doesn't work. Yes, it does. We just need to mix it with the blood of a mole. (recipe from Catherine Monvoisin, 17th century, burned at the stake for such tricks)
- It's salvation! - No. Well, I need to stop turning. I'll do the surgery. That's not what this is. No matter how much it costs, I'll do it.
That was something of a stretch. Well, I see we agree on less today. That's out of line. Ms. Morrow, there's a package for you. I found it in the mailbox this morning.
Here, let me do that. - Thank you. Uh-huh, uh-huh. - I just cut myself. - There's a note. - Read it. Dear Susan, I've written a novel to be published this spring.
What ex-husband? I didn't know you were married. For how long? A couple years in grad school. It's weird, I've been thinking about him a lot lately, and he recently sent me this book he wrote and it's violent and sad and he called it Nocturnal Animals and he dedicated it to me.
Happy anniversary! You guys are love! Oh, my God. My iris. I left it behind.
- Oh, my God. It's a sign. - It is. - Yeah. We steal this car, drive it close to the airport so we can walk to it, douse it in gasoline and set it on fire so they won't find it.
Deputy Chief Irving. What's going on here? Alcohol testing, sir. I can see that. Who organized it?
We put out a search for Liliat Saroyan's car. 2012 Altima registered to this address. Tony Allen's Vegas office. You looking for a car? We found it.
Tony Allen's office in Vegas. You looking for a car? We found it. It's been in our impound lot for a week. She left it at the Greyhound station.
Of course. Security footage. Irv, I, uh. I don't think that's a good idea. I want to see it.
May and June are booked on a first-come, first-served basis. Mrs. Sarkisian. Excuse me, Mrs. Allen, but why our church? You don't look Armenian, and your last name-- My late husband changed it for business reasons.
With a fiberglass hull, obviously. Too damaged, hard to tell what model. Probably some mid 80's or early 90's? Bertram or, I don't know, Albemarle. - You ever seen it before? - Я?
And he posted a picture of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West with their faces rearranged. It was a photoshopped joke, so stupid. You shouldn't have sent anything. I don't know what to do. I screengrabbed it from Instagram, I thought it would make you laugh, and you didn't respond.
Thank you. I love this top. Jess, Nick needs to stop telling that wet pants story, okay? - Uh, I know. - I've heard it four times this week.
I just met the only other person in America who cares about jury duty, and he's damn attractive. Jess, we have an emergency. Cece's washing her clothes, and I can't even get across the hall. She built a laundry dam. - Can't you just walk over it?
Excuse me, may I ask what you're doing? Did he see the van? Yeah, and he memorized the plates. And that didn't help? It helped us trace it back to the company it was rented from.
So he also owns a 19.3% stake in Lumetherm, obtained through a stake in Southern Wind. Remember the block trade Merrill conducted on Thursday? Fortress cashed out their short positions before the merger. Right? The deal was done at 12:52 p.m. when everyone was at lunch, meaning it was meant to be done discreetly. You guys caught it, which seems commendable.
Backstage. Share with me the process of processing information. The press makes information look like an obscene word. Everyone has access to information. We're just better at analyzing it.
What? You have to get the dog. - What? The dog. I can't keep it in the apartment.
Previously on the show... When did it become a crime to be successful in this country? Everyone has access to information. We're just better at analyzing it.
Medium-sized firm with a large distribution agreement with Yumtime Bakery. Holding at 50. The numbers are strong. I don't see a down play. Don't need to see it.
This is for you and Frida? You weren't lying when you said she'd do your father. - Mom, you're back in his net, and if you're here to convince me to slow down-- - That's not why I'm here. Competition is healthy if you use it to push yourself.
The wagon is the brain, and the processors we got are the rest of the Machine's nervous system. While you were gone, I finished connecting our encrypted system to the government surveillance system. The machine will restore all the data it lost. Good. (beeping) Let's wake her up.
Relax, sweetie. Okay, I killed her. But I was compelled by the circumstances. Ms. Groves, I think I should talk to the machine one-on-one. Machine, I killed her because she lied.
Damn it. A red dragon. It was breathing fire. Right at me. It's sunset falling on the northern mountain range, coloring it red.
Maybe you know what I'm talking about. Or maybe you don't, but, uh. you feel it. Because you've felt other boundaries, like youth and maturity, perhaps. I can't change your destiny. but I can help you meet it.
You don't even have a map. Where's our map? I don't need it. I know where I am. (LAUGHS) You probably couldn't even read it.
We didn't do anything. Could you check that napkin for a wire? Are you kidding me? Are--are you crazy? No, just check it.
I'm almost done. Funny thing is, I didn't know anything about Frantz Fanon before. I should have, like everyone else. He had something that really inspired me. "Each generation must find its mission, and fulfill or betray it."
What do you think of the salmon striped shirt she gave me? Great, you'll blow her away in a minute. But the thing is, it's drying. No way, I haven't worn that shirt in months. Well, maybe I wore it the other day for a drink.
There are no guarantees. And changing the timeline is proof of that. You stopped Jennifer Goines, destroyed the virus and changed history. We affected the epidemic. We stopped it.
There's only one of us left. I'd like to offer you a short position that you won't lose. You know Cross-Co. I don't see a short game. You don't need to see it.
I'd like to offer you a short position that you won't lose. You know Cross-Co. I don't see a down play. You don't need to see it. You need to make it.
8%. 8%? Sounds like it's important to you. It is important. Well, I have a long position open, obviously I'm going to have to terminate it, but if you're right and this company is sinking, I miscalculated with my position and I'm going to hold it forever, waiting for a recovery.
Not from this planet? We don't know yet. You said you could keep her in something. Yeah. Can you move her?
I beg your pardon? Now, you're gonna put the sample in a container and give it to me. Ms. Frost, you have no idea what this thing is capable of. Oh, on the contrary, I'm the only person who knows what it can do. Now give it to me.
The only thing left is zero matter. Tonight we're going to clean up the lab. We have to get to your lab to get the research and the zero matter. Whitney Frost? Now give her to me.
So she did get caught in the blast zone. I was closer, so I took the blast. Howard! The emulsion must be fading. I didn't realize he was emitting it so fast,
Whitney Frost... It defies categorization. It's open. Ms. Frost? A package arrived for you. Where should I put it?
I've always loved fireworks. Because of the fire, actually. What if it doesn't work? The crack will open. Zero Matter will pour out, and you and I will absorb it.
Two hours ago, you used a fake file to frame me. If I was helping them, I'd be halfway there. But I'm with you. The rift will open. Zero Matter will escape, and you and I will absorb it.
It's fine. I only plan on using it once. On what? Dr. Wilkes has my zero matter. I'll return it.
Thank you, Doctor... Wilkes. I want to thank you properly for saving me. How about dinner and dancing? Now give her to me.
- Whitney Frost, you're under arrest! - No! Please! I need her! Give her back!
I'm thinking. How long will the gamma cannon take to charge? At least 20 minutes. It doesn't have enough power to fire. Can we detonate it inside the rift?
Yeah, well, you wanted it, man. I'll see you at the show, hopefully your boys will have learned my songs by then. After my mom O.D.'d, we got into the system. - The foster care system. - Yeah. I don't like to call it that, because one day I looked up the word "foster care" in the dictionary and it means "patronage."
Let me know how it goes. -Hey. -Hey. I thought you were coming over to pick up Cadence later. I found her pacifier in the car. And I knew she was gonna ask for it, so, uh.
I mean, she was complicated. Don't get me wrong. But she was also passionate, and, uh. and she was loved for a lot of things. Yes? I mean, if it's so important for Glenn to hear the truth, then you should make him hear it.
But we're partners, right? What the hell are we gonna do? Draw a line down the middle of the Beverly? The line won't work. You're gonna keep crossing it.
- Then we kill them. - I see. So the rune on her neck-- The healing rune. Jace used it to save her life.
I got rid of my reputation as a murderer, even though I had a clean slate. I think I'll handle the marketing. Roger? Where'd you get that car? The agency sent it over.
You can fly home. "We." Did I somehow miss discussing this topic? We bought a boat together. We furnished it together.
"We". Did I somehow miss discussing this topic? We bought a boat together. We furnished it together. Yes, but we didn't discuss how and when we would use it.
I have the utmost respect for the federal prosecutor. I'm writing an article about the mass exodus of assistant federal prosecutors to the private sector. Now, you're at the top of my list, and I thought, uh. If you piss me off with this story, no other ADA will take your call. Look, I don't want to publish it.
Was it real? For a minute. More than a minute. I felt, uh. freedom, you know? Tasted it.
What's the matter? I'll be right back. Hey, Lawrence Boyd's not working out. - The problem is. - Solve it.
The ground beneath your feet is moving, and you don't even notice it. Or you refuse to notice it. But if this were the stock market, you'd forget your pride. You'd be trying to cut your losses by now. Lara, the earth moves because I move it.
So he was fired? With a bang. Partners thought his deals were out of line, possibly illegal. 9/11. their deaths. saved his career. It gave him a chance to take over the firm, rename it.
Mayor Claire Warren blew up the media today when she vowed to chip convicted rapists if she becomes governor. Stay tuned for updates on this story. I got your story. Have you always owned this car? Never lent it to anyone?
At the moment we are considering the project of equipping a whole bicycle zone. As you know, we have a very large student population. I'm getting annoyed that I never get a clear answer to a question that I think is legitimate. The mayor just told you that we have more pressing issues. Your issue is clear and we've taken it under advisement, okay?
You'll fill those hours by facing the world, Boris. Do you understand? I'm sure Beatrice wants you to change, too. You have power. You're so poor at using it.
Pike has a plan. Pike always has a plan and it's always the same plan to fight the Earthers. That's what got Monroe killed. You're out of line, Kane. No, I've already crossed it.
Do you have anything to say? What do you want to know? Everything. On the Ark, you taught your students about the promise of our future, the responsibility that our descendants will keep it when they first set foot on Earth. We didn't start this war, but you can be damn sure I intend to finish it.
I'm suggesting we run away from it. Why would anyone oppose it? There's no logic to it. Free will is the problem. I told you, we need to get around it.
I did my job. I'll just leave it in the Director's office. So, what do you know about this conference? I know it's small, classified, just a few countries attending. They're calling it the Alien Infection Symposium.
That's enough for a lot of ice. A map? Yeah, a map of Helena Blavatsky, 19th-century Russian occultist. She claimed she used it to track demonic presence. I don't have it.
No. Any evidence of previous digging? No, the ground's too hard. I think Jamie came here looking for a grave. - Found it and tried to dig it up.
When I was your age, I paid a company to work for me. Yeah. Can I borrow your car? - What am I, Uber? - That's right, Uber. I'll return it in a couple hours.
You just said the South is not conquered. - Yeah, but-- - There are no buts. Even a dog unconsciously craves discipline. And by the time he gets it, he'll forget how hard he was beaten.
I can still hear her voice in the house. She had a very soft voice. like a bell. I'm very sorry for your loss. So, uh. a fresh start. I've barely seen her in the last year. especially in such abundance.
- Yes! A whore. She's good. True love. They can find her here.
Slut. She's good. True love. They can find her here. Or we could make her up.
Is that your new tactic? Forbidden moves? I shot this episode. You know that. You took it down because Coleman's here getting the best out of you.
Get out and don't you dare come back. "Mirror of Truth." I like it. What kind of genius came up with that? - Я. - Я. You came up with the concept and I'm bringing it to life.
You dodged a bullet pretty good. Yeah. I didn't know about that. I called you on the radio. I turned it off.
I'm afraid the department won't make any concessions. You're still suspended from duty. Thursday. Before the Blenheim Vale files were sealed. the last piece of evidence went missing. I don't think anyone's gonna miss it in 50 years.
We'll also need weapons in case the beast returns. I'll use your phone. Couldn't this be some kind of terrible mistake? We found her bag at Goggins' house, apparently musk spilled in it when she wanted it back. Anyway, how do you know Georgie took it there?
Catherine Goble, sir. How do you know Redstone doesn't survive orbital flight? It's classified. Top clearance. It's no secret that Radstone keeps falling, it can go into suborbital flight, but it can't support the weight of the capsule and take it into space.
That's the math we don't know. Yes, Catherine. So the capsule will fly around the Earth forever because nothing will slow it down? That's right. Slowing it down to the right speed at the right time is our job.
Okay. Plank-Eistein. The problem is transitioning the capsule from an elliptical to a parabolic orbit. There's no mathematical formula for that. We can calculate the launch, the landing, but without that conversion, the capsule stays in orbit, we can't get it back.
You have until noon to remove it. But if I try to remove any of the individual pieces, the mechanism I designed will block the door. You can trust me. If you try to open it with gunpowder, you'll bring the roof down. It'll take a week to drill through it.
Will Peter find a new friend? You'll find out right after this Korean commercial that Ashton Kutcher hoped no one in America would see. Hi. I'm Ashton Kutcher. Have you ever killed a dog during a DUI and then been sad that there's not one way to cook it on the engine on the way home?
So if you give us a call back when you have a free minute, that would be great. Thank you, Patrick. 72 hours to vacate the premises. Where's our flour? Debbie used her as an imaginary child.
A rich despot. A gold-digging scumbag who fucks some girl just like you, beating her while he takes advantage of her. Find him and bring me his right hand! Yes! Cut it off and hold it bleeding to your chest!
A gold-digging scumbag fucking some girl just like you, beating her while he's using her. Find him and bring me his right hand! Yes! Cut it off and hold it, bleeding, to his chest! Bring it here, throw it on this table, and we'll sing at our pleasure!
He said Vanessa was with the Master. A creature she called Dracula. I have to get him to tell us where she is. And how do you intend to get that information? I intend to get inside his mind and rip it out.
Schrodinger's cat. As I can see, I have impressed you with my artistic talents. Schrodinger put his cat in a box of poisoned food. Until he opens the box, the cat is, in theory, both alive and dead. But when he opens it, it's either "Hello, Mittens" or "Goodbye, Sock."
I didn't want to live anymore. You went into, uh. into some store. И... it was a bookstore. I sat down and I came across this book... I started flipping through it.
If I hadn't had an affair with Laura, if we hadn't overslept, if I hadn't made a left turn, then that roe wouldn't have run out in front of me onto the road. And none of this would have happened. Where did you leave your car? I drowned it.
When Thomas and his wife came to the hotel and learned of Laura's death, it was immediately clear to them what had happened there. After thinking about it, they realized that the chances of bringing you to trial were slim. So, no longer trusting the justice system, they decided to watch their enemy and wait. All they could do was keep you in their sights at all times. From that moment on, Tomas Garrido became your shadow. He found an apartment in the building across the street from yours and rented it in someone else's name.
I'm just gonna crash into it. Cut the power and save my friends. That's it. It's okay. I'll just ram it and destroy my beautiful car, my parents' birthday present, but I'll save my friends.
We know you're not on our side, Theo. You said you wanted to help Lydia, but you took something else from Aiken, didn't you? You mean the mask? Does that bother you? Did you wear it?
I'm sorry, where are you going? Trying to figure out how to use this against Zoom. Remember Zoom? "Cisco, please join me. We'll use your idea and take it to new heights and save the world."
Do you really think Damien Darhk cares about you? He thinks the world needs a reset. Honestly, John, after what we saw in Afghanistan, how can you think otherwise? All right. So you and darc burn down a village to save it.
I know you want to tell Felicity, and believe me, I wish I could be an aunt, but you have to do the right thing for your son. As hard as it is for you, keeping William in the dark is safer for him. Yes, John. Andy did some digging on the Shadow Internet, found out that the Demolition Team uses a special acid that weakens the building. Only one factory in the city supplies it.
Well, it's a matter of credibility, Your Honor. Oliver Queen publicly vilified my client, accusing him of staging a drone attack. Now, if-if Mr. Diggle could work for Mr. Quinn for free by helping Ms. Quinn buy drugs, wouldn't it be such a stretch to believe that he could also perjure himself for Mr. Quinn regarding the nature of this shooting? You saw me take the oath. And then I saw you break it.
I know. I don't know how. Because of his magic. His magic is too strong. I saw it on Lian Yu, and it's not just magic.
Last year we were this close to leaving. After three terrorist attacks, we decided we'd had enough, but the night before the training camp started, Green Arrow appeared on our TV screen and reminded us that this city was worth saving, that my home my home is worth fighting for. That man inspired me. Gave me hope. And if he was able to give me hope then, why can't he give it to others now?
I think you hit your head harder than you think. No, no, he's right. I can't hack into the system. But if the missile gets close, which it will. We can reconfigure its target in line of sight and disarm it.
That's right. We have to provoke them somehow. What the hell are you doing? Your chart from the psych ward. I saved it.
I found something near you, something wonderful. I found love. Something the Time Lords always taught us to hide from, but they were wrong, Rip. Love is not a threat. It's beautiful, powerful, and once you know it, love changes everything.
They're not easy to kill. These Reapers are even more ruthless, which makes your task more difficult. My task? For this experiment to work, we need blood from a living Kree. And I want you to get it.
- A sermon? - Yes. - Vanya, Vanya, but you'll be killed on the first day! - It doesn't matter. "He who gives his life for me will save it."
How do you stay so calm, by the way? I'm getting used to these things. Okay, here's what you need to do. You see that laser line in the back? You need to cut it with the mirror.
How much did you owe him? 16,500. I told him I couldn't pay him. Next thing I know, some guy calls me and tells me that my debt has been resold and to write it off, I have to steal a car. They told me where to leave it and where to pick it up.
Doesn't that make you a very, very expensive errand boy? Whoever I am, I'm not in the habit of turning down Mr. McCall's requests. Certainly not now. My client has always been fond of demonstrating power. And as he gets older, he becomes more unpredictable and demonstrates it with greater insistence and surprise.
- Yeah? I found the forger. - You did? How? Well, I was looking among the locals, since it was only a few days between when you showed me Christopher's painting and when he left it for you, so...
Excuse me, I'm waiting for a question. Did you steal the painting from the museum, Ms. Vaughn? If you don't mind my asking, I think you're asking the wrong question, Agent Clark. Here's what I'd ask if it were my case. Why would a respected private investigator steal a multimillion-dollar painting of her clients and then hang it on her bedroom wall for anyone to see?
Can't you stop them? There's nothing I can do. She has a warrant, and it's none of my business anymore. When were you gonna tell me about the painting? I was gonna get it back as soon as I knew how.
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you-- It wasn't her, it was me. My name is Benjamin Jones. I stole the painting, hung it on the wall.
He's talking. Why is he talking? What's the job? I spent a lot of money and solved a lot of problems to get this package delivered to the hotel. - We'll steal it.
We're close. She's with him. What are you waiting for? We have a deal with her. And you confirmed it.
They don't serve that there, I hear. Well, they could make an exception for you, I suppose. You want to tell me about Via Crucis? It started at a time when it looked like we were losing the war on terror. I think you started losing it when you called it a war.
Have a nice vacation, Klingenberg. - That's a nice jacket you got there. - What? Your jacket. I'd buy it.
I mean, I'm family, right? Why, because a drop of serum shouldn't change anything, except for one simple fact, I'll be on equal footing with you. Oh, yeah. I guess you could never live with that. You give it up right now and I ask for this act of defiance as a moment of weakness.
Cool. Well, he's not here, so, uh. He's dead. The serum. No, Marcel didn't take it.
-No, no, no, no, I know it's war. I've lost a lot of friends too. I need your help today. And you're gonna get it.
That's Cornell's problem. You can't give it to Cornell yet. Eric. How do you think the homicide detective will take your new evidence? Cornell's gonna have to study it.
Hennessy put me in touch with another cell. They've got solid intel for a big operation. Big shot's coming into the sector. They have a full operation plan. They just need our tactical expertise to pull it off.
My mom. Oh, well, she'd love it. Norman, I don't believe we truly lose loved ones. Neither do I. I'm sure she'll see it.
Yeah. Well, I, uh. thank you, but, uh. this really isn't a good time, so, uh. Я... understand. I just wanted to make something. Mexican chicken casserole. I made it.
Yeah, it's really weird. I can't believe it. I'm like the Wernher von Braun of robots. Who? The Nazi scientist who invented the V-2 rocket using slave labor and then dropped it on London.
What the fuck is that? Cocaine, heroin, fentanyl. Inside the painting. Here. I went to sell it and the buyer opened it.
I don't... I think I do. He has a dog, doesn't he? He used to come in here. I even saw him walk it once.
Boys. Give us a minute. I want my money back. Your son's in a coffin, and you want your money back? The Irish may not have invented revenge, but I'm damn sure we've perfected it.
Uh... Okay, uh. I found this picture. It's of him and his wife and kids on the merry-go-round. Where'd you find it?
Probably not getting close to anyone because, uh. not everyone's coming home. But at the same time. you have to have some feelings, right? Otherwise, what are you fighting for? I remember Frank used to hum this awful song. He heard it, I think, on one of the kids' shows when he was on leave. Brought it with him to Afghanistan, it was contagious.
Am I right? I have to admit, I love being the messenger of bad news. Go ahead. The coin is not for sale. I just used it to get to you.
That was dispatch. Dan's phone died, and he wants to meet me at my place. Apparently, it's an emergency. Ah, how convenient. What next. he spilled something on his shirt and had to take it off?
Decided to add a little drama? You know, I've put up with a lot to let you investigate crimes with me, but only because up until these moments you've been honest with me, but now for some reason you're not telling me the whole truth. I'm telling you everything you need to know to help me find my property. A man was murdered, and all you care about is your property? Yeah, but if we find it, you'll know who killed the guard...
Which reminds me. that your presence here is no longer required. You can thank my agents for completing your mission. Their idealism will destroy this planet. No. It will save it.
Are you familiar with Elgar's work? I prefer jazz, I'm afraid. I love Elgar the most. I used to play him on my cello all the time. Until my father sold it.
Yeah? Well, you better believe Emil's dead. Do you know where he got the heroin from? No, no, I don't know anything about any heroin. You come to community church on Sundays? Take some drugs from your priest and leave it for your snitch buddies to overdose on?
I thought you'd appreciate it. I lost it. I guess I was wrong. No, you didn't. I need to read it.
I lost her. I must have made a mistake. No, you're not. I need to read it. I just can't find it.
Quentin! Oh, no. Yeah, that's it. I'm talking to you. I told you, you don't stop humming that stupid song, and I'm gonna reach into your brain and rip it out. - No, no, no, no.
The XO's been gone over two hours. It's too early to worry. How long have you been pumped out, Captain? Give or take half an hour. They're taking our blood and transfusing it into their own.
But I'll give you this. Ten thousand dollars. Take a trip. See the world while you still can. Life's too short to spend it sitting in an office.
He will never let you down or betray you. So it's a deal? You've crossed the line for the last time, Eldritch. You mean I took the nuke I paid for? You will return it immediately.
- What is it, Humphrey? I'm sorry, auntie, it's just, uh. Why would you put a bunch of old memorabilia in a safety deposit box? It's his old life, sir. And he wanted to preserve it.
Come on, chief. All right, then, JP. Take a card, any card. Okay. Don't show it to me.
Well, one, love can be found everywhere. Number two, love doesn't come out of the blue. Isn't it? Э... yes. And three, once you've found it. it's forever.
Yeah, we really do. Did you leave a note saying you weren't coming back? No. My Aunt Helen was there. I was afraid she'd find it before I left.
I know where he'd take her. What do you mean, you know where he'd take her? Connor has an 80-acre property north of town. That's where his lab is. - How do we find it?
They're holed up somewhere, I want to know where. Go get 'em. Agent Pritchard, a word. Pritchard, I know some people look down on you for ratting out your partner and your boss, but personally, I think it was damn professional. You took an oath and you kept it.
Why was this one ruled out? Mary said she needed it. Did she say why? No, Otto, she didn't. If you want the hat, Sheriff, come and get it.
Uh, standing guard, I suppose. Don't want any syphilitic soldiers breaking in. There's another number we could try. My address book. It's in that drawer over there, number 9. Could you get it for me?
I took a crash course at camp. - But why-- - Well, their radar is far superior to ours. It sees much clearer, much farther. They want us to get inside the rig, photograph everything we can, then blow it up.
Go away, now! What's up, Ricardo? You're fucking crazy, man. Ricardo, put the gun down, bro. Put it down, Ricardo.
I did it. What? What's that? I stole your speed. And I gave it to Zoom.
First message. Next message. Mrs. Warner, this is Hal Marcum, fraud department. We actually recently had an unlimited credit card opened in the name of Keith Blair. When Mr. Blair called and said he didn't order the card, we closed it immediately.
Yeah. If you want to arrest me, come and get me. I know less about Liam than I did a week ago. All I know is the kid was listening to God-awful music. I kept asking him to turn it off.
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris. I got slower. I did it. I stole your speed. I gave it to Zoom.
Caitlin, look out! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What happened? With all the breaches closed, the energy surging into this last remaining breach must have destabilized it.
Don't talk to them again. I'll get out of here. And I'm gonna destroy you. All I need from you, Flash, is your speed. And you're alive enough for me to get it.
Have you seen what he can do? Your friend, the outcast? His power? It is God's power. And why did god give it to him?
It's a long story. Someone took my cell phone, and they, uh. they sent out a picture. Of Professor Runyon? Was that you? Holy shit, you saw her too?
And I got it because my family's been here a long time. Yeah, your wife said 50 years? That's right. People know me, you know? They trust me to turn it into a mixed-use property that will bring in revenue but won't look like Vegas on the water. You know? So what do you got?
We take orders from her. That's the only way it works. The only ones whose jobs are in jeopardy right now are you and me. So we're just gonna take it as it comes? I don't like broccoli, but my doctor says to eat it, which I do.
Uh-oh. I swear to God, Leo, if that's how you-- Are you threatening me again? You know, I didn't ask you to come to my apartment, but you did. And you promised me the truth, or at least some attempt to find it, not this, whatever it is.
What happened that you won't tell me? The enemies I'm fighting, Lex, don't care about humanity. The virus doesn't care about politics, race or feelings. The truth is, I had no idea where this outbreak was happening. But I was pretty sure I was gonna stop it.
Why should I risk everything I have for this? It won't bring them back. - It won't save anyone's life. - No. But our friends died trying to find the truth, and all you have to do is push a few buttons to find it.
It's not a cure, but it will help someone live longer. Yeah, that's why you need a human study. Take her. Without enough time or resources, there could be a risk of an incompatible post-transfusion reaction to the antibody serum. Her body may not accept it.
Are you... a cancer counselor? I'd like to think of myself as a messenger for the pre-deceased. Good, she's still under sedation. I broke the news to her. I'm not sure she understood it.
"Mobilization at Dieppe. Attack tomorrow at dawn." We'll take advantage of the situation and attack Freya. German long-range radar. They want us to get inside the installation, then blow it up.
Athos and his friends. will be dead. Next time, don't wait for the bottle to kiss the floor before firing. It's not good for your nerves. Next time, don't pick up such small pebbles. I could barely hear her.
His ears must be burning. - What's up? - Hello to you, too. I can't find any good bourbon, just the acid we serve to guests. The construction guys started hitting that bottle, so I put it on the top shelf.
You read my book. Stayed up all night. It's a terrific read, by the way. We should make a movie out of it. I should have read it in the first place, I'm sorry.
Thank God you're here. Remember when you told me not to smoke in the house? You didn't, did you? No, I smoked in the car. And I wrecked it a little bit.
A little nail polish. You're lucky you're pretty. But you're not gonna tell Mr. Powell, are you? No. We'll take it to the body shop.
You haven't seen my biggest surprise. You made the bed? - But how? - I googled it. And I'm ready to make it again.
Please don't ask me. Please don't. What have we got? It's an upgrade to your tachyon gas pedal. I converted it from the one that was stealing your speed to one that amplifies it.
But before you make a mistake, listen. I suppose I deserve at least that. This is a church meeting. I am the church. I built it from nothing.
- There are other ways. I gave you a book about it. "Fillory and Beyond, Book Six"? I told you. I lost it.
I've never felt so much energy. And it's great. It feels, uh. dangerous. You treat magic like a drug because your teachers act like drug dealers. They buy it and sell it and fight over it and fuck over it.
You know... Which part of me helped more? Uh, good question. I'd say the smile. No, don't hide it.
And there's no woman in the world better than my daughter. - I didn't mean to be rude. - Did you? Pai-za is of Ugedei's house. I'll give her to Hutulun when I name her heir.
Which one? A silver Honda sedan? Medium-sized, no flashy parts? Yeah. Did you see it?
Inside me. Always. Of course, you have good memories, too. That song. how do you know it? I wrote it. for my little boy.
- You need help. - Okay. (sighs) You can take me there when this is over, but right now, I think you need help. Where's my bag? I threw it out here somewhere. out the window.
He deserves better than that. We'll get it done, but first we'll get the boat back, okay? - And the camera you forgot. And the camera I forgot. I mean, it'd be a lot easier if you hadn't forgotten it.
Did he know? Did Milo fucking know what was on the boat? Let's pack them up. It's your turn to carry the bag. Well, I hurt my shoulder dragging it up there on the rocks.
- What? Are you serious? - You know what? I don't even-- The car's a little damaged, and we want to trade it in for something that runs.
You rented a car. - At the airport. - Yeah. Where is it? I didn't see it out front.
- At the airport. - Yeah. Where is she? I didn't see her in front of the house. Well, we went into town last night, had a few drinks, so we left her in town, took a cab back.
Well, we went into town last night, had a few drinks, so we left it in town, took a cab back. So where, where's the car? The funny thing is, we don't remember where it is, we were really drunk. We had a good time. Do you want us to find it?
- What's she talking about, finding our car? - She saw the car keys on the table. Asked me where it was. - And what did you say? - I said we lost it.
- You're choking him! - I told you to bring the boat back. - She's in the lagoon. - We'll show you where she is. - She's stuck. - We tried to get her back!
We had a wonderful time. I haven't heard from Mr. Milo since he retired. I left him a package. He asked me to get something for him. Do you know if he got it?
I left him a package. He asked me to get something. Do you know if he got it? The package? I threw it over the fence.
He asked me to get something. Do you know if he got it? The package? I threw it over the fence. I want to make sure he got it.
- He says the others have them. - The other two? Yeah, we split the money between us. Where's your share? My friend took it.
What did I say? I said if we go back, they'll kill us. There's a reason we're alive. Lawrence had a villa. Milo ditched him and put it in our names.
All that's left is to get there. Victory is at hand. The five of us, we are all descendants of the victors. American exceptionalism. Don't forget that. Our ancestors tamed the power of the atom and used it to bring an empire to its knees.
We'll end up like that fucking dog if we deliver this. If we stay, that's for sure. What's in the package? I want you to treat this package like a child, okay? Don't shake it, don't open it.
- Anything. Look, the wrapping's coming off. Don't mess with it. You'll only make it worse. If we bend it back a little bit, we can see what's inside.
You'll only make it worse. If we bend it a little bit, we can see what's inside. Are you crazy? I'm not-- I'm not gonna open it.
"The Three X's don't leave their own behind. You gotta be kidding me. We lost. Mark activated the satellite, and it's bearing down on us. We're gonna have to shoot it down like a kamikaze.
- It's just awful. - What does it look like? Your dick is stuck between the wood. Shit, I can't reach it. Bend over and push it out of there.
Pathologist's report. It was all there until those guys switched him. And I got it all on my phone. - Where's that phone? - They smashed it.
I know that. As much as we'd like to, the dead don't talk. Good night. Your father said you had her gift. What would your mom say about you leaving him?
where he unleashed the dark forces of their alliance. But they had no idea about the sword. Merlin stole his staff. He forged the great sword Excalibur and destroyed the ancient tower. The sword was then given to the Lake Maiden, who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.
that sword. Only you can prevent it. You will meet him with the sword at the foot of the tower. Trust the Wizard. Take it.
- I don't like snakes. - Nobody likes snakes. Hold on. Look at me. You'll feel it for hours.
Okay, let's look at the facts. Get a grip. What makes you think this song can't be country-- Maybe you're.... so country. Take your finger out of your ear and shove it up your ass.
And the other one isn't. I'm always running, trying to be someone. Clinging to life. I've got real uranium in here! I stole it from Mom.
Splendid play! Yes. A farewell elegy for my dear Elizabeth. The pathogen didn't, uh. didn't accidentally break free on landing, did it? You released it yourself, didn't you?
Doesn't look too hard to me. Yeah. Well, thanks a lot, old sport. We'll hire you. I've been watching this show called Law & Order, and they solve crimes a lot faster. You should watch it.
Murphy. You got some hidden talent in you, man. "Then it happened. All I did was put a pint of 'Export' beer in front of Begbie. He took a fucking sip of beer.
Stay as close to the bottom as possible. Sharks attack from below, so if you're on the bottom, you'll be fine. This button inflates your buoyancy compensator. Use it to float up. This one deflates it.
You still have time. Charles, the world isn't what it used to be. We're taking a risk staying here, you know that. And the place we're going to, Eden, doesn't exist. Her nurse got it from a comic book.
We're home. Hi, Julia. No! Go to bed! Maybe it's because the ban expired and I can't renew it.
Diarmud, listen to me! You must go and leave me. - Without delay. - No. I can't leave. I will not leave without the stone. I hope God will forgive me, but I threw it off the cart.
- Mrs. Wellsboro, I'm sorry. - He knows what he's doing. - Is your friend crazy? No, he's just an asshole, but you're not far off the mark. Some scumbag broke in and smashed him to pieces.
Dr. Watson. I love his blog. Do you? - His blog? You don't read it?
Yes. They're all guilty. - Sherlock. And what did you call that case, John? Something about a murder at the zoo. Yeah, I called it "Murder at the Zoo."
Sherlock, are you all right? Careful, he's got a knife. - What? A scalpel. You took it from this table.
I saw it. I sure didn't do it! Look behind his back! Look! - I saw you take him!
It's an experiment. We need precision. Sherlock, pick up the gun. It's your turn. When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.
- For you. What do you mean? - If someone else has to die, do you really want to do it with your bare hands? It would be a waste of valuable time. I think you should just take it.
And that's just the flowers. Francis Francis, director of the Pappy Co., has made a statement. Teddy, turn it on. We are finalizing the world's most adorable puppy! We'll be showing it at the pet convention in Las Vegas.
What about this sprout? Can I hit it with a rock? No, Jeff. Kill such a charming little thing? Take it to the tailor.
You can do whatever you want. I'll do crazy things. But you know, Peter, this is a huge responsibility. Only we can reshape the universe. We're the only ones who can take the cosmos by the reins and steer it in the right direction.
But to do that, we need video from the lab. We need footage of horrific animal abuse. There's a problem. Their security is ultra-secure. But, uh. there is a way. We're only willing to use it with your consent.
I sent it to you. Tell that to your wife, Darren. Hey, Phil. Sorry, I gave your coffee to Dougie. He really wanted it.
I'll tell you about it at dinner. In the meantime, I'll tell you... how much I love you, and how beautiful you are, and I'll tell you how sexy you are, and the tits, how majestic they are, and that ass.... Give me a break, and I'll get you some bread. Why? Because I hear you've been baking it all day.
Come on. Get up! Why does Rand want to buy this dock? I'm not quite sure. Ward said to buy it.
Maybe we should use you to make a new deal. Is that why you came to me? I'm here to let you know it's in your best interest to never go near Joy again. Why is Rand so adamant about wanting full control of the pier? There's another group of people who forced us to buy it.
I've lived long enough to observe the change that has happened to the world. But this change, it seems significant. The devil of Hell's Kitchen. A man with impenetrable skin. But now the immortal weapon has left K'un-L'un, not doing his duty, but breaking it.
I wasn't born homeless. Yeah. Sorry. Most people pass. I need some information. about the factory, the guards, and the owner, Gao.
Looks like a tattoo on your chest. Do you have any connection to these people? No. It's a sacred symbol from K'un-L'un. Gao sends them to hell by using it to poison them.
In what way? She hinted that it was the Hand. Bakuto. There was a ceremonial knife in his office. I recognized it because the Ruka men used one just like it.
- We need to get you patched up. - Airport? We're going home, Danny. No. The path to K'un-L'un is open, and you're not there to protect it.
He really is dead. Let's make a list of things you're not allowed to say, and that'll be number one. If you still have the tablet, I could, uh. analyze it. Maybe prove the paperwork's forged. I gave it to Harold.
Holy shit. Did you even see him? I think I saw a shot. What? I'm gonna get him, man.
She will find peace. I pray you find yours. You've always loved this place. It's a miracle this park even exists. That the city didn't tear it down to build skyscrapers.
- You attacked first. Did you? - Why doesn't he feel anything? - What's with the fist thing? - I earned it.
- Why can't he feel anything? - What's with the fist thing? - I earned it. - You what? He deserved it.
How are you? Are you-- You still thinking about Matt Murdoch? He loved this town. Sacrificed himself to protect it.
We're going to die here. With them! Wait a minute, Dee. I got an idea! If we put Sherman's mouth to the bracelet, we can get out. - I thought you said you couldn't break it.
- Really? - Yeah, a little bit. - I blew the intro. So I'm gonna jump in. We are crow-enthusiasts who have decided to take the power and essence of the crow and put it into a delicious dairy beverage called Fighting Milk. I don't know what you're talking about, but I've heard about your product, and Cerrone and Felder love it.
I'd be happy to help you. I have a few questions. - Of course. - Uh, of course. The ticket we're looking at. Who purchased it?
That means she bought the ticket with my money. So, technically, the ticket is mine! Okay, let me summarize. Ms. Reynolds bought the ticket with mr. Reynolds' money. But mr. McDonald is holding it for her. That's correct.
I say. I'm not the god of war, Diana. I am the god of truth. Mankind stole this world from us. They destroyed it, day after day.
There's not much we can do if that's who I think it is. But we can stop that plane. If we could get a radio, we could call in the air force to shoot it down. No, if it goes down, it'll wipe out everyone in a 50 square mile radius. We'll have to land it!
If we got to the radio, we could call in the air force to shoot it down. No, if it goes down, it'll wipe out everyone in a 50 square mile radius. We'll have to land it! Bad news, there's a timer inside. If we land it here, it'll be the same thing.
Yes, Brother Owen. How can you forget him? OWEN SHOW Once a debauchee, now a guest in a nasty secret prison. Cypher used him and left him for dead. And if I get a chance to kill her, Jock, I won't blow it.
You love me. And you won't shoot me. You should have given him the case, because I'm not gonna chase you. All right. I'll take it from the corpse.
Well, now he's back. And Delaney left him everything. Including Nootka Island. Do we have a copy of the Nootka contract? Maybe our lawyers can terminate it.
Those who use it will go all out for it when their supply of the product runs out. The powder is called Colony. Do you have samples? Uh, sure. I could show you how to use it for best effect.
I stopped him at St. Pancras. Promised two shillings, I think you'll pay. Wait. Nitrous oxide. They call it "laughing gas".
Promised two shillings, I think you'll pay. Hold on. Nitrous oxide. They call it "laughing gas." I supply it for public parties.
Or it could burn. - Do you know what's in there? - Uh-huh. I do. I'd burn it.
- Do you know what's in there? - Uh-huh. I do. I'd burn it. Less chance of the river throwing it out at high tide.
To the wasteland! He won't let us move him. James. The gunpowder we moved last night would have been ready for transportation. That's why we moved it.
I didn't know there was a gun in there! He could have shot himself! He could have shot us all! It was under my feet! I moved it out of the way.
Came in the mail the other day. We haven't had keys like this in 20-odd years. Room 315. I'm pretty sure it's Agent Cooper's room key. Thought Harry might want to keep it as a souvenir.
39.57 52 north latitude, 71.28 57 west longitude. It's right here in Rosewood. 492 Hart Street. Wait, Toby, isn't that the house you built? I never found out who bought it.
Trying to get this Blu-ray player up and running. Do you know how they work? Normally, these wires go into the red, yellow, and white input. But this machine seems to only have this wire. I can't see where to plug it into the TV.
Even consecutive punches. Mason, are you sure this is gonna work? Whatever's in the cage is shielded from external electrical currents. So the Ghost Rider can't use the lightning to escape. We'll put a lightning rod on the roof and connect it to an insulating cable.
For that dagger, we'd live for a year. Where did she get it? I don't know. She never told me. But if I took it, it would be like a part of her following me around.
Excellent question. For murdering the Lady of the Eastern Woods, by order of the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, I sentence you to s--. This sword. I knew the man who carried it.
And we commemorate the day I banished this horror from our land. But when the two moons align, the Eternal Beast will return, and it will be worse than ever. He will destroy everything in his path. But if you build us a weapon, with our expertise, and your technological prowess. We can-- we can defeat it.
I know it's a lot of things all at once. Focus on one thing at a time. Focus on the pigeon. Come on. Can you hear it?
You didn't kill Glinda? Did you think I was capable of that, or did you just send me out knowing I wouldn't come back? I sent you to save Oz. Because I swore an oath to protect this world! And I will protect it!
What do you hear? It's raining It's raining Hear the rain? Hear it? Hear it.
I'm just confused. I assure you, I meant no harm. Let me explain. I picked up your phone to wipe down the closet. and the cord accidentally disconnected. I thought I'd better keep cleaning, so I left it.
The key is to penetrate the brain inside the skull. And quickly, before the pain spreads so the brain doesn't realize it's dying. There's an art to a good death. But nowadays, they give everybody a gun with bolts in it. You know what I mean? Put it to your head and--
The hammer. The one I used to kill with. It's a little dull, but, uh. You have to use it to keep it sharp. Blood nourishes it, makes it shine.
- This portfolio will remain closed. - Why? Because I fucking said so. He's just trying to break us up. He's angry and wants to get back at me. Open it, we'll look inside, then we won't suspect you.
- They don't want us to infect anyone. - Why is it on TV? - It's a cover-up. That's why they invented the fire! They brought it to Spain and it spread.
- Give it to me! No! - Give it to me! - Battery! Give it to me!
- Battery! Give it to me! Why now when it's useless? Give me the phone, I know who to call. - Don't touch it!
Let's see what you do because he's up to something. Right, Bearded Boy? We gotta get the gun. We gotta try something. We gotta get it.
Where's my investment? - Huh? I don't have it. - Speak up, I can't hear you. - I don't have it.
Do you need a ride? Where you headed? No, thanks. I'm on my bike. Just put it in the trunk.
Three miles of misery. What's so funny? It's Orwellian to call it funny. What do you care if I skip it? Who else is going to call it Orwellian?
- "What if I don't have hearing?" "What if no one can hear my music?" Does everyone really read that stupid magazine? I'm even addicted to it. - You've never read it?
Bye. Hey, Helmet. Yeah, I know, I just got a text. Uh, I don't know, I just called. Actually, I can just stop by and pick it up.
I have errands to run today anyway. That's okay. Uh, okay. - Uh, thank you. - I could have sent it.
It took hours. And then, just as she was about to dig the hole, she saw something. It was a bag of gold. О. King, he had it buried in the middle of the road because he knew that whoever pulled it out, whoever tried anything, would be rewarded.
"You want data from the smartest mammal in the galaxy, give me a proper brain analyzer." Well, order pancakes, I'm not going to leave this part of the brain. I think differently. Or you're relaxing your cerebellum..... - Shawnee. - or "nine thousand" is gonna fry it.
Where are you? At the workbench, Morty. You're invisible and you're gonna fart at me? Turn the pickle over. Yeah, I touch it, and it's some kind of alien dick.
Your belt was in his bed. I lost that belt. Many weeks ago. Where? If I knew, I wouldn't have lost it.
Let's not make this any harder than it has to be. Irling Munk. Dmitri Podnikov? He's the mayor of Vocobigina. If this is an official call, you should forward it to me.
You were never supposed to come. You were supposed to stay away. Someone took him a while ago. You don't know what it is, you don't know what you're doing. Who took him!
Are you making fun of me? No. The liver detoxifies the drug. The drug binds all the victims. Tavrani Tavra made it, Hindemith drank it, and Bianca was killed where they used it.
- And you me. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Yeah, my baby lost a baby tooth. - I put it under his pillow.
Between the shoulder blades. Oh, yeah. Higher. I'm gonna miss this cast. And you didn't even ask me to sign it.
It's a classic. - No need to ask for a bigger family since everyone marries each other. By the way, I've always wanted a little brother. I can, uh. I can give him away.
That's right. Not that one. Son, read my lips. Shit's pouring down on you, and we're holding an umbrella over you. Shall I put it away?
Right now, my body is heading for the bank. It's not robbing it. Come on, it'll be fun. All right, listen. We had a deal, or whatever the fuck you call it.
Is that what he wrote, "visual"? According to Mr. Adal, he did. So you didn't read the report yourself. No. Ask him.
- One second, sir. How did you get this address? In an e-mail. What e-mail? Who sent it?
What letter? Who sent it? One of yours. I don't know how it works here. I need to see him.
No buts. I didn't do anything. After you pushed me, for old times' sake. I did exactly what I was supposed to do. I wrote the report and passed it up the chain of command.
Thought I explained that. It led to Mr. Quinn holding Franny and her nanny hostage for hours. I detailed it in the report. I read it.
There's some bias with his interview. Avoidance. - About what? - About the one-year gap on his resume. How did he explain it?
The treaty is broken. We're running a parallel program in North Korea. - You know that's not true. - Saul has many qualities, the most remarkable of which is his optimism. Some might call him a stubborn denier of what's happening right in front of his eyes.
Of course you didn't get breakfast, you just left. You don't need to get a court order for local clearance. You already have it, but you didn't send it because your blue federal access request was denied.
- Please, Lori. It's in your best interest to stay out of it. Whatever you have to say to us, you can say to her. No one cares that I witnessed a murder. Whoever did it attacked me.
Taking us to the movies and bowling to distract us? Of course I remember. And once they took us to a baseball game, I was too young to understand the rules, and watching people in the other section hit a beach ball. The whole stadium was watching. When the ball came to our seats, you stood up and kicked it.
It's nothing. I killed her hamster. What? - Yes. When you went to the conference and didn't feed it.
Did you? I didn't tell you because it was bought with yours. You should have said something. It was our house. - You loved it.
Oh, that's good. Now your cock, please, sir. What? Your penis. Put it in the other scanner, sir.
You back in Mapleton? No. Still in Jardin. Our house. They still call it "wonder town"?
In a world full of orphans, they stayed together. And I was a ghost. A ghost that didn't belong there. And that's when I changed my mind, Kevin. The physicists who sent me said that the first person to use the machine was his own inventor.
It took a long time to do that too. But I found him and asked him to create another machine, because he already knew how. And he asked me, if I had come all this way, why did I want to come back? And I said, "Because I don't belong here." And he created it.
There aren't many people like that. I knew right away. Max betrayed us. If it weren't for her, Nassau would be ours now with the fleet, there would be no prisoners in the fort, no rift between us. Instead, this is how it turned out. I believe that the chaos that reigns here, and the anger that fuels it, will be easier to calm if we give what we deserve to the one who is to blame for everything.
Thanks for helping me move to Sesame Street, Mr. Frumpus. Oh, that's a lot of boxes to move. We're done, we can go get ice cream. - Oh, I want chocolate first. - And you're gonna get it.
What did I say earlier? Remember, Titus? I said: "I want chocolate." And what did you say, Titus? That you'd get it?
Search him. Hey, you're gonna break his arm. I said frisk him. Hey, hey, hey, easy, easy, okay? His gun, pull it out and push it towards me.
I won't accept it. You really should have told me, but it's also true that I wouldn't have accomplished this without you. Thank you for your loyalty, but I can't let this happen. If we get ahead of this, we can minimize the damage. Who knows? Maybe even turn it into an advantage.
Carter's two minutes away. Surveillance is set. Mullins asked me to run the phone records for Eric Carter's wife. But I couldn't find it. That's because the NSA hasn't intercepted it from the carrier's servers yet.
I'm trying to help. But so far, you've done the opposite. I didn't want the list to go to the terrorists. That was easy to do, Ben. You didn't have to kidnap it from me.
There should be a catheter, for injections. Got it. Okay, listen. You need to pull back on the syringe, fill it completely with air. Then insert it into the catheter.
Don't you dare. Put your hands behind your head and move over there. Put your hands on your head now. You got a gun in your waistband. Put it on the floor and toss it to me, slowly.
This is unbelievable. You know what? I think I still have that ball. Signed by the entire Royals 85 team. I'll see if I can find it.
- Of course I love her! We tried it your way! I trusted you! But I don't want to risk her life anymore. If I have to give up the chest to free her, I'm glad I took it.
IN PREVIOUS EPISODES. - Your plan failed, let's move on to mine. Pick him up.
We'll continue tomorrow, okay? - We found it. - I don't see a chest. - The tracks go back about 200 yards. He dragged it this way.
Thank you. He never stays with me more than a day or two, but this. this riddle got his attention. It's quite a formula. It's a beautiful ligand. May I ask where you got it?
In our neighborhood they say, "All government is other people's government," and I want to build back the ryons.... A neighborhood for people like us. And I want to use this town. We'll take it over and make it ours.
It's the kind of lesson you don't have to repeat. I agree. I need your specialized skills, enthusiasm, and tech nerd magic. No one told me I had enthusiasm. That's because you hide it behind a mask of smugness, disdain and pessimism, but I'm not fooled.
Raya. I want you to hack Raya and make me an account. I can't. I can't. - I mean, I can try, but the site is protected by a 128-bit Blowfish encryption. And the brute-force method won't work to crack it.
Yeah. I have one of those, too. I was gonna tell you last night, but she's got a lot to lose, so, uh. Anyway, her phone is in my car. And if anyone finds it.
There's got to be a mistake. Are you sure it's him? We found this in the dead man's pocket. It was Richard's. I gave it to him.
I'm sure your teacher thinks that sometimes. Rory Adams Flight Engineer Well, we still have a question from eight-year-old Marie. Are you bringing the alien back to Earth? No, it'll be here. We want to study it in a safe place.
I'll use the oxygen candles to lure Calvin into the "A" pod. I'll close the hatch. I'll press the button to control it manually. If I hold the lever, I can change the flight path. If I can hold it long enough, I won't enter the atmosphere.
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, calm down. We can go anywhere and do anything we want. If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris. If you want to go to Cairo to ride a camel, I'll go with you. The whole world is ours, and I want to share it with you as long as we're together. And our home is wherever we are.
The food is wonderful. Let's go sit down. - Do you know it? - "The word-owl." I believe it's an enchantment for the blade to kill me if I break it.
I'm glad things are going well with the sex. We should get some coffee. Oh, man. it's my machine again. The problem with men is that they don't realize. the most important thing, the clitoris. Most of you can't find it.
Oh, man... It's my machine again. The problem with men is that they don't realize. the most important thing: the clitoris. Most of you can't find it. My husband never could. Neither could my lover. They searched for it like Nazi gold in the mountains of Argentina.
- Faster, Dev, faster! - Thief! Thief! My picture! My picture with Matteo Godardez! Why didn't you send it to me, asshole?
I'll do the talking. My friend's phone was stolen. Have you been sold a phone today? No. We can't find it!
He'll give up soon. I don't think so. You'll see. There's a new movie in the theater. I've seen it three times already.
- You? For good behavior? - I didn't have the arm length for more. Daddy won a trophy for his boxing. Come on, Mickey, get him.
Let's just say, Justin. This is between you and me, right? Uh, sure. My grandmother had a big, important goat. We called him the King, because no matter what you did on the farm, he was always sticking his nose in everything and trying to stir up trouble.
Looks like he's got three different accountants working for him. I'm sure of one thing: Mayor Richards has something to hide. Okay, go ahead, Dwayne. JP? Sir, I got the deed to Mayor Richards' hotel from Planning and I've been going over it.
Thank you, JP. Florence, do you have the number? Who did the phone belong to? It belonged to you. And I assume you put it next to the seismometer.
I don't want this. This is where I lost my son. This is where Fitz was shot. My marriage failed here. I don't want it.
Mellie, listen to me. I've had enough of these games! I am not! They stole my cell phone right out of my purse. I want it back.
I've had enough of these games! I haven't! They stole my cell phone right out of my purse. I want it back. - No one stole it, Mrs. Vargas.
Someone sent you a finger. - Are you sure it-- - Yes, it belongs to Archer Dunhill. The prints match. Do you know who sent it and why?
Allison? Hi, I'm Julie, we spoke on the phone. Uh, yeah, hi. I was worried you weren't gonna make it before closing. Okay, here's your scanner, just point it at the bar code of the item you want, and voila, it goes on your shopping list.
Guys, because I had to get my phone. "Play with me, Hannah. A.D." It's my turn. You were up, too? I was waiting for that phone to start squealing again. You hid it, didn't you?
"Play with me, Hannah. A.D." It's my turn. You were up, too? I was waiting for that phone to start squealing again. You hid it, didn't you? If Caleb finds it.
You didn't sleep either? I was waiting for that phone to start squealing again. You hid it, didn't you? If Caleb finds it. No, I put it in my purse.
I was waiting for that phone to start squealing again. You hid it, didn't you? If Caleb finds it. No, I put it in my purse. He's not gonna find it.
Wait a minute, do you hear that? It sounds like a hum and then a bunch of clicks. Trust me, this joke makes all kinds of noises. I know, I just can't tell if it's mechanical or electrical. I can't break through the firewall and hack it.
Yeah, I thought that's exactly what you said. Look, we've tried this a million times. When has it ever worked? It's got to work at least once. Hanna's gonna leave it in her locker, so we'll see who comes looking for it.
Today, she gave me Lost Woods. - She gave you the motel? - Yeah, me and Ali. Why? I think I have to pawn it to pay for the lawyers we're gonna need.
And I don't even know why. Я... I just can't. It's bullshit. That voice telling you that you can't. Every time you hear that voice, I want you to tell it to fuck off.
I've never done that. I swim to the buoy, take the goods and keep them. That's it. - And yet her prints are here. She found it, but she wasn't gonna say anything.
And you'll pay. You didn't mention my garden. The garden is part of your lot, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn. It comes with the house, mom. I think you should put it in, just in case a crooked judge throws out the number.
Okay, thank you. You know, Sarah. you and I have, uh. we have a complicated history. But I'm a boring person now, and, uh. I've gone soft, believe me. If you have something to say about Michael, I'd love to hear it. Okay. Uh-huh. When your call came in and Kishida translated it. well, you could say there are key words that trigger the system pretty quickly.
Whoever tampered with your phone used a fingerprint; since your finger is there, it's you. I don't know what you've tampered with, but be careful ... While you were in the hospital, the woman who attacked us came back with a partner. What? They tracked me with my phone, I brought it to Jep's to see if I could figure it out,
Don't give in. And don't do anything without talking to me. I will. Where are you going? To buy a gun to use on Connor.
Anything you want to say before we start? It's an easy descent into Avernus. "Easy as hell." I'm glad you believe in our sacred Conclave motto. Alec and I use it as a reminder to each other that we cannot be broken.
You're welcome. I drink a little beer, but my bartender friend swears by this Ipa. Well, I do drink a little, periodically, but I'll take your word for it. Cheers. You hate him.
No, she's too young. But she's powerful beyond her years. Raising Meji alone, I've finally found a magician who is unconditionally devoted to me. Do you like your new home, sweetheart? I found it just for you.
Are you sure? She's about this tall, pigtails, always, uh. wears a scarf. Where'd you get that scarf? I didn't. I found it, it's mine.
Says the girl willing to die for the Underworld yesterday? She's right, Jace. It's too dangerous. I'm not going to touch the sword. I'm just going to take it before it's activated and return it to the Clave where it belongs.
Give me a portal to the Institute. Clary, we can't. Now! It looks like it's already drawing power. We have to get to the power source and shut it down.
Impossible. I saw him, too. He's telling the truth. You kill Clary, Valentine will still have the damn Sword. No doubt in time he'll find a way to activate it.
- I can't. - Lies, Professor! This virus is tearing Gotham apart. Then there's nothing in this city more valuable than your antidote. We can demand half of Gotham, and the city council will hand it to us on a silver platter.
Don't say that. - We can help you. - Listen to me. Listen to me. Take over this city. or burn it to the ground.
There hasn't been a single thing you've been able to keep from doing yet. Maybe being left behind is part of the plan. How did Chase get you here? On an airplane. Do you think you can find him?
- And I love you. Mom, are you settling in okay? It's so great that you have a guest house. I'll be coming over more often. Yeah, in that case, maybe we'll convert it back to a garage.
Now, let's get to work. All right. (clears throat) Counselor, thank you for meeting with me. Well, from what I hear, you're looking everywhere. But for someone with a little money in politics, you're certainly spending it in interesting ways.
The prosecutor came to me and, uh. Are you talking about Adrian Chase? That's right. He ordered me to amend the report to say that the Star-Spangled Killer was guilty. That report, and you agreed and signed it, even though you knew it was false. And then you turned it over to the police.
All right. Uh, listen. I appreciate the effort, but I'm fine. Mr. Mayor, with all due respect, you have blood all over your head, and our concussion protocol is stricter than the National Football League. Well, I'm the mayor, so I'm canceling it.
What have you got? When my ultrasonic scream hit Vigilante, a small piece of his hazmat suit broke off. It appears to be electronically wired. Which means it's handmade. Maybe I can trace where he bought it.
- Yeah. Thank you. What's gonna happen next? I mean, what am I gonna do with your secret? I'm gonna keep it.
As you wish. This laptop contains 80 million rubles in transfers from Kovar's accounts to accounts Gregor controls. Yes, we know that, to distribute to the captains of the Bratva. It also contains 40 million rubles in transfers from Kovar that Gregor didn't tell us about. Open it.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher? You accept the offer to join Helix. I fully accept. What am I supposed to do with your secret? I'll keep it a secret.
Fortunately, I had a chance to see the document they are working on. Orekhovo-Zuevo. That's, uh. A shipyard in Moscow. Then we're going to the shipyard. We're gonna stop Kovar from getting it.
- Death by elevator. - That doesn't sound like Chase. First, I thought maybe Chase wanted to get rid of the witnesses, but I couldn't find any connections between them. Argus' security key was still on him. Then why go into the elevator without taking it?
Issue. After Damien Darke stole my security key last year, I started a new protocol to prevent any unauthorized people from leaking information or discovering my location. Access can be gained with two security keys. But Agent Pierce's key wasn't taken. You found it on him.
What do you mean, traumatized? Я... I was heating soup for her. That's all I could do for her. And it was on the stove, and I passed out, drunk. Poor Zoe, trying to grab it, pulled it down, and it burned her hands, really badly...
I hate to know, but how much oxygen do they have left? If they don't bother, five, six hours tops. We're here. What's next? There's an embedded chip in the CPU, but our wiring can't trigger it.
- No. It won't work. You said the hatch is titanium? Uh-huh. Hydrochloric acid will turn it into cheese.
One of my last happy memories. I don't think this is one of them. I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver. I didn't save our city. I failed it.
The cyclotrizan release has reappeared. Computer is searching for a possible location. What's up? That's great! What made you put it back on?
Everything hurts. Yeah. Yeah! I love this cake. Where did you get it?
By myself. Can you explain that? The flower is blooming. It's transforming. How do you stop it?
The flower blooms. It's transforming. How do I stop it? I have no idea. Why would you want to stop it?
It's not a bio-toxin or some mutagen, it's alien life. You still want to destroy the sample? Yes. Even more than before. Miller wanted to destroy it, too.
He wants to run it. NAOMI: Fred wants to protect the Belt. That's what he says. It's too dangerous to leave the specimen there. We have to destroy it.
Give them this, please. Hey, Alex. What are you doing? Fixing the Mars flag. You're ruining it, Picasso.
What happened on that station? It wasn't a biological accident. Someone was testing a weapon there. MILLER: Julie uncovered a plot to launch it on Eros. Tried to undermine it, but she infected herself.
And we celebrate the birth of St. John, and according to local tradition, this is the time when we welcome newcomers to the community. People used to set up tables in front of their homes and invite everyone. We will, of course, eat in the dining room. Are you inviting us to a Christian feast? Think of it more as a party.
Coffee pot. Isn't there coffee in there? Isn't there coffee in there? Actually, Ders, you mean a tasteless can of Dr. Pepper? Because we put tasteless Dr. Pepper in the coffee pot and turned it on.
I thought about turning back, but curiosity got the best of me. So I followed the sound, but the closer I got, the farther the sound got. Finally, I turned around and wandered so far into the forest that I couldn't find my way back. For three hours I wandered in the dark and could recognize nothing, but then I remembered what my grandmother had said about leprechauns. Despite my hunger, I took my bread and put it on a mossy rock, and fell asleep next to it.
Sorry to get you in the thick of things like this, but I need to know what we're up against. Aside from the secret organization that runs Gotham? If they can isolate the virus, they can create multiple strains that can be released on a massive scale throughout the city. And all they need is a sample of her blood. They won't get it from the source.
The shipment arriving at Pier 9C. Yes. It needs to be tested, which means there's still time to stop them from spreading it around the city. But, of course, if they find out you've discovered their lab... He's right, they could use it immediately.
My enemies took everything from me. Tried to kill me. Help me avenge them, and when I regain my throne, I will provide you with everything you need to free yourself from the shackles of ice. If I were willing to agree, I can only survive a couple hours out in the cold without a suit. And you don't have one, as it was locked away in the secret Wayne Enterprises prison after your escape from Indian Hill.
I guess he wasn't meant to be. You crossed paths with Nygma recently. Any idea what secret he's talking about? I have no idea. I'm guessing he just made it up.
We arrested him five minutes ago. That's not all. What's he doing here? He should be in Lucius' office. Probably moved him.
- Isn't that right? - Yes. The virus sample we got from Hugo Strange is missing. - Maybe Lucius took it.
The perfect Dr. Lee Tompkins. Why is she so drawn to a man with so much darkness in him? Such an appetite for violence? Only if something inside her... wants violence. Craves it.
I left him a loophole. You hear that, Jim? I left you an emergency exit. Did you find it yet? You should have found it.
- I can't. - Lies, Professor! This virus is tearing Gotham apart. Then there's nothing in this city more valuable than your antidote. We can demand half of Gotham, and the city council will hand it to us on a silver platter.
No. Don't say that. - We can help you. - Listen to me. Listen to me. Take over this town. or burn it to the ground.
You're doing it, Wallace. I don't even know why you're asking him. What was Wells doing with me? His plan was more systematic than John Doe's in Seven. And he had a little more time to develop it. About, give or take, 15 years.
Antibiotics won't help. We have to do something. We don't have a choice. So, what do you do when a banana ripens too fast? - You put it in the fridge.
- Fasten your seat belts! - What's going on? We're gonna move the train. How do we do that? I'll vibrate it.
I couldn't defeat Solovar in battle, but you did. You did, and now I run Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me. Solovar never wanted to attack Central City. You did. You took my home from me, and now I'm getting it back!
I have everything I need to escape, Wallace. No, you don't. We still have a piece of that rock. It won't last long. And once I get it, you and everyone you love will disappear from the face of the earth.
- He's gone? - If Savitar gets the stone. He'll run for sure. You can't get rid of that stone, Wallace. You're not fast enough to throw it to Speedforce on your own.
Wally. He doesn't deserve it. Let me guess. Do you? I know what my hell is like. I've already seen it in the future.
This way. Gently, gently. Okay, ready. Hand me the X-ray machine, - got it for us, hand it over, please?
I still remember what it was like to be Flash. I can teach him. Good. Maybe that's the way to defeat Savitar. But the city's still full of villains, and no Flash to protect it.
I still remember what it was like to be Flash. I can teach him. Good. Maybe that's the way to defeat Savitar. But the city's still full of villains, and no Flash to protect it.
This is where mercy gets you. This must be where Waller kept her suicide squad. I think this is it. Come on, let's go. Cisco, we got him.
She's ready. We didn't have it before, but now we have an advantage. All right. [Cell phone rings] You guys think about your plan. I don't need to be here to know it.
Why didn't it work? I spent eternity in the same trap. You thought I didn't know how to prevent it from happening again? The Philosopher's Stone. It's made of solidified Speedforce energy, and you gave it to me.
Celine killed my friend. I want to find out how to get revenge. And since our only weapon is currently traveling around Paris. - You mean the tuning fork? - Actually, it's called Arcadius' staff. Cade's enemies left it in the fire that killed him.
- Any other useless demands? I'm not going to release them until you bring me that bell. What do you need that bell for? I'm sentimental. I want it.
I'm not going to release them until you bring me that bell. What do you need that bell for? I'm sentimental. I want it. And I need your help to find it.
And they'll call as soon as there's news of the bus. Besides, we know about Sybil's excursion near Mystic Falls. We're headed in the right direction. All because she wants the bell. I've never heard of such madness. Says the guy who threw it off a bridge.
You know, one steals, the others think they can, too. Okay. But then who has the package? How--how did you find me? I'm sorry I took it.
I used to steal cars. If you don't get away fast, you're in trouble. Anyway, I know a black market place that has a Zat X-Three: a shop in North Hollywood. Problem is, I don't think the owner's gonna give it back.
Give me the gun. Please. Where'd you get it? - In her purse. - You gave it to me, remember?
Black Bill is... Us. Come again? When I was a kid, my dad used to tell me stories about a monster. He lived under our house and made us rich. All we had to do was feed him.
- How is that possible? - Crowley, I think. And now he's dead himself. That's what Hesse says. But Crowley's like a cockroach. I won't believe he's gone until I see his corpse and burn it.
Wait. In a real rat? It's not that bad in there. I had time to think. I was so fixated on keeping my post that I didn't have time to realize how much I hated it.
Thank you very much! So what do you think, Miller? You think her attacker sent that text? Well, it doesn't make sense. Why send it now?
Listen, I was thinking. if I stop by in, like, half an hour, is that okay? I just need to borrow an old laptop. Why? I've got some files I need for school. I'll bring it back to you later today.
- Leah, seriously. - Dad, please! Please don't act so weird right now. This is my spare locker key. If mom's computer's in there before the end of school, I'll take it home, put it back, and not tell anyone.
- What kind of presentation. Lots of them. Osmosis, the reproductive system, plant cellular structure. Okay, fine, but we'll take the computer. Thank you for understanding. We'll take a look at it for investigation.
What did you expect to get from him? I just needed to, uh. I wanted to hear it from Joe. You know, to get him to confess what he couldn't say in court. I tried to record him on his phone so I could give the police evidence, he took it away from me.
- Why is he being taken away? - It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I was doing some work and I came across this bag. Did you touch it?
All right. Let's go piss him off. You all searched everything two days ago. This package wasn't there. You want us to believe that you came across this suspicious package in one of your sheds, picked it up, left your fingerprints and DNA.
Ladies and gentlemen, the murder weapon. - Unbelievable! - Amazing! Stefano used a syringe with two needles positioned so that the injection of poison into Uncle Monty would resemble a snakebite. And then he took it apart to hide the evidence.
Smart. Yeah. But it's not gonna happen. I canceled the order. Told David to destroy it before anyone else saw it.
Hello... Hi. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. (Beep) My laptop was stolen, and I'm seeing it now.
I don't know what the fuck you're showing me. All right. We don't want any trouble. My computer was stolen, and the app shows it's here. Just give it back.
We don't want any trouble. My computer was stolen, and the app shows it's here. Just give it back. And we'll go away. So, can we take it back?
Can I help you? Sorry, I'm an idiot. I left my wallet in my room. I'm sorry, I don't know what to do. Call someone you know and have them bring it to you.
- Can you talk? I can. Thanks for giving me my phone back, I wish you'd done it in person. I didn't think it would make much sense. Did anyone at the station see it on you?
Okay, I used to be. But it's not mine anymore. I'm not in the mood to celebrate, so I thought I'd skip it. Oh. I got you a present. Should I return it?
О. I got you a present. Should I return it? No, no, you don't have to return it. You're so thoughtful. I'll give it back.
There's a cake for you, Dr. Reid. They're persistent. Well, tell them I'm in the O.R. and I don't want cake. You know what, though? Why don't you and the nurses eat it?
- Thank you. - ... outside the room. Thank you for understanding. Your cell phone, sir? I left it in the car.
And where did you hide it? I mean, the tape's pretty clear, he was in the couch cushions, wasn't he? It was under the blanket. Out of sight. Oho. So I didn't get a chance to see him.
Can you tell me where the nearest power source is right now? Jimmy, you got something in your pocket? Yeah, to be honest, I do. My cell phone. From this distance, you should be able to feel it, but you can't, can you?
Wait. Repeat after me. "On short notice, we'll shoot you a commercial today" "and air it tomorrow." We'll shoot you a commercial on short notice today and air it tomorrow.
What's that noise? It's like a bone being sawed. - Yeah. You get used to it. I don't even hear it anymore.
I loved Margaret. She was my best friend. It's just that sexuality is fickle. And sometimes I leaned toward men. Standing up for Larry as a family man failed. On the bright side, the airline found my suitcase and will get it here. So this baggage moment puts us in a positive mood. What do you think?
And that no more of our soldiers die from this drug. "Ingersol Pharmaceuticals must be stopped, Dan. Dan? Do you know the route of the Red Line in Shenandoah National Park? I'll find it.
Until I get my daughter back. Even then, I-- The only way to get my daughter back is to give them the laptop intact. Where is it, by the way? They better not try to hack into it.
Give me the address. 26 Tivoli Park Street. Hi. Here's your rug. Where do you want it?
The Register needs a Lois Lane like you. I think I know something that might help with the Blossom murder investigation. They say Cheryl heard a gunshot? That's what she claims, yeah. I heard it, too.
Move over, outcasts. I'm having deja vu. Yeah, we were here senior year, watching Candyman. God, I hate that movie. -You picked it.
Kevin called me. He said his dad found the gun that killed Jason in a drawer in E.P.'s closet. But, Betty, we searched E.P.'s trailer. We went through that closet. And there was no drawer. Someone put it there after we left.
Juggie, we screwed up. All of us. Breaking into your daddy's trailer was wrong, but at least something good came out of it. I'm sure my daddy just got arrested for murder. That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer. Somebody put it there after we left.
Veronica, wait. You and Archie-- Got closer? Maybe, why? Your father and I made Fred an offer to buy the SoDale contract, but Fred's still considering it.
I'm tired. Bye, bro. You were right. Check this out. Looks like Gunn was clinging to the joint to keep from getting pulled out.
Because we've already accused someone else. You never found Danny's cell phone in his apartment? It wasn't in evidence. Maybe there's something on his phone that we didn't find on the computer. He must have dropped it in the attack and we have no idea where.
- Tell the truth! Order in the courthouse. Here's the phone. It's marked with the code number 23. I think we should take a look at it.
We need those materials. Nothing in the cloud. They found a laptop at the blast site. It kind of burned up, but the materials might still be there. We almost stole it from the cottage, but no luck, the feds took it.
Don't you dare. That's what I do, Olivia. My job. Protecting this office. No, you're destroying it.
Now you know what inspires me. Yeah, yeah. Zelda has style. Really? Hell, I could even publish it in its current form.
Some of it. It's not worth fighting about. Two writers under the same roof. - What could be better? - I think it's financially better for both of us if I use your diary than if you publish it under your own name.
You were right. It's like riding a bicycle. Do you think my novel won't stand the test of time? I can't say. I haven't read it.
A hog firm bids for a spot in Duarte? You check it out. But you said "major client." That's the, uh. is the one with the weird name that's hard to pronounce. How do you pronounce it?
Roxie, tell me, how is she? Not good, Dr. Reid. She's losing a lot of blood. Keep pushing blood, give her maximum volume. We're delighted with the new surgical robot from St. Vic's, and you'll be pleased to know I got it at a good price.
In previous episodes. - While you were in a coma, your mind traveled to another world. That's where we met. They call it the Sphere.
Any connection with Oxford? Was vicar at St. Mary's for a while ten years ago. St. Mary's? Barry Finch sang in the choir there until his voice broke. Look at the mark on Finch's body, if you turn it, it could be a cross, couldn't it?
But I convinced him that your baby would be the best option. He knows I asked you. And he knows you said no. Yeah, that's what I said, and now I'm saying yes. You can have him as soon as he's born.
It's Ivy's flower. Reggie's gonna stay with us for a couple days until things settle down. Hmm. (chuckles) That's fine. Reggie, why don't you take the flower into the spare room and put it in a nice bright spot?
Baby! Meet your little girl. Let's go. I've waited so long for this baby, Patrick. Waiting for him and praying for him.
Tom, please put the gun down. - Why? - Just, uh. Why? So you can pick it up and shoot me?
Your reward is not being kicked out of the Citadel. You're good to go. Beware of paper mites. They like flesh, too. We must find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
Golden roses, what can we take. Your brother and his new queen thought you would protect Casterly Rock. Casterly Rock is no longer of the same importance. Well, it does to me, but my fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne. So you let them take it?
Casterly Rock no longer has the same meaning. Well, it does to me, but my sweet childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne. So you let them take it? Not for long. They won't be able to hold him.
I'm done learning from my mistakes, aren't I? How will you do it? With your sword? Joffrey used to wield it, didn't he? Never used it though.
How will you do it? With your sword? Joffrey used to wield it, didn't he? Never used it though. What did he call it?
Stranger things have happened. Such as? The grain from all the barns is loaded onto wagons, my lord. - And the new harvest? - Our men are already taking it from every village in the Vale.
Someone at Iron Bank will be disappointed. They expected to continue charging interest on your debt. We must find a way to lift their spirits. Yes, perhaps we can be useful in some current venture. My only current enterprise is to regain control of the continent and all its inhabitants.
Cersei's on her list. Who else is on your list? Almost all of them are already dead. Where did you get a dagger like that? Littlefinger gave it to me.
I don't throw words around. I will not put shackles on people. If given the opportunity, many would choose it. They had a choice. And they made it.
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never return to Westeros. But you did. And that sword has belonged to your family for centuries. I have no right to own it. He gave it to you.
Uh-huh. Bitten. The old lady life will never be boring. Well, that's good. - Where'd she get it?
The killer knew how to use a knife. Cut his arteries. You must know the technique. two cuts from the neck to the shoulder. That's a serious move, brother. Did you use it?
Tiny. - That's him. - It's a sure thing. You think he still has the knife? If it is, he cleaned it.
Come here. Take a look. Okay. Look for the brightest object in the sky, above the moon. Oh, yeah, I see it.
During the interview, they asked: if I could be any animal, what would I be? How does this apply to frozen yogurt? Did you use Tom's cologne? Oh, I think I did. I just found it in the bathroom.
You don't remember me? Your old apprentice. Marius. Yeah, you said it was the first trick you ever taught yourself. Now I stop at the very end and can't remember how to finish it.
No more birthday parties with cakes. Well, uh. Right? No, I had a cake for my 11th birthday. But I never tasted it.
There are some things you want to forget. Like my brother Taylor. He was always badgering me, making me feel like a jerk. Made fun of me, made it into a joke, but it wasn't fucking funny. One day we went to the fair. I went into the toilet, and Taylor took it and flipped it over...
All the airport security ran in our direction. It took me a while to realize they were running towards me. One of the radiation detectors thought I was carrying a bomb. I found it on a farm when I was a kid, right by the pond. I was dribbling pebbles in the water, and I looked under my feet and there was this beautiful black rock, so I took it home.
- Memory fails often, Noah. Everyone knows that. - I was there. You weren't. - You weren't? - I don't know where that text came from. I didn't write it.
Vannesa said Jake was out every night after the election. And if we knew where he was going. We could put the pieces together. The day Jennifer was killed, I picked up a satellite phone signal outside her cabin. She's around there somewhere. She did buy a satellite phone and she's using it.
I didn't pay Tom Larsen. - That was my-- - Uh, hold on. What? Your phone, give it to me.
I don't think about it. Yes, you do. Don't lie, Red. I know that look. I've seen it on a lot of faces.
She had a cell phone. I gave her one just in case. If we can trace the signal? ! We can find Huck and bring him home. Her phone stopped sending a signal hours ago. Maybe she turned it off, maybe it's damaged.
Think about it. So let's introduce him again. Olivia, this doesn't make sense. This bill and the way it's worded. No matter how we rewrite it a hundred other ways, it won't work.
- just like everybody else. - Oh, come on. What could possibly be the difference between you two? You know what we should show him? The wedding album. Honey, can you get it?
Is that my robe? - No. Yeah. He says it feels like money. Just be sure to wash it afterward.
You should have bought on Black Friday. Aren't those the best deals? That's what I told him. So, uh, about your surveillance request on the Meadows suspects. I can't sign it.
My daughter has a way to save us. This device was designed by my brother to protect humans by contaminating the planet's atmosphere with kryptonite. It would have made the planet uninhabitable for you. Fortunately, my cousin imprisoned him before he could do that. And lucky for you, I found him.
No! You said he was ready. He is ready. I just gave Supergirl the remote. Only she can turn it on.
You don't realize how beautiful he is. I do. It's what summer smells like to me. It's been that way all my life. But you won't appreciate it until you're as far away as I was.
I guess I'm not as strong as I thought I was. Barely made it down the hall. Do you remember that day. I picked you up from school, and it was trash day, and we found that old TV on the curb? Yeah, and you wanted me to smash it.
Yeah, it's total Delaware. Yeah, it sure is. - Denise! Jane, this story was your idea. I didn't even want to do it.
I have to say, I'm just shocked that you were able to raise that much money so quickly. Uh, you know what? I think I'm gonna go buy myself a gilet. "Vest." Yeah, that's what we call it in our family.
- I'll make you a deal. No, folks. She's, uh. she's not herself. The only consolation is that the bitch is with the Beast right now, and I doubt that's good for her. "Word-o-words." I assume it's an enchantment for the blade to kill me if I break it.
They'll save you and torture us. Where's my phone? I should call him. I didn't call him. I traded it.
Fred saw what the protomolecule did to Eros. He wants to control it. It's too dangerous to leave the sample there. We can't destroy something this important. We have to destroy it.
Even our friend. We were tired of being afraid that if we didn't obey, we would be cut off, our water would be cut off, we would be thrown into an airlock or rounded up in cells like test animals. Because that's the way it's been until now. But that's coming to an end. I stole your secret, Fred Johnson. And I'm going to give it to the Belt.
Even our friend. We were tired of being afraid that if we didn't obey, we would be cut off, our water would be cut off, we would be thrown into an airlock or rounded up in cells like test animals. Because that's the way it's been until now. But that's coming to an end. I stole your secret, Fred Johnson. And I'm going to give it to the Belt.
Few things are evil, but many things are hunger. Hunger is a lot like evil if you find yourself stabbing yourself on a fork. Or do you think your sausage sandwich just adores you? What is it, and what on earth is it doing? There are scorch marks on the asphalt where we found it.
When she realized that her cousin's life was in danger because of the insulin you injected her with, she rang the night bell to call for help. But no one came. Why? Why didn't you answer, doctor? Because you and Nurse McMahon had more important things to do? Because Claude turned it off.
Thank you, sir. I look forward to seeing you again. Thank you. Grandma, I brought you a rabbit. Put it in the kitchen.
It's exhausting. Do you know what the saying "Waiting for the other shoe to drop" means? I know. It came about in the late 19th century when people started moving to the big cities and living on each other's heads in these huge apartment buildings, where they had to live in houses at night where the tenants could hear their neighbors who came home after work by the thousands, sat down, took off one shoe, threw it on the floor.
Okay. Okay. Make sure you set up the camera so it covers the whole room. - I got it. You'll be able to hear us through this earpiece, but don't put it on until you get in the room.
It's natural, made from pine. But it's quite toxic. How much would it take to make another batch? I'll just bring the turpentine, that's all. It's not harmful to pregnant women? Not if I drink it.
That skull tried to grab me and pull me to him. It almost killed you. And he will if I don't do something about it. So maybe it's best to stay away. Nick saw him, too.
Look what David's holding. Oh, my God. I thought David killed him with a slingshot. But he had a staff, too. But for some reason, history doesn't tell us about it. David left that staff to his descendants, and David's kings used it as a scepter until the temple was destroyed. And then the staff disappeared.
Something about this staff bothered me. The staff was all cracked, like it was assembled from numerous pieces, and there was no mention of it in the books. Yeah, that thing bothers me too. If it's as powerful as it's implied to be, and it belonged to all those people-- How did the Destroyer get his hands on it?
Question... now that it's ready, how do we use it on the Destroyer? What if we dipped bullets in it like we did with the Destroyer, remember? We shot him with poisoned bullets and it worked. - I still have the gun. - You can go get it.
You gave us a house to live in, not to hold meetings. I don't care what you do there as long as the village is quiet. We've had enough excitement. We need some peace. May you find it, in the name of God!
Hold on. - I don't have anything for you. - You gave me this. It's the most beautiful gift I've ever gotten. You never take it off.
What does Miss Morwenna say? I don't think she's thrilled, but Mom said it's a great party, so I guess she'll change her mind soon. Drake, you've been a great friend, I brought you a present. No need, Master Geoffrey, your friendship has been enough. You can open it later if you want.
I don't think she's thrilled, but mom said it's a great party, so apparently she'll change her mind soon. Drake, you've been a great friend, I brought you a present. No need, Master Geoffrey, your friendship has been enough. You can open it later if you like. I'll be insulted if you don't accept it.
- No, I thought angels couldn't die. - He did. - Oh. Okay. Anyway, you were right. You said the world would want Genesis, and bad people would want him.
But I wasn't mad at him, you know? He was always throwing up and always falling down. I wasn't mad because he wore a suit and tie. I don't know where he got it from. God, I never saw him again, but, uh. he wore a suit and tie that day. For me.
Don't tell me you want to change the terms. I refuse. - Mike. - Hear me out. During the trial, I said I had a gift and I threw it away.
My ex-husband set this up It was one of his startups Can you give me your OffKey username and password? Yeah, it's ChandlerFamily1, and the password is, uh. Tom changed it every seven days.
Come on! You said I had the right to remain silent. Do I even have to answer these questions? No, but you do have to give us your phone. Put it on the table and unlock it.
Get out of here, you lunatics. You don't even know what you're missing. That suit was so tight. Must be damn hard to get it off, I imagine. Unless he never takes it off.
I can't help it. You can't tickle yourself. You need someone else. Someone outside your nervous system. - Get to the point, Tony. - Uh, excuse me. Anyway, I'm with this hottie, and she's checking out my peppers. She's twisting it back and forth, back and forth. And I'm stroking her leg.
- What's there to talk about? He's lying. - There are other questions. - Is this your office? - That's what we call it.
I am very worried. - I see. Where is your baby? - No, no, he's still a baby. - Okay, where is the baby? - I... I don't remember where I left him.
- About that woman who was walking down the highway. She was lucky she didn't get hit. - And the baby? Was he lost? Was he found?
We'll make a different you. Hi. Made you a sandwich, uh. half an hour ago. And then I ate it.
Я... incompetent to be king. And I am incompetent to teach the king. To be an adult is to realize your responsibility. A bunch of my students have conquered another world. More like given to us.
We weren't her friends, remember? We owe her a debt of gratitude. because we weren't friends. We have no money. We're wizards. Let's conjure him up.
Were the drivers mad that he was on the same road as them? Oh, I remember a few days ago, uh. I think it was last Wednesday. Yeah, it was last Wednesday. Will said he thought he thought some car was following him He said he saw it a few times.....
- We're looking for Quinn. Why, what happened? Is she okay? - We don't know. Her cell phone's off and untraceable.
All right, man, listen. Lady, uh. dropped her key. - A key? - Yeah, the key. And I, uh, ran after her to give it to her.
- Run his cell phone. The number he gave me is out of service, but I have his license address. 3942 Wyoming Street. Get a warrant. Let's nail him.
you gave him. Sire. Do you know the best way to tame a wild horse, sire? You must make him graze with a submissive horse.
The refrigerator's broken. - The ice cream's melting. - Let me guess. Because it's warm? - Okay. (chuckles) I'll call a handyman, and he'll be here in no time.
We could all learn from Anton. - Uh-oh! This yogurt is expired! - Did you see that? I could have died from it. And now Ehrlich will eat it.
He's hiding something in his rectum. What is it, a gun? Says he has no idea how the gun got there. All right. [Cell phone rings] What do we do? It's not easy to get it out.
We have to postpone the procedure. Why? Our patient just confessed to a crime. That means the gun is evidence. And since the father convinced his son to do the procedure, we have to get a warrant to remove it.
Thank you both. The D.A. signed the warrant. We're good to go. I don't believe Ray's story about the gun, do you? That he smuggled it into the prison?
- Nothing, we were just, uh. we were doing a visualization class. One more time. Close your eyes, Ariel. Okay. Do you see your shield? Now describe it for me.
- I'd put it this way. - UTIs are common in paraplegics. Been through it a few times. Life with a catheter, huh? It needs to be replaced.
Good luck? Ethan, are you kidding me? Nat, I've met paralyzed veterans. A sense of inferiority can overwhelm them. If you tell them that ground chalk can help them, they'll eat it every day.
Mr. Kessler, he saved your son. He's in surgery right now. But they promised us. We've been waiting for him. That man would have given him to Dustin.
Vijay, don't do this. You're making a mistake. - He's not safe with her. - Gemma. Vijay had a choice, and he made it.
Uh, I'm not so sure about that. Soon they'll find the others we knocked out. What's the score? Well, there's good news and bad news. Good news is the jammer truck is parked behind that shed, we can cut it off.
What are we looking at? Well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is the jammer truck is parked behind that shed, we can cut it off. The bad news is. It's guarded by a squad of heavily-armed soldiers.
A lot more than she paid you. If you have an offer, go ahead. Looks like we only have two choices. Either I shrink this case down to the size of a baseball and nobody gets anything, or-- Or we kill you, and we take it.
I don't know. Some kind of advanced code. It's like fifth-generation syntax. I've never seen anything like it. Every time I try to change it, I get thrown back...
We have no idea what Billy did to Darkhold. I didn't want to know. That was the whole point of giving the book to him. Well, we need to get it back and destroy it. - If you had given it to me.
Although, to be honest, I feel attracted to her now, sexually and otherwise, and I'm thinking about filming, but she might say no. - You Americans are too chatty. - It's our great vice. Our unit became aware that an object was on the premises. And we were sent to retrieve it.
You're in danger. I have so many memories of snow. My first time skating on my neighbor's pond. A month spent in the French Alps. But the truth is. this is the first time I've ever seen it.
See? Good as new. - And clearly stronger. - I know what you did. You stole my mind and loaded it into a nasty machine.
Apparently, they're looking for contraband. They arrested my neighbor yesterday for a laptop. - The drone. in my backpack. - What? I was gonna return it myself so you wouldn't get in trouble.
- Daddy! - She's just a child! Let her go! No! The hangar was in a state of disrepair when we first found it.
- That's perfect. I can't wait to rip Agent Coulson's throat out with a knife. And speaking of S.H.I.E.L.D.. we've tracked down two agents threatening the Framework. They're aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. As soon as we get the code to it, my men will be ordered to shoot it down.
- ... taken? - Yes. We've tracked two agents threatening the Framework. They're aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. As soon as we get the code to it, my men will be ordered to shoot it down.
My head, the one you ripped off, is now running a lot of these machines. And you don't know where it is. So you can do whatever you want with that body. My plan is already in motion. And there's nothing stopping it.
Take it easy. We're not your enemies. - Let's keep it together. - Shut your robot mouth. Or I'll have these people shut it for you.
Paul's doing it all over again. Hating Adam? He doesn't want to kill him anymore, which is progress, but-- It's because the baby's close. Maybe Paul's worried about how he'll feel when he sees him.
Hate for Adam? He doesn't want to kill him anymore, which is progress, but... It's because the kid's getting close. Maybe Paul's worried about how he'll feel when he sees him. He'll love him.
For the most part. He could be arrogant, especially when he'd had a beer, and of course he was a Manchester City fan, so.... Yeah, I liked him. We talked about you, about the baby. He wanted one so badly.
Okay, what do you want to know? Everything. Who else is connected to this? All right, all right. Just get that gun out of my face. I got bleach, and I'm gonna throw it in your face!
-Hi. Good to see you. -Yeah. I need to take this backpack off. -Yeah. I can't take it.
No, nothing, uh. I didn't see anything like that. - It's too early for that. - Yes. Is the cake ready for the Putnam's? Yes, ma'am. I just need to pack it up.
You're going to have a hard time without a husband. You should worry about your own husband. They need you to go to Jezebel's again. They're trying to get a package from there. Hide it until someone contacts you.
And the truth is, a lot of it is because of Mike. And I wanted to tell her, but--.... You don't know how she's gonna react. No, I don't. I haven't even told her yet that I knew Mike's secret before he got caught, let alone used it to make partner.
What are you talking about? He guaranteed he'd pay the money he promised and hire you at the end of the quarter. - Because not only do I want you to set up a hearing, I want you to take down anyone who gets in my way. It's up to you. You'll take the job and the money and take me on the board, or you'll stay on a sinking ship waiting for everyone to realize you sunk it.
Because I didn't fly here to blackmail this woman. And I know the story of the wind and the sun. What are you talking about? She's talking about Aesop's fable. Which actually says that if you want to make a man take off his cloak, you don't blow it off.
And I know the story of the wind and the sun. What are you talking about? She's talking about Aesop's fable. Which actually says that if you want to make a man take off his cloak, don't blow it off. Make him hot, and then he'll take it off.
There's something attached to his rib. Oh, my God! There's a wire. It goes under the skin. Pull it out.
To make sure that life and death remain separate. But if he crosses that bridge. He won't! And why not? Because I will destroy him.
It's all here. Oxycontin, Percocet, amphetamines, pregnancy tests. What's the ketamine for? Some of our guests fantasize about Sleeping Beauties. But the girls use it themselves.
Figure it out. What's in the-- What's in the bag? I just know it's important. Don't open it yourself.
I'll be right there. Hey! Where's the fan? - I'm on my way. We'll find it.
I'm not gonna sit in this heat without a fan. I guess that's when you took the knife. And at the same time you were making a fuss saying you couldn't find what you were looking for. Where's the fan? Which gave you, Judith, an excuse to go and help her find it.
- Not a word. I'm sorry you had to sign. I know how much you hate being one of the good guys. I seriously doubt they're the good guys. I finally got the dynamite, but I never got to use it.
- Helps dull the odor. Try not to drop ashes on my tools, Detective Inspector Bradfield. Based on the hypostasis and rigor mortis at the scene, I believe she was killed between 6pm and midnight on Sunday, May 13th. Cause of death was strangulation? The knot on her bra was so tight I had to cut it.

Cause of death was strangulation? The knot on her bra was so tight I had to cut it. The killer ripped it off her?
Even after you disappeared, we continued because you wanted us to. No, because old Rip was an idiot for believing time needed saving, and you're even bigger idiots for believing him. My patience is about to run out. Where's the fragment of the Spear? Right where you left it.
Poor thing. Anyway, your king is now doing whatever I want him to do, so unless you want him to flood the entire floor with your blood, I guess you'll give up the Spear fragment. My patience is running out. The fragment. Where is it? As long as I'm alive, you're not getting it.
Dude, I can't. I can't do this anymore. Okay. If there's a hole in your suit, that means it's damaged. So I have to go in and fix it.
No. No? Why not? The White Martians have infiltrated the reactor in the basement. And I need to shut it down before it gets overloaded.
They saved me to save Henshaw. They made me keep him alive to strengthen him. Physically, they turned him into the monster he was. It's so strange to see you as Henshaw. I hope I use him wisely.
Okay, try pressing the switches next to the helm and you'll go into manual mode, then I can control it from here. - Two minutes. - Nothing's changed. - The ship's still picking up speed. - We need to slow it down.
- Nothing's changed. - The ship's still picking up speed. - We need to slow it down. I'm here. I can slow it down.
- She's his insurance policy. - All right, people, let's get to work! Wynn, what's going on with Alex's subcutaneous tracker? Uh, nothing, it's been off since 10:00 p.m. Whoever took her must have found a way to disable it.
If my mother would have spoken to me in the same inspiring way, imagine what I could have done. I'm glad I inspired you. But, trust me, it's not always easy being a parent who inspires their child. Shall we test it again? I'm going to plug into the algorithm and run it now.
What are you-- What are you doing? Thousands of Daxam survived the destruction of our planet. All they had to do was get here. Shut it down!
Oh, come on. We both know Winslow can't keep his mouth shut. My boyfriend and best friend are in there. Maybe the president and Alex are right. Supergirl has to protect everyone. But all I can think about is that the two people I love are stuck on that ship, and if we destroy it...
- We're running out of time. - You said you had a plan? - Yeah. Koda Handshaw was in the fortress of solitude. When he broke in, he stole a deadly virus and used it to kill the aliens in that bar.
It was easy. Do you know anything about a VCR? I can't plug it in. I know it works. I turned it on earlier.
- I'm not going back. - Do as I say. Time trail. "Titan? We found it.
Go ask him to wait for me, please. Governors, we're running out of time. The fact that you are here in this emergency meeting for such a short time says to the American people that you are as concerned about their safety as I am. Terror is unacceptable. I don't accept it.
Soapy pole? Throwing balls into small hoops? Hammer throwing? I'm not exactly sure what it is, but we need a hammer. We'll throw it.
I'm more concerned about the atmosphere of the day than the events themselves For example, I wish there was a starter pistol. Just what you need! Why did you bring it? I carry it all the time.
Just what I need! Why did you take it? I carry it all the time. Be careful, sir. Point it at the ground when you shoot.
Initially, I was impressed by it, but now I'm getting bored Endless jazz and seriousness Yes, jazz is a challenge. I love jazz. A challenge in a good way, and I love it.
Why don't we change when we drop him off? - [LeeAnn] Yeah! Let's make some tags out of sheets and go on a new trip. - Yeah! Yeah. Maybe we'll find a gun. We'll go back to yesterday and remember where we put it.
But don't worry about him. Kanen is dead. - I wouldn't leave a gun at Truthout, you know that! I'm telling you, Angie's setting me up! - It doesn't matter who put it there.
Kanen is dead. - I wouldn't leave a gun at Truthout, you know that! I'm telling you, Angie's setting me up! - It doesn't matter who put it there. What matters is that they found it.
The young star, best known for her role in the TV series "Waterfall," and a Golden Globe nomination for her role as a young prostitute in Wendy Sanborn's "Bridgeland." The photos came as a complete surprise to James' fans, who have grown to love her so much. The actress has so far refrained from commenting. Word to you, Karen. Daryl found a contact at the critics association, he'll read my script, but they said to send it in a PDF, and what is that?
My golden retriever sits around all day barking at clouds. And eats cat shit like it's tapas. Paul, they have DNA, they have witnesses. There's something wrong here. Forensics says the body was barely buried, not very deep, and no one's found it all this time?
Julius, don't be rude. - The potatoes are gone. Thank you very much. Newton's second law of motion. You all know it, but as we delve deeper into Newtonian mechanics, you should not just "know" it.
- No more potatoes. Thank you very much. Newton's second law of motion. You all know it, but as we delve deeper into Newtonian mechanics, you must not just "know" it. You have to be able to see it.
- to come to me for favors. - It's not like that at all. Oh, yes. What do you want? The Paris receiver picks up the Berlin signal and transmits it to everyone within range.
Your father-in-law works on a top-secret project - called Operation Marigold. - How do you know that? We broke into his briefcase at your reception. We think Operation Marigold is a new, major oil refinery in Poland that could increase oil production in record time and ensure Nazi victory. Franz, I need you to help me find it. - Why would I do that?
Thank you, Dad, it's very beautiful. Kach, it's so beautifully iridescent. It's called refraction. All the colors are there, inside the light. The glass just refracts it for us to see.
Don't peek. You thought it was 1,000 times stronger than uranium. This element is a million times stronger, and it's not even in its pure form. It's beautiful. What shall we call it, my love?
Yeah, by car. Oh, that's great. Give me your keys. Where's your bike? I don't know if you noticed, but I'm pregnant, so I sold it.
All right. [Cell phone rings] Give us a minute. It's got auto defrost, it's got an ice maker. Each of these shelves can hold almost 4 liters of liquid. Can I pick it up today?
I'm sorry. Hamid. Thanks for meeting me. Do you have your cell phone? No, I left it in the car.
Thanks for meeting me. Do you have your cell phone? No, I left it in the car. Oh, good. Uh-huh. I don't want the agents using it as a microphone.
How did you get into the school? The caretaker gave me a key. The custodian? Yeah, Kevin Russell. And he just gave it to you?
"Home" was supposed to include throwing yourself on Matthew Wilde's neck? - I'm in love. - In love? Don't be ridiculous. You saw your lucky ticket and you grabbed it.
What about the boys? You can't have everything, Albert. Is Snake with you? - Yes, Papa. Good. I'll be there soon to fly it.
You asked him how it went with MJ. - How does that prove you were set up? - Angela, when I opened the drawer, the phone wasn't there. The snitch planted it, and he also killed Greg. - Or Greg brought the phone home and put it in the drawer before he died.
- (Blaine) Can you come with me? I could use some advice, especially given my memory. - (Peyton) I'll tell you what I tell all my clients. What do I get? - (Topher) When you hear a noise, just accept it and then let it go.
St. Patrick gave me this phone. It's from the Lobos' C.I., Hugo Sanchez. - What? Where'd he dig it up, Angela?
- Not me. - Then Mike. He worked with Hugo Sanchez for the Lobos. He's a traitor, he killed Greg and planted the phone to cover his tracks. - You can't prove that. Maybe Greg hid it in his apartment because he was a rat.
He did it after he erased his prints. And then he shot himself to confuse everyone. And then his ghost hid the murder weapon in Pravda. - We can't get the cell phone into evidence. Where did Patrick get it?
Piper, honey, is that you? What are you doing here? My baby got caught up in a prison riot. I worry about things like that. Please tell me you're not leading it.
Even technology in their hands has become a weapon that poisons minds. I know you're in pain. I know you're afraid, but you don't have to accept it. There is a path that leads to the light. I will show it to you.
Maybe he has an opinion. Ha ha ha. Very funny. - Albert. The uncertainty principle is true. It works. And it can be applied to the world around us. The point of a scientific principle is not just to be able to apply it to the world. It has to be understandable. Fundamental.
- Albert, watch out! Just, uh. Watch where you're going, please. What for? Why look? According to you, this car is a particle, but we didn't see it. And it wouldn't have hit us.
Execute reception Now, now. We just added a backstory. There's a law-- There is a law, and you broke it.
You're taking a long time. Show us the trophy. Oh, my God. It's a nightmare. How did you get it in your mouth?
♪ Beat, bam ratatata tatatatata ♪ I made it to get some people dancing at our parties, but I overdid it a little bit. Damn it. We can't crack that code. Why don't we just take it by force?
Behold the essence. Then you'll understand better. Helen. You're a blessing. His brain. do you want to slice it up and look at it through a microscope?
Helen. You're a blessing. His brain. do you want to slice it up and look at it through a microscope? What's the alternative? Throw him in the oven?
If you don't do the work, you don't draw lots. When the time comes, we'll write down all the names and draw. All right? All right? It's done. By the way, the radiation shield is ready. Who's gonna help me put it up?
We'll get out. Everybody up. What are you doing? Taking you home. You can save yourself on the ship. I'll take him.
I can't see anything. I tried to warn them there was something there. They wouldn't listen. What was it? My dog ran into the fog and something killed him.
Looks empty. Who wants to make a run for it? Could whatever killed him be inside? There's a drone with a camera at the electronics store. My dad and I saw it the last time we came here.
Surrender. Then you won't kill me. Skaikru made me kill my whole family. You're going home. The ship will protect you from the Praefer. Then I'm taking it.
- to send messages. - Oh, my God! - And you didn't tell us? - I had no idea what they were planning. Because of the code? You couldn't use your megabrain to crack it? !
I'm sorry. I don't know her. Thank you for coming on such short notice. It's about a commercial. I've seen it.
Hello, Tara. This is Fran Coughlan. He's out of town. And there's a new movie. Someone e-mailed it to Connor.
Talking is your side. That's good. Bullshit. See, there's a law, Ray. And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you.
We'd better go. It's a beautiful house. I have a talent. It's like a needle in a haystack. When was the last time you saw him?
- Your father's driver brought this. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome, Brian. - This coffee is disgusting. How do you drink it?
It took Honda 10 years to develop this model. И? Ten years is a long time to develop a car. Don't criticize it because it took so long to develop. "I'm not going to see Cologne Cathedral because it took 600 years to build."
Or is it possible? First of all, you have to remove that rather nondescript body. You can't do that on modern cars where the body is load-bearing. It's a skeleton. If you take it off, there's nothing left but a bunch of spare parts.
And now we're driving on, because it's time to set the navigation systems to "talk". We're driving down the Street of Conversation. - That hurt. - Yes, it did. Yeah, but not as much as last week's bottle bashing. So, the Mercedes. They've got a plan, an idea - the owner of the car can rent it out when he's not using it.
A coconut milk latte with caramel, please. Okay, a latte with coconut milk.... - What's that for? - It doesn't make sense. The thing is, you can't use launch control on a race track because you can only turn it on for three or four seconds, and because you don't know when the green light comes on, you don't know when the three or four seconds starts.
And I saved your life at the station. We're even. Really? Oh, come on. If I give you the gun, you have to promise to give it back to me once we're done.
Transfer to the wardroom. Aye, Second. "Raza, this is Galactic Authority Lieutenant John Anders. Where did you get our encryption key? Your comrade gave it to me.
Time. Very funny. It wasn't a joke. I've been studying the instantaneous drive for two days now. But I'm no closer to figuring it out. I don't know why it turned on or how to fix it.
Hi. I hope you don't mind me crashing here. The party's boring. This controller's broken. Yeah, I fixed it.
Oh, great. Now turn it off. - Really? - After everything? We can't be sure Brophy won't activate the return again. We'll only use it as a last resort.
- Hmm! 6-OY: She's not lying. Android and Fifth have been trying to fix it ever since we got it back. It's your scientists' fault. The engine's gone bad. So give it to me.
Android and Fifth have been trying to fix it ever since we got it back. It's your scientists' fault. The engine's a dead end. So give it to me. Maybe we should just destroy it.
Wait a minute. What the hell is that? Wait! Don't come any closer. Or I'll throw it over there.
What the hell is that? Stop! Don't come any closer. Otherwise, I'll throw it over there. You don't want to destroy it, and neither do we.
"We"? 6-ONE: With your ship. Agree to lay down your weapons and retreat. And we will guarantee your safe evacuation from the planet to the nearest neutral space station. What about the explosion? If they think we did it, do you think they'll just let us fly away?
Negative. We're cut off from the shuttle. We can't get out. - We have to get to the station's reactor. The anomaly is powered by it. We have to shut it down.
- and the Holy Ghost, amen. - Amen. What are you reading, Mrs. Raven? The diary of one of the first priests here. I found it in your office.
Bellamy. What? The truck's not here. How do you know? Because everyone acts for the good of their people. My men took it.
to die a forgotten coward or survive to be celebrated and remembered. Before the regent touched the sword, I slit his throat. Four of his bodyguards burst into the room and I killed them all. Since that day, fear has come to me before every fight, but I greet him as a friend.
Four of his bodyguards burst into the room and I killed them all. Since that day, fear comes to me before every fight, but I meet it as a friend. He makes you faster, stronger, smarter. As long as YOU control him and don't let him control you.
- Was he upset? - At first. but when he signed the first bill, he had that feeling that only true service can bring. The joy of giving back to others. Where is Jeremiah now? That's a separate story for a separate conversation. In the here and now, I want you to look at your peers and unlock their personal potential, and.... help them see it.

It's about millions of dollars. Fear. That's what I heard. The secret is not the absence of fear, but redirecting it. Using it.
You hungry? - Yeah. I love this show. I hope they show another episode. - My dad and I used to watch it, and I hated it. Now I think it's funny.
Honestly, it's a miracle we're alive. So, uh. no presents? Let's go to the candy bar, see what they've done. That way people won't think we're customers here. I can't wait to see it, and now that Randy's really done, I promise to give the candy bar 5%.
No reason. But there is one reason: aluminum. At least the taste of it. The taste of fear on my tongue. Most people try to run from fear, to banish it from their lives as quickly as possible, but me - I cultivate it.
aluminum. At least the taste of it. The taste of fear on my tongue. Most people try to run from fear, to banish it from their lives as quickly as possible, but me - I cultivate it. I try to recognize it, organize it, and use it.
I wanted you to be comfortable. I guess I could have done things differently. I don't know, but you could have done things differently, too. - So, Ms. Minchak, what do we do? - My job is to get the dirt before the competition so that if there's a potential surprise for October, we can do it in February. Just in time for the Super Bowl.
Richard is thinking. He understands me. We need a real heroine to flush out this commander crap. And why aren't you holding a cell phone? Я... I didn't bring it with me.
- It needs to be watered twice a day. - We don't have any water here. - Okay. All right, that's fine. We'll put it with the rest of the waste paper.
The deal fell through. But my speech! Я... Colonel Al-Saleh felt you could have been more enthusiastic. What am I supposed to do? Pull out my clitoris and cut it off in front of everyone to get something out of this world?
- Oh, man. Mike, that journal is your whole point. It cost him to lose you. Every detail of every day at the White House was in that journal. Where would you leave it?
I think he's a little elitist. - He is! But not in a good way. Yeah, let's get rid of it. But make sure you memorize the pattern on it so we can rent it for my birthday.
Oh, my God! The diary is definitely not in your crotch, because I've had a great view of those berries for the last hour. Look, I lost my belt, okay? When I was screened at the airport, I-- I left it on the counter.
Sure thing, Gary. Everybody, eat up! Danny, where the hell did you disappear to? I've been trying to call you all night. First of all, I'm Dan, and second of all. I don't have a cell phone because our morning guest dropped it overboard on the Staten Island ferry when he was portraying Melanie Griffith in Businesswoman.
- Amy, you promised! - What? Mike? What have you done with your 47 jumbled chromosomes? ! - Sorry, ma'am. I should have brought a journal with a lock, but I was afraid I wouldn't be able to open it!
June 20. For several days now Olga has not come to her senses. Her new appearance is unfamiliar to me. I know one thing: as long as the posthumous negative is stored, nothing threatens her soul. I hid the negative in the house, where no one would find it.
Where do all the strigoi live? What about it? Today I saw a tanker truck parked behind the building, heavily guarded by strigoi. They tapped into the building's water supply - and filled it with blood.
- It's the doctor. Neal sent me. Put the gun down or I'm leaving. What about you? I'll hold on to it until I know it's safe.
It'll go viral. The ball! Did you get it? No, I don't have my phone! I left it in the car!
Drop it. Hey. Dude. That's not my phone. I found it in these pants.
- (Liv) I'm helping Detective Babineaux investigate a murder. An anonymous witness sent a snapchat with photos of possible suspects. As soon as I opened the photos, they disappeared. - (jimmy) would have saved everyone time if I'd taken a screenshot. - (liv) when I need your advice, I'll beat it out of you.
- Yeah, go ahead. - What color was the festival bracelet? - Uh, blue, right? - Yeah, it was blue. That means she got it in advance.
- Yeah, it's blue. That means she got it in advance. It's for VIPs. I mean, there's no way she even went to the festival. It just means someone in the band gave it to her.
Let's go. Hold on. Hold on. We have to take out that sentry first. I'll take him.
From Sandstorm? I thought he went underground before Jane showed up. Yeah. But before that, he was transmitting encryptions to me through this temple. I still check it every morning.
Made Icarus wings. Stop looking at me like that when I know something. Pretentious students and lithium. It just doesn't add up. Maybe they put it in their Eregmeister and drink it.
That I, Gordon Meredith Enver, should be in your shoes, breathing your rarefied air like a visionary adored by all, instead of lurking in the margins, nameless and ungrateful, like some digital thief! Leave us. Gord. I'm sorry... that you feel that way. But I didn't steal anything from you. Yes, we started writing that code together, but then I begged you to come to Silicon Valley with me and finish it.
You're happy now, Mom and Dad, huh? Take this piece of paper. - Rich! Rich! Roll it up tight and stick it in your--
Hey, Cap, how about that diesel fuel you promised? Fuel's right over there. As much as you want. In the bunker, right? Could the Eaters have opened it?
. Did you look on the coffee table? Yes, it was, uh. on the china cabinet. Oh, good. (Chuckles) I'm glad you found it.
Sam. I'm sorry, but, God... what's wrong with you, Joe? The baby can't help us. He's just a baby. You need to take him to the hospital.
Two. It's okay. I'd like to think that one day you'll be an old man like me, boring a young guy with explanations of how to take the most sour lemon that life has offered you.... - Which is yours? ...and turn it into something resembling lemonade.
Thank you. - Uh, no? No. Let's just watch, okay? I'd like to think that one day you'll be an old man like me, boring a young guy with explanations of how to take the most sour lemon life has offered you and turn it into something resembling lemonade.
- Princess brides? - Kevin, seriously, what do you want? That movie scared you. I was nine then. Now I'll be 10, and I love it.
I'm just gonna grab a bite to eat. And up ahead, we have a building with yoga, drum lessons, cooking lessons, and nutrition lessons. And over there are the stables. Where's the gym? Did I miss it?
So. Thank you. For being an ass. I needed it. Like I said, my horses didn't like your voice. That's why I grabbed him.
- This is your moment. - You did it. You got your dream job. Lauren: "Where's my coffee?" Lauren wants coffee before the meeting. Oh, it's in the kitchen where she can make it herself.
I just realized what's wrong with your ideas. You're giving me the kind of pitches you think I want to hear. - Uh, well. - Your voice sounds new. I want to hear it.
Ma'am, we're seizing your cell phone as evidence. - You can't do that without probable cause-- - Jody. The phone is police property, not my personal property. They can check it without probable cause.
Sergeant Arnott. Where was your wife between the evening of March 17th and the morning of March 18th? Uh-huh. I assume you're aware of the right of spouses not to testify against each other? A spouse is usually a witness to bolster an alibi, not undermine it.
The map also shows the location of Hana Reznikova's abduction. Looks like your man wasn't in the right place at the right time. Just because the phone wasn't there doesn't mean Michael wasn't there. Besides, no one saw Farmer hanging around outside his grandmother's nursing home for an hour and 45 minutes. He left it there the whole time?
Those items were trophies. I believe that Michael Farmer treated them with the utmost care, kept them in a private place, cleaned them. So I didn't consider the lack of carpet fibers to be atypical. There was also a shoe print found in the house by an unidentified person. This footprint had nothing to do with personal items. As with the carpet fibers, having weighed its materiality, I excluded it as evidence in preference to the compelling evidence against Michael Farmer.
Okay. (Cell phone rings) A search of Tim Ifield's apartment turned up no laptop or cell phone. So we can assume that the killer stole both the phone and the laptop. Any sign of the phone? The last place the signal came from was Tim's apartment. Whoever took the phone was smart enough to turn it off.
I knew you had to have someone. You followed me. I didn't do it on purpose. But you left your phone at home when you said you were leaving for work. So I took it and tried to catch up with you.
Hey. Hey. What? No, we're not messing with your robot. What? He kissed me, not me kissing him.
Is it today's? No. No, the other one. I've been trying to make it work for years. No one understands it or wants to make movies with it.
No. No, the other one. I've been trying to make it work for years. No one understands it or wants to make a movie based on it. I don't need to read it.
No, the other one. I've been trying to make it work for years. No one understands it or wants to make a movie based on it. I don't need to read it. We'll shoot it.

I really like wrestling. Really? Yeah. I don't know, I feel like my body doesn't belong to Randy or Mark. And I don't know, I use it for me and feel like a freakin' superheroine.
Yes... What do you want to talk about? I want to know your secret. - What do you-- - I can feel it.
ƒYovid. śrosrosnit. - He's not in his memories, not in his subconscious, he checked. √Wherever his mind was, he couldn't find it.
This is your fault. I told you, the eyewitness is following us. Hold your fire! Stand down! Anger. Use it.
Turns out I was writing about the future in the past tense..... #Priority Issues. What's your point, Ms. Goines? The eyewitness kept a diary, too. I saw him at the Monkey Mansion.
One step ahead of you, Jonesy. Sit back and enjoy.... The word of the Eyewitness. A cocktail of history and prophecy, a mix of what was, what will be and what could be. Everything you wanted to know about Eyewitness but were afraid to ask. When leaving Germany, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys intended to take the manifesto with them, but were afraid to transport it in the open.
The lights would flicker on. Dizzy. Ms. Markridge. I'm sorry, but you've spent more than we bargained for. You've exceeded your limit. So increase it.
About what you said. At the cemetery. - I said what he wanted to hear. The happiest moment of my life was the day I found out I was going to be a father. living with you in that house. I can still see it.
You are a man of great honor. The thing is, I'm a woman of great curiosity. So I just need to know what you got in there. It's never gonna open. I special-ordered it from Offismax and it has an embedded locking system.
- (liv) Suicide? - (Babineaux) No. Look, there's a piece of the hair dryer, and there's a chip in the tile. A small piece of the hair dryer hit the tile and landed here. Somebody threw it.
Look, there's a piece of the hair dryer, and there's a chip in the tile. A small piece of the hair dryer hit the tile and landed here. Someone threw it. Probably from this spot. - (cop1) I saw it.
- (cop1) I saw him... - (cop2) Okay, what's your point? - (cop1) The point is it was in the trash! - What's going on here? - (cop1) Found him in the trash.
- (barb) When I left TIm's house... - (babino) That's not what we need to talk about. Let's talk about him. The ball. We found it in the trash.
Even the signature is crooked. But you know that, right? That's why you killed EvOne. EvOne owed you a thousand dollars in rent, so she pawned your ball. She switched it with another one, hoping you wouldn't notice.
There's one more dose left! - Where? What are we waiting for? - (Ravi) A couple weeks ago, I gave Major a syringe just in case. He didn't use it.
We were attacked. But our enemy didn't come down from heaven. He was already here. The Rapes needed only one resource to maintain control, and we gave it to them without a fight.
Someone's at the door. All right. Load the shotgun. Take the cartridge. Holding the brass end, push it into the charging chamber until it clicks into place.
I told him to keep quiet, that it was important to keep morale up on a day like this. I need your gun. - What? ! - Keep your holster closed, and no one will know it's gone. Just give it to me.
You don't need to kill all your opponents. We need to kill the last one. Octavia com Skycru has won. Skaikru won't take the bunker for themselves. We'll share it.
One clan, one fighter. One death instead of a thousand. The winner gets the bunker. I fought for all of us. The Skycru won't take the bunker for themselves. We'll share it.
Okay, hold on. We need to breathe, too. What about oxygen? From what Murphy told me about the local bunker, I think, uh. I'm praying for an oxygen generator. We'll take it with us, you set it up.
If it were me, it would be you or Clark. None of us would have done what you did, and I don't mean the battle. You were able to give people hope. You're like Prometheus stealing fire from the gods to give it to mankind.
I don't know, he said it was urgent. Is this about the deposition? No, actually, it's about a different nightmare scenario. I checked the timer found in the Arkani factory, and it's the most impressive thing we've seen from the BNM, if not other extremists. In fact, it's as good as what the US produces because.... we made it.
Both true believers, willing to die for what we love. Farooq, we got something. There's an "L" number written down here. It's on our list of possible Mossad operatives. - Dial it.
I'll put it in a safe place. Thank you. Uh, one more thing. A spare key to the house. I can't leave it under the flowerpot because of all those reporters.
Me and my sister. My mom used to celebrate every year until, uh. stopped celebrating. Well, don't just stand there. Take a look at the layout. Study it.
Every way I look at it, there's sand in the baby. I turn around, there's sand. Where is this sand coming from? I don't know. That's why I let them eat it.
Get on the table. Where are we on finding roman? I've got Peterson on the system to call Roman's cell phone every 15 seconds. - But he's not picking up. - But he's traceable?
He's been out of touch for a very long time. Naz doesn't even know who he is. - But he gave her his phone? - Yeah. Naz and his team at NSA tried to hack into it, but no one could get past the main screen.
Actually, I don't want to discuss it. We're already discussing it. Are you taking Bailey's side? Richard, you're going to a lovely dinner. Don't ruin it.
I was right here, uh. No, no, good job, Warren. Go ahead. You see the source of the bleeding? Yeah, I see it.
No, what? When? I don't understand, I mean... Many on Wall Street are asking, is Henry Rindell the new Madoff? Earlier today, the FBI shut down a restricted investment fund, recognizing it as a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme whose collapse wiped out the accounts of many members of the nation's liberal elite.
But doesn't your method lead to false consciousnesses? Very rarely. In fact, hasn't your method been banned by the police in Canada and England? I wouldn't say "banned." They decided not to use it.
It says, "Come and get it, Cam!" So it's not a mistake? We paid extra for a custom order. I dreamt it up. Put it on.
Okay, this is bad. Dad's already set up for pork. Why don't we get another pig? Like through your concierge service? I just got it. And it says "For Mitch."
Three by one centimeter. Nice, Yusuf. Can you zoom in on the camera? - Got it. Can you have the dentist sew up the hole and close it up?
You should know, you manage our contracts. We did. Looks like there's going to be a delay this year. Try this bread. They bake it every morning. My office is upstairs.
Hence the interest in conservation? She takes characteristics from general interest websites. For character. - So turn it off. Since you created this bot, turn it off.
She takes characterizations from general interest websites. For character. - So turn it off. Since you created this bot, turn it off. If you try to tear it down, it'll replicate itself.
- So shut it down. Since you created this bot, disable it. If you try to tear it down, it'll replicate itself. It's pretending to be me. So ignore him.
And you just screwed us. Under British law, this sale is void. What does that change, Your Honor? You've already identified the owner of the embryo. In order to take it back to England for a procedure that's now banned.
I love mysteries. Do you recognize how this list could hurt the firm? Are we sure it will? - Oh, yes. Mr. Kristeva worked hard to get it.
That's not true. Asked me to get out of the car to search it. Then handcuffed me and told me I was under arrest for possession of heroin. You were in possession of heroin? No, he planted it.
You don't look it. It's time for you to rest. Wake up Snowy and get some sleep. I said I'm fine! And if I need advice, I doubt I'll ask a pirate for it.
Or was I young, woefully stupid, and... Unarmed? If you had a flaming sword, a weapon that guards the heavens, that can crush everything, even the gates of heaven, then you would have won the rebellion. Why rake up the past? Yeah, I didn't have a sword, and after Dad destroyed it, so....
So if we could get your brother to stop drinking and show us where he hid it... I just wanted you to tell him what you told me before I made a mess. What mess? He's been here the whole time? Put him where I can keep an eye on him.
Father set a trap for me, and Mother was the one who made sure I fell into it. She did everything to make me feel what I... to make me feel what I didn't want to feel from now on. Now, that's it, that's what you've forbidden yourself to feel, that's what you need to feel. What, anger? I can feel it.
Mom! That's enough! It's not me that's wrong, it's the blade. All right, then. Okay, then we'll fix it.
A clue to what? You have to figure it out for yourself. And you think it's a flaming sword? It doesn't glow. Because only you, my Lightbringer, can ignite it.
Before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The wreckage is here." I thought it was bullshit, but-- I guess that's why the blade didn't ignite. It wasn't whole. After the riot, my father wanted to destroy the flaming sword. So, you're saying he broke it apart?
I know. I was waiting for an official "hello." Oh, I see you're still working on the phone. I knew Chet well. Maybe I could take it and try a few combinations.
And guess who has the key. Oh, come on, now. Who's got it? It says that God entrusted the key to his favorite son. Of course he gave it to you.
- Brother. - That you've always been Father's favorite, no matter what you've done. And you always have been. Look down. Is that a key around your neck, or are you just happy to see me? He entrusted it. to you, brother.
In every way. I know. And she doesn't care who she hurts anymore. Linda. I'm going to Lynda's. You follow your mom, she'll listen to you. But don't you dare promise her the sword fragment, because I'm not giving it back.
No. I'm not lying. Detectives S and P didn't lie. Sarge, tell me this faulty copier won't sink our precinct. I figured out how to turn it on, but the screen only shows a sobbing turtle.
I figured out how to turn it on, but the screen only shows a sobbing turtle. Apparently, the paper's stuck. And when the little roll appears and chops off the turtle's head? - We're out of paint. - Why? Anyway, I've started to take it apart, but the process is slow because of something.
Trouble with Charles. Stuck much, Boyle? Totally. Looks like the tail's tied around the sprinkler. I think I can get him out.
Here we go. Everything okay in here? Deep cut on his forehead. It's bleeding a lot. We should close it if we can.
It could have been you sitting there with your seat belt unbuckled. Yeah, but it wasn't me. I'm fine. And so are you. If you had a choice to avoid a plane crash, would you take it?
You're a surgeon. I need you in the O.R. You think wilson and edwards are standing around waiting for a chance to prove themselves? No. They're taking it.
You taught me how to... You taught me how to accept my past and find my way. Thank you. Thank you. I think I found it.
- Yeah, all of it. - You got the lidocaine ready? - Yeah. Good. Inject it around the wound.
It's the liver. - Take the retractors. - Okay. [Cell phone rings] Okay, got it. Get ready to pull it out.
The one that Emma cracked during their last fight. I don't understand. Why does he think killing Emma with that sword makes him a savior? He's not the first person to think that arming himself with that sword makes him a hero. We need to find the sword before Gideon gets his hands on it. Before he attacks Emma again.
The lake is shallow. We can cross it. What is it? Did you bring the dagger? I couldn't leave it behind.
Why? There's something going on with the magic. The source is in Fillory. - The flow is jumping. - They're trying to fix it.
Is that Rip in there? Get him out of there! As soon as one of you can explain what the hell is going on. We're here for your fragment of the Spear of Destiny. You see, if the League of Villains, who prey on anyone who tries to protect it.
17 minutes. All right. [Cell phone rings] We have 17 minutes to find out what's going on in there before the whole world sees it. Yeah, you're right about that. Gideon, download the original Apollo 13 flight path. We need to find it first.
Please don't tell me you scratched your back with the Spear of Destiny. Who said I was scratching my back? Well, Mr. Rory has now shown us that in the wrong hands, this divine artifact can be a very dangerous thing. - Yes. That's why I've gathered you here, to figure out how to keep it out of the hands of the Legion of Death.
What's the condition of the car, Doctor? Please tell Mr. Thawne I'm working as fast as I can. I've started the reactor. I just need to make some adjustments to the core. Have you turned it on yet?
I'm not the only one who didn't see it. I know. Think about your family. You'll be back. Haven't seen him in a while, huh?
No, because I can see now when people are being used. We use what works. Did your friend Shaana give you a similar bracelet? Exactly the same. And you don't wear it. Too bad, it's beautiful.
Your friend Shaana gave you a similar bracelet? It's exactly the same. And you don't wear it. Too bad, it's beautiful. It's stolen, like everything else. Wear it when you work with Shaana.
Hello? It's Guillaume. This phone was used to call El Mansour last night. They triangulated him.
- Yes. And it wasn't Debayi who briefed her. No, the call only lasted a few seconds. I think she was told, "Guillaume Debayi to ask you to buy a prepaid phone "and turn it on at such and such a time."
He can run, jump, update his Facebook feed. Death, where is your sting? So... Back in the TARDIS? Can you turn it off?
Can you fry them too? Maybe, but we have another problem. Opening the airlock was plan A for the station. Plan B is to filter out all the oxygen. To sell it back to us?
You don't know anything. All you do is talk and wave your antenna around. Shall I tell you what's in there? No. There's a Light Eater in there, and we're holding him.
It's powered by light, but it goes to sound. - What do we do? - Simple. We make some noise, lure the beast here. Send it back to the gate.
- What do we do? - Simple. We make some noise, lure the beast here. Send it back to the gate. How do we keep it there?
This is it. It's starting. Let Reddington know. Maybe he'll know who did it. That man has the list, or he knows where to find it.
Margo and Sasha will leave the country under assumed names... Eva Taylor and Lily Hum, can you, uh. - Track them during the conversation? - What about the list? Emma took it.
I think Carol Anne destroys everyone who comes before her. And that's a tough lawyer. People's feelings have been hurt, so let's close with "cool or not cool." Carol Anne spent 28 days destroying your image. Only Summer can recreate it.
We found out that Margaret had a cell phone that someone was using. I know what you're thinking. a ghost phone. But Josh thinks the killer has it. Dwayne, find that phone. And I dial it every day.
Look in the right closet. No, not the left. Don't look in the left one. Okay, there's a gray safe. You have to open it.
M: I need you to help me nail this bastard. M: What are you up to? M: He's got a cabin, right? M: There's a shed out back. Can you check it out for me?
Yeah, I found your journal here. It's very interesting. Where did you find it? It was under your pillow. You really should hide it better.
♪ The Richie Queenan Show on the radio, ♪ And he's the talk of the town! ♪ His teddy bear I grabbed him and put it over his mouth.
Yeah. I asked me to make your drink. Shall I drop it off? You don't have to apologize, Grace. But if you leave it by the door, I'm sure it won't go to waste.

My head is spinning. The Droxians fly across the galaxy destroying everything in their path. In this comic, the humans discover the mark and arm themselves, preparing to defend Earth. We should do the same! That's why I wanted everyone to see it.
Thank you, you're very kind. But first I'd like to confess, with your permission, of course. Five minutes. The locket is in the wall. And I have five minutes to find it.
- What's that noise? - A noise? - One minute. It's beautiful. How are you going to get him out of here?
Do you understand me? Yes. If you want to see them alive again, I suggest you do as I say. Get me that locket. I suggest we quietly remove it from Flambeau's body as soon as he's hanged.
Jordy? - Yes? They're waiting for you. So why is our friend Lawrence so obsessed with sex? Because he sees it as a discovery, as an exploration of ourselves, of our deepest darkest desires.
She still has a small scar. He said he didn't see me until he swung, but my brother was always a terrible loser. - The thing is, I was inseparable * defensive position in baseball with my brother and my dad. I was always more interested in being a boy. I tried to play softball, but then I hated it.
We need to breed crops that can withstand almost anything. And how do you do that? Well, we take samples of the most resistant wheat seeds from around the world, cross them, then infect them with the most dangerous pests, test the new crop, and cross them again. And we've, uh. we've made great progress, we're close to developing the strongest wheat the world has ever known. And you -- what will you do when you make it....

- Josh, what about the fine? Did you know it was issued the day Margaret died? Yeah, that was the day she took the car. Looks like the ticket was issued to a ghost. Or she got it before she died.
We had to. To protect you and our family. And when you were ready, we told you. I can just picture him there, writing his journal every night, jotting down his little observations about everyone, his parishioners, us... He should have kept it in the damn safe.

So if we can find the right fountain. We'll go straight there. I heard a couple of Librarians whispering. There's a statue of a stack of books by the poison room fountain. If we split up, we can probably find it in a couple weeks.
As visitors to my past work, you'll make a great focus group for my new world. I've built something here. I'm testing it out now. It's more of a pocket world. I call it Cuba.
So am I. It's my job to secure the territory. Yes... I think I left a work order in my truck. Why don't you go get it then?
We have to bring back the light. Let's go. Ryan, stop. Stop. My gun. I think someone took it.

She's not ruling out a natural mutation, but most likely our suspect worked in a lab. So someone created it on purpose so it could pass the fire and water of the city's purification systems?
If someone had told me a year ago that I'd be pouring my heart out to my wife as I prepared to fight for my mythical kingdom.... I would have taken more drugs. I have something that might help.

And we were late because of the "Hold Hands, America" event that you dragged me to. Hands were at 86, and you thanked me afterward because you were holding the hand of the man who held Willie Nelson's hand. What kind of action was that? Fighting hunger?

Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker with an update on the hijacking. As you can see, I've taken off my blazer to emphasize the seriousness of the situation. The plane was detected by satellite. Apparently it's off course and headed for Las Vegas. The government fears they may have to shoot it down.
After his death, the Jedi kept the sword until someone of the Vizsla family stole it from the temple. They used it to unite the clans and defeat their enemies. They once ruled all of Mandalore with this sword. The Vizsla clan honors this sword, and the clans recognize its power. I imagine Sabin was surprised when she found it.

Faster. You're not trying. At arms. The sword is lighter. You can feel it.
I want to pay $10 for a sandwich with Ellen DeGeneres on it. Maybe you hurt Veronica's feelings without meaning to. No. I planned the perfect breakup. We went out to dinner at a mid-range restaurant-- nice enough to show I cared, but not so nice that she'd think we were proposing. I even bought a first class gift and put a check in case she wanted to exchange it.
Lucy, make sure the cuffs are locked behind my back. Yes, they are. This lovely lady has confirmed that my hands are firmly bound behind my back. Now, I'm gonna get in the trunk. My brother Dash will lock it up.
Are you scared? Yes. Fear has become a part of my life. My son is only 8. He has a devil in a box. Every time he sets it off, the devil jumps out, and he laughs like he's just seen it for the first time.
They want our biology. You think the kid healed in a matter of hours? Yeah. Like Sarah, I make amazing babies. The doctor wants to cut it out of my stomach.
The thing is, the monks have some sort of encoder...so no one can trace the signal. Then I'm lucky I have this! It tracks the source of the signal and pinpoints the coordinates on the map. Cool! Where'd you get it?
Boy, one of your fine friends upstairs must know. Come on, Sergeant, you're my favorite. You should know! You get a permit to install a wiretap. You need a warrant, and since it has to be signed by a judge, you'd better prove it's necessary.
It's gonna blow my mind, though, cause I'm gonna blow up the lab. I need some kind of fuse. But what are you gonna blow it up with? Bacteria produces ethanol! There's plenty of it in the greenhouse and the lab!
And we still have 40 bucks, all thanks to things no one will miss. High five. Where'd the hair iron go? Who cares? Your mom doesn't use it.
A society of snowflakes. Because we're unique, and so inaccessible we're almost frozen. You know, snowflake, every day after school I go to my favorite place and treat myself to a salted caramelized macchiato. You know, that lawn behind the store? Yeah, I remember it well.
Okay. And? What does it say? No one knows. Everyone who worked on the translation and everyone who read it is dead.
European Organization for Nuclear Research. The world's largest particle physics laboratory. Why? Four hours ago, someone - apparently that priest - sent them a copy of the Truth translation from their computer. Remember what he said. He said: "I sent it."
That's not true! What about that picture of the chupacabra? - Photoshopped. - That treasure chest? Probably bought it at an auction.
What the-- Damn it, it's beating. Your Majesties, welcome to Loria. You stole our castle? I will return it as soon as you accept my offer.
Are you coming? So, how long have you been sick, Jack? The red lesions behind your right ear are indicative of basal cell carcinoma. Skin cancer. Doesn't look like you've ever treated it.
I need access to it 24/7. Also, our new product is finally ready. It's been soaking for 20 days. Twice as long as Ravi's recipe. I want you to try it out.
Ladies' man. Nice. I need to know how long the visions last. How quickly they start after you use it. That's, uh, after you eat it.
That's where we found this one. Wandering alone. Didn't seem himself. Thought you might have some tranquilizers. We need something to knock this freak out without killing him.
I'm thinking of getting one. I have to get back to work. That wasn't a request. It's nice. I told my brother he could put it here while he was in Iraq.
Did you tell John about the rape before you were married? No, I was ashamed, but when I told him what Stan Kendricks did to me, he changed. He triple-locked every door. Insisted he drive me to work every day and pick me up afterward. Bought me a gun and wanted me to carry it in my bag.
He installed triple locks on every door. Insisted he drive me to work every day and pick me up afterward. Bought me a gun and wanted me to carry it in my bag. - Did you carry it? - No. I hid it in the bathroom.
- Good morning, sir. Sarge. So, in the novel, Iris jumped from here, right? This place is becoming a tourist pilgrimage site. I assume you've all read it?
This place is becoming a place of pilgrimage for tourists. I assume you've all read it? Of course, sir. It's required reading in school. I can't imagine anyone growing up on this island who hasn't read it.
I'd also like to swing by the library while it's open and pick up a copy of The Blazing Tree, but if anyone wants to grab a beer afterward.... Chief's buying. That's very kind, Chief. Yes, I'd like to know what you think of Sylvie's novel. You've all read it.
What's the matter? Didn't she come to see you on Thursday for an interview? Yes. She was working late every night on a new section of her paper. If we read it together, where you wrote it.
Hey, Mouse. Where you going? - I'm busy, Daddy. - Hey, what about lunch? You can just wrap it up and put it in the fridge for a while.
You're a smart guy. You hear me? So get smart already. Drop the gun so nobody here gets hurt. Drop it!
Not exactly. He had a share. But about 20 years ago, Charlie left. The hotel was originally my parents'. We inherited it.
As we sat down, I noticed that the railcar behind us was loaded with barrels of oil. - Oil? If we could start a fire... They'd have to stop and put it out or the train could explode.
No, there's still places to go. Oh, Duke. What's up? Brought what I could find. Except my wallet. Couldn't find it.
The residents loved Valerie. Not so much me. Did she have an office or a desk or something to look at? A locker. I'll open it.
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Gently. This is Inspector Bacchus. Sergeant Coles. What were they doing when they found the body? We used to dump garbage in there, but now a German company wants to buy us, and they're very health-conscious, so we cleaned it.
She had no alibi, and we had a witness who heard the altercation. Was the knife outside? Yeah, right there. Right there. So either the killer threw it outside, thinking it wouldn't be found, or Alistair died here.
After Jerome left to get a beer, during the 15 minutes in which he was killed, where were you all? At the bar. No one left? It's a small place, Inspector. We would have noticed if anyone had left.
Yes, sir. He's 30 years old. Owns a garage near the marina. Family business. Inherited it from his father.
But we know that all four suspects remained there between Jeremy's death and our arrival... so where did the gun disappear to? Where no one ever looks at a crime scene? Police car. Archer hid the gun in our engine? Exactly, and then tore his overalls when he came to retrieve it later that day.
- Yeah, we don't. The gun could be anywhere by now. Dwayne, JP, keep an eye on Archer Brown. You got it, Chief. - He's hiding it somewhere.
Then they used the moment we were near Jerome's body to hide the gun in the police jeep, knowing that we would never look for the gun there. That's why we saw you outside the club that morning. Later, you planned the moment to take the gun, and when you planted the fabric of Archer's coveralls, you left the hood ajar so we could find it. And the final nail in Archer's coffin-- you planted the gun in his apartment. Archer found it first and panicked, tried to get rid of it, but since you convinced us he was the killer, we were waiting to catch him in the act.
In a way, I envy you, Emily. Your dad's poor, so you don't care if he respects you or not. Okay, you know what? You could learn a lot from him. He had a flower store, and no matter what, he kept it going.
A truckload of radioactive material is missing. Okay. Should I prepare a statement? Where's the truck? We don't know. When will it be found?
Is the senator under pressure? By who? Come back later, we'll talk. No, no, wait, wait, wait. Danny, I'm counting on his vote. -You can cross him off.
- Really? Athena can see into a man's heart. Well, in that case, I'd like to be of service. I have a recipe for a soap that's great for the skin. I'd like to be the first to try it.
Proof that he was working with trinitrotoluene. So we can close the Muriel Bruce murder case. Sisters, please! Remain calm! Our oasis has been taken, but we will get it back.
Sheldon, I just talked to the guys in Massachusetts about the emotion reader; they're ready to send you a prototype for beta testing. Oh, that's great. Although I'm not sure how I feel about being a guinea pig. Well, when you get the device, you can find out. Maybe I can use it to figure out why women leave me.
Beg, if necessary. That's very French, Catherine. And very English not to do it. Perhaps. It's my cross to bear.
So you were right. He was killed downstairs and then the body was moved to the deck. Looks like you've been busy. Unfortunately, my evening wasn't as romantic as yours. I spent it working on the victim's financial records.
He had a bag full of money. Cash. Lots of cash. Do you know what happened to that bag? Cause we never found it.
Cash. A lot of cash. Do you know what happened to this bag? Cause we never found it. - No, I never saw it again.
Look at the X-rays. Was it in his stomach? Based on my analysis, it looks a lot like computerized storage. No oxidation by gastric bacteria. The M.E.'s sure he swallowed it right before he died.
Mary Graziano, U.S. Department of Justice, National Security Division. Haven't heard the phrase "seizure of materials" since law school. What's this about? You have classified material belonging to the United States government. We want it back.
The zombies put a bug on the dashboard. They know where we're going and what we're saying. Did you get rid of it? No. We're using it against them.
I told you they'd find out. What's the matter? Okay, I can explain. The gun belongs to me, it was my father's first, from World War II. Years ago, I brought it into the office to impress the guys.
The gun belongs to me, first it belonged to my father, from WWII. Years ago, I brought it into the office to impress the guys. It's been in a desk drawer ever since. It was kept under lock and key? And anyone could have taken it?
That's not true. Although, I think my ribs are broken and I'm wearing a pillowcase I made into a T-shirt. - I'll have to think about that. Does anyone remember who had a laptop? Wait, we all left the room and went somewhere and I didn't want to leave my laptop with a bunch of strangers, so I took it with me!
How sure are we about our guy? Mrs. Doening said she saw him leaving the house before her husband had his seizure. She also remembered that he had a briefcase. Just the right size for the syringes and tools he used to get into the Doening house. Local police put up a sketch, but we'll take him to the morgue in Paramus in person, see if they saw him talking to the medical examiner who missed the murder.
You're back early. You're never gonna believe this. Leonard got me an amazing gift, a tour of a historic railroad, and I get to drive a real locomotive. Wow. He finally used it.
It's not even a math symbol. It's just Charlie Brown's hair. Sorry, guys. This club was so cool. How could they turn it into a bookstore?
Dude, that environmental movie we saw was awesome; seriously, I feel bad for people who haven't seen it.
Some kind of drops. I've never seen him use them. All I know is he gives them to her twice a week. Who did he get the poison from? He wouldn't say. But I can tell you where he keeps it.
- Who was he? - A child. A beautiful child. A unique genome. We tried to discover him, but, uh. those were early days.
He is my deepest regret. For the record, I wasn't a research scientist. But I synthesized the gene. You synthesized it? You inserted it into Leda's genome.
We need to know if the trait is inherited. You want to harvest her eggs. That's how he got in here. But he's wounded. We'll find him.
- You didn't? - No! But you used that phone. Yeah. They'll trace it.
Commercial hunting kills 20 times more seals than Inuit. Yeah, the last thing I'd want is for Tendu to be dead or something. Can you prove any of this? I have a draft agreement ready in my office. We both signed it.
Why would Thawne use the Spear of Destiny to shrink you? I don't think he used it. I believe he took Dr. Palmer's exoskeleton. Well, then it should still be in the lab. We'll steal it and enlarge the ship.
But you won't like him. So, where to now? I don't know. I've never seen my exoskeleton in here. I'm just wondering where Thawne would hide it.
This can't be happening. My gun is in the safe in the bedroom. The bedroom's that way? Yes. I put it there with my own hands.
This demon came from the vessel. If he's brought back, he can be kept alive. Why, so he can trick you into making more crappy deals? No, to save the one who made the crappiest one. Let's catch this demon, Winona, and use it to save Deputy Marshal Dolls.
Hi. I thought you'd-- Thought you left already. Yeah. I came back for Agent Zigman's badge. Bailey left it on her desk.
Address, please. If I tell you, I'm a dead man. I won't tell anyone. Scout's honor. But if you don't give it to me.
- He's a partner. It's not an ideal situation. You know, I'd be happy to, uh. show you my left hook. Oh. Well, I'd like to check it out.
I thought I'd miss my gun and badge and chasing bad guys, but I don't. Not one bit. Is that your tooth? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Can you come over here and hold it?
How do you know it's just one? Dad, I remember all my penalties, and the worst one was in this folder. And you think I know where it is? I'm asking my father, who was commissioner at the time I got it. And you're implying that I tried to bury it, son.....
Dylan, this cart's going to 63 and 6 as soon as the C-4 is loaded. But we have a problem with the propane. I'm gonna have to shut it down.
What's the matter? Stay where you are! Did you say something about better late than never? I forgot how fit you have to be for the FBI. You may have your badge back, but you still have to earn it.
Priors for illegal possession, aggravated battery, assault on police, . you know the drill. I think I'm gonna head back upstairs. That's a good idea. You spit on this floor again, you'll be licking it up, trust me.
- Mission accomplished, Mr. Azulei. And he's turning his private plane around.... - He has a private plane? - He has a private plane? Yes, he has a private plane and he's turning it around to Van Nuys in case I can meet him this morning.
All cities are on high alert for riots due to ongoing or impending protests. That's where "all agents" of the FBI are being called in. What does that tell you? Criminals are planning a riot in one of these cities. Or planning to create one.
Did you ever work with a courier named Lelantos? I don't recall. I usually work with Ethan or Ed. What about this symbol? - Have you ever seen it?
We offer full body scans, psychological evaluations and personalized nutrition. Sounds great. Well, a lot of patients rebel when I suggest they give up poisons like beer or sweets, but they all thank me in the end. I couldn't help but notice your scar. May I ask how you got it?
Sounds like he's a sociopath. We don't know, his mom never took him for a checkup. You're talking about me. Very funny. Although I would have loved to sketch out a budget and make Raj stick to it without a shred of compassion.
just do your laundry! Stuart, you don't have to make dinner. Yeah, I just feel awkward after this morning and to be honest, I'm not a big fan of meatloaf. Oh, what's for dinner? Meatloaf. Oh, great. Stuart made it. Oh, great.
- Trixie died and? And I forgot to tell her that. It's awful and the awful part is that I've been sending Bernie Christmas cards from Trixie ever since. Howard! Let me finish-- and one card with $5 in it I took from Bernie's purse. The notebook isn't in the bathroom. I can't find it either. How can he not remember the day?
You don't have to stop, just slow down. I'll jump out myself. Amy, look. I'm on a monocycle! How did we go from croissants to a monocycle? I hurt myself juggling. Where'd you get that?
Amy, look. I'm on a monocycle! How did we go from croissants to a monocycle? I hurt myself juggling. Where'd you get it? Howard said I could borrow it.
I'm on a monocycle. All right, have fun. Wait, can you help me off? What do you want me to do? Get our mattress and put it over here, then go to the neighbors, get their mattress and put it over there.
It's too late for that. Even if it comes with my resignation letter? It'll be kept with you, it'll have a later date on it, enough time for you to make sure you've made the right decision. - Why now? - Because I want to see if you'll take it. Do you really want this country to survive, or do you just want to burn it to the ground?
No bull tranquilizers. Don't set my pants on fire! Calm down, sister. Of course the house is ours. Mom and Dad left it to all of us.
I was just promised a new way to break the curse. Sold my soul to the Black Badges for it, maybe I won't have to kill everyone. Wait, so we can all get free? Uh-huh. I can stay here and protect him.
What am I here for, detective? Uh, we got a couple facts that don't add up. Have a seat. You mean the epinephrine? Well, you stole it.
She's getting her way, but I would do anything to get that day back, Detective! Anything. Michelle, she knew about the epi, too, right? Yeah, it's from our E.R. Could she have taken it?
Anything. Michelle, she knew about the epi, too, didn't she? Yeah, he's from our E.R. Could she have taken it? Yeah, she gave it to me for Shareen.
Please. Dolls, please. There is another way. There has to be another way. You'll find it.
We're done. She's staying here until it's over. One way or another. I brought you a sample. Examine it.
- I want a girl. - Predictable. - That girl's got a demon inside her. - Shoot her. Which will spread like a virus if we don't destroy it.
It's not that hard to do once we get the password. Rebecca's old-fashioned. Her computer's closer to a Commodore than a Mac, so she'll have a rudimentary password. That's the good news. The bad news is it can't be hacked remotely, so we'll have to use good old-fashioned human intelligence.
Owen, that goes for you, too. Stay in position. Alex, he's right. Owen, we need her earpiece. We can't let the cops find it.
I wasn't fighting for Skaikru today. I thought I was fighting for me, but now I know I wasn't. I was fighting for all of us. Skaikru won't take the bunker for themselves. We'll share it. Equally. Because we're equals.
I know it's not just a case for everyone. It has become personal for everyone. We need to take care of ourselves and each other. Otherwise, we just can't beat them. That's why I've scheduled a session with Dr. Sun for you tonight, please don't miss it.
Yes, but the odds are much smaller and we can take our chances. We have to stop playing defense all the time if we want to get ahead of them. Okay, but we're gonna need some serious precautions. Get Tasha some ironclad paperwork, an impenetrable cover story... and some way to communicate. I'll give you a prepaid cell phone, but you'll have to sneak it in.
Peterson, what do you have for us? Actually, I'm Stuart, one of the staff. Where's Peterson, Stuart? She had to step out, but there's a message you need to know about. Agent Zapata's phone was on briefly, we just got a lock on it.
Look, it'll take time, but he'll understand. I'll take your word for it. Oh, shit. I cut my finger. Put it under cold water.
I don't understand you. You don't trust anyone. And after everything that's happened, you still trust her? There's got to be a phone here. Let's find it.
Look, it may not help, but I sent you an app I just wrote to your phone. Maybe it'll find the beacon. Remaining time. Okay, I've got the phone in my hand. Okay, open it up and scan the room like a metal detector.
If you don't find him in the next two minutes, the glider will fly past the turnaround point. - I found him. - Then what are you waiting for? Destroy it! - Shepard swallowed it.
Terry, baby, talk to me. Where the hell is Moo-Moo? I think Terry has a little girl named Moo-Moo, and we forgot to pick her up. It's not a baby, Jake. It's Cagney's blanket. She calls it that because of the little cow head.
What's going on with Amy's hair? She has an obsession with braids when she's nervous, and she's terribly nervous about her sergeant's exam today. But Amy loves tests. Not this one. She's always wanted to be the youngest captain in NYPD history, but if she fails the exam, she'll have to wait three years to retake it, and that will ruin her life calendar.
I was so proud of you. And hold on to your crazy hair. cause I'm gonna prove to you that you have nothing to worry about. Follow me. Sample test. Pass it and relax, pass the real one, you'll be a sergeant, and in return, we'll make love for 14 hours.
It's time to, uh. for a secret smoke. I smoke shamefully and I see... The library. Captain, did you throw away my restaurant sombrero? Must have accidentally swept it in the trash.
- He's very clumsy. If an outsider saw the tape, they might get the wrong idea. You know, I saw the tape, and I was shocked at how clumsy this guy is. - Right? - And the funny thing is, I wanted to save the file, but I accidentally deleted it.
You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took the prototype and all our research and you didn't even tell us? I think you're getting it. So why'd you do it? You guys have finished phase one, we'll take it from here. Where did you take him?
Bear claw, excellent choice, Rebekah. Exactly. I learned your name. I learned everyone's name. Emily, I've been thinking. Even though you lost, and I can do what I want with the office, I'm gonna give it to you.
Welcome to our home. None of this would have happened if it weren't for him. We were cursed. We were supposed to guard the magic portal. The samurai managed to overpower us. But instead of using it to fulfill his purpose, he freed us.
We made it beige! Beige cars shouldn't be made. You look out and you see a man in a beige car. It's all beat up, the side window's a garbage bag... What's stopping him from committing suicide? What's holding him back?
Don't ask that shit. I don't know Achilles' mom. Don't shout out if you do! "It's Kampapatida!" Nobody cares what you know. She had an interesting question about Achilles. I'll tell it to you.
But she was holding his heel. That's an important nuance. She was holding him by the heel. And that's an uncomfortable way to hold a baby. The heel. Try holding a baby by the heel and dunking it in a river.
If they say, "We got a guy here, he's got the best dick. "He's got the best dick in the world. His penis has been soaked in olive oil since he was five years old. His whole life we've been feeding him nothing but oil and penises. He's got the best dick, and you can suck it right now!"
All his life we've fed him nothing but oil and penis. He's got the best cock and you can suck it right now!" - Well, let me see it! Can I see it? Can I take it out?
Can we get him out? Oh, fuck, it's beautiful! Oh, my God. Now it's my favorite! I shouldn't have fucking looked. Let him get closer.
Oh, fuck, he's beautiful! Jesus... Now it's my favorite! Fuck, I shouldn't have fucking looked at it... Let him get closer. I don't know what I'm gonna do, but get him over here."
Oh my gosh... Now it's my favorite! Fuck, I shouldn't have fucking looked.... "Let's get him closer. I don't know what I'm gonna do, but get him over here." I think you're taking it in your mouth after that, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's great. Making juice. You know the juice you need, the juice of life. Huh? Squeeze every last drop.
Zombie-in-chief. I'm not fucking-- I'm Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you fucking nerds! - I showed you my badge! - And if you showed it to us one more time.
I'm Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you fucking nerds! - I showed you my badge! - And if you showed it to us again. I didn't-- Whoever knocked me out took it.
That's your purse. Uh-huh. But that's my DNA test. I thought you said it wasn't here yet. So you, uh. Did you open it?
- Edwin Earp! Edwin Earp! - Of course it's Earp. Then you know the combination. Open it.
- Not so much. - Diplomat! He belongs to the Earps. Well, looks like there's someone to kill. Put it on the table.
You know, the only altar this head worships is a chair at the bar on Saturday night hockey. Where's yours? In the house of my enemies. In the temple. And you will lead me to the seal that opens it.
We'll decide later who's blaming who. - Time's a little tight right now. - Oh, yeah. We'll talk about it, Winona. The poison must be in her tonsils. - To extract it, you're gonna need this.
I didn't think it through. - Shit, is that my phone? - Oh, yeah. You have my--? Why do you have my phone? Did you leave it in the bathroom?
Oh, John, darling, I've got a toothache. It's probably rotted. Can you pull it out? - Annie, I'm busy at the moment, why don't you come over tonight? - I've got clients tonight. - Let's have it now, shall we?
"The Three X's don't leave their own behind. You gotta be kidding me. We lost. Mark activated the satellite, and it's bearing down on us. We're gonna have to shoot it down like a kamikaze.
- It's just awful. - What does it look like? Your dick is stuck between the wood. Shit, I can't reach it. Bend over and push it out of there.
Pathologist's report. It was all there until those guys switched him. And I got it all on my phone. - Where's that phone? - They smashed it.
I know that. As much as we'd like to, the dead don't talk. Good night. Your father said you had her gift. What would your mom say about you leaving him?
where he unleashed the dark forces of their alliance. But they had no idea about the sword. Merlin stole his staff. He forged the great sword Excalibur and destroyed the ancient tower. The sword was then given to the Lake Maiden, who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.
that sword. Only you can prevent it. You will meet him with the sword at the foot of the tower. Trust the Wizard. Take it.
- I don't like snakes. - Nobody likes snakes. Hold on. Look at me. You'll feel it for hours.
Okay, let's look at the facts. Get a grip. What makes you think this song can't be country-- Maybe you're.... so country. Take your finger out of your ear and shove it up your ass.
And the other one isn't. I'm always running, trying to be someone. Clinging to life. I've got real uranium in here! I stole it from Mom.
Splendid play! Yes. A farewell elegy for my dear Elizabeth. The pathogen didn't, uh. didn't accidentally break free on landing, did it? You released it yourself, didn't you?
Doesn't look too hard to me. Yeah. Well, thanks a lot, old sport. We'll hire you. I've been watching this show called Law & Order, and they solve crimes a lot faster. You should watch it.
Murphy. You got some hidden talent in you, man. "Then it happened. All I did was put a pint of 'Export' beer in front of Begbie. He took a fucking sip of beer.
Stay as close to the bottom as possible. Sharks attack from below, so if you're on the bottom, you'll be fine. This button inflates your buoyancy compensator. Use it to float up. This one deflates it.
You still have time. Charles, the world isn't what it used to be. We're taking a risk staying here, you know that. And the place we're going to, Eden, doesn't exist. Her nurse got it from a comic book.
We're home. Hi, Julia. No! Go to bed! Maybe it's because the ban expired and I can't renew it.
Diarmud, listen to me! You must go and leave me. - Without delay. - No. I can't leave. I will not leave without the stone. I hope God will forgive me, but I threw it off the cart.
- Mrs. Wellsboro, I'm sorry. - He knows what he's doing. - Is your friend crazy? No, he's just an asshole, but you're not far off the mark. Some scumbag broke in and smashed him to pieces.
Dr. Watson. I love his blog. Do you? - His blog? You don't read it?
Yes. They're all guilty. - Sherlock. And what did you call that case, John? Something about a murder at the zoo. Yeah, I called it "Murder at the Zoo."
Sherlock, are you all right? Careful, he's got a knife. - What? A scalpel. You took it from this table.
I saw it. I sure didn't do it! Look behind his back! Look! - I saw you take him!
It's an experiment. We need precision. Sherlock, pick up the gun. It's your turn. When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.
- For you. What do you mean? - If someone else has to die, do you really want to do it with your bare hands? It would be a waste of valuable time. I think you should just take it.
And that's just the flowers. Francis Francis, director of the Pappy Co., has made a statement. Teddy, turn it on. We are finalizing the world's most adorable puppy! We'll be showing it at the pet convention in Las Vegas.
What about this sprout? Can I hit it with a rock? No, Jeff. Kill such a charming little thing? Take it to the tailor.
You can do whatever you want. I'll do crazy things. But you know, Peter, this is a huge responsibility. Only we can reshape the universe. We're the only ones who can take the cosmos by the reins and steer it in the right direction.
But to do that, we need video from the lab. We need footage of horrific animal abuse. There's a problem. Their security is ultra-secure. But, uh. there is a way. We're only willing to use it with your consent.
I sent it to you. Tell that to your wife, Darren. Hey, Phil. Sorry, I gave your coffee to Dougie. He really wanted it.
I'll tell you about it at dinner. In the meantime, I'll tell you... how much I love you, and how beautiful you are, and I'll tell you how sexy you are, and the tits, how majestic they are, and that ass.... Give me a break, and I'll get you some bread. Why? Because I hear you've been baking it all day.
Come on. Get up! Why does Rand want to buy this dock? I'm not quite sure. Ward said to buy it.
Maybe we should use you to make a new deal. Is that why you came to me? I'm here to let you know it's in your best interest to never go near Joy again. Why is Rand so adamant about wanting full control of the pier? There's another group of people who forced us to buy it.
I've lived long enough to observe the change that has happened to the world. But this change, it seems significant. The devil of Hell's Kitchen. A man with impenetrable skin. But now the immortal weapon has left K'un-L'un, not doing his duty, but breaking it.
I wasn't born homeless. Yeah. Sorry. Most people pass. I need some information. about the factory, the guards, and the owner, Gao.
Looks like a tattoo on your chest. Do you have any connection to these people? No. It's a sacred symbol from K'un-L'un. Gao sends them to hell by using it to poison them.
In what way? She hinted that it was the Hand. Bakuto. There was a ceremonial knife in his office. I recognized it because the Ruka men used one just like it.
- We need to get you patched up. - Airport? We're going home, Danny. No. The path to K'un-L'un is open, and you're not there to protect it.
He really is dead. Let's make a list of things you're not allowed to say, and that'll be number one. If you still have the tablet, I could, uh. analyze it. Maybe prove the paperwork's forged. I gave it to Harold.
Holy shit. Did you even see him? I think I saw a shot. What? I'm gonna get him, man.
She will find peace. I pray you find yours. You've always loved this place. It's a miracle this park even exists. That the city didn't tear it down to build skyscrapers.
- You attacked first. Did you? - Why doesn't he feel anything? - What's with the fist thing? - I earned it.
- Why can't he feel anything? - What's with the fist thing? - I earned it. - You what? He deserved it.
How are you? Are you-- You still thinking about Matt Murdoch? He loved this town. Sacrificed himself to protect it.
We're going to die here. With them! Wait a minute, Dee. I got an idea! If we put Sherman's mouth to the bracelet, we can get out. - I thought you said you couldn't break it.
- Really? - Yeah, a little bit. - I blew the intro. So I'm gonna jump in. We are crow-enthusiasts who have decided to take the power and essence of the crow and put it into a delicious dairy beverage called Fighting Milk. I don't know what you're talking about, but I've heard about your product, and Cerrone and Felder love it.
I'd be happy to help you. I have a few questions. - Of course. - Uh, of course. The ticket we're looking at. Who purchased it?
That means she bought the ticket with my money. So, technically, the ticket is mine! Okay, let me summarize. Ms. Reynolds bought the ticket with mr. Reynolds' money. But mr. McDonald is holding it for her. That's correct.
I say. I'm not the god of war, Diana. I am the god of truth. Mankind stole this world from us. They destroyed it, day after day.
There's not much we can do if that's who I think it is. But we can stop that plane. If we could get a radio, we could call in the air force to shoot it down. No, if it goes down, it'll wipe out everyone in a 50 square mile radius. We'll have to land it!
If we got to the radio, we could call in the air force to shoot it down. No, if it goes down, it'll wipe out everyone in a 50 square mile radius. We'll have to land it! Bad news, there's a timer inside. If we land it here, it'll be the same thing.
Yes, Brother Owen. How can you forget him? OWEN SHOW Once a debauchee, now a guest in a nasty secret prison. Cypher used him and left him for dead. And if I get a chance to kill her, Jock, I won't blow it.
You love me. And you won't shoot me. You should have given him the case, because I'm not gonna chase you. All right. I'll take it from the corpse.
Well, now he's back. And Delaney left him everything. Including Nootka Island. Do we have a copy of the Nootka contract? Maybe our lawyers can terminate it.
Those who use it will go all out for it when their supply of the product runs out. The powder is called Colony. Do you have samples? Uh, sure. I could show you how to use it for best effect.
I stopped him at St. Pancras. Promised two shillings, I think you'll pay. Wait. Nitrous oxide. They call it "laughing gas".
Promised two shillings, I think you'll pay. Hold on. Nitrous oxide. They call it "laughing gas." I supply it for public parties.
Or it could burn. - Do you know what's in there? - Uh-huh. I do. I'd burn it.
- Do you know what's in there? - Uh-huh. I do. I'd burn it. Less chance of the river throwing it out at high tide.
To the wasteland! He won't let us move him. James. The gunpowder we moved last night would have been ready for transportation. That's why we moved it.
I didn't know there was a gun in there! He could have shot himself! He could have shot us all! It was under my feet! I moved it out of the way.
Came in the mail the other day. We haven't had keys like this in 20-odd years. Room 315. I'm pretty sure it's Agent Cooper's room key. Thought Harry might want to keep it as a souvenir.
39.57 52 north latitude, 71.28 57 west longitude. It's right here in Rosewood. 492 Hart Street. Wait, Toby, isn't that the house you built? I never found out who bought it.
Trying to get this Blu-ray player up and running. Do you know how they work? Normally, these wires go into the red, yellow, and white input. But this machine seems to only have this wire. I can't see where to plug it into the TV.
Even consecutive punches. Mason, are you sure this is gonna work? Whatever's in the cage is shielded from external electrical currents. So the Ghost Rider can't use the lightning to escape. We'll put a lightning rod on the roof and connect it to an insulating cable.
For that dagger, we'd live for a year. Where did she get it? I don't know. She never told me. But if I took it, it would be like a part of her following me around.
Excellent question. For murdering the Lady of the Eastern Woods, by order of the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, I sentence you to s--. This sword. I knew the man who carried it.
And we commemorate the day I banished this horror from our land. But when the two moons align, the Eternal Beast will return, and it will be worse than ever. He will destroy everything in his path. But if you build us a weapon, with our expertise, and your technological prowess. We can-- we can defeat it.
I know it's a lot of things all at once. Focus on one thing at a time. Focus on the pigeon. Come on. Can you hear it?
You didn't kill Glinda? Did you think I was capable of that, or did you just send me out knowing I wouldn't come back? I sent you to save Oz. Because I swore an oath to protect this world! And I will protect it!
What do you hear? It's raining It's raining Hear the rain? Hear it? Hear it.
I'm just confused. I assure you, I meant no harm. Let me explain. I picked up your phone to wipe down the closet. and the cord accidentally disconnected. I thought I'd better keep cleaning, so I left it.
The key is to penetrate the brain inside the skull. And quickly, before the pain spreads so the brain doesn't realize it's dying. There's an art to a good death. But nowadays, they give everybody a gun with bolts in it. You know what I mean? Put it to your head and--
The hammer. The one I used to kill with. It's a little dull, but, uh. You have to use it to keep it sharp. Blood nourishes it, makes it shine.
- This portfolio will remain closed. - Why? Because I fucking said so. He's just trying to break us up. He's angry and wants to get back at me. Open it, we'll look inside, then we won't suspect you.
- They don't want us to infect anyone. - Why is it on TV? - It's a cover-up. That's why they invented the fire! They brought it to Spain and it spread.
- Give it to me! No! - Give it to me! - Battery! Give it to me!
- Battery! Give it to me! Why now when it's useless? Give me the phone, I know who to call. - Don't touch it!
Let's see what you do because he's up to something. Right, Bearded Boy? We gotta get the gun. We gotta try something. We gotta get it.
Where's my investment? - Huh? I don't have it. - Speak up, I can't hear you. - I don't have it.
Do you need a ride? Where you headed? No, thanks. I'm on my bike. Just put it in the trunk.
Three miles of misery. What's so funny? It's Orwellian to call it funny. What do you care if I skip it? Who else is going to call it Orwellian?
- "What if I don't have hearing?" "What if no one can hear my music?" Does everyone really read that stupid magazine? I'm even addicted to it. - You've never read it?
Bye. Hey, Helmet. Yeah, I know, I just got a text. Uh, I don't know, I just called. Actually, I can just stop by and pick it up.
I have errands to run today anyway. That's okay. Uh, okay. - Uh, thank you. - I could have sent it.
It took hours. And then, just as she was about to dig the hole, she saw something. It was a bag of gold. О. King, he had it buried in the middle of the road because he knew that whoever pulled it out, whoever tried anything, would be rewarded.
"You want data from the smartest mammal in the galaxy, give me a proper brain analyzer." Well, order pancakes, I'm not going to leave this part of the brain. I think differently. Or you're relaxing your cerebellum..... - Shawnee. - or "nine thousand" is gonna fry it.
Where are you? At the workbench, Morty. You're invisible and you're gonna fart at me? Turn the pickle over. Yeah, I touch it, and it's some kind of alien dick.
Your belt was in his bed. I lost that belt. Many weeks ago. Where? If I knew, I wouldn't have lost it.
Let's not make this any harder than it has to be. Irling Munk. Dmitri Podnikov? He's the mayor of Vocobigina. If this is an official call, you should forward it to me.
You were never supposed to come. You were supposed to stay away. Someone took him a while ago. You don't know what it is, you don't know what you're doing. Who took him!
Are you making fun of me? No. The liver detoxifies the drug. The drug binds all the victims. Tavrani Tavra made it, Hindemith drank it, and Bianca was killed where they used it.
- And you me. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Yeah, my baby lost a baby tooth. - I put it under his pillow.
Between the shoulder blades. Oh, yeah. Higher. I'm gonna miss this cast. And you didn't even ask me to sign it.
It's a classic. - No need to ask for a bigger family since everyone marries each other. By the way, I've always wanted a little brother. I can, uh. I can give him away.
That's right. Not that one. Son, read my lips. Shit's pouring down on you, and we're holding an umbrella over you. Shall I put it away?
Right now, my body is heading for the bank. It's not robbing it. Come on, it'll be fun. All right, listen. We had a deal, or whatever the fuck you call it.
Is that what he wrote, "visual"? According to Mr. Adal, he did. So you didn't read the report yourself. No. Ask him.
- One second, sir. How did you get this address? In an e-mail. What e-mail? Who sent it?
What letter? Who sent it? One of yours. I don't know how it works here. I need to see him.
No buts. I didn't do anything. After you pushed me, for old times' sake. I did exactly what I was supposed to do. I wrote the report and passed it up the chain of command.
Thought I explained that. It led to Mr. Quinn holding Franny and her nanny hostage for hours. I detailed it in the report. I read it.
There's some bias with his interview. Avoidance. - About what? - About the one-year gap on his resume. How did he explain it?
The treaty is broken. We're running a parallel program in North Korea. - You know that's not true. - Saul has many qualities, the most remarkable of which is his optimism. Some might call him a stubborn denier of what's happening right in front of his eyes.
Of course you didn't get breakfast, you just left. You don't need to get a court order for local clearance. You already have it, but you didn't send it because your blue federal access request was denied.
- Please, Lori. It's in your best interest to stay out of it. Whatever you have to say to us, you can say to her. No one cares that I witnessed a murder. Whoever did it attacked me.
Taking us to the movies and bowling to distract us? Of course I remember. And once they took us to a baseball game, I was too young to understand the rules, and watching people in the other section hit a beach ball. The whole stadium was watching. When the ball came to our seats, you stood up and kicked it.
It's nothing. I killed her hamster. What? - Yes. When you went to the conference and didn't feed it.
Did you? I didn't tell you because it was bought with yours. You should have said something. It was our house. - You loved it.
Oh, that's good. Now your cock, please, sir. What? Your penis. Put it in the other scanner, sir.
You back in Mapleton? No. Still in Jardin. Our house. They still call it "wonder town"?
In a world full of orphans, they stayed together. And I was a ghost. A ghost that didn't belong there. And that's when I changed my mind, Kevin. The physicists who sent me said that the first person to use the machine was his own inventor.
It took a long time to do that too. But I found him and asked him to create another machine, because he already knew how. And he asked me, if I had come all this way, why did I want to come back? And I said, "Because I don't belong here." And he created it.
There aren't many people like that. I knew right away. Max betrayed us. If it weren't for her, Nassau would be ours now with the fleet, there would be no prisoners in the fort, no rift between us. Instead, this is how it turned out. I believe that the chaos that reigns here, and the anger that fuels it, will be easier to calm if we give what we deserve to the one who is to blame for everything.
Thanks for helping me move to Sesame Street, Mr. Frumpus. Oh, that's a lot of boxes to move. We're done, we can go get ice cream. - Oh, I want chocolate first. - And you're gonna get it.
What did I say earlier? Remember, Titus? I said: "I want chocolate." And what did you say, Titus? That you'd get it?
Search him. Hey, you're gonna break his arm. I said frisk him. Hey, hey, hey, easy, easy, okay? His gun, pull it out and push it towards me.
I won't accept it. You really should have told me, but it's also true that I wouldn't have accomplished this without you. Thank you for your loyalty, but I can't let this happen. If we get ahead of this, we can minimize the damage. Who knows? Maybe even turn it into an advantage.
Carter's two minutes away. Surveillance is set. Mullins asked me to run the phone records for Eric Carter's wife. But I couldn't find it. That's because the NSA hasn't intercepted it from the carrier's servers yet.
I'm trying to help. But so far, you've done the opposite. I didn't want the list to go to the terrorists. That was easy to do, Ben. You didn't have to kidnap it from me.
There should be a catheter, for injections. Got it. Okay, listen. You need to pull back on the syringe, fill it completely with air. Then insert it into the catheter.
Don't you dare. Put your hands behind your head and move over there. Put your hands on your head now. You got a gun in your waistband. Put it on the floor and toss it to me, slowly.
This is unbelievable. You know what? I think I still have that ball. Signed by the entire Royals 85 team. I'll see if I can find it.
- Of course I love her! We tried it your way! I trusted you! But I don't want to risk her life anymore. If I have to give up the chest to free her, I'm glad I took it.
IN PREVIOUS EPISODES. - Your plan failed, let's move on to mine. Pick him up.
We'll continue tomorrow, okay? - We found it. - I don't see a chest. - The tracks go back about 200 yards. He dragged it this way.
Thank you. He never stays with me more than a day or two, but this. this riddle got his attention. It's quite a formula. It's a beautiful ligand. May I ask where you got it?
In our neighborhood they say, "All government is other people's government," and I want to build back the ryons.... A neighborhood for people like us. And I want to use this town. We'll take it over and make it ours.
It's the kind of lesson you don't have to repeat. I agree. I need your specialized skills, enthusiasm, and tech nerd magic. No one told me I had enthusiasm. That's because you hide it behind a mask of smugness, disdain and pessimism, but I'm not fooled.
Raya. I want you to hack Raya and make me an account. I can't. I can't. - I mean, I can try, but the site is protected by a 128-bit Blowfish encryption. And the brute-force method won't work to crack it.
Yeah. I have one of those, too. I was gonna tell you last night, but she's got a lot to lose, so, uh. Anyway, her phone is in my car. And if anyone finds it.
There's got to be a mistake. Are you sure it's him? We found this in the dead man's pocket. It was Richard's. I gave it to him.
I'm sure your teacher thinks that sometimes. Rory Adams Flight Engineer Well, we still have a question from eight-year-old Marie. Are you bringing the alien back to Earth? No, it'll be here. We want to study it in a safe place.
I'll use the oxygen candles to lure Calvin into the "A" pod. I'll close the hatch. I'll press the button to control it manually. If I hold the lever, I can change the flight path. If I can hold it long enough, I won't enter the atmosphere.
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, calm down. We can go anywhere and do anything we want. If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris. If you want to go to Cairo to ride a camel, I'll go with you. The whole world is ours, and I want to share it with you as long as we're together. And our home is wherever we are.
The food is wonderful. Let's go sit down. - Do you know it? - "The word-owl." I believe it's an enchantment for the blade to kill me if I break it.
I'm glad things are going well with the sex. We should get some coffee. Oh, man. it's my machine again. The problem with men is that they don't realize. the most important thing, the clitoris. Most of you can't find it.
Oh, man... It's my machine again. The problem with men is that they don't realize. the most important thing: the clitoris. Most of you can't find it. My husband never could. Neither could my lover. They searched for it like Nazi gold in the mountains of Argentina.
- Faster, Dev, faster! - Thief! Thief! My picture! My picture with Matteo Godardez! Why didn't you send it to me, asshole?
I'll do the talking. My friend's phone was stolen. Have you been sold a phone today? No. We can't find it!
He'll give up soon. I don't think so. You'll see. There's a new movie in the theater. I've seen it three times already.
- You? For good behavior? - I didn't have the arm length for more. Daddy won a trophy for his boxing. Come on, Mickey, get him.
Let's just say, Justin. This is between you and me, right? Uh, sure. My grandmother had a big, important goat. We called him the King, because no matter what you did on the farm, he was always sticking his nose in everything and trying to stir up trouble.
Looks like he's got three different accountants working for him. I'm sure of one thing: Mayor Richards has something to hide. Okay, go ahead, Dwayne. JP? Sir, I got the deed to Mayor Richards' hotel from Planning and I've been going over it.
Thank you, JP. Florence, do you have the number? Who did the phone belong to? It belonged to you. And I assume you put it next to the seismometer.
I don't want this. This is where I lost my son. This is where Fitz was shot. My marriage failed here. I don't want it.
Mellie, listen to me. I've had enough of these games! I am not! They stole my cell phone right out of my purse. I want it back.
I've had enough of these games! I haven't! They stole my cell phone right out of my purse. I want it back. - No one stole it, Mrs. Vargas.
Someone sent you a finger. - Are you sure it-- - Yes, it belongs to Archer Dunhill. The prints match. Do you know who sent it and why?
Allison? Hi, I'm Julie, we spoke on the phone. Uh, yeah, hi. I was worried you weren't gonna make it before closing. Okay, here's your scanner, just point it at the bar code of the item you want, and voila, it goes on your shopping list.
Guys, because I had to get my phone. "Play with me, Hannah. A.D." It's my turn. You were up, too? I was waiting for that phone to start squealing again. You hid it, didn't you?
"Play with me, Hannah. A.D." It's my turn. You were up, too? I was waiting for that phone to start squealing again. You hid it, didn't you? If Caleb finds it.
You didn't sleep either? I was waiting for that phone to start squealing again. You hid it, didn't you? If Caleb finds it. No, I put it in my purse.
I was waiting for that phone to start squealing again. You hid it, didn't you? If Caleb finds it. No, I put it in my purse. He's not gonna find it.
Wait a minute, do you hear that? It sounds like a hum and then a bunch of clicks. Trust me, this joke makes all kinds of noises. I know, I just can't tell if it's mechanical or electrical. I can't break through the firewall and hack it.
Yeah, I thought that's exactly what you said. Look, we've tried this a million times. When has it ever worked? It's got to work at least once. Hanna's gonna leave it in her locker, so we'll see who comes looking for it.
Today, she gave me Lost Woods. - She gave you the motel? - Yeah, me and Ali. Why? I think I have to pawn it to pay for the lawyers we're gonna need.
And I don't even know why. Я... I just can't. It's bullshit. That voice telling you that you can't. Every time you hear that voice, I want you to tell it to fuck off.
I've never done that. I swim to the buoy, take the goods and keep them. That's it. - And yet her prints are here. She found it, but she wasn't gonna say anything.
And you'll pay. You didn't mention my garden. The garden is part of your lot, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn. It comes with the house, mom. I think you should put it in, just in case a crooked judge throws out the number.
Okay, thank you. You know, Sarah. you and I have, uh. we have a complicated history. But I'm a boring person now, and, uh. I've gone soft, believe me. If you have something to say about Michael, I'd love to hear it. Okay. Uh-huh. When your call came in and Kishida translated it. well, you could say there are key words that trigger the system pretty quickly.
Whoever tampered with your phone used a fingerprint; since your finger is there, it's you. I don't know what you've tampered with, but be careful ... While you were in the hospital, the woman who attacked us came back with a partner. What? They tracked me with my phone, I brought it to Jep's to see if I could figure it out,
Don't give in. And don't do anything without talking to me. I will. Where are you going? To buy a gun to use on Connor.
Anything you want to say before we start? It's an easy descent into Avernus. "Easy as hell." I'm glad you believe in our sacred Conclave motto. Alec and I use it as a reminder to each other that we cannot be broken.
You're welcome. I drink a little beer, but my bartender friend swears by this Ipa. Well, I do drink a little, periodically, but I'll take your word for it. Cheers. You hate him.
No, she's too young. But she's powerful beyond her years. Raising Meji alone, I've finally found a magician who is unconditionally devoted to me. Do you like your new home, sweetheart? I found it just for you.
Are you sure? She's about this tall, pigtails, always, uh. wears a scarf. Where'd you get that scarf? I didn't. I found it, it's mine.
Says the girl willing to die for the Underworld yesterday? She's right, Jace. It's too dangerous. I'm not going to touch the sword. I'm just going to take it before it's activated and return it to the Clave where it belongs.
Give me a portal to the Institute. Clary, we can't. Now! It looks like it's already drawing power. We have to get to the power source and shut it down.
Impossible. I saw him, too. He's telling the truth. You kill Clary, Valentine will still have the damn Sword. No doubt in time he'll find a way to activate it.
- I can't. - Lies, Professor! This virus is tearing Gotham apart. Then there's nothing in this city more valuable than your antidote. We can demand half of Gotham, and the city council will hand it to us on a silver platter.
Don't say that. - We can help you. - Listen to me. Listen to me. Take over this city. or burn it to the ground.
There hasn't been a single thing you've been able to keep from doing yet. Maybe being left behind is part of the plan. How did Chase get you here? On an airplane. Do you think you can find him?
- And I love you. Mom, are you settling in okay? It's so great that you have a guest house. I'll be coming over more often. Yeah, in that case, maybe we'll convert it back to a garage.
Now, let's get to work. All right. (clears throat) Counselor, thank you for meeting with me. Well, from what I hear, you're looking everywhere. But for someone with a little money in politics, you're certainly spending it in interesting ways.
The prosecutor came to me and, uh. Are you talking about Adrian Chase? That's right. He ordered me to amend the report to say that the Star-Spangled Killer was guilty. That report, and you agreed and signed it, even though you knew it was false. And then you turned it over to the police.
All right. Uh, listen. I appreciate the effort, but I'm fine. Mr. Mayor, with all due respect, you have blood all over your head, and our concussion protocol is stricter than the National Football League. Well, I'm the mayor, so I'm canceling it.
What have you got? When my ultrasonic scream hit Vigilante, a small piece of his hazmat suit broke off. It appears to be electronically wired. Which means it's handmade. Maybe I can trace where he bought it.
- Yeah. Thank you. What's gonna happen next? I mean, what am I gonna do with your secret? I'm gonna keep it.
As you wish. This laptop contains 80 million rubles in transfers from Kovar's accounts to accounts Gregor controls. Yes, we know that, to distribute to the captains of the Bratva. It also contains 40 million rubles in transfers from Kovar that Gregor didn't tell us about. Open it.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher? You accept the offer to join Helix. I fully accept. What am I supposed to do with your secret? I'll keep it a secret.
Fortunately, I had a chance to see the document they are working on. Orekhovo-Zuevo. That's, uh. A shipyard in Moscow. Then we're going to the shipyard. We're gonna stop Kovar from getting it.
- Death by elevator. - That doesn't sound like Chase. First, I thought maybe Chase wanted to get rid of the witnesses, but I couldn't find any connections between them. Argus' security key was still on him. Then why go into the elevator without taking it?
Issue. After Damien Darke stole my security key last year, I started a new protocol to prevent any unauthorized people from leaking information or discovering my location. Access can be gained with two security keys. But Agent Pierce's key wasn't taken. You found it on him.
What do you mean, traumatized? Я... I was heating soup for her. That's all I could do for her. And it was on the stove, and I passed out, drunk. Poor Zoe, trying to grab it, pulled it down, and it burned her hands, really badly...
I hate to know, but how much oxygen do they have left? If they don't bother, five, six hours tops. We're here. What's next? There's an embedded chip in the CPU, but our wiring can't trigger it.
- No. It won't work. You said the hatch is titanium? Uh-huh. Hydrochloric acid will turn it into cheese.
One of my last happy memories. I don't think this is one of them. I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver. I didn't save our city. I failed it.
The cyclotrizan release has reappeared. Computer is searching for a possible location. What's up? That's great! What made you put it back on?
Everything hurts. Yeah. Yeah! I love this cake. Where did you get it?
By myself. Can you explain that? The flower is blooming. It's transforming. How do you stop it?
The flower blooms. It's transforming. How do I stop it? I have no idea. Why would you want to stop it?
It's not a bio-toxin or some mutagen, it's alien life. You still want to destroy the sample? Yes. Even more than before. Miller wanted to destroy it, too.
He wants to run it. NAOMI: Fred wants to protect the Belt. That's what he says. It's too dangerous to leave the specimen there. We have to destroy it.
Give them this, please. Hey, Alex. What are you doing? Fixing the Mars flag. You're ruining it, Picasso.
What happened on that station? It wasn't a biological accident. Someone was testing a weapon there. MILLER: Julie uncovered a plot to launch it on Eros. Tried to undermine it, but she infected herself.
And we celebrate the birth of St. John, and according to local tradition, this is the time when we welcome newcomers to the community. People used to set up tables in front of their homes and invite everyone. We will, of course, eat in the dining room. Are you inviting us to a Christian feast? Think of it more as a party.
Coffee pot. Isn't there coffee in there? Isn't there coffee in there? Actually, Ders, you mean a tasteless can of Dr. Pepper? Because we put tasteless Dr. Pepper in the coffee pot and turned it on.
I thought about turning back, but curiosity got the best of me. So I followed the sound, but the closer I got, the farther the sound got. Finally, I turned around and wandered so far into the forest that I couldn't find my way back. For three hours I wandered in the dark and could recognize nothing, but then I remembered what my grandmother had said about leprechauns. Despite my hunger, I took my bread and put it on a mossy rock, and fell asleep next to it.
Sorry to get you in the thick of things like this, but I need to know what we're up against. Aside from the secret organization that runs Gotham? If they can isolate the virus, they can create multiple strains that can be released on a massive scale throughout the city. And all they need is a sample of her blood. They won't get it from the source.
The shipment arriving at Pier 9C. Yes. It needs to be tested, which means there's still time to stop them from spreading it around the city. But, of course, if they find out you've discovered their lab... He's right, they could use it immediately.
My enemies took everything from me. Tried to kill me. Help me avenge them, and when I regain my throne, I will provide you with everything you need to free yourself from the shackles of ice. If I were willing to agree, I can only survive a couple hours out in the cold without a suit. And you don't have one, as it was locked away in the secret Wayne Enterprises prison after your escape from Indian Hill.
I guess he wasn't meant to be. You crossed paths with Nygma recently. Any idea what secret he's talking about? I have no idea. I'm guessing he just made it up.
We arrested him five minutes ago. That's not all. What's he doing here? He should be in Lucius' office. Probably moved him.
- Isn't that right? - Yes. The virus sample we got from Hugo Strange is missing. - Maybe Lucius took it.
The perfect Dr. Lee Tompkins. Why is she so drawn to a man with so much darkness in him? Such an appetite for violence? Only if something inside her... wants violence. Craves it.
I left him a loophole. You hear that, Jim? I left you an emergency exit. Did you find it yet? You should have found it.
- I can't. - Lies, Professor! This virus is tearing Gotham apart. Then there's nothing in this city more valuable than your antidote. We can demand half of Gotham, and the city council will hand it to us on a silver platter.
No. Don't say that. - We can help you. - Listen to me. Listen to me. Take over this town. or burn it to the ground.
You're doing it, Wallace. I don't even know why you're asking him. What was Wells doing with me? His plan was more systematic than John Doe's in Seven. And he had a little more time to develop it. About, give or take, 15 years.
Antibiotics won't help. We have to do something. We don't have a choice. So, what do you do when a banana ripens too fast? - You put it in the fridge.
- Fasten your seat belts! - What's going on? We're gonna move the train. How do we do that? I'll vibrate it.
I couldn't defeat Solovar in battle, but you did. You did, and now I run Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me. Solovar never wanted to attack Central City. You did. You took my home from me, and now I'm getting it back!
I have everything I need to escape, Wallace. No, you don't. We still have a piece of that rock. It won't last long. And once I get it, you and everyone you love will disappear from the face of the earth.
- He's gone? - If Savitar gets the stone. He'll run for sure. You can't get rid of that stone, Wallace. You're not fast enough to throw it to Speedforce on your own.
Wally. He doesn't deserve it. Let me guess. Do you? I know what my hell is like. I've already seen it in the future.
This way. Gently, gently. Okay, ready. Hand me the X-ray machine, - got it for us, hand it over, please?
I still remember what it was like to be Flash. I can teach him. Good. Maybe that's the way to defeat Savitar. But the city's still full of villains, and no Flash to protect it.

This is where mercy gets you. This must be where Waller kept her suicide squad. I think this is it. Come on, let's go. Cisco, we got him.
She's ready. We didn't have it before, but now we have an advantage. All right. [Cell phone rings] You guys think about your plan. I don't need to be here to know it.
Why didn't it work? I spent eternity in the same trap. You thought I didn't know how to prevent it from happening again? The Philosopher's Stone. It's made of solidified Speedforce energy, and you gave it to me.
Celine killed my friend. I want to find out how to get revenge. And since our only weapon is currently traveling around Paris. - You mean the tuning fork? - Actually, it's called Arcadius' staff. Cade's enemies left it in the fire that killed him.
- Any other useless demands? I'm not going to release them until you bring me that bell. What do you need that bell for? I'm sentimental. I want it.
I'm not going to release them until you bring me that bell. What do you need that bell for? I'm sentimental. I want it. And I need your help to find it.
And they'll call as soon as there's news of the bus. Besides, we know about Sybil's excursion near Mystic Falls. We're headed in the right direction. All because she wants the bell. I've never heard of such madness. Says the guy who threw it off a bridge.
You know, one steals, the others think they can, too. Okay. But then who has the package? How--how did you find me? I'm sorry I took it.
I used to steal cars. If you don't get away fast, you're in trouble. Anyway, I know a black market place that has a Zat X-Three: a shop in North Hollywood. Problem is, I don't think the owner's gonna give it back.
Give me the gun. Please. Where'd you get it? - In her purse. - You gave it to me, remember?
Black Bill is... Us. Come again? When I was a kid, my dad used to tell me stories about a monster. He lived under our house and made us rich. All we had to do was feed him.
- How is that possible? - Crowley, I think. And now he's dead himself. That's what Hesse says. But Crowley's like a cockroach. I won't believe he's gone until I see his corpse and burn it.
Wait. In a real rat? It's not that bad in there. I had time to think. I was so fixated on keeping my post that I didn't have time to realize how much I hated it.
Thank you very much! So what do you think, Miller? You think her attacker sent that text? Well, it doesn't make sense. Why send it now?
Listen, I was thinking. if I stop by in, like, half an hour, is that okay? I just need to borrow an old laptop. Why? I've got some files I need for school. I'll bring it back to you later today.
- Leah, seriously. - Dad, please! Please don't act so weird right now. This is my spare locker key. If mom's computer's in there before the end of school, I'll take it home, put it back, and not tell anyone.
- What kind of presentation. Lots of them. Osmosis, the reproductive system, plant cellular structure. Okay, fine, but we'll take the computer. Thank you for understanding. We'll take a look at it for investigation.
What did you expect to get from him? I just needed to, uh. I wanted to hear it from Joe. You know, to get him to confess what he couldn't say in court. I tried to record him on his phone so I could give the police evidence, he took it away from me.
- Why is he being taken away? - It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I was doing some work and I came across this bag. Did you touch it?
All right. Let's go piss him off. You all searched everything two days ago. This package wasn't there. You want us to believe that you came across this suspicious package in one of your sheds, picked it up, left your fingerprints and DNA.
Ladies and gentlemen, the murder weapon. - Unbelievable! - Amazing! Stefano used a syringe with two needles positioned so that the injection of poison into Uncle Monty would resemble a snakebite. And then he took it apart to hide the evidence.
Smart. Yeah. But it's not gonna happen. I canceled the order. Told David to destroy it before anyone else saw it.
Hello... Hi. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. (Beep) My laptop was stolen, and I'm seeing it now.
I don't know what the fuck you're showing me. All right. We don't want any trouble. My computer was stolen, and the app shows it's here. Just give it back.
We don't want any trouble. My computer was stolen, and the app shows it's here. Just give it back. And we'll go away. So, can we take it back?
Can I help you? Sorry, I'm an idiot. I left my wallet in my room. I'm sorry, I don't know what to do. Call someone you know and have them bring it to you.
- Can you talk? I can. Thanks for giving me my phone back, I wish you'd done it in person. I didn't think it would make much sense. Did anyone at the station see it on you?
Okay, I used to be. But it's not mine anymore. I'm not in the mood to celebrate, so I thought I'd skip it. Oh. I got you a present. Should I return it?
О. I got you a present. Should I return it? No, no, you don't have to return it. You're so thoughtful. I'll give it back.
There's a cake for you, Dr. Reid. They're persistent. Well, tell them I'm in the O.R. and I don't want cake. You know what, though? Why don't you and the nurses eat it?
- Thank you. - ... outside the room. Thank you for understanding. Your cell phone, sir? I left it in the car.
And where did you hide it? I mean, the tape's pretty clear, he was in the couch cushions, wasn't he? It was under the blanket. Out of sight. Oho. So I didn't get a chance to see him.
Can you tell me where the nearest power source is right now? Jimmy, you got something in your pocket? Yeah, to be honest, I do. My cell phone. From this distance, you should be able to feel it, but you can't, can you?
Wait. Repeat after me. "On short notice, we'll shoot you a commercial today" "and air it tomorrow." We'll shoot you a commercial on short notice today and air it tomorrow.
What's that noise? It's like a bone being sawed. - Yeah. You get used to it. I don't even hear it anymore.
I loved Margaret. She was my best friend. It's just that sexuality is fickle. And sometimes I leaned toward men. Standing up for Larry as a family man failed. On the bright side, the airline found my suitcase and will get it here. So this baggage moment puts us in a positive mood. What do you think?
And that no more of our soldiers die from this drug. "Ingersol Pharmaceuticals must be stopped, Dan. Dan? Do you know the route of the Red Line in Shenandoah National Park? I'll find it.
Until I get my daughter back. Even then, I-- The only way to get my daughter back is to give them the laptop intact. Where is it, by the way? They better not try to hack into it.
Give me the address. 26 Tivoli Park Street. Hi. Here's your rug. Where do you want it?
The Register needs a Lois Lane like you. I think I know something that might help with the Blossom murder investigation. They say Cheryl heard a gunshot? That's what she claims, yeah. I heard it, too.
Move over, outcasts. I'm having deja vu. Yeah, we were here senior year, watching Candyman. God, I hate that movie. -You picked it.
Kevin called me. He said his dad found the gun that killed Jason in a drawer in E.P.'s closet. But, Betty, we searched E.P.'s trailer. We went through that closet. And there was no drawer. Someone put it there after we left.
Juggie, we screwed up. All of us. Breaking into your daddy's trailer was wrong, but at least something good came out of it. I'm sure my daddy just got arrested for murder. That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer. Somebody put it there after we left.
Veronica, wait. You and Archie-- Got closer? Maybe, why? Your father and I made Fred an offer to buy the SoDale contract, but Fred's still considering it.
I'm tired. Bye, bro. You were right. Check this out. Looks like Gunn was clinging to the joint to keep from getting pulled out.
Because we've already accused someone else. You never found Danny's cell phone in his apartment? It wasn't in evidence. Maybe there's something on his phone that we didn't find on the computer. He must have dropped it in the attack and we have no idea where.
- Tell the truth! Order in the courthouse. Here's the phone. It's marked with the code number 23. I think we should take a look at it.
We need those materials. Nothing in the cloud. They found a laptop at the blast site. It kind of burned up, but the materials might still be there. We almost stole it from the cottage, but no luck, the feds took it.
Don't you dare. That's what I do, Olivia. My job. Protecting this office. No, you're destroying it.
Now you know what inspires me. Yeah, yeah. Zelda has style. Really? Hell, I could even publish it in its current form.
Some of it. It's not worth fighting about. Two writers under the same roof. - What could be better? - I think it's financially better for both of us if I use your diary than if you publish it under your own name.
You were right. It's like riding a bicycle. Do you think my novel won't stand the test of time? I can't say. I haven't read it.
A hog firm bids for a spot in Duarte? You check it out. But you said "major client." That's the, uh. is the one with the weird name that's hard to pronounce. How do you pronounce it?
Roxie, tell me, how is she? Not good, Dr. Reid. She's losing a lot of blood. Keep pushing blood, give her maximum volume. We're delighted with the new surgical robot from St. Vic's, and you'll be pleased to know I got it at a good price.
In previous episodes. - While you were in a coma, your mind traveled to another world. That's where we met. They call it the Sphere.
Any connection with Oxford? Was vicar at St. Mary's for a while ten years ago. St. Mary's? Barry Finch sang in the choir there until his voice broke. Look at the mark on Finch's body, if you turn it, it could be a cross, couldn't it?
But I convinced him that your baby would be the best option. He knows I asked you. And he knows you said no. Yeah, that's what I said, and now I'm saying yes. You can have him as soon as he's born.
It's Ivy's flower. Reggie's gonna stay with us for a couple days until things settle down. Hmm. (chuckles) That's fine. Reggie, why don't you take the flower into the spare room and put it in a nice bright spot?
Baby! Meet your little girl. Let's go. I've waited so long for this baby, Patrick. Waiting for him and praying for him.
Tom, please put the gun down. - Why? - Just, uh. Why? So you can pick it up and shoot me?
Your reward is not being kicked out of the Citadel. You're good to go. Beware of paper mites. They like flesh, too. We must find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
Golden roses, what can we take. Your brother and his new queen thought you would protect Casterly Rock. Casterly Rock is no longer of the same importance. Well, it does to me, but my fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne. So you let them take it?
Casterly Rock no longer has the same meaning. Well, it does to me, but my sweet childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne. So you let them take it? Not for long. They won't be able to hold him.
I'm done learning from my mistakes, aren't I? How will you do it? With your sword? Joffrey used to wield it, didn't he? Never used it though.
How will you do it? With your sword? Joffrey used to wield it, didn't he? Never used it though. What did he call it?
Stranger things have happened. Such as? The grain from all the barns is loaded onto wagons, my lord. - And the new harvest? - Our men are already taking it from every village in the Vale.
Someone at Iron Bank will be disappointed. They expected to continue charging interest on your debt. We must find a way to lift their spirits. Yes, perhaps we can be useful in some current venture. My only current enterprise is to regain control of the continent and all its inhabitants.
Cersei's on her list. Who else is on your list? Almost all of them are already dead. Where did you get a dagger like that? Littlefinger gave it to me.
I don't throw words around. I will not put shackles on people. If given the opportunity, many would choose it. They had a choice. And they made it.
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never return to Westeros. But you did. And that sword has belonged to your family for centuries. I have no right to own it. He gave it to you.
Uh-huh. Bitten. The old lady life will never be boring. Well, that's good. - Where'd she get it?
The killer knew how to use a knife. Cut his arteries. You must know the technique. two cuts from the neck to the shoulder. That's a serious move, brother. Did you use it?
Tiny. - That's him. - It's a sure thing. You think he still has the knife? If it is, he cleaned it.
Come here. Take a look. Okay. Look for the brightest object in the sky, above the moon. Oh, yeah, I see it.
During the interview, they asked: if I could be any animal, what would I be? How does this apply to frozen yogurt? Did you use Tom's cologne? Oh, I think I did. I just found it in the bathroom.
You don't remember me? Your old apprentice. Marius. Yeah, you said it was the first trick you ever taught yourself. Now I stop at the very end and can't remember how to finish it.
No more birthday parties with cakes. Well, uh. Right? No, I had a cake for my 11th birthday. But I never tasted it.
There are some things you want to forget. Like my brother Taylor. He was always badgering me, making me feel like a jerk. Made fun of me, made it into a joke, but it wasn't fucking funny. One day we went to the fair. I went into the toilet, and Taylor took it and flipped it over...
All the airport security ran in our direction. It took me a while to realize they were running towards me. One of the radiation detectors thought I was carrying a bomb. I found it on a farm when I was a kid, right by the pond. I was dribbling pebbles in the water, and I looked under my feet and there was this beautiful black rock, so I took it home.
- Memory fails often, Noah. Everyone knows that. - I was there. You weren't. - You weren't? - I don't know where that text came from. I didn't write it.
Vannesa said Jake was out every night after the election. And if we knew where he was going. We could put the pieces together. The day Jennifer was killed, I picked up a satellite phone signal outside her cabin. She's around there somewhere. She did buy a satellite phone and she's using it.
I didn't pay Tom Larsen. - That was my-- - Uh, hold on. What? Your phone, give it to me.
I don't think about it. Yes, you do. Don't lie, Red. I know that look. I've seen it on a lot of faces.
She had a cell phone. I gave her one just in case. If we can trace the signal? ! We can find Huck and bring him home. Her phone stopped sending a signal hours ago. Maybe she turned it off, maybe it's damaged.
Think about it. So let's introduce him again. Olivia, this doesn't make sense. This bill and the way it's worded. No matter how we rewrite it a hundred other ways, it won't work.
- just like everybody else. - Oh, come on. What could possibly be the difference between you two? You know what we should show him? The wedding album. Honey, can you get it?
Is that my robe? - No. Yeah. He says it feels like money. Just be sure to wash it afterward.
You should have bought on Black Friday. Aren't those the best deals? That's what I told him. So, uh, about your surveillance request on the Meadows suspects. I can't sign it.
My daughter has a way to save us. This device was designed by my brother to protect humans by contaminating the planet's atmosphere with kryptonite. It would have made the planet uninhabitable for you. Fortunately, my cousin imprisoned him before he could do that. And lucky for you, I found him.
No! You said he was ready. He is ready. I just gave Supergirl the remote. Only she can turn it on.
You don't realize how beautiful he is. I do. It's what summer smells like to me. It's been that way all my life. But you won't appreciate it until you're as far away as I was.
I guess I'm not as strong as I thought I was. Barely made it down the hall. Do you remember that day. I picked you up from school, and it was trash day, and we found that old TV on the curb? Yeah, and you wanted me to smash it.
Yeah, it's total Delaware. Yeah, it sure is. - Denise! Jane, this story was your idea. I didn't even want to do it.
I have to say, I'm just shocked that you were able to raise that much money so quickly. Uh, you know what? I think I'm gonna go buy myself a gilet. "Vest." Yeah, that's what we call it in our family.
- I'll make you a deal. No, folks. She's, uh. she's not herself. The only consolation is that the bitch is with the Beast right now, and I doubt that's good for her. "Word-o-words." I assume it's an enchantment for the blade to kill me if I break it.
They'll save you and torture us. Where's my phone? I should call him. I didn't call him. I traded it.
Fred saw what the protomolecule did to Eros. He wants to control it. It's too dangerous to leave the sample there. We can't destroy something this important. We have to destroy it.
Even our friend. We were tired of being afraid that if we didn't obey, we would be cut off, our water would be cut off, we would be thrown into an airlock or rounded up in cells like test animals. Because that's the way it's been until now. But that's coming to an end. I stole your secret, Fred Johnson. And I'm going to give it to the Belt.
Even our friend. We were tired of being afraid that if we didn't obey, we would be cut off, our water would be cut off, we would be thrown into an airlock or rounded up in cells like test animals. Because that's the way it's been until now. But that's coming to an end. I stole your secret, Fred Johnson. And I'm going to give it to the Belt.
Few things are evil, but many things are hunger. Hunger is a lot like evil if you find yourself stabbing yourself on a fork. Or do you think your sausage sandwich just adores you? What is it, and what on earth is it doing? There are scorch marks on the asphalt where we found it.
When she realized that her cousin's life was in danger because of the insulin you injected her with, she rang the night bell to call for help. But no one came. Why? Why didn't you answer, doctor? Because you and Nurse McMahon had more important things to do? Because Claude turned it off.
Thank you, sir. I look forward to seeing you again. Thank you. Grandma, I brought you a rabbit. Put it in the kitchen.
It's exhausting. Do you know what the saying "Waiting for the other shoe to drop" means? I know. It came about in the late 19th century when people started moving to the big cities and living on each other's heads in these huge apartment buildings, where they had to live in houses at night where the tenants could hear their neighbors who came home after work by the thousands, sat down, took off one shoe, threw it on the floor.
Okay. Okay. Make sure you set up the camera so it covers the whole room. - I got it. You'll be able to hear us through this earpiece, but don't put it on until you get in the room.
It's natural, made from pine. But it's quite toxic. How much would it take to make another batch? I'll just bring the turpentine, that's all. It's not harmful to pregnant women? Not if I drink it.
That skull tried to grab me and pull me to him. It almost killed you. And he will if I don't do something about it. So maybe it's best to stay away. Nick saw him, too.
Look what David's holding. Oh, my God. I thought David killed him with a slingshot. But he had a staff, too. But for some reason, history doesn't tell us about it. David left that staff to his descendants, and David's kings used it as a scepter until the temple was destroyed. And then the staff disappeared.
Something about this staff bothered me. The staff was all cracked, like it was assembled from numerous pieces, and there was no mention of it in the books. Yeah, that thing bothers me too. If it's as powerful as it's implied to be, and it belonged to all those people-- How did the Destroyer get his hands on it?
Question... now that it's ready, how do we use it on the Destroyer? What if we dipped bullets in it like we did with the Destroyer, remember? We shot him with poisoned bullets and it worked. - I still have the gun. - You can go get it.
You gave us a house to live in, not to hold meetings. I don't care what you do there as long as the village is quiet. We've had enough excitement. We need some peace. May you find it, in the name of God!
Hold on. - I don't have anything for you. - You gave me this. It's the most beautiful gift I've ever gotten. You never take it off.
What does Miss Morwenna say? I don't think she's thrilled, but Mom said it's a great party, so I guess she'll change her mind soon. Drake, you've been a great friend, I brought you a present. No need, Master Geoffrey, your friendship has been enough. You can open it later if you want.
I don't think she's thrilled, but mom said it's a great party, so apparently she'll change her mind soon. Drake, you've been a great friend, I brought you a present. No need, Master Geoffrey, your friendship has been enough. You can open it later if you like. I'll be insulted if you don't accept it.
- No, I thought angels couldn't die. - He did. - Oh. Okay. Anyway, you were right. You said the world would want Genesis, and bad people would want him.
But I wasn't mad at him, you know? He was always throwing up and always falling down. I wasn't mad because he wore a suit and tie. I don't know where he got it from. God, I never saw him again, but, uh. he wore a suit and tie that day. For me.
Don't tell me you want to change the terms. I refuse. - Mike. - Hear me out. During the trial, I said I had a gift and I threw it away.
My ex-husband set this up It was one of his startups Can you give me your OffKey username and password? Yeah, it's ChandlerFamily1, and the password is, uh. Tom changed it every seven days.
Come on! You said I had the right to remain silent. Do I even have to answer these questions? No, but you do have to give us your phone. Put it on the table and unlock it.
Get out of here, you lunatics. You don't even know what you're missing. That suit was so tight. Must be damn hard to get it off, I imagine. Unless he never takes it off.
I can't help it. You can't tickle yourself. You need someone else. Someone outside your nervous system. - Get to the point, Tony. - Uh, excuse me. Anyway, I'm with this hottie, and she's checking out my peppers. She's twisting it back and forth, back and forth. And I'm stroking her leg.
- What's there to talk about? He's lying. - There are other questions. - Is this your office? - That's what we call it.
I am very worried. - I see. Where is your baby? - No, no, he's still a baby. - Okay, where is the baby? - I... I don't remember where I left him.
- About that woman who was walking down the highway. She was lucky she didn't get hit. - And the baby? Was he lost? Was he found?
We'll make a different you. Hi. Made you a sandwich, uh. half an hour ago. And then I ate it.
Я... incompetent to be king. And I am incompetent to teach the king. To be an adult is to realize your responsibility. A bunch of my students have conquered another world. More like given to us.
We weren't her friends, remember? We owe her a debt of gratitude. because we weren't friends. We have no money. We're wizards. Let's conjure him up.
Were the drivers mad that he was on the same road as them? Oh, I remember a few days ago, uh. I think it was last Wednesday. Yeah, it was last Wednesday. Will said he thought he thought some car was following him He said he saw it a few times.....
- We're looking for Quinn. Why, what happened? Is she okay? - We don't know. Her cell phone's off and untraceable.
All right, man, listen. Lady, uh. dropped her key. - A key? - Yeah, the key. And I, uh, ran after her to give it to her.
- Run his cell phone. The number he gave me is out of service, but I have his license address. 3942 Wyoming Street. Get a warrant. Let's nail him.
you gave him. Sire. Do you know the best way to tame a wild horse, sire? You must make him graze with a submissive horse.
The refrigerator's broken. - The ice cream's melting. - Let me guess. Because it's warm? - Okay. (chuckles) I'll call a handyman, and he'll be here in no time.
We could all learn from Anton. - Uh-oh! This yogurt is expired! - Did you see that? I could have died from it. And now Ehrlich will eat it.
He's hiding something in his rectum. What is it, a gun? Says he has no idea how the gun got there. All right. [Cell phone rings] What do we do? It's not easy to get it out.
We have to postpone the procedure. Why? Our patient just confessed to a crime. That means the gun is evidence. And since the father convinced his son to do the procedure, we have to get a warrant to remove it.
Thank you both. The D.A. signed the warrant. We're good to go. I don't believe Ray's story about the gun, do you? That he smuggled it into the prison?
- Nothing, we were just, uh. we were doing a visualization class. One more time. Close your eyes, Ariel. Okay. Do you see your shield? Now describe it for me.
- I'd put it this way. - UTIs are common in paraplegics. Been through it a few times. Life with a catheter, huh? It needs to be replaced.
Good luck? Ethan, are you kidding me? Nat, I've met paralyzed veterans. A sense of inferiority can overwhelm them. If you tell them that ground chalk can help them, they'll eat it every day.
Mr. Kessler, he saved your son. He's in surgery right now. But they promised us. We've been waiting for him. That man would have given him to Dustin.
Vijay, don't do this. You're making a mistake. - He's not safe with her. - Gemma. Vijay had a choice, and he made it.
Uh, I'm not so sure about that. Soon they'll find the others we knocked out. What's the score? Well, there's good news and bad news. Good news is the jammer truck is parked behind that shed, we can cut it off.
What are we looking at? Well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is the jammer truck is parked behind that shed, we can cut it off. The bad news is. It's guarded by a squad of heavily-armed soldiers.
A lot more than she paid you. If you have an offer, go ahead. Looks like we only have two choices. Either I shrink this case down to the size of a baseball and nobody gets anything, or-- Or we kill you, and we take it.
I don't know. Some kind of advanced code. It's like fifth-generation syntax. I've never seen anything like it. Every time I try to change it, I get thrown back...
We have no idea what Billy did to Darkhold. I didn't want to know. That was the whole point of giving the book to him. Well, we need to get it back and destroy it. - If you had given it to me.
Although, to be honest, I feel attracted to her now, sexually and otherwise, and I'm thinking about filming, but she might say no. - You Americans are too chatty. - It's our great vice. Our unit became aware that an object was on the premises. And we were sent to retrieve it.
You're in danger. I have so many memories of snow. My first time skating on my neighbor's pond. A month spent in the French Alps. But the truth is. this is the first time I've ever seen it.
See? Good as new. - And clearly stronger. - I know what you did. You stole my mind and loaded it into a nasty machine.
Apparently, they're looking for contraband. They arrested my neighbor yesterday for a laptop. - The drone. in my backpack. - What? I was gonna return it myself so you wouldn't get in trouble.
- Daddy! - She's just a child! Let her go! No! The hangar was in a state of disrepair when we first found it.
- That's perfect. I can't wait to rip Agent Coulson's throat out with a knife. And speaking of S.H.I.E.L.D.. we've tracked down two agents threatening the Framework. They're aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. As soon as we get the code to it, my men will be ordered to shoot it down.
- ... taken? - Yes. We've tracked two agents threatening the Framework. They're aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. As soon as we get the code to it, my men will be ordered to shoot it down.
My head, the one you ripped off, is now running a lot of these machines. And you don't know where it is. So you can do whatever you want with that body. My plan is already in motion. And there's nothing stopping it.
Take it easy. We're not your enemies. - Let's keep it together. - Shut your robot mouth. Or I'll have these people shut it for you.
Paul's doing it all over again. Hating Adam? He doesn't want to kill him anymore, which is progress, but-- It's because the baby's close. Maybe Paul's worried about how he'll feel when he sees him.
Hate for Adam? He doesn't want to kill him anymore, which is progress, but... It's because the kid's getting close. Maybe Paul's worried about how he'll feel when he sees him. He'll love him.
For the most part. He could be arrogant, especially when he'd had a beer, and of course he was a Manchester City fan, so.... Yeah, I liked him. We talked about you, about the baby. He wanted one so badly.
Okay, what do you want to know? Everything. Who else is connected to this? All right, all right. Just get that gun out of my face. I got bleach, and I'm gonna throw it in your face!
-Hi. Good to see you. -Yeah. I need to take this backpack off. -Yeah. I can't take it.
No, nothing, uh. I didn't see anything like that. - It's too early for that. - Yes. Is the cake ready for the Putnam's? Yes, ma'am. I just need to pack it up.
You're going to have a hard time without a husband. You should worry about your own husband. They need you to go to Jezebel's again. They're trying to get a package from there. Hide it until someone contacts you.
And the truth is, a lot of it is because of Mike. And I wanted to tell her, but--.... You don't know how she's gonna react. No, I don't. I haven't even told her yet that I knew Mike's secret before he got caught, let alone used it to make partner.
What are you talking about? He guaranteed he'd pay the money he promised and hire you at the end of the quarter. - Because not only do I want you to set up a hearing, I want you to take down anyone who gets in my way. It's up to you. You'll take the job and the money and take me on the board, or you'll stay on a sinking ship waiting for everyone to realize you sunk it.
Because I didn't fly here to blackmail this woman. And I know the story of the wind and the sun. What are you talking about? She's talking about Aesop's fable. Which actually says that if you want to make a man take off his cloak, you don't blow it off.
And I know the story of the wind and the sun. What are you talking about? She's talking about Aesop's fable. Which actually says that if you want to make a man take off his cloak, don't blow it off. Make him hot, and then he'll take it off.
There's something attached to his rib. Oh, my God! There's a wire. It goes under the skin. Pull it out.
To make sure that life and death remain separate. But if he crosses that bridge. He won't! And why not? Because I will destroy him.
It's all here. Oxycontin, Percocet, amphetamines, pregnancy tests. What's the ketamine for? Some of our guests fantasize about Sleeping Beauties. But the girls use it themselves.
Figure it out. What's in the-- What's in the bag? I just know it's important. Don't open it yourself.
I'll be right there. Hey! Where's the fan? - I'm on my way. We'll find it.
I'm not gonna sit in this heat without a fan. I guess that's when you took the knife. And at the same time you were making a fuss saying you couldn't find what you were looking for. Where's the fan? Which gave you, Judith, an excuse to go and help her find it.
- Not a word. I'm sorry you had to sign. I know how much you hate being one of the good guys. I seriously doubt they're the good guys. I finally got the dynamite, but I never got to use it.
- Helps dull the odor. Try not to drop ashes on my tools, Detective Inspector Bradfield. Based on the hypostasis and rigor mortis at the scene, I believe she was killed between 6pm and midnight on Sunday, May 13th. Cause of death was strangulation? The knot on her bra was so tight I had to cut it.

Cause of death was strangulation? The knot on her bra was so tight I had to cut it. The killer ripped it off her?
Even after you disappeared, we continued because you wanted us to. No, because old Rip was an idiot for believing time needed saving, and you're even bigger idiots for believing him. My patience is about to run out. Where's the fragment of the Spear? Right where you left it.
Poor thing. Anyway, your king is now doing whatever I want him to do, so unless you want him to flood the entire floor with your blood, I guess you'll give up the Spear fragment. My patience is running out. The fragment. Where is it? As long as I'm alive, you're not getting it.
Dude, I can't. I can't do this anymore. Okay. If there's a hole in your suit, that means it's damaged. So I have to go in and fix it.
No. No? Why not? The White Martians have infiltrated the reactor in the basement. And I need to shut it down before it gets overloaded.
They saved me to save Henshaw. They made me keep him alive to strengthen him. Physically, they turned him into the monster he was. It's so strange to see you as Henshaw. I hope I use him wisely.
Okay, try pressing the switches next to the helm and you'll go into manual mode, then I can control it from here. - Two minutes. - Nothing's changed. - The ship's still picking up speed. - We need to slow it down.
- Nothing's changed. - The ship's still picking up speed. - We need to slow it down. I'm here. I can slow it down.
- She's his insurance policy. - All right, people, let's get to work! Wynn, what's going on with Alex's subcutaneous tracker? Uh, nothing, it's been off since 10:00 p.m. Whoever took her must have found a way to disable it.
If my mother would have spoken to me in the same inspiring way, imagine what I could have done. I'm glad I inspired you. But, trust me, it's not always easy being a parent who inspires their child. Shall we test it again? I'm going to plug into the algorithm and run it now.
What are you-- What are you doing? Thousands of Daxam survived the destruction of our planet. All they had to do was get here. Shut it down!
Oh, come on. We both know Winslow can't keep his mouth shut. My boyfriend and best friend are in there. Maybe the president and Alex are right. Supergirl has to protect everyone. But all I can think about is that the two people I love are stuck on that ship, and if we destroy it...
- We're running out of time. - You said you had a plan? - Yeah. Koda Handshaw was in the fortress of solitude. When he broke in, he stole a deadly virus and used it to kill the aliens in that bar.
It was easy. Do you know anything about a VCR? I can't plug it in. I know it works. I turned it on earlier.
- I'm not going back. - Do as I say. Time trail. "Titan? We found it.
Go ask him to wait for me, please. Governors, we're running out of time. The fact that you are here in this emergency meeting for such a short time says to the American people that you are as concerned about their safety as I am. Terror is unacceptable. I don't accept it.
Soapy pole? Throwing balls into small hoops? Hammer throwing? I'm not exactly sure what it is, but we need a hammer. We'll throw it.
I'm more concerned about the atmosphere of the day than the events themselves For example, I wish there was a starter pistol. Just what you need! Why did you bring it? I carry it all the time.
Just what I need! Why did you take it? I carry it all the time. Be careful, sir. Point it at the ground when you shoot.
Initially, I was impressed by it, but now I'm getting bored Endless jazz and seriousness Yes, jazz is a challenge. I love jazz. A challenge in a good way, and I love it.
Why don't we change when we drop him off? - [LeeAnn] Yeah! Let's make some tags out of sheets and go on a new trip. - Yeah! Yeah. Maybe we'll find a gun. We'll go back to yesterday and remember where we put it.
But don't worry about him. Kanen is dead. - I wouldn't leave a gun at Truthout, you know that! I'm telling you, Angie's setting me up! - It doesn't matter who put it there.
Kanen is dead. - I wouldn't leave a gun at Truthout, you know that! I'm telling you, Angie's setting me up! - It doesn't matter who put it there. What matters is that they found it.
Only Uther Pendragon or his direct heir could have pulled the sword. You felt it, didn't you? Its power. It knocked you out. You just don't know how to control it.
No, not cash. Taking your own life. That's an interesting expression. Take it from who? Once it's gone, it's not you who's going to take it.
Shit! Cypher has restarted and taken control of the sub. What's he saying? In layman's terms, she just hijacked a submarine. We can't let her get away.
It's all right. Attaboy. The submarine's too close. We're not gonna make it to the airlock. And we're just gonna let her sail away?
Am I wrong? Say yes, and we'll move on. - And then what? This war. Your war. Her war. Julius is not an obstacle.
Yeah. We've got to leave only one way in, block that gap, that'll slow them down. Seven, eight. Nine. The machine. We can block it.
Are we talking about me and Mary Beth or you and Iris? Give her some time. That's what I'm doing. Well, uh. It's Mary Beth's birthday today, and I found this cool ukulele online. I'm gonna paint it like this and bring it to her.
And you know what? - You win. - What? I didn't-- Your grand prize, chosen especially for you, is unlimited freedom. Enjoy it wherever you want.
Despite her current form, she was human. It's a living organism that must have limitations. What if we run a current to knock it out? Look, this thing tears through steel like tinfoil. It doesn't need oxygen.
This one. Go ahead. I want to get out of here. You're not going anywhere, dead wife, not without me, not until that coin is back in my pocket, back where it belongs.
and my head is spinning. It would be good to talk to you. I can't send it just for your accounting. The package is in the armory right now. We've assigned a number to it.
There's no room left for me. There is no space left. It crowds out my grief. And my grief. my constant daily pain. it is as strong and alive as his. But I will not let it prevail.
But it's locked. She must have crawled in there. And locked the cage from the inside. But the snake couldn't have picked the lock on its own. - Maybe the lizard helped it.
Honey, I made a mess of things. Your dad found out about me and Fred. Someone told him. I didn't even get a chance to say anything. Oh, my God, Dad knows? Yeah, on top of that, the Blossoms are still after the drive-in theater land, and Fred still doesn't know we own it.
For the good of the country. Remember what you so generously gave me the night Vargas was assassinated that you called it the most beautiful thing in the world? America? Well, I'm keeping her. She's not safe with you.
So why transfer? It's a long story. I was a doctor in the STARZ division of Raccoon City. I guess I've always been interested in medicine in some way. And one day I decided it was my duty to stop people from abusing it.
It used to be a compulsory subject. Until they banned it. And for good reason, from what I hear. The situation was pretty complicated. I thought it was right at the time, but the professor who taught it disagreed.
This thing appeared. It was covered in leaves and lichen and slime, and it had branches instead of arms, and it picked it up. Picked it up and picked it up. - What about you? I shot her, and she didn't give a shit.
A wand? So Nick followed Eve. But the wand stayed here. It can't go in there. It doesn't belong there.
You are mistaken, my lord. I do not favor bloodshed and lawlessness. But liberty, equality, fraternity - that's what I subscribe to. Well, I have no such intention. No, if there is power and someone has to wield it, and man is not perfect, it will be abused. And who's the most likely to abuse the power?
It was wrong. I'm sure he regrets it. But if you fight with him, it will upset me deeply. For your sake, Mother, I will be kind. The old forge on the edge of the Trenwyth lands, who owns it now?
It's good to see you, Harvey. I'd invite you to dinner, but I'm pretty sure that's not why you're here. Mike Ross is out of prison. I don't think there's anything stopping him from practicing law again. I don't disagree, but technically, he never practiced it.
- Nothing. Smell the damn flowers. Hopefully with someone like you. I've been doing this for a long time and at a certain point, you realize enough is enough. This job will swallow you whole if you let it.
Just because I'm a prince doesn't change anything. Not how I feel about you. It changes everything. It's bad enough that you lied, but being a prince? I thought you were just born on a cruel planet, but you ruled it.
That's a nice tie. It really is. Unleash your power. This sucks. And most importantly, don't be afraid to let it go.
- At the end of the hall. Alec? What are you doing in my father's office? You mentioned his model train. He doesn't use it anymore.
When I was a kid, about like you, I saw it happen. But the butterfly was having a hard time. So I decided to help it. I opened the cocoon very carefully and the butterfly crawled out. But it couldn't fly. It had to work hard to get out of the tight cocoon.
You do that, I'll have Deb book you a ticket. You do that. It's not about that. I never planned on living like this. You're already living it.
This is war. - It's not a personal choice. - No. You could have been a good man. But you put on the uniform and let her decide for you.
I'm sorry. That was very impertinent. Oh, no, it wasn't. Don't be. Your self-confidence, I admire it.
Dr. Wilson? The recovery was successful. Did you fix what you broke? I fixed what I broke. And that disgusting esophageal tumor is now in the medical waste where it belongs.
You've changed. And today you saved me from a terrible mistake, and I, uh. I don't know if I can repay you. Luckily, I have an idea. If we're not gonna lose our family. We have to let it grow.
I miss her so much. Love leaves you or catches up with you again. Love brings suffering. Or brings hope. But you must always be brave and open your hearts to it.
I controlled their minds. As you have done many, many times. I don't know what you're talking about. You know your power. You've used it your whole life.
Who are these people? You heard. It's Sarge and Pea. Two nicknames I've never heard. That kindness. I don't trust her.
Like the one on your screensaver? Yeah, only now it's in front of McNeely's house. I think he bought the car just to drive me crazy. I have to look at it every day! Or you could look at it every day, Rog.
Nothing. The less she knows, the better. Callie Hughes. her mom went to the top of the heart-lung transplant list two days ago. Maybe that's how the perps give her incentive. My mom had an infection, but once she got better, they moved her to the top of the list.
I'm sorry. Don't be. Thanks to the BulletPoint recording, we know the shooter was hired by the last owner of the guitar. Now, whoever he was, he never advertised that he owned the guitar. He may have enjoyed it on his own, but people like that rarely keep their trophies secret.
Howard, how are the amenities gonna be in there? Well, there's a sink outside, that solves half your problems. But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right? Uh-huh. We don't use it much, so it'll be kind of like yours.
Let's go. - Let's get her inside. - Thank you for saving our little girl. That thing took Willa. I wouldn't let her take Waverly.
Wow! I'm so sorry, are you okay? Yeah, don't worry, I'm fine. MONTY: I got this thing, I'm trying to find a use for it.
- Bunk beds? Did you grow up in prison? Van, did you know I'm the only senior vice president in this building who doesn't have an office? Emily, you grew up in a box. You're like a tropical fish that grows up in a coral reef, but if you take the fish out and give it an office,
Any survivors? No... None. It's over. My village, it's over.

Tall. Tall. Love is but a lie. A trick to control the stupid and weak. Forget it. Never let it influence your mind and will.
Please drink. No water for him! No, Judas. My life, I give it to her of my own free will.
Loud and distracting? I've got just the thing. Don't break my music! Break it? I'll give it an upgrade!
I need a drink. - How much do I owe you, buddy? - 12 bucks. Always hated that palm tree. Never trusted her.
In this business, restraint is important. And there's no restraint here. But, uh. I like it. I mean, I'm proud of her.
Okay. There's a lot of things to do. - "what about the boat? - We should talk to George about that. - There's no point in dealing with it because no one will use it.
Offer them a lesser sentence and get off quicker. - Oh, my God, what is this? It's like I mutilated myself with a sharp pencil. - Sticks. - One patient took a needle that could go right to the ankle bone.
Ladies and gentlemen, Josh Greenberg. Masturbation. We all do it, but what if I told you you were doing it wrong?
Why should I remember this fucking car? Does it look unfamiliar to you? Does it remind you of anything, look closely? - What's this for? - You don't remember who drove it?
I could use some of that perfume. My cool French boyfriend asks me when it's my birthday. Maybe he wants to send me flowers or find out what my zodiac sign is to see if I'm compatible. These Europeans are obsessed with numerology. Madonna was so into it when she moved to London.
I left her. Masha's lost. I left my diaphragm. - Your diaphragm? Yeah, I just started using it recently.
If that were the case. I think we'd know by now. They'd disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment. Hell, they might even swallow us whole. Science is accurate. But I'm afraid it's a stranger to leniency.
We need to get back to the station. What? Your mom and Hopper will be there as bait. That thing is still out there. And we can't just sit here and let it get to them.
- Who should I trust? I thought I could trust you. - I'm not gonna explain myself to you, Bernard. I've been charged with protecting the park's intellectual property. - Why would it be in danger?
No. But whoever I got is not going anywhere. I never thought a hit man could faint at the sight of his own blood. Wait a minute, I think I just found our target. Which Turner was it?
It's false advertising. You know, I think she's a punk, you know? People like her grow up with all that baggage behind them, right? You know, family squabbles, resentment towards one of her parents, sibling problems, boyfriend problems, all that psychological garbage, you know? All that rage builds up inside and she gives it some stupid noble excuse.
Is there anything we can do? I'm thinking. How long will the gamma cannon take to charge? At least 20 minutes. It doesn't have enough power to fire.
Well, because technically it's my song, since I wrote it, and it's mostly my voice, and I just don't think it's fair.... Scarlett, what's important is what's best for the band, so it should be the song that tells the best story. Okay? ♪This old guitar♪ ♪ Damn, I even took it and gave it a name♪
This is the schedule of all the presidential candidates for the next week... Their movements, security details. We can't give it to him. They'd be easy prey. We can't put that kind of information in the hands of a terrorist. We can only if we can trace it back to him before he uses it.
Unfortunately, we've had to make that hard choice. We all suffer pain. Part of it is physical from wounds or age. part of it is mental, you know, when we live with the loss of our family and friends. If you think about it, whether we fight that pain or give in to it, the result is the same.
But it's actually pretty boring. As always, love, Vanessa. She told her story. Yes, master. Did the doctor believe her?
It's one thing to protect a city, it's another to protect one person. The one you're worried about. I'll find something else to do. And speaking of which, I saw that abyss you were talking about. I don't know how you're fighting it.
A whore resurrected to be given to your creation. To make your life easier. But even this great demon was more human than you. Victor, can't you see the cruelty you're committing? You created life. so let it live.
I don't know how. Because of his magic. His magic is too strong. I saw it on Lian Yu, and it's not just magic. It's darkness, and every time I try to resist it, I can't.
I know it's not a good time. In our apartment. my apartment-- my apartment.... Yeah. Darhk magic, it got to you. I thought, uh. you thought I'd found a way to fight it?
One teddy bear, two teddy bears. That's the end of it. Yeah. I read that book to her every night before this shit. I read it to her every night, but see, it ain't over 'cause daddy's home.
Why would you put seeds in mustard? They're mustard seeds. They make mustard. No, mustard is yellow. You know, you go to a baseball game, you put it on a hot dog.
And judging by your tone and the throbbing vein on your forehead, you're not happy about it? She was about to leave. You should fire her! No. I have a mop, and I know how to use it.
No, I'll wait for you. I'll be downstairs. Okay. Why psychology? How long have you been interested in it?
I'll help you. on one condition. What's that? You don't let this go too far. Your bond with Jace can take some strain. But you have to promise me you won't let it break.
It's a... an offer. Is this a field trip for you? You, you, uh. amateur. I've been to war. All you do is teach it.
I heard him get up. I shouldn't have let him go so early. It's not your fault. It's just the farm's been in Russ' family for generations. If he can't run it.
I don't know any. Thanks anyway. How did it happen? He had a dog. I wanted to give it a treat.
I know. You stopped printing an hour ago. What if all I have is a big headline, Sally? Isn't that the point? That guy over there. he's gonna take the front page of my story and he's gonna wipe his ass with it, and then he's gonna flush it down the toilet, and what's that all about?
Yeah, right after the inauguration, we'll be pointing Mr. McCleator out the door. Hi. Hi. I love my job. God, I could do it forever.
- let's find out what it is. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want to use a Bunsen burner? Better yet, I have a centrifuge I bought at Colonial Williamsburg when I was 12... and I never used it, but I knitted West Covina with it.
Bingo! Bingo! Don't you think you're a little obsessed with this thing? Yeah, that's the point. I want to please her and make her proud of me.
- Almost everything... - Wait. What if Bailey was trying to make a deal with Steve, he figured it out. Found the wire. - And strangled her with it.
What the--? Isikiel, say something. The submarine just made a U-turn on its own. - She's heading back to port. - Why would she do that?
you wanted a YouTube author. Liza, relax. You're an asset. Your job is safe. Why would it be in danger?
She spat right in my face. - Now, where did my spit come from on that ball? - I know! I know exactly where it came from! - Where did it come from?
With regret. You have a role, a whole set of rules. All you have to do is follow them. Margaret, you have freedom. All you have to do is enjoy it.
Oh, yes, ma'am. The dispatches from Afghanistan will require your absolute attention. This is a pointless endeavor! Please try to be more gallant, Albert. When you take her hand to kiss it, you must look straight into her eyes as if you're going to drown in them, like this.
- To close the wound? - Yeah. Okay, Tino, you gotta take off your shirt, but keep your hand on the leg wound at all times. Got it. Take your shirt and roll it up and try to cover your brother's leg wound with it.
You should have listened to him! That's why he started looking for new friends! Yes! The clue is in the music. Give yourself to it.
November 13, 2015. Malraux said that the mission of the twentieth century would be to reintroduce God into man. This is why I, following in the footsteps of this enlightened agnostic, believe that a religious renewal, gods that, like torches, illuminate the human soul, preventing it from becoming a beast, will enrich the republic, allowing it to understand and accept its own multiplicity.
To get some fresh air. Where you headed? I have a meeting. Someone has a nicotine addiction. Maybe you should indulge it instead of suppressing it.
But creating a cyber command meant using the same technology to attack. Once you gain access to an adversary's computer networks, you put an implant into that network. And we have tens of thousands of foreign computers and networks where the U.S. has implanted implants. You can use them to monitor what's going on around that network or you can use them to introduce cyber weapons, worms and viruses. If you can spy on the network, you can manipulate it.
They will still die by the will of your master's plan. We're not sure what will happen. I hope... Hope again. You are so full of it.
Explain why we should support it. I'm not running for president. So that was your plan, to drop out of the race? The country needed to calm down. Now it needs a real election, which it won't get if I run.
It's just a coincidence. I haven't spoken to Ezra in years. I'm sure we won't even cross paths on this job. You were right about why I took the job. Part of me hoped it would bring me and Ezra back together.
You have to. It's karma. Karma's been kicking us in the teeth lately. Yeah. So, uh. let's hit it back.
And with his track record, we'd be on him soon enough. And with a little momentum, Zoey tied all the evidence she found to him, not you Teri felt responsible for the whole chain of events, and in order to leave the kids with at least one parent, she took the blame for both crimes. Lucky for the kids, they have loving grandparents. Unfortunately for you, when the lab works properly, without bias or assumptions, it usually manages to convince a jury of the murderer's guilt.
Because you're my sister and you like to stick your nose in. Luke. I have a life. My life. It needs my time.
Fuck you all! Fuck you! As much as we love them, our fathers couldn't stay with us. Everyone needs someone to share their pain with, but it has to be someone who cares, not someone who revels in it.
So please leave my family alone and get out of here. Thank you, Dr. Edwards. That'll be all. This is a normal decortication procedure, except for a slight anomaly. I can't do the decortication because I'm already in the middle of it.
And I will. I'm very patient. And I'm right, which makes me even more patient seeing her behavior. We both know it, but she's not ready to admit it yet. So I'm going to wait for her apology and then get my ass into the bedroom where it belongs.
I will find and stop the man who tried to kill you. The manhunt is on for an escaped convict named Ruslan Krasnov. Ruslan is only the perpetrator, not the organizer of this assassination attempt. We've dealt with this organization before, Watson. It was run by Moriarty.
- What? - See, I noticed we use a lot of bacon, so I ordered 120 kilos in bulk, which is 20% cheaper. Wow, that's amazing. I love cheap women. Well, I hope you bought toilet paper in bulk, because you're full of it.
Emphasis on "musical." It's a tuning fork. Why does the car make that damn sound? Oh, it reminds you to buckle your seat belt. Well, you can remind her that I'm immortal.
Mazikeen, what's that weird squelchy stuff the boys are cooing about? Maze: Are you watching porn? What's that? It's like money. People use it to buy things they can't afford.
Magda, I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but you're gonna be okay. You can do this. You can do this. Just remember, this power. it doesn't control you. You control it.
What does that mean? That it's old. It's not plastic. It's a handmade work of art. It's also fucking slow, which means only a real man can drive it.
I'm not a kid anymore. I know. But I'm still worried about you. You volunteered to go to a station that could explode. That's why I'm going there, right? We have to find the bomb and stop it from going off.
Yeah, your message earlier. Seattle police car 916. This bullet looks intact. Reinforced polymer. I put it through a steel tank, and there's not even a scratch.
I'm sorry? Why hasn't he been released? Must be paperwork. Bullshit. You're holding her back because he threatened a lawsuit.
Addidale, if I may use your full name. It's not my name. It's Addidale. Fate brought us together. And I'm grateful for that.
So Mike stays behind bars, so Cahill isn't the only one who stands to gain from a successful interrogation. I admit, Ms. Zane, I was very interested in your handling of the Bailey case. It's been a long time coming. Your life has changed a lot since you were a public defender. You see all sorts of people in that job, so you can't do it for long.
You asked me why I got drunk the other day. I found out that the program I was working on to get that prick approved was a lie. - The trading program. - Yeah, it was. Turns out he wasn't using it.
It must have been stolen. And you didn't notice or report it? It's sitting in an abandoned parking lot. On the West Side. I don't use it much in the city.
I don't know if you'll ever forgive me. But I want you to live without the burden of doubts and lies. - Look at the moon. So full, so bright. No wonder it's been attributed magical powers.
- Take me to Stanford or Berkeley. - Yeah, I know. But will it make you happy? I mean, look at my uncle. He's got tons of degrees, this car, but no time to enjoy it.
No one's gonna die. Not on my watch. Yeah, you want to keep me alive so you can grow weed up my ass and make a soft robe out of my beard. No thanks, ladies. I like my hide on my bones where it belongs.
Mostly Shae. So, what we have to do is avoid the conversation so that they give up on the crypt idea. This job starts today, and we all have roles to play. Understand? That's why we're going to the Big Mac party and we're going to enjoy it whether we want to go or not.
Don't give up. I don't give up. I never will. I will fight for her until my last breath. But what if this fate can't be defeated and we're just moving towards it?
- What's your name? - Pam. Give me your hand. No offense, but I threw the cart away. It's ruined.
No! That's not how you interfered. I'm sorry, Jake, it's an omen. And I'm not taking your side against the universe. It's hundreds of years old.
Tall. Tall. Love is but a lie. A trick to control the stupid and weak. Forget it. Never let it influence your mind and will.
Please drink. No water for him! No, Judas. My life, I give it to her of my own free will.
Loud and distracting? I've got just the thing. Don't break my music! Break it? I'll give it an upgrade!
I need a drink. - How much do I owe you, buddy? - 12 bucks. Always hated that palm tree. Never trusted her.
In this business, restraint is important. And there's no restraint here. But, uh. I like it. I mean, I'm proud of her.
Okay. There's a lot of things to do. - "what about the boat? - We should talk to George about that. - There's no point in dealing with it because no one will use it.
Offer them a lesser sentence and get off quicker. - Oh, my God, what is this? It's like I mutilated myself with a sharp pencil. - Sticks. - One patient took a needle that could go right to the ankle bone.
Ladies and gentlemen, Josh Greenberg. Masturbation. We all do it, but what if I told you you were doing it wrong?
Why should I remember this fucking car? Does it look unfamiliar to you? Does it remind you of anything, look closely? - What's this for? - You don't remember who drove it?
I could use some of that perfume. My cool French boyfriend asks me when it's my birthday. Maybe he wants to send me flowers or find out what my zodiac sign is to see if I'm compatible. These Europeans are obsessed with numerology. Madonna was so into it when she moved to London.
I left her. Masha's lost. I left my diaphragm. - Your diaphragm? Yeah, I just started using it recently.
If that were the case. I think we'd know by now. They'd disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment. Hell, they might even swallow us whole. Science is accurate. But I'm afraid it's a stranger to leniency.
We need to get back to the station. What? Your mom and Hopper will be there as bait. That thing is still out there. And we can't just sit here and let it get to them.
- Who should I trust? I thought I could trust you. - I'm not gonna explain myself to you, Bernard. I've been charged with protecting the park's intellectual property. - Why would it be in danger?
No. But whoever I got is not going anywhere. I never thought a hit man could faint at the sight of his own blood. Wait a minute, I think I just found our target. Which Turner was it?
It's false advertising. You know, I think she's a punk, you know? People like her grow up with all that baggage behind them, right? You know, family squabbles, resentment towards one of her parents, sibling problems, boyfriend problems, all that psychological garbage, you know? All that rage builds up inside and she gives it some stupid noble excuse.
Is there anything we can do? I'm thinking. How long will the gamma cannon take to charge? At least 20 minutes. It doesn't have enough power to fire.
Well, because technically it's my song, since I wrote it, and it's mostly my voice, and I just don't think it's fair.... Scarlett, what's important is what's best for the band, so it should be the song that tells the best story. Okay? ♪This old guitar♪ ♪ Damn, I even took it and gave it a name♪
This is the schedule of all the presidential candidates for the next week... Their movements, security details. We can't give it to him. They'd be easy prey. We can't put that kind of information in the hands of a terrorist. We can only if we can trace it back to him before he uses it.
Unfortunately, we've had to make that hard choice. We all suffer pain. Part of it is physical from wounds or age. part of it is mental, you know, when we live with the loss of our family and friends. If you think about it, whether we fight that pain or give in to it, the result is the same.
But it's actually pretty boring. As always, love, Vanessa. She told her story. Yes, master. Did the doctor believe her?
It's one thing to protect a city, it's another to protect one person. The one you're worried about. I'll find something else to do. And speaking of which, I saw that abyss you were talking about. I don't know how you're fighting it.
A whore resurrected to be given to your creation. To make your life easier. But even this great demon was more human than you. Victor, can't you see the cruelty you're committing? You created life. so let it live.
I don't know how. Because of his magic. His magic is too strong. I saw it on Lian Yu, and it's not just magic. It's darkness, and every time I try to resist it, I can't.
I know it's not a good time. In our apartment. my apartment-- my apartment.... Yeah. Darhk magic, it got to you. I thought, uh. you thought I'd found a way to fight it?
One teddy bear, two teddy bears. That's the end of it. Yeah. I read that book to her every night before this shit. I read it to her every night, but see, it ain't over 'cause daddy's home.
Why would you put seeds in mustard? They're mustard seeds. They make mustard. No, mustard is yellow. You know, you go to a baseball game, you put it on a hot dog.
And judging by your tone and the throbbing vein on your forehead, you're not happy about it? She was about to leave. You should fire her! No. I have a mop, and I know how to use it.
No, I'll wait for you. I'll be downstairs. Okay. Why psychology? How long have you been interested in it?
I'll help you. on one condition. What's that? You don't let this go too far. Your bond with Jace can take some strain. But you have to promise me you won't let it break.
It's a... an offer. Is this a field trip for you? You, you, uh. amateur. I've been to war. All you do is teach it.
I heard him get up. I shouldn't have let him go so early. It's not your fault. It's just the farm's been in Russ' family for generations. If he can't run it.
I don't know any. Thanks anyway. How did it happen? He had a dog. I wanted to give it a treat.
I know. You stopped printing an hour ago. What if all I have is a big headline, Sally? Isn't that the point? That guy over there. he's gonna take the front page of my story and he's gonna wipe his ass with it, and then he's gonna flush it down the toilet, and what's that all about?

I guess you're right. - Shall I show you the house? - What did she say? She wants to show us her farm. - She must be proud of it.
HAMILTON: I think of death so often that it's like a memory to me. When will she take me? In my dream? In a duel? If I see her coming - will I run away or will I let her come?
HAMILTON: Burr, that's why we need it Burr: The Constitution is chaos. That's why it needs amendments.
We don't feature regular people. The merchandise is sold by either stars or specially trained salespeople. I told you that. Who showed you the mop? Sold it to you, showed you how to use it.
No, ma'am. My body feels like absorbent cotton. I gave you a tincture of opium. Are you finished? I need to clean the wound and stitch it up.
Captain Lowe. He paid 90 grand for it. - Why would you...? - Why wouldn't I? Valuable information knocked on the door, I was supposed to let it go?
Where'd he get that car? I don't know. Why? They don't sell those in Canada. Then how does he own it?
I know what you're thinking. "That's impossible. How can it be 4028? How could we have missed so much time? " But what if I told you that this mouse can go into a state that allows it to survive the entire winter without eating, without drinking, and that it actually lives longer as a result?
- That's the life, huh, Jay? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's right, Chet. You know, you gotta take what life has to offer, look it in the eye and take it.
- I didn't think anyone would notice. - But I did. It was, uh. Sarah's birthday. I mean, before she disappeared. I gave it to her, and she loved it.
I just want to look better. Blush. It's going to revitalize you right away. The same company makes this mascara. I use it myself.
Actually, into adulthood, too. We need to put this story to rest. I'm on it. Thanks, Sue. So why haven't you put an end to it?
Damn it, Abe! However, I had no intention of giving up. A few months ago, my life had meant nothing to me. I took no joy or pleasure in it. I would have been glad if this simple game of Russian roulette had ended it.
- So, Master Cromwell. - William Popney says I can find a use for you. He says you have many talents. A remarkable memory? - It's a special technique, my lord. I learned it in Italy.
Its juice contains an alkaloid toxin that blocks calcium channels in the heart. One drop, and the heart stops completely, and death. instantaneous. If nature had its way, you'd be dead by now. But this plant is harmless because I took the poison out of it. On this island, nature does what I tell it to do.
Ana? Ana? Ana! The bird... flew into the house.
- Hey, hey. Thank you so much for coming. Have a seat. What did you want to talk to me about? Well, to be honest, I've been going through a rough patch. And it's made me realize that I haven't been the best with women.
"At the end of the day, the best reward in our lives is the opportunity to do work that is worthwhile." And I would like to add that what makes a job worthwhile is the opportunity to do it with the people you love. I started my career over 30 years ago with the Parks and Recreation Department here in Pawnee, Indiana. I have held many different positions, including two terms as your governor, and soon I will be faced with a new, uncharted challenge, and it still gives me a rush of excitement because I love this job. I don't want to say that public service work isn't sexy, because it is, but that's not why we do it.
I joined here to garden, to grow plants. Hey! Is that our wheelbarrow? It's a prison wheelbarrow. I'm allowed to use it.
Hey! Is that our car? It's a prison car. I'm allowed to use it. You can use it and put it back.
Come on, people. There's no such thing as a bad idea. I wouldn't be so sure about that. I have an idea, but it's not about saving money. But it'll still save us money.
That's creepy! It was a lot of fun! Six months of brain-eating had given me such qualities as fear of pigeons, kleptomania..... But a couple spoonfuls of Javier's brains with microwave pizza, and I'm getting creative. Beauty doesn't just attract me, I long to possess it, to make love to it.
May I? I like it. Hey, Van Damme, give me the damn bag. I can't. Give it to her, or we'll beat the shit out of you.
But he's your brother. What else was he supposed to do? Marco, listen to me. Chuck is not forcing me to do this. He's giving me an opportunity, and I'm gonna take it.

- The subvocal cavity is in pieces! - I need healthy tissue! - Cyanosis. No pulse. - We can take tissue from the palate and patch the subvocal cavity with it.
What are you doing? Get out of the toilet! - Is the girl in there? - Yes. But she's in her 60s, lying as if she's alive, with bare legs.
- Did you go shopping? Sort of. - Did you steal this? - Which is the greater sin? Stealing food or letting it spoil?
And when they do, they will destroy the one thing in the world that the Overlord desires. But as long as this book exists. It's a decoy! You want the Lord? He will come for those who possess it.
Is there a fear and risk here for you, Senator? Is that a threat, Mrs. Pearson? Just an honest question. Life is always full of fear and risk. That's what gives it its spice.
- Okay. Were you warned about this, Mr. Gently? A lumbar puncture is a very painful procedure. I understand that. Look, I wouldn't subject you to it if there was another way to verify the diagnosis.
Anything else? Well, the brand of sneakers like this are used by pro athletes.... Wait, wait, wait. I don't get it. The lack of a midsole height drop from heel to toe, which allows for greater range of motion, strengthens the foot by giving it extra load.
How did you even get in A.J.'s crosshairs? I went to the video store, I asked stupid questions. I was right in front of you, and now I realize you were investigating Sammy's murder, not taking instructions from a gang leader. How could you even think I was on the side of those crazy ninja wannabes? Clive, I know it's hard to understand, but I didn't just hear a rumor and believe it.
- Only a psychopath fell in love with me. - No. Only you could bring out the human in a psychopath. You're normal. I know I'm normal. When I make friends, I try to avoid those who nurture and feed on addiction.
Let me guess. She got the house. I got what he got, too. Sorry I'm late. The escape pod pops up whenever and wherever it wants.
- I didn't. - Okay, maybe it didn't. But still, she wouldn't let me near her for months. Leila. Then one day she let me wash her hair.
This is not the last line of defense. We need a strategy. We could use some help. Your car's long overdue to activate as backup, Harold. Give it a second.
I'm afraid you've miscalculated. We need a strategy. Could use a little help. It's about time your car activated as backup, Harold. Give her a second, she's got a lot on her mind right now.
What's a singularity? It's a black hole. We can destroy Central City. That's a start. If we create a singularity and can't control it, we'll have a global catastrophe.
It seems that if we want Sweetums, we're gonna have to find him ourselves. I'm short a rat. Liv. You're lulling the rat to sleep. I'm ready to name it and then feed it grilled cheese.
I'm really sorry, but I can't. I've been trying for days. I can't live like this. Yes, you can. You can take this burden. And let it destroy you from the inside out.
I've been trying for days. I can't live like this. Yes, you can. You can take this burden. And let it destroy you from the inside out. Or you can take advantage of it.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, have another drink." Oh, God; That's exactly what I'm doing right now. You know, sometimes I see that glint in you. if you eat that last cookie, I'm gonna shove my hand down your throat, pull it out, and beat you to death with it!
Not for me, and not for your mom, and not for your brothers - do it for the music. That's what god sent us to this planet for. No matter how we fight, no matter how we feel, no matter how we try to hurt each other - music, Mal! Music is forever. They will forever dance to it, sing to it, be inspired by it.
If it was a business and the employee didn't comply..... This is not a business. In training, we encourage discussion and opinions that differ from the administration. This is Encore Beach, not Harvard, Lina. And if this school needs to get out of debt, it needs tough leadership, which it hasn't had.
Yeah, something like that. Now hand me those pliers. Interesting. I thought you didn't trust anyone but people. A microwave isn't a person, and yet you let it cook your food.
You are kind to me, Brother Thor. But kindness will not shoe my men or put food on their table. No. That requires faith. And we must surrender to it with a pure heart, not bitterness.
Record the murder and get the M.E. down here. Found the Beretta. There's not a single scratch in the clip from the loading. I don't think this gun ever had a bullet in it. Whoever brought it here wasn't gonna use it.
It's amazing. - You knew I could do it. How? Because Castor and Leda have the same disease. It attacks the brains of boys, the epithelial tissue of women. but your ability to conceive proves, Sarah, that you can somehow beat the disease. You've infected innocent women with it.
- Cosima needs my urine. What do you mean, your urine? Why? I don't know, for a test? Я... I don't know. If she wants it, she can come here herself.
- I'm very glad you mentioned them. Since they themselves revealed to the public that they were treated by us, I think we can confirm that. But I'm not at liberty to divulge details. - In general terms, what made their case special? - Well, let's take the example of a real monkey that was taken from its natural habitat. With this example, you can understand what happened in the Neely family. After all, if we take a monkey and inflict on it the kind of moral damage that only a human can do - that is, change its natural nature - then our task is to pick up the pieces of its soul and put them back together again,
Help me put him down. What was that? Long, long, long ago. before your stories began. A wizard fought the darkness. He was able to stop it from consuming the worlds.
Relax, Hugs. I didn't say I wouldn't, I said I shouldn't. Okay, I'm just gonna give you a direction, the rest is up to you. Dogleg is the code name for a covert operation in Tunisia. I ran it for the CIA.
For what's about to happen, whether I live or die is irrelevant. You can't take my faith away from me. All religions cannot be true at the same time, Peretta. And you know it. Your faith is beautiful. As beautiful as poetry. But there's no room for it now.
Did you discuss this at all? Your Honor, the plaintiff believes that if we leave it at that, we're admitting that it's okay for a grown man to hit a child. And the bat was already on the ground. God, it wasn't on the ground. He was swinging it, he was dangerous.
Earlier in "Slap in the face." Your Honor, the Plaintiff believes that if we leave it at that, we're admitting that it's okay for a grown man to slap a child. And the bat was already on the ground. It wasn't. He was swinging it.
Oh, man, the car's right next to you, and you can't drive it. That's what I'm going through with you guys. Caroline, can I ask you a favor? You are not proposing to Sophie in that car. You heard how much she liked it.
I don't need a psychiatrist. The hoodie and the painted eyes suggest otherwise. Stop trying to escape your inner darkness. Embrace it. Let it run its course.
This isn't just one night. It's been going on for weeks. I hear something, I see something. I see Lawrence. No, this disease is real, and I'm not gonna let it beat me.
There was a huge social movement. Half the country was involved. The voices of the hitherto silent began to be heard. Allende began to return to the indigenous people the lands that had been taken from them. Freedom didn't last long. A coup d'état financed by the United States ended it.
Why do you keep asking "what's this?"? My official recommendation to the Chief that you be released from active duty due to your imminent death. Where are you gonna put it? Since the Hippocratic Oath forbids wiping yourself with it, I intend to give it to you
And there was a funny thing that happened. I was shooting a documentary with a friend of mine. He was filming, and I said, "That's St. Mary's Hospital over there." "That's where I was born." I was pointing at it and a demolition truck comes out of nowhere and just demolishes it, apparently they swung it across the street.
- Are you sure about that? - Look at them the next time you're in court: their looks, their smiles. - He argues, she argues, every time. - Past passion still reignites, doesn't it? - I think they'd give it to her on the bench in court if they could.
Shakespeare needs to live out his days here as history remembers. Great, Will, you step into your time, we step into ours, it's-- it's all good. I'm afraid not. Once Master Shakespeare returns to 1611, the original paradox closes. The timeline requires him to live a life in the past, but it does not require your return.
It's still haunting me. That's why I didn't go anywhere this week. My trip wasn't canceled. Everyone found out, and I couldn't take it. Look, I know this part of life isn't moving too fast for you, but enjoy it as it comes.
1200 years of history and only one made-up song. Wow! Sitting on a diet of pork ribs is not that hard. This diet isn't working. Give it another year.
Over 30? - Not the right atmosphere. - Oh. I'm like a vessel. I walk on the earth, breathe it, feed on it.
As Attorney Morganelli mentioned, Durst is represented by an attorney, and we only communicate with attorneys. - How do you comment on today's events? - It's simple. Mr. Derst wishes to enter his defense against the charges in Texas. His line of defense is solid, and he hopes to use it.
Help me put him down. What was that? Long, long, long ago. before your stories began. A wizard fought the darkness. He was able to stop it from consuming worlds he could control with a dagger.
Seeing Marie in tears? It's not for me. So, cabbage. just when I thought I was out, you pull me back in. Max, don't say that about kale. Don't give it that kind of power.
Just go. Hey. I knew you weren't home. I just wanted to check your security program to see if the flash drive was located. Victoria didn't use it last week.
Take me to Joe. Hey, careful. That thing might be loaded. It's loaded, but, uh. I don't know how to use it.
Not bad, Cookie. We'll start investigating right away. At least try to find something from the last few years. He'll fight you because he cares about this deal. It better not go through.
I want to make it easier for you. Pain is my trade. I know it like a mother knows her child. I nurture pain. I help it grow.
Speak loud and fast. Steve passed out, Doc. Broke the boat. Did you call an ambulance? No, there's no way she can get into this cove, and the lifeboat's here with us.
Do you need a sedative, Jim? I want this damn thing out. Believe it or not, you're fine now. If I take the bone out of your chest, then you could be in danger. So I'm just gonna cut the bone to keep it from moving and damaging your lungs.
Congratulations. Now, would you sign this, please? What's this? It releases the clinic from liability in the event of a pregnancy violation. Why would it be broken?
No. There are too many questions in life... And too little time for answers. You may not understand. I live by a 5,000-year-old book. I ask it questions as if it were alive.
You were sleep-deprived. You must have just fantasized it. No, I-- I know what I saw. That blood wasn't just on me, it was all over the floor, like someone had just dragged the body away.
You can see he's not serious about it. Tony said he'd be willing to write for two pianists. Okay, you know what? I wrote a composition. She didn't like it.
I'm afraid so. I've read some of the letters you write to lonely soldiers. And in each one, you tell the recipient not to take any unnecessary risks and to come home to mom. They're letters to soldiers, Mim. Whether we like it or not, their job is not to hide from danger, but to face it.
New events, new experiences, new people. New things to do. You'll never forget your husband, Kate. But life will pick you up and carry you on. And you just let it do that.
How about nitroglycerin? Look, we spotted a car running a red light four blocks from the crime scene. It's all on the tape. Bullshit, I drive safe! Same car's hanging around the harbor, where I'm sure it doesn't belong.
I didn't let you go. Where are you going? Justice. I am justice. This is a private matter, Olivia, protected by the immunity and nondisclosure agreement you signed when you started working for me, ensuring that the Caledonian monarchy would continue to rule for millennia as it should.
Oh, yeah, I recognize the old Danny. Sorry to take up your time. Okay, universe, I guess the lesson is that without me, Danny Castellano is a pathetic meatball. But my life is so much better without him. I might as well enjoy it. Morgan!
What if the last beat of my heart is all I have left? What if time can't heal? What if the universe needs me to die? The universe is finished! It has nothing more to say!
We have to get across somehow. We haven't come this far to fail. Maybe we don't need to go that way. Pass me the bottle. We can shoot it right through the portal.
all the cameras on them are up and running. - now-- okay. Thanks, Buzz. Lieutenant Provenza, you ready? - Yes, captain. Okay, Sykes, there's only one door. I'll cover it. Go back and help Julio and Mike, please.
And you're one of the best. You're the only one who can do it. And if you make it to the other side, you'll finally realize that your faith in HYDRA was never misplaced. It's real. You will look her in the eye.
And my best moments in life were connected to it. Is it possible for someone to have dark powers but use them to protect people? Emma, don't let such thoughts tempt you. But is it possible? Perhaps someday there will be someone worthy to wield such power and not let it scorch and darken their soul.
Okay, I'll read the whole thing. Did you get the book? Yes. A very special woman introduced me to it. And I want to share it with someone else... so she'll realize how much I care about her.
Thank you. Lab results came back. The blood in Woodhull's trunk belongs to Jeremy Dolan. - Is the blood fresh? - It's two days old.
They were even blindfolded. But they didn't do that this time. No blindfolds, and 3 victims found in roughly the same place, a few feet away from each other. Dee's Real Cafe had a back room in the back. Why didn't they use it?
Richest hotelier in the world. Now she's developing a resort area on the Costa Rican coast. At the same time, an energy company my father consults for wants to build a wind farm nearby. Mrs. Esfandari has stopped the company through the courts, proving that the mills will spoil the view from her window. My father, on the other hand, thinks she won't mind if she is offered the right terms.
Just me. That painting belonged to my family. My father gave his life trying to find it. He died crushed. There's no way I'm letting it sit in some billionaire's den.
Then how about the bathroom? I take it back. Uh, okay. Then the dining room. I guess we didn't use it much.
If I had known about Dr. Edwards, I would have done things differently. We're, uh. We're having a party at our house tonight. You both should come. There'll be food, drinks. She'll love it.
Okay, I'll text you after I talk to Romi. It was good to see you, Caroline. And you, Max. You guys are gonna watch my ass while I walk, right? You gonna shake it for daddy?
It was good to see you, Caroline. And you, Max. You girls are gonna watch my ass while I walk, aren't you? You gonna shake it for daddy? I can't shake it, but I can go "whoo."
I guess you're right. - Shall I show you the house? - What did she say? She wants to show us her farm. - She must be proud of it.
HAMILTON: I think of death so often that it's like a memory to me. When will she take me? In my dream? In a duel? If I see her coming - will I run away or will I let her come?
HAMILTON: Burr, that's why we need it Burr: The Constitution is chaos. That's why it needs amendments.
We don't feature regular people. The merchandise is sold by either stars or specially trained salespeople. I told you that. Who showed you the mop? Sold it to you, showed you how to use it.
No, ma'am. My body feels like absorbent cotton. I gave you a tincture of opium. Are you finished? I need to clean the wound and stitch it up.
Captain Lowe. He paid 90 grand for it. - Why would you...? - Why wouldn't I? Valuable information knocked on the door, I was supposed to let it go?
Where'd he get that car? I don't know. Why? They don't sell those in Canada. Then how does he own it?
I know what you're thinking. "That's impossible. How can it be 4028? How could we have missed so much time? " But what if I told you that this mouse can go into a state that allows it to survive the entire winter without eating, without drinking, and that it actually lives longer as a result?
- That's the life, huh, Jay? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's right, Chet. You know, you gotta take what life has to offer, look it in the eye and take it.
- I didn't think anyone would notice. - But I did. It was, uh. Sarah's birthday. I mean, before she disappeared. I gave it to her, and she loved it.
I just want to look better. Blush. It's going to revitalize you right away. The same company makes this mascara. I use it myself.
Actually, into adulthood, too. We need to put this story to rest. I'm on it. Thanks, Sue. So why haven't you put an end to it?
Damn it, Abe! However, I had no intention of giving up. A few months ago, my life had meant nothing to me. I took no joy or pleasure in it. I would have been glad if this simple game of Russian roulette had ended it.
- So, Master Cromwell. - William Popney says I can find a use for you. He says you have many talents. A remarkable memory? - It's a special technique, my lord. I learned it in Italy.
Its juice contains an alkaloid toxin that blocks calcium channels in the heart. One drop, and the heart stops completely, and death. instantaneous. If nature had its way, you'd be dead by now. But this plant is harmless because I took the poison out of it. On this island, nature does what I tell it to do.
Ana? Ana? Ana! The bird... flew into the house.
- Hey, hey. Thank you so much for coming. Have a seat. What did you want to talk to me about? Well, to be honest, I've been going through a rough patch. And it's made me realize that I haven't been the best with women.
"At the end of the day, the best reward in our lives is the opportunity to do work that is worthwhile." And I would like to add that what makes a job worthwhile is the opportunity to do it with the people you love. I started my career over 30 years ago with the Parks and Recreation Department here in Pawnee, Indiana. I have held many different positions, including two terms as your governor, and soon I will be faced with a new, uncharted challenge, and it still gives me a rush of excitement because I love this job. I don't want to say that public service work isn't sexy, because it is, but that's not why we do it.
I joined here to garden, to grow plants. Hey! Is that our wheelbarrow? It's a prison wheelbarrow. I'm allowed to use it.
Hey! Is that our car? It's a prison car. I'm allowed to use it. You can use it and put it back.
Come on, people. There's no such thing as a bad idea. I wouldn't be so sure about that. I have an idea, but it's not about saving money. But it'll still save us money.
That's creepy! It was a lot of fun! Six months of brain-eating had given me such qualities as fear of pigeons, kleptomania..... But a couple spoonfuls of Javier's brains with microwave pizza, and I'm getting creative. Beauty doesn't just attract me, I long to possess it, to make love to it.
May I? I like it. Hey, Van Damme, give me the damn bag. I can't. Give it to her, or we'll beat the shit out of you.
But he's your brother. What else was he supposed to do? Marco, listen to me. Chuck is not forcing me to do this. He's giving me an opportunity, and I'm gonna take it.

- The subvocal cavity is in pieces! - I need healthy tissue! - Cyanosis. No pulse. - We can take tissue from the palate and patch the subvocal cavity with it.
What are you doing? Get out of the toilet! - Is the girl in there? - Yes. But she's in her 60s, lying as if she's alive, with bare legs.
- Did you go shopping? Sort of. - Did you steal this? - Which is the greater sin? Stealing food or letting it spoil?
And when they do, they will destroy the one thing in the world that the Overlord desires. But as long as this book exists. It's a decoy! You want the Lord? He will come for those who possess it.
Is there a fear and risk here for you, Senator? Is that a threat, Mrs. Pearson? Just an honest question. Life is always full of fear and risk. That's what gives it its spice.
- Okay. Were you warned about this, Mr. Gently? A lumbar puncture is a very painful procedure. I understand that. Look, I wouldn't subject you to it if there was another way to verify the diagnosis.
Anything else? Well, the brand of sneakers like this are used by pro athletes.... Wait, wait, wait. I don't get it. The lack of a midsole height drop from heel to toe, which allows for greater range of motion, strengthens the foot by giving it extra load.
How did you even get in A.J.'s crosshairs? I went to the video store, I asked stupid questions. I was right in front of you, and now I realize you were investigating Sammy's murder, not taking instructions from a gang leader. How could you even think I was on the side of those crazy ninja wannabes? Clive, I know it's hard to understand, but I didn't just hear a rumor and believe it.
- Only a psychopath fell in love with me. - No. Only you could bring out the human in a psychopath. You're normal. I know I'm normal. When I make friends, I try to avoid those who nurture and feed on addiction.
Let me guess. She got the house. I got what he got, too. Sorry I'm late. The escape pod pops up whenever and wherever it wants.
- I didn't. - Okay, maybe it didn't. But still, she wouldn't let me near her for months. Leila. Then one day she let me wash her hair.
This is not the last line of defense. We need a strategy. We could use some help. Your car's long overdue to activate as backup, Harold. Give it a second.
I'm afraid you've miscalculated. We need a strategy. Could use a little help. It's about time your car activated as backup, Harold. Give her a second, she's got a lot on her mind right now.

We have to get across somehow. We haven't come this far to fail. Maybe we don't need to go that way. Pass me the bottle. We can shoot it right through the portal.
all the cameras on them are up and running. - now-- okay. Thanks, Buzz. Lieutenant Provenza, you ready? - Yes, captain. Okay, Sykes, there's only one door. I'll cover it. Go back and help Julio and Mike, please.
And you're one of the best. You're the only one who can do it. And if you make it to the other side, you'll finally realize that your faith in HYDRA was never misplaced. It's real. You will look her in the eye.
And my best moments in life were connected to it. Is it possible for someone to have dark powers but use them to protect people? Emma, don't let such thoughts tempt you. But is it possible? Perhaps someday there will be someone worthy to wield such power and not let it scorch and darken their soul.
Okay, I'll read the whole thing. Did you get the book? Yes. A very special woman introduced me to it. And I want to share it with someone else... so she'll realize how much I care about her.
Thank you. Lab results came back. The blood in Woodhull's trunk belongs to Jeremy Dolan. - Is the blood fresh? - It's two days old.
They were even blindfolded. But they didn't do that this time. No blindfolds, and 3 victims found in roughly the same place, a few feet away from each other. Dee's Real Cafe had a back room in the back. Why didn't they use it?
Richest hotelier in the world. Now she's developing a resort area on the Costa Rican coast. At the same time, an energy company my father consults for wants to build a wind farm nearby. Mrs. Esfandari has stopped the company through the courts, proving that the mills will spoil the view from her window. My father, on the other hand, thinks she won't mind if she is offered the right terms.
Just me. That painting belonged to my family. My father gave his life trying to find it. He died crushed. There's no way I'm letting it sit in some billionaire's den.
Then how about the bathroom? I take it back. Uh, okay. Then the dining room. I guess we didn't use it much.
If I had known about Dr. Edwards, I would have done things differently. We're, uh. We're having a party at our house tonight. You both should come. There'll be food, drinks. She'll love it.
Okay, I'll text you after I talk to Romi. It was good to see you, Caroline. And you, Max. You guys are gonna watch my ass while I walk, right? You gonna shake it for daddy?
It was good to see you, Caroline. And you, Max. You girls are gonna watch my ass while I walk, aren't you? You gonna shake it for daddy? I can't shake it, but I can go "whoo."
I respect that. Why did you tear it up? I was insulted as a woman. It's a normal part of growing up. But he glued our babysitter's face on her.
We'll start with 10 seconds. Wait, wait! Can I make one last request? There's a picture of Elise Graves in my vest pocket. I want it given to her.
If he gets tweeted about, I want to know about it. With all due respect, if S.H.I.E.L.D. is going after Captain America, we have a right to know why. Because he lied to us. Rogers has information regarding Fury's death. He refused to share it.
But there will be dark days ahead. There will be days filled with loneliness. And it is on days like these that we need hope. No matter how deep it goes. No matter how bad you feel. Promise me you won't let hope go. Don't let it die.
What package? The package with the billion-dollar invention inside. Lloyd, where did you put the package? Me? You did. No, remember, we used to stop at the truck stop and we'd play soccer with it.
- she looks more like... - Me? Personally, I prefer the term "Labizian." - We need to talk about the shirt. - Okay. - I love this shirt. - It shows, but it needs a break.
- Damn, that's a good bitch. - Thank you. - Did she have tits like that when you guys were dating? They weren't silicone, were they? Okay, so the whole point of revenge is to enjoy her.
"And God said, Let the water bring forth reptiles, the living soul; and let birds fly over the earth upon the firmament of the heavens. And God created the great fish, and every creeping animal soul which the water produced, after their kind, and every feathered bird after its kind. And God saw that it was good." Genesis 1:20. In other words, life came into existence because God told it to come into existence.
What's your problem? I need that car badly. Okay. Listen to me. If your dad says it's okay, you can use it for free whenever you want.
There's sandwiches in the pickup. Yeah, but you can't hunt for sandwiches? Grandpa, the water won't be cold, will it? Of course not, it's just the North Atlantic. Why would it be cold?
I could pave the road in three months. Oh, why? To destroy the transcontinental railroad system. to build three miles of narrow gauge railroad. If you change your mind, I'll hire you for the job. Or Midas will give you a loan if you want to own it.
The first one and your mother. Then there's the Filipino nurse with the big ass. She was always hitting things with it. - Okay, are you done yet? - Look, kid, you can't make life stop screwing you whenever it wants.
At times the sky is so blue and the reflection in the sea is so brilliant - you can't even look at it. And sometimes huge black clouds creep over the ocean and you feel like you're inside a storm. What I fear most is nature. Right now she's sending the weather out for revenge, we're all open to that revenge. Soon the weather will put on a real show. It's funny how the more I write about the weather, the worse it gets, the more interesting it becomes. the more it shapes the narrative that I prepare for it.
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. That's what I said when I threw the leech into the fire. A leech drunk on the blood of a bastard. The bastard you freed. Now I have an amazing opportunity, but I can't take it.
- Yeah, I'm fine. But you're a dickhead. - How's grandma? - Her fever's holding. She's resting, but she's not feeling well.
Progress. The presentation starts in five minutes. - I can't find it. - Did you look under the table? Why would she be under the table?
Let them take it. It's only right that the house goes to another cop with a wife and a little kid. I just hope she likes the room the way you liked it. I don't. I hope she likes it better.
Is that a candle in your pocket, or do you just really like twins? Tell me about the candle, Bruce. It belonged to Edna St. Vincent Millay, okay? Uh, sure. "My candle burns two ends. She won't last the night."
I went to see her this afternoon for the second time. Right. And she's been working hard on her mouth and her gums, and, uh. And she should use an electric toothbrush. And I can't give her mine, and I can't drive it to her every day.
Disappointed. I was, maybe a little. Well, I don't think my mom would be disappointed. I think she would want me to live my life. Find a way to fill it and share it with the people I love.
Top notch! Look, for a comic book salesman, you're neat, polite, and an eligible suitor. And now. Your destiny is knocking at the door. А? Don't let it slip away.
He goes to the gym, loads at school, and now he wants to do this too. A fucking marathon. It's gonna kill him. I know it, Nicole knows it. What we don't know is if he's running from death or towards it.
You won't miss me. She knows what she's doing. I hope you'll keep quiet about what you saw in the house. When I came here, I saw the strife in that family. I thought I could help reunite them.
Progress. The presentation starts in five minutes. - I can't find it. - Did you look under the table? Why would she be under the table?
Look, when my project goes live, and it will - once it reaches the right number of users, Pied Piper will help you find any song in the entire music collection of the world to find out if you're in copyright infringement. That is, if you're a songwriter or a member of a band ... Okay, first of all, nobody gives a shit about stealing other people's music, okay? Anyone involved in the music industry either steals it or shares it.
And the rotation of the barrel makes it jump. Actually, the speed of airplanes makes them jump. The rotation is to create the Magnus effect. What? The rotation of the barrel allows it to lock onto the dam and reach the base of the dam before the hydrostatic fuse activates it.
Playing games again. Lies, secrets, hidden threats. What exactly have you and your lackey been doing all these years? Johan's work. Well, I'm alive because of it.
If it starts, you will sow death and destruction. What starts what? Don't play games, traitor. You're interfering with destiny. No, I'm finally going to meet it.
You don't look so good. Come in and have some tea. Oscar, I'd love to, but I have to get back to my dream job. What the hell, come in for tea! I pay 80 dollars a month for this apartment and I want people to enjoy it.
What? Why? I lent mine to Cherie. You what? She really needed it.
Objection, Your Honor. Excuse me, Your Honor. Ms. Langhorne, what did Tamsin Drouin tell you when she came to see you? Well, she, uh. She came to me with some wild story. I didn't believe her.
- I have to. - I'm not leaving the base. No, you're not. Have you ever seen death? Ever looked it in the face?
I don't know anything for sure. I just couldn't understand why they thought an ordinary programmer was important, so I asked Ms. Shaw to find out. And you didn't tell me anything? Just like your car, Finch, you have all the information. You just don't share it.
Without it, our nights are darker and our days gloomier. But when we find love, no matter how wrong, no matter how sad and awful, we cling to it. It gives us strength. It gives us resilience. It feeds on us, and we feed on it.
I don't know. I just got sucked into it, more than I thought I would. I just don't want to mess up. Did I tell you? I bought a boat. And a helper to take care of it.
It would have been worth it. Come on, I don't believe you. Can I do something extremely corny? Again? I've been wearing this thing for a week, but I've never used it. And I really want to take a picture of the two of us.
Deke, what's so funny? What do you want me to do with this information? Do what? You and the mayor are neck and neck. Use it.
Then there was a knock on the door, and I heard him talking to Viva and Luisa Nunez, the housekeeper and her little girl. Then he made them come inside. So you could hear him talking to them? Yes, and... I was terribly frightened for them, so I used all the strength I had left and broke the metal bar out of the headboard, and when Lewis came into the room, I hit him with it.
Because their hearts are filled with joy, isn't that an option? We need to see what's going on out there. Take the toy helicopter out of the car. This "toy" is a professional aerial photography device for house sales only! You used it at the beach to film yourself making sand angels.
We're gonna have a long day tomorrow. Okay, then turn around. All night? There's not a single thing in your bag that hasn't gotten wet. Let it dry.
Jimmy Jr.? What, Tina? You're doing all right for the dance contest, but for the magic contest, you're missing the actual magic. When did you become an expert, Tina? You've only been doing magic for a day, and I've been doing it for nine days!
He ignores the opera, I sponsor it. We saw "Figaro" last season. How did it end? Same as it always is, John. It's 200 years old.
You said you checked them out? That's right. We did. Angela Birkett has her own law practice. She seems to be making a pretty good income.
But there will still be someone in the reception area. There's a dispatcher and usually one or two officers for the night shift. You guys should use the service door behind the dumpster. All right? Nobody uses it.
If Vinnie Van Gogh saw this car, he'd chop off both his ears. This car wasn't made. This car wasn't made. It was sculpted. The interior is finished in luxury woods. The luxury leather upholstery is climate-appropriate, expensive and sexy. If the tailpipe wasn't so small, I'd give it a shove.
You're hurting me! No! General, help! A man in your position is privy to all sorts of information. If you were willing to share it, I might reconsider.
It was great to perform in front of the judges and talk to each of them and get advice - it's all great I'll be able to apply it A different style, a different sound from Melissa. I'm gonna do an Amy Winehouse song. I've listened to it a thousand times, and I really want to pay tribute to her.
Shh. It's okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Angela, set her free. Save her soul from this world and let her soar high into the sky.
- Omar! - Dad. Raheem ruined my life by posting that video. - Your life is not ruined. - It's over.
I'm sorry. how long have you been there? 200 years...at least. He's lying. Rumple built this library for me just before the curse. It's only 30 years old.
Felix isn't so bad. His heart is as big as his mouth. That last part is so boring. I played it at the audition. Thanks to it, we got fourth place.
No, you wanted to put my call down or someone would have answered it by now! How much did you say this book is worth? Is it a law book? Whatever you say. Well, 120 bucks, and come up with a boring title.
Why waste time on petty tinkering when we can discuss the real war? Perhaps you and I have more in common than you realize. I don't think we do. I want the car free. And you want to take it.
Mines? What kind of island is this? Can you move explosives? Definitely. But keeping it from exploding, uh.
Time's up, but, uh, I don't have any more clients, so, uh. You did a good job. I gotta tell you. I mean, what can't this asshole do? - You shaped it, so you get the dough.
Plus, I made out with Harvey from the movie club. I think I'm jealous of Harvey. Don't be. A few weeks later, he almost died when he was electrocuted by a VCR. There's still a rumor going around that he can turn on the microwave just by winking at it.
Charming. - Mike? - Yes, ma'am. I want to talk to you about the speech for the World War I service, okay? I'm very proud of her, ma'am.
Gordon, why the hell are you attacking me? - She stole the money. - I put my soul into that box. - And I didn't? - You gave her a name and a pen.
I don't need a treadmill! The doctor said you need exercise! I exercise enough as it is! Suppressing my will to live is not exercise! If she's not gonna use it, why are we busting our asses here?
I'm willing to do it as a foursome. Yes! I'll book a room. You go woo, get them to give you as many shower caps as they'll agree to.... Okay, stop. They only get one hand, and I'm not even gonna move it.
Okay, okay. I know Greg was impressed with Berman's smart house, but I don't think he's seen this smart car, man. It's amazing. It's like a detective on wheels. Just give her a CSI badge and a field kit.
Shaw, help me out here. Six months ago, I was ready to put a bullet in this guy's head. But since hanging around you guys, I've kind of gotten used to saving people. But we've only been able to do it by trusting the machine. And if she says this guy has to go, I think we should still trust her.
Take a long and relaxing bubble bath as soon as I begin phase number two, the uploading of your consciousness into your new body. She'll have my brain? Not your physical brain. Your mind, your thoughts, your memory, your personality. Will she like brussels sprouts?
She had a restraining order. You tried to kill her. That's not true. We were arguing, and I was cleaning my rifle. So I swung it a couple times.
Let's not waste any time. I'll drive by the places he's been. Take a picture, it'll make it easier to find. - This one? It's at least 30 years old.
Well, the curtain is up and it's time to light the lights! Are you sure you're not mistaken? This is it. This is it. You're just, uh. You're just gonna face a lot of pain. control it, show it who's boss!
There is only one place on Earth with such a view of the Hudson. below the pier, trees on the other side. It was a routine process of elimination. Norman's car is outside, but it looks like it hasn't been used in a while.
- You know, it's not like you're blowing the audience away here at Lucky Strike. Michael Schumacher won the Formula One championship five years in a row, and I think even the biggest Michael Schumacher fan had to admit that it was because he had the fastest car. Will may have been at his peak when you were his producer, but I have to remind you that you were also at your peak when he was your presenter. I'm offering you a fast car. - It needs repairs.
The cops work for me. I don't like cops. I can't trust them. Mr. Sabini uses them all the time. That's why he's winning in London, not you. The war won't end until you end it, pal.
- It's a ritual lamb sacrifice. - Yes, and we're going to sacrifice it. Tonight. That's why we lock the doors. But this year, we thought we'd give the fucking goat a name. - You gave it a name?
- One good fuck. - That's him talking about "Skinny." 2,000 years of studying ballistics is needed when a cannon is fired many times. We need our cannon to blow itself apart. It only needs to be fired once.
Like what? A pig! I don't know, Chief. What the hell should we do, do an autopsy on her? We gave her Relanium and she had a heart attack.
Come on, if I win again, I'm not wearing this pendant. Carrie, if you don't wear that camera pendant, we won't be able to see what's going on in the casino. Jay, if I wear this camera pendant, I'm gonna look like a Beverly Hills housewife. This thing is huge. I bought the exact same pendant for my sister a couple years ago, and she loved it.
I smoked it. You smoked it? All of it? Well, I shared it, but I-- you shared it?
Out of nothing. And you have nothing. A little tiara. You have an opportunity. Take it.
Dr. Cummings, would you examine Mr. Julio? He doesn't look very well. In the meantime, I'm sure everyone would welcome the quiet. I don't like silence. Music is a wonderful gift, and we should share it.
- You'll have it. My doctor will send you my medical history. But please be careful. This could ruin my career. If it's not already over.
Something happened about two centuries ago. And I changed. My life is like yours. Except for one detail. There's no end to it.
I have a long story. Something happened about two centuries ago. And I've changed. My life is like yours. Except for one detail. There's no end to it.
- And we can think about the future again - like all normal people. - Is that what I'm hoping for? Mr. Bates, I thought you'd decided to believe me. - I told you, that thing belongs to Lady Mary. - I believe you. - I don't know why she wants it, but I believe you.
When I was with the Espheni, I learned to control my abilities. I -- I -- it's hard to explain. You should try it. It's like I can see energy, control it, all kinds of energy -- gravity, radio waves, electric current.
And you know what? I love this country. I still do. No matter what. It's been through so much!
I'm much older than I look, my dear. But, of course, things were less civilized then. Back when men were men, and the pernicious weeds of civilization did not grow so lushly on this blooming earth. Oh, you may be a man of the law, sir, but you have a romantic soul. Though this newfound soulful intimacy with Ned might help me endure this journey, I couldn't let it distract me from my quest to find my way back to the standing stones of Craig-Nu-Dun and return to my own life in the 20th century.
I'll find her, somebody has to. Not a real U.S. Marshal, then, is it? I was. But I've been looking for the same person for too long. It's hard to hold down a job when you become obsessed with it.
She'll be gone tomorrow. You want to keep her? Yeah. I'm gonna freeze it. - Like a piece of wedding cake. - Yeah, that's right. I'll take her out once a year. Get her a tattoo and buy her some new clothes.
- And who was he yelling it to? - I don't know. There was no one else. But I think this guy saved my life. That power... what did it want?
- I don't know. There was no one else. But I think this guy saved my life. That power... what did she want? It seems like it, uh. needed me.
It's a wonderful bird, isn't it? Beautiful plumage. Listen, pal. At home, I took the liberty of examining this bird and found that it was only holding on to the perch for one reason - because it was pinned to it. Of course it was pinned! And if I hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would have had the strength to bend the bars, turn them around with its strong beak.... and whoosh!
Ha-ha. I'm gonna try and outrun him, assuming your car can do at least 60 miles an hour. My car will be faster than yours. What kind of driver, what kind of car. Remember that. Oh, yeah? What about the fact that it doesn't need gas?
Something happened about two centuries ago. And I changed. My life is like yours. Except for one detail. There's no end to it.
Let's get out of here. Oh, my God. Has that hole been here the whole time? Why didn't we notice it before? She wants me, but she almost took you.
Oh, my God. Has that hole been here the whole time? Why didn't we notice it before? She wants me, but she almost took you. No, Vince, I won't let her.
Show the goods with your face, walk the ace. Oh, my God! 25-- No, 50. Give me a spade and I'll kill you with it!
She doesn't care about the citizens. All she cares about is defeating me. This is war, Sergeant. A war against Wunch. Oh, good. You've already come up with a name for it.
Meanwhile, we know HYDRA is trying to find evidence of alien writings. That's not good. Yeah, it's not good. And that's not the worst of it. Analysis of the painting came back. It's 500 years old.
Yeah. Wait! You have to wear gloves. The record is old. The oil from your fingers could hurt it.
Just give me the record and I'll give her what she wants. She wants her soul. And it's not yours to give. You lied to her. 20 years ago, for Ian Fell's life.
If your family's out there, we'll find them. How does that sound? Looks like I'm going back to work on the railroad. I've dug this ditch before. There's a difference between digging a ditch and owning one, sir.
Sure, you can use my computer. I'm sorry, I just need to-- You need what? Does this building have its own zip code? Yeah, mail delivery's been more efficient since we stopped using it.
These gloves can hide your powers. Unstoppable? If you believe in it. Faith can be very powerful. But for those who don't have it, another solution is required.
Won't let me remove it. She's resisting. What was she doing? Trying to infiltrate the real world. She tricked you into giving her the password. That's how she ended up on your computer.
[Target located] [Officer en route] Any advice on eyeliner? Yeah. You might want to ease up on the eyeliner, sister.
The story is as old as the world. New technology keeps coming up and all the peasants are going crazy But there's one prince who knows what's going on. He says, "Don't trust technology!" And all you peasants trust it, and the tech then becomes intelligent and destroys you all.
Something happened about two centuries ago. And I've changed. But my life is just like yours. Except for one small detail. There's no end to it.
Guys, look at this. I was rehearsing the material in the room, and you see what happens? The door closes on its own. I think there's a ghost in my room. Motif, it's probably a mouse, and it's closing the door because it's sick of your material.
They're united. [Lizard! Wait, do lizards eat fish? She just wants to try it! See if she likes it!
Physical pain has a function. It teaches us. Doesn't it, Doctor? Well, it teaches us how to defend ourselves. In a perfect world, we learn from it.
Did I do it myself a year ago? No. He can't have her. Then what are we gonna do about the second kid? You think if he had that ability, he wouldn't have used it by now?
I picture a man lying under a parked car, dead. The tow truck's skid was lowered-- on his wrist. And then your puddle turned into a soupy soup. But why do you keep saying he was dead? He could have just been a drunk lying on the side of the road with his arm where it shouldn't have been.
Look inside yourself. Try to feel your instincts. Your instincts have never failed you before. And it won't now. Trust it.
Why you? Because I think I know who you are. And who is that? You're a girl who recognized true love and gave herself to it wholeheartedly.
I respect that. Why did you tear it up? I was insulted as a woman. It's a normal part of growing up. But he glued our babysitter's face on her.
We'll start with 10 seconds. Wait, wait! Can I make one last request? There's a picture of Elise Graves in my vest pocket. I want it given to her.

Anyone involved in the music industry either steals it or shares it.
And the rotation of the barrel makes it jump. Actually, the speed of airplanes makes them jump. The rotation is to create the Magnus effect. What? The rotation of the barrel allows it to lock onto the dam and reach the base of the dam before the hydrostatic fuse activates it.
Playing games again. Lies, secrets, hidden threats. What exactly have you and your lackey been doing all these years? Johan's work. Well, I'm alive because of it.
If it starts, you will sow death and destruction. What starts what? Don't play games, traitor. You're interfering with destiny. No, I'm finally going to meet it.
You don't look so good. Come in and have some tea. Oscar, I'd love to, but I have to get back to my dream job. What the hell, come in for tea! I pay 80 dollars a month for this apartment and I want people to enjoy it.
What? Why? I lent mine to Cherie. You what? She really needed it.
Objection, Your Honor. Excuse me, Your Honor. Ms. Langhorne, what did Tamsin Drouin tell you when she came to see you? Well, she, uh. She came to me with some wild story. I didn't believe her.
- I have to. - I'm not leaving the base. No, you're not. Have you ever seen death? Ever looked it in the face?
I don't know anything for sure. I just couldn't understand why they thought an ordinary programmer was important, so I asked Ms. Shaw to find out. And you didn't tell me anything? Just like your car, Finch, you have all the information. You just don't share it.
Without it, our nights are darker and our days gloomier. But when we find love, no matter how wrong, no matter how sad and awful, we cling to it. It gives us strength. It gives us resilience. It feeds on us, and we feed on it.
I don't know. I just got sucked into it, more than I thought I would. I just don't want to mess up. Did I tell you? I bought a boat. And a helper to take care of it.
It would have been worth it. Come on, I don't believe you. Can I do something extremely corny? Again? I've been wearing this thing for a week, but I've never used it. And I really want to take a picture of the two of us.
Deke, what's so funny? What do you want me to do with this information? Do what? You and the mayor are neck and neck. Use it.
Then there was a knock on the door, and I heard him talking to Viva and Luisa Nunez, the housekeeper and her little girl. Then he made them come inside. So you could hear him talking to them? Yes, and... I was terribly frightened for them, so I used all the strength I had left and broke the metal bar out of the headboard, and when Lewis came into the room, I hit him with it.
Because their hearts are filled with joy, isn't that an option? We need to see what's going on out there. Take the toy helicopter out of the car. This "toy" is a professional aerial photography device for house sales only! You used it at the beach to film yourself making sand angels.
We're gonna have a long day tomorrow. Okay, then turn around. All night? There's not a single thing in your bag that hasn't gotten wet. Let it dry.
Jimmy Jr.? What, Tina? You're doing all right for the dance contest, but for the magic contest, you're missing the actual magic. When did you become an expert, Tina? You've only been doing magic for a day, and I've been doing it for nine days!
He ignores the opera, I sponsor it. We saw "Figaro" last season. How did it end? Same as it always is, John. It's 200 years old.
You said you checked them out? That's right. We did. Angela Birkett has her own law practice. She seems to be making a pretty good income.
But there will still be someone in the reception area. There's a dispatcher and usually one or two officers for the night shift. You guys should use the service door behind the dumpster. All right? Nobody uses it.
If Vinnie Van Gogh saw this car, he'd chop off both his ears. This car wasn't made. This car wasn't made. It was sculpted. The interior is finished in luxury woods. The luxury leather upholstery is climate-appropriate, expensive and sexy. If the tailpipe wasn't so small, I'd give it a shove.
You're hurting me! No! General, help! A man in your position is privy to all sorts of information. If you were willing to share it, I might reconsider.
It was great to perform in front of the judges and talk to each of them and get advice - it's all great I'll be able to apply it A different style, a different sound from Melissa. I'm gonna do an Amy Winehouse song. I've listened to it a thousand times, and I really want to pay tribute to her.
Shh. It's okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Angela, set her free. Save her soul from this world and let her soar high into the sky.
- Omar! - Dad. Raheem ruined my life by posting that video. - Your life is not ruined. - It's over.
I'm sorry. how long have you been there? 200 years...at least. He's lying. Rumple built this library for me just before the curse. It's only 30 years old.
Felix isn't so bad. His heart is as big as his mouth. That last part is so boring. I played it at the audition. Thanks to it, we got fourth place.
No, you wanted to put my call down or someone would have answered it by now! How much did you say this book is worth? Is it a law book? Whatever you say. Well, 120 bucks, and come up with a boring title.
Why waste time on petty tinkering when we can discuss the real war? Perhaps you and I have more in common than you realize. I don't think we do. I want the car free. And you want to take it.
Mines? What kind of island is this? Can you move explosives? Definitely. But keeping it from exploding, uh.
Time's up, but, uh, I don't have any more clients, so, uh. You did a good job. I gotta tell you. I mean, what can't this asshole do? - You shaped it, so you get the dough.
Plus, I made out with Harvey from the movie club. I think I'm jealous of Harvey. Don't be. A few weeks later, he almost died when he was electrocuted by a VCR. There's still a rumor going around that he can turn on the microwave just by winking at it.
Charming. - Mike? - Yes, ma'am. I want to talk to you about the speech for the World War I service, okay? I'm very proud of her, ma'am.
Gordon, why the hell are you attacking me? - She stole the money. - I put my soul into that box. - And I didn't? - You gave her a name and a pen.
I don't need a treadmill! The doctor said you need exercise! I exercise enough as it is! Suppressing my will to live is not exercise! If she's not gonna use it, why are we busting our asses here?
I'm willing to do it as a foursome. Yes! I'll book a room. You go woo, get them to give you as many shower caps as they'll agree to.... Okay, stop. They only get one hand, and I'm not even gonna move it.
Okay, okay. I know Greg was impressed with Berman's smart house, but I don't think he's seen this smart car, man. It's amazing. It's like a detective on wheels. Just give her a CSI badge and a field kit.
Shaw, help me out here. Six months ago, I was ready to put a bullet in this guy's head. But since hanging around you guys, I've kind of gotten used to saving people. But we've only been able to do it by trusting the machine. And if she says this guy has to go, I think we should still trust her.
Take a long and relaxing bubble bath as soon as I begin phase number two, the uploading of your consciousness into your new body. She'll have my brain? Not your physical brain. Your mind, your thoughts, your memory, your personality. Will she like brussels sprouts?
She had a restraining order. You tried to kill her. That's not true. We were arguing, and I was cleaning my rifle. So I swung it a couple times.
Let's not waste any time. I'll drive by the places he's been. Take a picture, it'll make it easier to find. - This one? It's at least 30 years old.
Well, the curtain is up and it's time to light the lights! Are you sure you're not mistaken? This is it. This is it. You're just, uh. You're just gonna face a lot of pain. control it, show it who's boss!
There is only one place on Earth with such a view of the Hudson. below the pier, trees on the other side. It was a routine process of elimination. Norman's car is outside, but it looks like it hasn't been used in a while.
- You know, it's not like you're blowing the audience away here at Lucky Strike. Michael Schumacher won the Formula One championship five years in a row, and I think even the biggest Michael Schumacher fan had to admit that it was because he had the fastest car. Will may have been at his peak when you were his producer, but I have to remind you that you were also at your peak when he was your presenter. I'm offering you a fast car. - It needs repairs.
The cops work for me. I don't like cops. I can't trust them. Mr. Sabini uses them all the time. That's why he's winning in London, not you. The war won't end until you end it, pal.
- It's a ritual lamb sacrifice. - Yes, and we're going to sacrifice it. Tonight. That's why we lock the doors. But this year, we thought we'd give the fucking goat a name. - You gave it a name?
- One good fuck. - That's him talking about "Skinny." 2,000 years of studying ballistics is needed when a cannon is fired many times. We need our cannon to blow itself apart. It only needs to be fired once.
Like what? A pig! I don't know, Chief. What the hell should we do, do an autopsy on her? We gave her Relanium and she had a heart attack.
Come on, if I win again, I'm not wearing this pendant. Carrie, if you don't wear that camera pendant, we won't be able to see what's going on in the casino. Jay, if I wear this camera pendant, I'm gonna look like a Beverly Hills housewife. This thing is huge. I bought the exact same pendant for my sister a couple years ago, and she loved it.
I smoked it. You smoked it? All of it? Well, I shared it, but I-- you shared it?
Out of nothing. And you have nothing. A little tiara. You have an opportunity. Take it.
Dr. Cummings, would you examine Mr. Julio? He doesn't look very well. In the meantime, I'm sure everyone would welcome the quiet. I don't like silence. Music is a wonderful gift, and we should share it.
- You'll have it. My doctor will send you my medical history. But please be careful. This could ruin my career. If it's not already over.
Something happened about two centuries ago. And I changed. My life is like yours. Except for one detail. There's no end to it.
I have a long story. Something happened about two centuries ago. And I've changed. My life is like yours. Except for one detail. There's no end to it.
- And we can think about the future again - like all normal people. - Is that what I'm hoping for? Mr. Bates, I thought you'd decided to believe me. - I told you, that thing belongs to Lady Mary. - I believe you. - I don't know why she wants it, but I believe you.
When I was with the Espheni, I learned to control my abilities. I -- I -- it's hard to explain. You should try it. It's like I can see energy, control it, all kinds of energy -- gravity, radio waves, electric current.
And you know what? I love this country. I still do. No matter what. It's been through so much!
I'm much older than I look, my dear. But, of course, things were less civilized then. Back when men were men, and the pernicious weeds of civilization did not grow so lushly on this blooming earth. Oh, you may be a man of the law, sir, but you have a romantic soul. Though this newfound soulful intimacy with Ned might help me endure this journey, I couldn't let it distract me from my quest to find my way back to the standing stones of Craig-Nu-Dun and return to my own life in the 20th century.
I'll find her, somebody has to. Not a real U.S. Marshal, then, is it? I was. But I've been looking for the same person for too long. It's hard to hold down a job when you become obsessed with it.
She'll be gone tomorrow. You want to keep her? Yeah. I'm gonna freeze it. - Like a piece of wedding cake. - Yeah, that's right. I'll take her out once a year. Get her a tattoo and buy her some new clothes.
- And who was he yelling it to? - I don't know. There was no one else. But I think this guy saved my life. That power... what did it want?
- I don't know. There was no one else. But I think this guy saved my life. That power... what did she want? It seems like it, uh. needed me.
It's a wonderful bird, isn't it? Beautiful plumage. Listen, pal. At home, I took the liberty of examining this bird and found that it was only holding on to the perch for one reason - because it was pinned to it. Of course it was pinned! And if I hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would have had the strength to bend the bars, turn them around with its strong beak.... and whoosh!
Ha-ha. I'm gonna try and outrun him, assuming your car can do at least 60 miles an hour. My car will be faster than yours. What kind of driver, what kind of car. Remember that. Oh, yeah? What about the fact that it doesn't need gas?
Something happened about two centuries ago. And I changed. My life is like yours. Except for one detail. There's no end to it.
Let's get out of here. Oh, my God. Has that hole been here the whole time? Why didn't we notice it before? She wants me, but she almost took you.
Oh, my God. Has that hole been here the whole time? Why didn't we notice it before? She wants me, but she almost took you. No, Vince, I won't let her.
Show the goods with your face, walk the ace. Oh, my God! 25-- No, 50. Give me a spade and I'll kill you with it!
She doesn't care about the citizens. All she cares about is defeating me. This is war, Sergeant. A war against Wunch. Oh, good. You've already come up with a name for it.
Meanwhile, we know HYDRA is trying to find evidence of alien writings. That's not good. Yeah, it's not good. And that's not the worst of it. Analysis of the painting came back. It's 500 years old.
Yeah. Wait! You have to wear gloves. The record is old. The oil from your fingers could hurt it.
Just give me the record and I'll give her what she wants. She wants her soul. And it's not yours to give. You lied to her. 20 years ago, for Ian Fell's life.
If your family's out there, we'll find them. How does that sound? Looks like I'm going back to work on the railroad. I've dug this ditch before. There's a difference between digging a ditch and owning one, sir.
Sure, you can use my computer. I'm sorry, I just need to-- You need what? Does this building have its own zip code? Yeah, mail delivery's been more efficient since we stopped using it.
These gloves can hide your powers. Unstoppable? If you believe in it. Faith can be very powerful. But for those who don't have it, another solution is required.
Won't let me remove it. She's resisting. What was she doing? Trying to infiltrate the real world. She tricked you into giving her the password. That's how she ended up on your computer.
[Target located] [Officer en route] Any advice on eyeliner? Yeah. You might want to ease up on the eyeliner, sister.
The story is as old as the world. New technology keeps coming up and all the peasants are going crazy But there's one prince who knows what's going on. He says, "Don't trust technology!" And all you peasants trust it, and the tech then becomes intelligent and destroys you all.
Something happened about two centuries ago. And I've changed. But my life is just like yours. Except for one small detail. There's no end to it.
Guys, look at this. I was rehearsing the material in the room, and you see what happens? The door closes on its own. I think there's a ghost in my room. Motif, it's probably a mouse, and it's closing the door because it's sick of your material.
They're united. [Lizard! Wait, do lizards eat fish? She just wants to try it! See if she likes it!
Physical pain has a function. It teaches us. Doesn't it, Doctor? Well, it teaches us how to defend ourselves. In a perfect world, we learn from it.
Did I do it myself a year ago? No. He can't have her. Then what are we gonna do about the second kid? You think if he had that ability, he wouldn't have used it by now?
I picture a man lying under a parked car, dead. The tow truck's skid was lowered-- on his wrist. And then your puddle turned into a soupy soup. But why do you keep saying he was dead? He could have just been a drunk lying on the side of the road with his arm where it shouldn't have been.
Look inside yourself. Try to feel your instincts. Your instincts have never failed you before. And it won't now. Trust it.
Why you? Because I think I know who you are. And who is that? You're a girl who recognized true love and gave herself to it wholeheartedly.
- Not thirteen, not anymore. That young, dark-haired archer. We put a Morgul arrow in him. The poison is already in his blood. Soon he'll choke on it.
I don't think so. I guess that's one thing we have in common. I'm gonna get these bastards too, and right now I don't care how I do it. They found a formal loophole. And they're taking advantage of it.
- Tell me about it, I'm so turned on. This is who you really are, Mindy. You may dress or talk differently than we do. But when it comes to guys, we're all the same. Twilight, Channing Tatum, Union J. It's biology, bitch. Don't fight it.
And some of those French assholes you saw him hanging around with. I wish I'd met him before I wrote Hamlet. He would have made the most perfect role model. "Love is not a pathetic puppet in the hands of time that wipes away the roses." "On fiery lips and cheeks, and no time's dangers to her."
The opening of my sensitive door, gave me the opportunity to develop my morphological knowledge from leaves to genitalia. I went on a journey, as they would say in children's books, through the land of big black dicks, the land of little yellow ones, and so on. And for the most part, I made my way through an endless array of circumcised dicks. By the way, did you know that if you collect the foreskin that's been circumcised in history. you could pave the road to Mars and back?
You're a doctor, but you're unemployed. - Well. - Would you like to work for me? At Osterity? In rehab? Is it yours? My brother Argil runs it, but we're short-staffed.
So what's the deal with the time machine? What do you mean? How does it work? Well, it's complicated. Would I have to get naked to operate it?
No man has ever controlled two elements at once. I'm not like the others. I can do it. You can. But then Rava must keep that power until you master it.
I'm not going to argue the business side of the issue. It's not my place, nor my area of expertise, but I do know the following.... Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs, enriched media, it's all surface. These are all temporary fads. They are not the foundation on which this newspaper is built, and they are not what will help it survive.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Dad. That woman's pipes are always clogged. We gotta help her.
Arsen. You didn't go to town? Before we came here, we were in Heppylon. My mom gave me a lot of money for that card. I can use it at any vending machine.
My feet and my toes are on fire! The burning in my extremities. In the Middle Ages, it was called St. Anthony's fire. Reid, ergotism. That man at my morgue - that doesn't explain the manner of his death, the decomposition of his stomach that preceded it.

She knew him as Randolph James. It just got worse. What? "There'll never be secrets between us," that's what he told me. When love sweeps you off your feet like that, you have no choice but to confide in it.
I have a girlfriend. Yes, you do. Come on. Slap that ass. Let her know who she belongs to.
I'll get you some water. - Yeah. Yeah, I-- And Tony had a new opportunity to get into Gob's phone. And he didn't take it.
Why aren't you socializing? Я... - I can't concentrate. - Don't push yourself. Let each thought come and go as it pleases.
Wow. That's weird coming from you. I'm really good, you know? You always make everything better. Do you remember that Sunday at church when the dying butterfly flew in the window and landed on your palm and you tried to help it fly and it just couldn't?
Yeah, and she didn't feel a thing. What kind of gun do you use? .45 caliber. Right in the back of the head. She was so small, it practically blew her whole head off.
You talk to him. He's really listening to you. Fitz. We're all concerned that this campaign needs a spark. Your father could be that spark.
Don't cry. Oh, God. Let's just-- let's just get your mom a kidney. -Don't. She needs it.
I think I know what we're looking for. Your spelling's a little off, isn't it? Terrible. There's no such word as "ran." There's "ran." But the important thing is that the story makes sense and I believe it.
Did you come up with a name for it? No, what I meant was. You know what? I'm not gonna stand here and be accused by the likes of you. And if there was a door here, honey, I'd slam it in your face.
If you've been a good person, you'll just make yourself even better. Well, I guess it depends on how you look at it. You wanted to ask me about Elliston Farm? You worked there, didn't you? No, I ran it.
All right, ataz, I'm outta here. You're hopelessly hopeless, Buster. That song sounds like it's about my son. I'm happy for your new hand. But stick it to someone else.
We'll pretend it's a vacation. Milner thinks that's how long it'll take her to clean it up, if only she has the manuscript. she has the manuscript. We have to give it to her. Jessica. She needs it to end this.
Yeah, I came prepared. I'd expect nothing less. Good luck with your speech. My speech doesn't need your wishes. It needs a warning from the chief of medicine because it's so unhealthy.
And they found me. "They"? Believers. People who know that magic exists. And that it has no place in this world. And they're ready to fix it.
Tamara. But I had help. What are you doing, Tamara? I have to keep magic out of this world, Neal. It doesn't belong here.
Job done. How many times do I have to explain the difference between vendetta and revenge? This can't be a war of attrition. The Order of the Dragon is like Hydra. Cut off its head, and they'll grow two to replace it.
Luckily, there's more than that on the menu. He may be a lousy builder, but now it's his time. That's family bliss! Stone ledges are the only place bald eagles build their nests. So they owe their home to a river that has exposed the side of a huge boulder. This river and many others like it join to form the major rivers of Central Africa.
Wide, flat and safe. These sandy strips attract visitors from the coast. African water vultures looking for a safe place to settle down. The lower part of their beak is greatly elongated. They cut across the water surface at 10 meters per second.
It's half past two. I gotta get outta here. I got the day shift. And you can finish that. That door closes behind you if you slam it shut, which is what you're great at, so--
If federated Georgia doesn't agree to an unconditional retreat by midnight tonight, he'll detonate the bomb. You must know he has power, right? Uh-huh. But a nuke? He's crazy enough to use it.
There has to be another way. You've done this a thousand times, Castiel. You're ready. Kill him. Then take the tablet and bring it home where it belongs.
Which I did. "Some view neonomatopoeic irony as a derivative of semantic manipulation." Interesting point of view. Because of the narrow tires, it's pretty obvious that the GT86 wasn't designed to break records at the Nürburgring. And with 197 horsepower and a two-liter engine, it's not going to be a drag racing star.
And here's the first corner. Just the right tire squeal and the perfect trajectory. Keep going down the road. Yeah, good plan! Just follow it through. It's not looking too bad.
Look at the little duckling swimming in the tarp. Do you think they move each leg one at a time, or both at the same time? I think each one in turn, Vic. You know, the great Mel Ott raised ducklings in Louisiana during the off-season. And when a duckling got sick, he'd take it to his bed until it got better.
You know where Joe would go? He always goes either to me or to her. You have no idea what it's like to have a baby and be alone and pull everything by yourself. I gave her this shirt for her birthday. She didn't like it.
No Teddy. So, what do we do? Where do we start? I set up alerts on the credit card I gave her, so I'll be notified if she uses it. In the meantime, I'll print out a list of every place she's ever used it.
None of the other stores in the lobby were broken into. Must have gone upstairs. But the staircases were locked. The card for the elevator was in the guard's jacket. You think they used it and then put it back?
"in" means "not", "credibile" means "trustworthy" - well.... Your message said you had something vital to us, something from the President's ABM program. I'm giving it to you right now, but you're not listening. This technology-- it's "not credible." At best, it's 50 years before it can be remotely controlled.
Who, uh. uh. Who knew the boat was moored there? It wasn't a secret. Anyone who walked along the beach there. - And when was the last time you used it?
In thunderstorm clouds that form, upward currents separate the charges. The lighter ice crystals become positively charged and rise upward, while the heavier, negatively charged crystals settle downward. The result is a potential difference of up to 100 million volts between the clouds and the ground. Nature likes to equalize everything. The imbalance is not to her liking and she tries to correct it by means of electric current.
What's the big deal? You think there are fingerprints? Because there could be hundreds of prints on any given bill. Yeah, but if we find the same prints on different bills, we'll know who gave him the money the night of the murder. You know, if I had any unrelated cash on me, I'd stuff it in these panties.
- What's next, a security camera? - Maybe. - We'll bug her. - Tony, stop. Please stop, and please, for God's sake, put the pen down before I stab you with it.
- What's going on here? We're just making dinner. Didn't expect to see you. Maddie left her soccer uniform in the car. I think she needs it for the game tomorrow.
What? Lavon? You didn't elect me union rep for show. We have an agenda. We're going to follow it point by point.
We could have had a great team. Kill it yourself. Someone should embroider this on a pillow. - Give it to me. - No, I'll keep the Citron card. I'll hold it until we use it.
She'll chew you up and spit you out. Here's your nuggets, Red. Thank you. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever met. And she's the reason I'm gonna start writing music again.
The polls open in an hour. And my humble self must make that decision. As many of you have said many times, the sanctity of the voting booth is sacred, but.... that sanctity is not absolute. It needs our constant vigilance. It needs our assurance that the votes cast in it are real.
Keep driving. Got a warrant. All right, keep an eye on the entrance, all right? Cause there's a lot of people interested in this car. So why don't we tow it to our parking lot?
I know, but I think they should know. Watch out, she'll ground you or something. - Stab you. - Huh? Sharpening is a thing, stabbing is what you do to her.
! It's that chip they put in her head that makes her so mad, look at her. Maybe it's time you woke up, started thinking for yourself. These tactics are not gonna get us anywhere. Maybe she's the reason I got what I wanted.
- Hey, evil Jeff. What? How are you? I may not be good at reading emotions, but I can always recognize an evil doppelganger. Plus, your hand makes a noise when you move it.
He's just showing off 'cause he's got a stupid crush on you. It's okay. It's kind of funny. - Yeah, it sure is. - Does the machine tell me what to do, or do I tell it?
This is how I remember the '80s. There were no parenting blogs or peanut allergies. Look at that little bespectacled guy. Yeah, that's me, Adam Goldberg. We were the first kids on the block to have a video camera, and it captured my entire childhood.
So there's no point in explaining now. Listen to me. Beat back the wall of Maria and make sure you find the basement! Then your power should come in handy! How to use it!
You hated "The Cicadas' Lamentations." No, no, no. You're that Joel Stevenson? Maybe he didn't hate that book so much. He gave it one star.
Yeah, to get us away from Ali. I think "A" is a guy. Did you guys see this? Wait, I was with Ali when she bought that shirt. She said she needed it for a date with an older guy.
Hey, please. This is what we wanted. This is what we've worked for all these years. You got a normal life. So live it now.
You should know that and not trust him. And now I realize I don't trust him either. I don't have a wife. I have no children. I've sacrificed everything for this company, and I'm not gonna let it fall apart.
Actually, I'm not "Mrs." Didn't you get a divorce already? I'm keeping my last name. Good for you. Cherish it.
He was killed in an accident two years ago, and the perpetrator got away. I'm so sorry. And now the game "Forevermore" could be worth millions, and his divorced parents are contesting his inheritance. That game is Craig's legacy. I'm not gonna let them get their hands on it.
All right, now get some rest. That was bad. I can see it in your face. I don't know why, Sarah, but there are days when darkness descends on the land, a dark, bloody shroud, like a battlefield, like the station today. Oh, yes, you can resist it as best you can, but it's as if the darkness needs to defeat itself, devour itself to extinction.
They keep keeping it on her. Healing herbs. - What? Your people? My men put them on her leg to make her feel better.
Put both things together and you can move to whatever time you want. Change the course of the revolution when it's most needed! Naturally, I'll stay here, do my part by laying the groundwork. You are testing my patience. When this thing works again, a dude like Escher will use it.
This is a camera obscura, a typical representative from the 17th century. This type of camera obscura is called a box camera. It usually has the same frosted glass. It has the ability to focus by moving the lens back and forth. People who believe that Vermeer used optics were unanimous that he looked at the projection and was inspired by it.
Hello, ma'am. Oh, thank God! Here, hold this. The lasagna's burning. All right, ma'am. Catch the dog, but don't let him touch the baby!
I thought I was gonna fall out of these things. Well, you didn't. I probably would have noticed. Your song is really great. Will really got a hold of it, didn't he?
Let's not look a gift horse in the mouth and talk about it here, okay? So, what do you say we get some champagne? I can't believe it. My life is over. It doesn't have to be over.
Well, uh. How are you doing? How's work? This company has a quiet reputation. What's the name of the man who runs it?
Is everything okay? Yeah, I thought you were going home. You know, I was on my way downstairs, and then I remembered. You forgot your hat. She needs her tracking anklet.
- There's a lot of blood. - What's she doing? All right, everybody move back, very slowly. If we spread out, she'll be weaker. I don't think she needs any of us.
- What's she doing? All right, everybody back off, very slowly. If we split up, she'll be weaker. I don't think she needs any of us. I think she needs Nathan.
And you can do something for me. Prove his innocence. I'm glad you're back in my office. We assume you're ready to buy the photograph. Actually, no, but the D.A.'s office is interested.
It is believed to be missing due to looting, shelling, or just time. but I think it was stolen. Here's a photo of one of the bowls found at the excavation site. The exact same vase was in Beth Roney's office yesterday. She worked with Monroe and Clennon. She kept it out of the catalog, and then she handed it to them to remove it - from the dig site.
You want to play? Bet you can't catch me? Come on, it's okay! Are you sure you want to stay in this old shack? It could use some work.
[ Sighs ] Good to see you, Jax. You too, Juri. That patch looks good on you. I'm trying to match it.
But even then, it's not much use. I used to sell cards like that, people would come in and say, "I'm going to Birmingham," and I'd say, "No, you can't do that." - Yeah, I've only got a Kendal card. - Do we use it at home?
What had they done to her? Her eyes looked like glass balls. Most likely someone threw sulfuric acid in her face. I've only seen burns like that from technical accidents. It burned through her optic nerves.
Well, we asked everyone we know. And now I'm depressed because THIS is everyone we know. Let's start asking people at the diner. We have to find the cat a new home. Why? Why can't she live right here, in my arms, between my lush and natural?
It's a 2007 wine. It's the second best wine you'll ever taste. Tell me what you think it tastes like. Cat pee, right? If you pet that thing one more time, she's gonna have to buy you dinner.
Are you saying that Ike was taking hormones regularly because of Intellilink's mistake? That's right. It's a shitty system that's nothing but trouble. It's good! It's working fine, you just have to give it time.
Uh-huh. Okay. You need to find your purpose, honey. You hear me? Vulnerability is a responsibility. It has no place in this life.
- Like what? - For example... like if the sermon is about faith. - Like it was today. - Exactly. Faith can be a very abstract concept until you give it "weight" through your words and thoughts. - That's right.
Got a calculator? Let's do the math. And what will happen to the soul of the city if we don't take extraordinary measures to save those who can still be saved? "Soul of the city" is not a line item in the city budget. But maybe it should exist.
You have the power to retrieve him. Where is your friend now? I was told you'd tell us. Maybe. If the bond between you and your friend is strong enough, I can use it.
I'm a trespasser. Okay, let's be clear right now. I have no idea when or how I got that pen. It could have been in a doctor's office, a bank, a restaurant. The last time I used it was when I signed my daughter's field trip permit yesterday morning.
Maybe you could talk to her. Dudley! Explain the situation! She'll help, I'm sure. The powder is so light, she needs the lightest touch.
Or... like Claudette? She looks like an angry beet to me. But, uh. Okay! Come on, she needs to parrot.
Oh, shit. - Did I scare you? - Yeah. You ever heard of a front door? I wasn't sure if I was allowed to use it.
Russell Jonathan. His story of self-destruction followed by complete recovery was like food for my soul. It was like he was speaking directly to me about me. All I wanted to do was to wrap myself in the veil of his words again. And so I did, for this book was absorbing and... distracted me. I read it over and over and over again, covering for my abstraction from life.
You wouldn't happen to have any cool science stuff you could hastily put together to make this dog smarter, would you? I thought dogs were kept to feel superior, Jerry. I wouldn't mess with that if I were you. Come on, Morty. Look, Rick, if you want to live here for free and use my son for your stupid science, you could at least help her family out a little.
You look gorgeous! Almost like Richard Dreyfuss in "Mr. Holland's Penis." Why did you take my mom's old makeup bag? I thought it would look like a briefcase. You're welcome to use it.
They just remembered you. Oh, my God. Am I so pathetic that you had to put up a picture of me to cheer me up? Pretty much. This is where it belongs.
That's right. That's how important they are. That's very good. But if you name that food, I'll be very impressed because it's really the very essence of Korea. They're obsessed with it.
If you're happy, God bless you, buddy. No, I'm not fucking happy, no married man is happy. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy. Listening to it, I really, you know. I really appreciate this fucking job, and I really enjoy it.
- Not thirteen, not anymore. That young, dark-haired archer. We put a Morgul arrow in him. The poison is already in his blood. Soon he'll choke on it.
I don't think so. I guess that's one thing we have in common. I'm gonna get these bastards too, and right now I don't care how I do it. They found a formal loophole. And they're taking advantage of it.
- Tell me about it, I'm so turned on. This is who you really are, Mindy. You may dress or talk differently than we do. But when it comes to guys, we're all the same. Twilight, Channing Tatum, Union J. It's biology, bitch. Don't fight it.
And some of those French assholes you saw him hanging around with. I wish I'd met him before I wrote Hamlet. He would have made the most perfect role model. "Love is not a pathetic puppet in the hands of time that wipes away the roses." "On fiery lips and cheeks, and no time's dangers to her."
The opening of my sensitive door, gave me the opportunity to develop my morphological knowledge from leaves to genitalia. I went on a journey, as they would say in children's books, through the land of big black dicks, the land of little yellow ones, and so on. And for the most part, I made my way through an endless array of circumcised dicks. By the way, did you know that if you collect the foreskin that's been circumcised in history. you could pave the road to Mars and back?
You're a doctor, but you're unemployed. - Well. - Would you like to work for me? At Osterity? In rehab? Is it yours? My brother Argil runs it, but we're short-staffed.
So what's the deal with the time machine? What do you mean? How does it work? Well, it's complicated. Would I have to get naked to operate it?
No man has ever controlled two elements at once. I'm not like the others. I can do it. You can. But then Rava must keep that power until you master it.
I'm not going to argue the business side of the issue. It's not my place, nor my area of expertise, but I do know the following.... Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs, enriched media, it's all surface. These are all temporary fads. They are not the foundation on which this newspaper is built, and they are not what will help it survive.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Dad. That woman's pipes are always clogged. We gotta help her.
Arsen. You didn't go to town? Before we came here, we were in Heppylon. My mom gave me a lot of money for that card. I can use it at any vending machine.
My feet and my toes are on fire! The burning in my extremities. In the Middle Ages, it was called St. Anthony's fire. Reid, ergotism. That man at my morgue - that doesn't explain the manner of his death, the decomposition of his stomach that preceded it.

She knew him as Randolph James. It just got worse. What? "There'll never be secrets between us," that's what he told me. When love sweeps you off your feet like that, you have no choice but to confide in it.
I have a girlfriend. Yes, you do. Come on. Slap that ass. Let her know who she belongs to.
I'll get you some water. - Yeah. Yeah, I-- And Tony had a new opportunity to get into Gob's phone. And he didn't take it.
Why aren't you socializing? Я... - I can't concentrate. - Don't push yourself. Let each thought come and go as it pleases.
Wow. That's weird coming from you. I'm really good, you know? You always make everything better. Do you remember that Sunday at church when the dying butterfly flew in the window and landed on your palm and you tried to help it fly and it just couldn't?
Yeah, and she didn't feel a thing. What kind of gun do you use? .45 caliber. Right in the back of the head. She was so small, it practically blew her whole head off.
You talk to him. He's really listening to you. Fitz. We're all concerned that this campaign needs a spark. Your father could be that spark.
Don't cry. Oh, God. Let's just-- let's just get your mom a kidney. -Don't. She needs it.
I think I know what we're looking for. Your spelling's a little off, isn't it? Terrible. There's no such word as "ran." There's "ran." But the important thing is that the story makes sense and I believe it.
Did you come up with a name for it? No, what I meant was. You know what? I'm not gonna stand here and be accused by the likes of you. And if there was a door here, honey, I'd slam it in your face.
If you've been a good person, you'll just make yourself even better. Well, I guess it depends on how you look at it. You wanted to ask me about Elliston Farm? You worked there, didn't you? No, I ran it.
All right, ataz, I'm outta here. You're hopelessly hopeless, Buster. That song sounds like it's about my son. I'm happy for your new hand. But stick it to someone else.
We'll pretend it's a vacation. Milner thinks that's how long it'll take her to clean it up, if only she has the manuscript. she has the manuscript. We have to give it to her. Jessica. She needs it to end this.
Yeah, I came prepared. I'd expect nothing less. Good luck with your speech. My speech doesn't need your wishes. It needs a warning from the chief of medicine because it's so unhealthy.
And they found me. "They"? Believers. People who know that magic exists. And that it has no place in this world. And they're ready to fix it.
Tamara. But I had help. What are you doing, Tamara? I have to keep magic out of this world, Neal. It doesn't belong here.
Job done. How many times do I have to explain the difference between vendetta and revenge? This can't be a war of attrition. The Order of the Dragon is like Hydra. Cut off its head, and they'll grow two to replace it.
Luckily, there's more than that on the menu. He may be a lousy builder, but now it's his time. That's family bliss! Stone ledges are the only place bald eagles build their nests. So they owe their home to a river that has exposed the side of a huge boulder. This river and many others like it join to form the major rivers of Central Africa.
Wide, flat and safe. These sandy strips attract visitors from the coast. African water vultures looking for a safe place to settle down. The lower part of their beak is greatly elongated. They cut across the water surface at 10 meters per second.
It's half past two. I gotta get outta here. I got the day shift. And you can finish that. That door closes behind you if you slam it shut, which is what you're great at, so--
If federated Georgia doesn't agree to an unconditional retreat by midnight tonight, he'll detonate the bomb. You must know he has power, right? Uh-huh. But a nuke? He's crazy enough to use it.
There has to be another way. You've done this a thousand times, Castiel. You're ready. Kill him. Then take the tablet and bring it home where it belongs.
Which I did. "Some view neonomatopoeic irony as a derivative of semantic manipulation." Interesting point of view. Because of the narrow tires, it's pretty obvious that the GT86 wasn't designed to break records at the Nürburgring. And with 197 horsepower and a two-liter engine, it's not going to be a drag racing star.
And here's the first corner. Just the right tire squeal and the perfect trajectory. Keep going down the road. Yeah, good plan! Just follow it through. It's not looking too bad.
Look at the little duckling swimming in the tarp. Do you think they move each leg one at a time, or both at the same time? I think each one in turn, Vic. You know, the great Mel Ott raised ducklings in Louisiana during the off-season. And when a duckling got sick, he'd take it to his bed until it got better.
You know where Joe would go? He always goes either to me or to her. You have no idea what it's like to have a baby and be alone and pull everything by yourself. I gave her this shirt for her birthday. She didn't like it.
No Teddy. So, what do we do? Where do we start? I set up alerts on the credit card I gave her, so I'll be notified if she uses it. In the meantime, I'll print out a list of every place she's ever used it.
None of the other stores in the lobby were broken into. Must have gone upstairs. But the staircases were locked. The card for the elevator was in the guard's jacket. You think they used it and then put it back?
"in" means "not", "credibile" means "trustworthy" - well.... Your message said you had something vital to us, something from the President's ABM program. I'm giving it to you right now, but you're not listening. This technology-- it's "not credible." At best, it's 50 years before it can be remotely controlled.
Who, uh. uh. Who knew the boat was moored there? It wasn't a secret. Anyone who walked along the beach there. - And when was the last time you used it?
In thunderstorm clouds that form, upward currents separate the charges. The lighter ice crystals become positively charged and rise upward, while the heavier, negatively charged crystals settle downward. The result is a potential difference of up to 100 million volts between the clouds and the ground. Nature likes to equalize everything. The imbalance is not to her liking and she tries to correct it by means of electric current.
What's the big deal? You think there are fingerprints? Because there could be hundreds of prints on any given bill. Yeah, but if we find the same prints on different bills, we'll know who gave him the money the night of the murder. You know, if I had any unrelated cash on me, I'd stuff it in these panties.
- What's next, a security camera? - Maybe. - We'll bug her. - Tony, stop. Please stop, and please, for God's sake, put the pen down before I stab you with it.
- What's going on here? We're just making dinner. Didn't expect to see you. Maddie left her soccer uniform in the car. I think she needs it for the game tomorrow.
What? Lavon? You didn't elect me union rep for show. We have an agenda. We're going to follow it point by point.
We could have had a great team. Kill it yourself. Someone should embroider this on a pillow. - Give it to me. - No, I'll keep the Citron card. I'll hold it until we use it.
She'll chew you up and spit you out. Here's your nuggets, Red. Thank you. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever met. And she's the reason I'm gonna start writing music again.
The polls open in an hour. And my humble self must make that decision. As many of you have said many times, the sanctity of the voting booth is sacred, but.... that sanctity is not absolute. It needs our constant vigilance. It needs our assurance that the votes cast in it are real.
Keep driving. Got a warrant. All right, keep an eye on the entrance, all right? Cause there's a lot of people interested in this car. So why don't we tow it to our parking lot?
I know, but I think they should know. Watch out, she'll ground you or something. - Stab you. - Huh? Sharpening is a thing, stabbing is what you do to her.
! It's that chip they put in her head that makes her so mad, look at her. Maybe it's time you woke up, started thinking for yourself. These tactics are not gonna get us anywhere. Maybe she's the reason I got what I wanted.
- Hey, evil Jeff. What? How are you? I may not be good at reading emotions, but I can always recognize an evil doppelganger. Plus, your hand makes a noise when you move it.
He's just showing off 'cause he's got a stupid crush on you. It's okay. It's kind of funny. - Yeah, it sure is. - Does the machine tell me what to do, or do I tell it?
This is how I remember the '80s. There were no parenting blogs or peanut allergies. Look at that little bespectacled guy. Yeah, that's me, Adam Goldberg. We were the first kids on the block to have a video camera, and it captured my entire childhood.
So there's no point in explaining now. Listen to me. Beat back the wall of Maria and make sure you find the basement! Then your power should come in handy! How to use it!
You hated "The Cicadas' Lamentations." No, no, no. You're that Joel Stevenson? Maybe he didn't hate that book so much. He gave it one star.
Yeah, to get us away from Ali. I think "A" is a guy. Did you guys see this? Wait, I was with Ali when she bought that shirt. She said she needed it for a date with an older guy.
Hey, please. This is what we wanted. This is what we've worked for all these years. You got a normal life. So live it now.
You should know that and not trust him. And now I realize I don't trust him either. I don't have a wife. I have no children. I've sacrificed everything for this company, and I'm not gonna let it fall apart.
Actually, I'm not "Mrs." Didn't you get a divorce already? I'm keeping my last name. Good for you. Cherish it.
He was killed in an accident two years ago, and the perpetrator got away. I'm so sorry. And now the game "Forevermore" could be worth millions, and his divorced parents are contesting his inheritance. That game is Craig's legacy. I'm not gonna let them get their hands on it.
All right, now get some rest. That was bad. I can see it in your face. I don't know why, Sarah, but there are days when darkness descends on the land, a dark, bloody shroud, like a battlefield, like the station today. Oh, yes, you can resist it as best you can, but it's as if the darkness needs to defeat itself, devour itself to extinction.
They keep keeping it on her. Healing herbs. - What? Your people? My men put them on her leg to make her feel better.

Bacon? Have fun. Put your finger in your mouth! Put your finger in your mouth! - We have to throw up or we'll die like Billy! - I can't! Think of something disgusting! - Think of something fucking disgusting! - Okay, okay, okay. Your grandma's naked and someone's sticking his dick in her.
Fuck! It says closed. Yeah, we wanted to get gas. Does the pump work? If you know how to use it.
Go! Josh, no! Anybody touches the girl, they're coming after you. - Naomi! This way. It's over. It's over. You wanted to help? Does she want live bait?
- Naomi! (Whispers) This way. It's over. It's over. You wanted to help? Does she want live bait? Well, we'll give her live bait.
H, it's a Prada coat! No way! Give me the keys. Give me the keys, I want to drive this beauty, bro! She's not even a month old yet.
This teapot is about 2,000 years old. It has passed through the hands of the greatest and worst characters in our history. It fell from our observation when it went missing in a concentration camp in 1945. Our founder, Dr. A. K. Bhardwaj, discovered that in the wrong hands it can do a lot of mischief. If there is even an ounce of malice and hatred in any of you, the teapot will find a use for it.
It has the atmosphere that I have achieved. It's not finished yet. But it feels like a game that has a beginning, a middle and an end. It remains to be seen if the game will be good. Whether it will be like this on every level. But I'm pretty damn happy with it so far.
I love this shirt. Oh, that's so cool. Yeah. No matter how the game goes... I'll always have a fond memory of being proud of it.
NCP... Nereus Capital Properties. to pave the way for his office to break ground on a new development. and then he dumps his wife. Ames really wanted to leave her for Terry. I'm sorry. A week after she was formed, you gave her bidding rights.
What's this all about? Making this room look right. Say what you will about the Targaryens -- but they were conquerors. This throne is meant for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not wine and flowers.
I grab her, you eat her, I erase her memory Yeah hell, I'll even heal her when it's over. Why would you do that? You know what blood does to me. You just let it control you.
The worse she got, the more devout she became. It didn't make her feel any better. What was hanging in that spot? A painting of the Virgin Mary. Her mother gave it to her.

You suspect your boss is involved in the theft of a Stradivarius violin? He's very busy networking, trying to expand our brand with insurance. He's no longer investigating, but he took this case about the violin and then it went missing - it doesn't add up. Its date of creation is before 1700 - expensive, but it sells cheap. So why is Brian so interested in it?

I'd give anything for that bat. I'd swear that piece of wood is worth a lot of money. - "Piece of wood"? - Yeah. Except for the fact that DiMaggio pitched with it, it's just a bat.
Nothing has to go back to the way it was. You know, it's good to try to move on if that's what you want. I want-- I want my family to go back to the way it was. That's all I want. И... I shouldn't have let it fall apart.
Are they okay? Hal's taking care of them. I just wanted to stay on David's yacht until he found out the cops came last night. You broke into his boat? He's not using it, he's just sitting there.
Hey, hey. Your desk is in the corner. - This is neutral territory. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's what I'm using.
I'm a writer. I must have a lot of imagination. Yes, but magic? Water has great power. People have worshipped it since ancient times.
Where I kept the rest of my magic. The only magic in this world is in the things I brought with me. It's not spinning. It doesn't work. It needs to absorb the magic around it.
Now I am in walking country, so I will need a walking cane. It's more like a club. Pretty heavy. Ironwood? Don't wave it in my direction.
We must draw lots, and cut shallow to stretch the game. Seppius the first, in honor of his fallen cousin! Fuck all you Roman bitches! Do not think the gods have shown mercy. I but delay your demise so that I may fully savor it.
Ann, I painted your garage pink. I didn't ask you to do that. Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's commercial is just better. Our friendship is over. No, it's not. It's not over.
I didn't ask you to do that. Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's commercial is just better. Our friendship is over. No, it's not. It's not over. It's never over.
Why not? I mean, technically, she's yours. No. It's yours. I'm just gonna use it.
No Jane, either. Both are missing. - Where could they be? - I have no idea. Rose left me a note, but I didn't pay much attention to it.
Plunge her into the abyss of death and hold her there. Blood without oxygen is pure and thick. That's it. You don't even have to try. Let it flow to you.
Get your own imaginary animal! You made up that dog to pick up pussy! It's a stupid fucking story! So dumb you fucking stole it? Like you were gonna use it.
The man is about to make us all rich. See, that's what the company's talking about right now. And Skip likes it even more than I do. It's a takeover. - Let it play out.
- Yeah. I wanted to use them. And no one was supposed to know about it? She wanted to make a documentary about her work. For her presentation. And I was helping her with that. - It was 12 hours worth of material.
No, it's not cool! It's a miracle! And when I see on the schedule that my patient, my miracle, is going in for a lymph node transplant without my knowledge. She came to us. She said she brought it up, and you turned her down.
No. It's a chance to say goodbye. Do you like your job? Yes. You enjoy it, don't you?
If something happens to it, no power will be generated. I beg your pardon, where exactly did you study engineering? I didn't. But you think you can run a power company. My client will run it, not design the parts.
Okay, so I'll talk to Ben, then I'll talk to you. Then you, then you'll talk to each other, and then we'll talk to all three of you. - Okay. - So who's talking now? "Grab your dream." "Don't let it spread its wings and fly away."
Congratulations, General. You deserve it. How'd it go? Better than I expected. Fringe Division now has a full science team and no one to lead it.
Uh, excuse me. What kind of book was it? A diary? It was pretty small, but I'm not really sure. Could you find a way to get a hold of it?
I agree about the color. Come to think of it, is she a star? It's a nice color. And the approach is fresh, youthful. She could use a little more confidence.
- No! I haven't looked at it up close. Looks like they're for treating erectile dysfunction. Too bad he hadn't heard of Viagra. He couldn't use it because of his heart condition.
More gas, more gas, more gas, more gas, more gas. Oh, my God! Get closer to the wall. I'm up against the wall! Eventually, Kyle let me out on my own. Letting it find traction. Trying not to struggle too much.
- Just start already! What? This thing must be broken. Totally broken, guys. It's, like, a million years old.
We don't need her. You're lying. Why? I'm not lying. If an opportunity comes out of nowhere, why don't we take it?
Very humiliating. Who's the brainless shrink here? I think it's me. Your retarded neighbor yells at me for no reason. I have a can of Mace in my purse and I'm not afraid to smash his skull with it.
- Our friend Clark seems to have learned his management skills from Mao. What did he say? I'm a real lawyer. The firm has suffered because of your management over the last six months. Now it needs a man at the helm.
They'll be everywhere. The temporalis muscle is atrophied. Any idea why, Dr. Grey? Lack of use? It's had nothing to attach to since the bone was removed.
Which proves to us that animals are ungrateful. Basically, to make the Fisker even greener, you'd have to chain it to a Japanese whaling ship. But I like being in it. It's very cozy. The Fisker makes you realize that a conventional leather interior is a terrible relic of the past. It's something that could have been done in ancient Roman times. And most importantly, I like driving it.
I'm not leaving the clinic, Harrison. This is what I've always wanted to do. And that's why I told them I wouldn't do it. if they didn't have room for you. And there is. They're opening a free clinic. and they want you to run it.
- Are you Carter? - Yeah. How do I know Elias isn't paying you? You can't. You have another option, and I'd encourage you to take it.
And this is the rally car we'll be competing in... the Skoda Fabia Super 2000. In the last season, this car dominated the championship, winning seven of the 12 rallies and taking the entire podium on four occasions. And while this car is obviously not a shy ten, what sort of non-car rival have we prepared for today? In fact, if I were a car, I'd probably be wetting myself right now. Because tonight, it will be challenged by Yves Rossi, the world's first jet-powered flying man.
When something happens that wasn't supposed to happen, it's called an accident. Clearly, everyone knew about Brick's soccer career, but nothing about his personal life. Was he married? To the game. He devoted his life to it.
I'm not excusing what she did. I'm trying to shed some light on what happened. And get a trial that can set her free? Postpartum depression is real. Jake, it affects 80% of mothers.
And mosquitoes. Just wanted to make a couple bucks. Buy a beer. I've been thinking about this job more and more lately. Maybe I should have enjoyed it more.
Hmm. Maybe there was something in his second book? Maybe he was going to reveal something that got him killed? "I looked down at the blood flowing from my wrist like a river. I let it pool in my lap.
I tried to break up with her without a scandal, but she didn't take it too well. Actually, I don't know how she took it because I wasn't there. We dated for a few weeks, and then after we... Well, you know, I slipped out of her house before she woke up and never called her again. I put my pants on in her yard, put the car in neutral, let it roll down the driveway with the headlights off.
I turned my phone off because I was taking a yoga class, I needed to relax. Oh, wait a minute. You don't do yoga. I'm doing yoga, and you're making fun of me for it. Because I do it to focus my mind.
Whereas a cigarette smoker is in a hurry. He has somewhere to go. - But a cigarette also takes time. - That's true, but... A cigarette is like that. You can't enjoy it.
The power that this car represents..... Like, who would you trust it to? Besides you? No one. That's why the machine was programmed so that no one could abuse it.
- But I've got one that's really cool, it's called Miscellaneous Apps, I'm sure Russell would be interested. - No. Nick, the Miscellaneous App was my idea. Miscellaneous Apps was not your idea. Yeah, of course it was. It might have been your idea, but I helped it come about and I helped clean the shit out of it.
Kara Simmons. She's not here. Her name's not on the list. Thank you. I can't decide if I admire your sentimentality or despise it.
Lilith has chosen you to be my Adam. Together we will create a new world. What if I don't want to be chosen? Her blood is in you. Let her guide you.
Just standard questions. Have you ever given your sister a ride to work? I don't have a license. We just have this car. Everybody uses it.
Wait a minute. Smallpox. Hasn't it been eradicated? See, you can't believe everything you read on the Internet. - Okay, how did he get it?
And I found one curious entry. What is it? His death certificate. The real Graham Wyler died in 1997. Whoever you're following stole his identity and has been using it for the last 15 years.
And that's only if the ADTs don't put you in the ground first. - Well, the card was just charged at the Le Beaumonde Hotel. - What? We've been tracking Johnny's credit card in case someone from A.T.D. uses it. And what, uh. one of those assholes used it?
Just don't yell "Yauza!" Ha, ha, ha. - Why do you do that? - I always tear the last page out of a book. Then it doesn't have to end.
# When I'm walking through the neighborhood # This is what I see # Everybody stops and stares at me. # Come on! # I've got passion # And I'm not shy about showing it off
40 years in the desert with this. You know what this production needs? Some asshole jumping around on stage like a black man? Oh, no, sir! It needs a star.
You know what this production needs? Some dork jumping around the stage like a black man? Oh, no, sir! It needs a star. It needs you.
Told them about a heavily armed cartel boat off the coast. They were very intrigued. Most people think the Coast Guard is an unarmed unit. They're wrong. The Coast Guard patrol boat is equipped with two fifty caliber machine guns, and a twenty-five klib gun, allowing it to destroy any vessel smaller than a battleship.
Wait, is that what this is? Don't worry, it's also the last meeting. Because the end is near. Sam and I called you all here to tell you what we really think of you. Tina, acting is your pipe dream, and your decision to pursue it is both irresponsible and shocking.
I'll get marshmallows. You know, it's probably nothing. We just have to deal with these kinds of allegations. Of course, of course. But if it's some random complaint, how can you even trust it?
I started a business where I rent expensive clothes to teenagers so their parents don't have to buy them nice things that they grow out of. So if you see a 14-year-old wearing a Louis Vuitton tie, you know who to thank. Me. And Louis Vuitton for making cool ties. Son, I love wildlife, but does it belong in a store?
Stalker's probably looking for a victim. We need to find out where Lisa was today. Find out where Lisa was traveling from, maybe get closer to the kidnapper. Just got a hit on Lisa's credit card. Someone tried to use it at a convenience store 2 miles from here.
- What? Actually, Commander, I really think you should take a look for yourself. Sorry to drag you back here, but I noticed something disturbing in the autopsy. My hypothesis is that the killer used a knife with a unique engraving on the handle. When he plunged it into the victim's skin, it left latent prints of blood.
I need to focus on death. And I look at it every morning. - Doesn't sound right, does it? - In the bathroom. I don't know. I mean, I know he won't come back and use it, but I feel better when I see it there, next to mine, on the sink.
In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up wearing someone else's clothes over my own. Sometimes I get so lonely that I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I grab it with my right and pretend I'm holding someone else's hand. I do that too. Sometimes my left hand tries to touch me. And I let it.
Bacon? Have fun. Put your finger in your mouth! Put your finger in your mouth! - We have to throw up or we'll die like Billy! - I can't! Think of something disgusting! - Think of something fucking disgusting! - Okay, okay, okay. Your grandma's naked and someone's sticking his dick in her.
Fuck! It says closed. Yeah, we wanted to get gas. Does the pump work? If you know how to use it.
Go! Josh, no! Anybody touches the girl, they're coming after you. - Naomi! This way. It's over. It's over. You wanted to help? Does she want live bait?
- Naomi! (Whispers) This way. It's over. It's over. You wanted to help? Does she want live bait? Well, we'll give her live bait.
H, it's a Prada coat! No way! Give me the keys. Give me the keys, I want to drive this beauty, bro! She's not even a month old yet.
This teapot is about 2,000 years old. It has passed through the hands of the greatest and worst characters in our history. It fell from our observation when it went missing in a concentration camp in 1945. Our founder, Dr. A. K. Bhardwaj, discovered that in the wrong hands it can do a lot of mischief. If there is even an ounce of malice and hatred in any of you, the teapot will find a use for it.
It has the atmosphere that I have achieved. It's not finished yet. But it feels like a game that has a beginning, a middle and an end. It remains to be seen if the game will be good. Whether it will be like this on every level. But I'm pretty damn happy with it so far.
I love this shirt. Oh, that's so cool. Yeah. No matter how the game goes... I'll always have a fond memory of being proud of it.
NCP... Nereus Capital Properties. to pave the way for his office to break ground on a new development. and then he dumps his wife. Ames really wanted to leave her for Terry. I'm sorry. A week after she was formed, you gave her bidding rights.
What's this all about? Making this room look right. Say what you will about the Targaryens -- but they were conquerors. This throne is meant for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not wine and flowers.
I grab her, you eat her, I erase her memory Yeah hell, I'll even heal her when it's over. Why would you do that? You know what blood does to me. You just let it control you.
The worse she got, the more devout she became. It didn't make her feel any better. What was hanging in that spot? A painting of the Virgin Mary. Her mother gave it to her.

You suspect your boss is involved in the theft of a Stradivarius violin? He's very busy networking, trying to expand our brand with insurance. He's no longer investigating, but he took this case about the violin and then it went missing - it doesn't add up. Its date of creation is before 1700 - expensive, but it sells cheap. So why is Brian so interested in it?

To cry into it? Because they were so upset that Pharaoh had died. I think they cried because they were slaves and buried alive. Angela saw it right here in the gift store. She loved it.
And here's the thing: she cheated on you. She didn't cheat. Yeah, I know you're dumber than a bag of wet hair, but deep down, you know she's lying to you. This whole stuck gum thing is bullshit. And you choose to believe her so you can stay with her.
I'm so glad you guys are back. But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call Dr. Emil and have him take a look at you. Clark, those Omegas we saw at the portal, it's like the darkness is everywhere. What if it comes back? We'll give it a fight.
- No, Mom, thanks. Tucker, Ambrose is in Switzerland. You and I are in London. I came here because my country needs me. And because it needs you, too.
Anyway, she's gone. My only connection to Conde Nast has been replaced by a stapler snatcher. And I'll staple whatever's in your pretty little hand to your jeans if you don't get out in a jiffy. I'm holding an article. Epperly said she'd give it to her at "Details."
And then, all of a sudden, he just died. Just like that. You know. There's a lot of talk about "reconciliation after death," but I don't believe in it. When someone blows a big hole in your life. it's never gonna close.
I mean, I'm amazing, but I'm not perfect. But you are. Give me that power. So I can use it.
You can't hide from me. Nothing can hurt me. But I know pain. I know pain. Sometimes I share it with someone like you.
His face... His eyes were different. He came at me with a pickaxe. And we fought. And he put it through my leg.
Well, see, I can only guess that because anti-vampire sentiment spread after Russell Edgington's horrible crime, something had to be done about it. Mm-hmm. And that hate is a powerful force, but hate never wins. Not at the end. We will never succumb to it.
How far away are you and the creature? Abby? There's a second creature here. It's been hit by acid. It looks like it's in a lot of pain.
Maybe I'll hang the jumpsuit on the wall. My kids and I went through the hardest time of our lives together...and we never tried to hide anything from each other, We grieved and cried together and then asked ourselves - So, what's next? Get over it and move on. I guess the point of life is just to enjoy it.
For the tenth time, I don't need this. I know where Oak Park is. Carlos, I'm starving! I won't think you're weak if you use the navigation system! Fine, I'll use it.
Isn't that right, Father? But it's your vanity that grows best. How so? You've done the forbidden. You chose the dark side and let it feed on your anger and lust for power.
- No, you're not getting out. - Captain, we'll find another way. - You will do as you're told, Doctor. And you, Mr. Borges. Take this thing back to hell where it belongs.
Looks broken. Maybe it's just a crack. Tie it tight. If that thing wanted us dead, we'd be dead by now, so I guess that's a good sign, right? It wants us alive.
You do? Actually, I speak six different languages, so let McNair go, uh. away. Uh, here we go. You know, I was thinking we should stick around. You did? Honestly, my leg's been hurting, and you said I should rest it.
Ann is a civilian, and we don't want to lose our doctor. And your team was taken hostage. We almost lost our best weapons and a lot of supplies. And we almost put it all in the hands of a bunch of thugs with AKs and emergency flares. This time it all worked out, but chain of command exists for a reason, and make sure people follow it.
Where'd he go? Who's gone, who is this guy? I need to find Michelle. Are you sure it wasn't another pink balloon? He's got a rifle, and he's gonna use it.
This is the Master's spirit. When are you going to leave? From a job you've given so much to? I've never resisted this job. I adore my work and give my life to it.
Only if you'll be my Mrs. Wellington. All right. Your purse, please. Marriage is based on trust. Trust that I have my baton on me, and I enjoy hitting people with it.
It's a game of cat and mouse. Blaze tries to lure the shark closer to put a noose around its neck, but, one wrong move and the game is over. Finally, it takes the bait. He takes his time preparing the noose. Blaze doesn't have the strength to hold the tearing shark, but the wooden float will keep it from going deep.
A contract is worth more than money. It's time to speak. Ajit? Love is like a bird. Let it soar.
It's time to perform. Ajit? Love is like a bird. Let it soar. Let it land in your heart.
Well, at least when you're 55, with a pension, you can do it nicely. Leave the rifle at Khokar's feet. Then come back and get in the car. Why? She doesn't belong here.
I'm so sorry. Actually, I'm glad I ran into you, Bates. I had a call from Sir Richard Carlisle today. He says he's paid Mrs. Bates for her story. Now she must keep quiet or face prison.
Antrecote, 500 grams. What does a cow do? - What? It goes "Moooo!" And then she gets shot in the head.
Why not? Remember the other day when you said you weren't so hot anymore? - Yeah. Well, when you're hot, your body tries to protect itself. So your skin starts to excrete sweat and other substances that serve as protection.
We're gonna get Travis Marshall, okay? I got the boat on the video I sent Travis. He'll think he's gonna find me on my boat. Not this one. The owners use it twice a year, but I'm only gonna need it once. for Travis' latest masterpiece.
When was the last time you saw her? Yesterday. in Renny's trailer. Okay. [Cell phone rings] Could he have loaned it to someone? That lighter was worth a lot of money, and Renny treasured it.
It's a couple blocks from here. We're on our way. All right, let me see if I can stall him for you. Now, he probably wants to check the magnetic strip. Maybe clean it.
Do you have another envelope? Yeah. Found this medal inside. It's called the Order of the Sunrise. It was awarded to Japanese pilots who bombed Pearl Harbor.
- Shit. Why? What's up, buddy? I'm going to a friend's house where I might have to use this thing. I've only used it once, and that was to take a cake out of the oven.
You know what, Kristen? Oh, yeah, that's it, get mad! You got something to say, Ryan? That was pathetic. You just got in a position to make it easier for her to have you.
It's the latest in technology. Give me a couple hours. I'll write an algorithm to bypass the alarm. The alarm won't be an obstacle. How's that? Keep it from going off.
And what happened? They formed ... in some way. a subconscious coherence. From these views emerged what was called the California Ideology. It was a strange mix of radical individualism and utopian theories about computer systems, and an international cult arose to promote these ideas. These people were united by a view of the modern world as a single interconnected system, they believed that state systems were not appropriate and that politicians should not try to control the system, they should give it freedom to create a new kind of democracy.
Reggie. It's okay, it's me. Come on, we gotta go. - Where's the rental car? - Right where it's supposed to be.
We draw conclusions by proposing one thing, which in turn immediately contradicts another. It takes time to get a scientific basis. You can't have a hoax and then wait for the results, Hale - you've got to be patient. OK, let's just assume she died of cholera and Tess was infected.
I'm 22. In a couple days, I might change the world and disappear. Listen. "Now is the time for the rich to get rich and the poor to die. It's not in spite of nature, but because of nature that money rules the world.
Since they are your publishers I was hoping that perhaps you could stop the publication. It's a satire on my life and everyone I know, and if it gets published, I'll be a pariah. You've turned out to be an even bigger coward than I thought. The best way to make sure your book goes out is to leave it alone. What, let it see the light of day?
I swear! Well, let's see. After him! Oh, come on, honey. Put the big gun down. You don't know how to use it.
Where's Leo? He's in the waiting room. There's a man dressed as a janitor watching him. The other rooms are sealed off. This is your operation, Myka. How do you want to play it?
A few centuries ago, she told me about a vampire who knew how to kill Klaus. She never told me anything else. - Why not? - Because it was her trump card. She knew it was important information, and she wouldn't share it with me.
The evidence pointing to the terrorists was left for him to find, but he found another piece of evidence proving it was a covert operation. Percy couldn't afford for that information to get out, so he buried it. And Merrick. Killing the lead researcher would draw too much attention, so he framed him. For beating an Iraqi resident to death. He's currently serving the seventh year of a 30-year sentence. This guy has evidence that this is the work of a pro, why wouldn't he use it to clear his name?
It won't help. If people only understand each other through battle, then what was the point of our meeting? ! Hate can only be suppressed by reason. But it must be allowed to run free sometimes, or it will eat you alive.
Already sent it. Check your e-mail. You're welcome, Mary Sunshine. Today, I am just grateful that justice was served and that this horrible man was held accountable for his crimes against the American people. As for my future, I always planned to serve my country wherever and in whatever capacity it needed me.
Sitting in the cabin, I thought that a snail in its shell would have a better life as a first-class thief under the shadow of the law under the blazing sun Rows of huddled shacks, and rows of women in line for a single sip each with a bucket and a face full of pain under the blazing sun - Viola ... Where did you hear that song? A little bird taught it to me.
Why should I discuss with the state's attorney who I should hire? Tell me: what happens when the defense attorney questions this lab because of a juvenile miscreant handling evidence? So you think this young man, with a brilliant mind even by Dr. Brennan's standards, should be forever condemned because of youthful misconduct? Sometimes life isn't fair. But I don't help it all the time.
The lung donor didn't have cancer. Tell that to the tumor I found in his arm. That mass wasn't a tumor. It was clotted plasma. He was literally pumped full of it in the E.R.
This is great Spence, she's funny, soulful, uplifting..... I wish I could be there to hear you. Wow, Spencer, you just got Melissa's endorsement. - That must be a good speech. - Well, it better be.
Actually, uh. yes, he could have. Barry Bavetta left his hotel in a hurry at 0730. Enough time to get back to the house by 9:00, the time of Jack's murder. Barry's phone still goes to voicemail. Manager gave me his credit card info, so we'll be lucky if he uses it.
Stop staring at me! You hit me! People! Keep moving! The door reacted to our music! What didn't it like? What was missing? !
I'm just hanging out here as a friend. Okay, you know, forget it. Let's get out of here. Last thing on the list. toilet paper. I don't use it.
-A little stronger than I expected. Need something to put underneath, that's all. So, what can I do for you? This strike-- It's got to end.
A door with a code lock. You have to know the code to get out. Shit. Detective, have you heard of interracial identification? But you don't give it much credence?
God, you sound so confident. Yeah. So what do you think about the baseball commissioner position? Celeste, no. I didn't like that life, even when I was living it.
A bagel? Awesome! I'll sit wherever you want. My life is not what I'd like it to be. That dollar forty-seven tip was like a wake-up call reminding me that life will always underestimate you if you let it.
Here's how. Deputy, why don't you get busy and help contain the crowd? People of Storybrooke, stay calm. We all knew this area was riddled with abandoned mine tunnels. There's no cause for alarm. I will find a way to secure this area and put it to good use for the city.
I'm a damn good salesman. - What exactly are you doing here? - Your boat was stolen today. No. I let Victor Shetland and Darren Riggs use it.
Every Al Qaeda cell is now thinking, "Right!" "Where are the nearest skyscrapers?" And they're running up there with nitrogen. I remember one chemistry class, I saw one of the most beautiful things then. The chemistry teacher came in and there was liquid nitrogen already prepared, but we didn't know what it was yet. He came in with a rose that he had just cut in the garden. He put the rose in there for a second and then he hit it on the table and it shattered like glass into thousands of pieces.
- If I die, will you call me a hero? - I guess. But as long as I'm alive, I'm a coward. I'm afraid that's just the way it is. You get glory when you can't enjoy it.
Well, point in favor of the single fathers of this world. That's nice. You do realize it's not technically your dog to give away, right? A dog needs a home; I found it a home.
He makes us cry or laugh, and he inspires us. To be or not to be... To our language in its highest form we give a name that many pisses off and scares literature. (Episode 5: Power and Glory) In this form, it gives us voice, identity, and history. Everything literature does, in effect, is telling our story. So how do we pay homage to it in just one hour?
- No. I can't talk. It's still fresh. Let's put a cork in it. Let it heal, Jay.
I can't talk. It's still fresh. Let's put a cork in it. Let it heal, Jay. Let it heal.
It's up to you. So what's next. We buy a bunk bed, live in a tent? Are you thirsty? I've always had this anger inside of me, and I think now. I've found a way out.
When I was a kid, some kids at school picked on a girl, I tried to stop them. Got beat up. And what did my dad do? He took my favorite toy. He ripped its head off right in front of me.
You got grain in your ears, friend? You don't pay your mortgage, you don't own the land! - Basic law of land law. - Qui pro quo! I see your face around here again, I'm gonna cut it off and wipe my hiding places with it.
They laughed at us, but now it's our turn to laugh at them. Another crash! That's number 9, Nigel Gazley. Bucket, unleash your rage. Let it out.
I see papers, Tic-Tacs. I-I don't know. - Uh, no, no. Yeah, it's this silver, curved thing with a flashlight on the end. Okay, okay, I got it. There's definitely something in her throat. You hold her mouth, and I'll try with my hand.
How do you know we're not sick? We were on the street. You don't have it. This shit doesn't waste any time. - You breathe it in, you cough it up.
Rain... What rain? It's death crying for you. The wheat is ripening outside the window. Don't let it get wet
I must inform you that we're by appointment only. Fanny broke her boat, I hope you'll agree to help. - I'll have some boiled potatoes. - She's a little drunk. I poured her a drink to soothe the pain.
It's not that bad. Try it. It's an accident. I have an idea. Will you give her a chance?
Axl. What about Axl? Prom is coming up. Funny thing about prom. He invited the wrong girl via text message, and now he won't take her to prom.

What are you waiting for? Good morning. Jesus, Mike, you always were a bore. Tony, what do you think of this room? It needs some color.
There is karma, and you should not do bad things in your lives. After talking for the whole session, we did not find out why children should die. Felix repeated over and over again: "We are already quite perfect, and we must leave this earth. That's why we have to leave so soon. When a Hindu dies, the family lights a candle next to his body. For Hindus believe that the soul is in turmoil when it leaves the body. And the candle helps it to settle in.
Right. Strong surface activity, Strong stellar winds. Bipolar current. She's brand-new. It's out of phase. Which means it could be 100 million years old? It's about 200 million years old.
There's no way to ask Destiny to come back and get them. How do you know that? Because I've already tried it. I'm done. The gate on this ship is more primitive than any found in the Milky Way. As you can see on this map, when Destiny stops, only a small group of gates are available.
Nothing. So we're back together? Looks like it. Call me James. If you want role-playing, you have to give it your all.
If you want roleplay, you have to give yourself to it completely.
What kind of word is "come true"? Come true? Come true? Okay, you just said, like, ten offensive words. Jesse pushed Rachel to find her mom, and she turned out to be Shelby Corcoran, director of Vocal Adrenaline.
And now. I have to stand on my feet all day! Just like a coolie. A laborer. It's okay, I'll push harder. Your technique is unique, where did you learn it?
If I remember correctly, quite gifted. What did you do to your hand? Я... I hurt myself. I'm not supposed to use it, but I was supposed to finish a sculpture today, so, uh.
Yeah. A piece of thread is tied to the left second premolar. She was hiding the map. It's an old prison trick. She attached one end of the thread to her tooth and the other to the memory card, so if she needed it, she could use the thread to retrieve it.
Any of this work? Uh-huh. The Gamma-Gamma Six Destroyer. Why doesn't this model of the solar system work? Because it's 60 years old.
- Are you a doctor now? - Why are you mad at me? I gotta go. Let nature take its course. Help her if you can.
Someone orchestrated this, deliberately forcing children to strangle themselves. Make sure you close the door. Tomorrow is the night we all play the game. There's a whole subculture around this game. Kids make up names for it, play it at parties.
Then where is my Wizarding power? It's in you. Lift that urn with the power of your mind. I can't do that. Let it rise, Wizard.
I don't like the memo myself anymore. Too many people are making fun of my last name. I'm surprised it took a memo to set it off. Look, I've gotten a few complaints, but the company will never admit it made a mistake. What if it doesn't have to admit it made a mistake?
You can't see the head. I got meat flies. Now this looks like murder. We found traces of black and red enamel paint on the concrete near the practice court that match the paint on the Fuschida putter. We believe the club broke during the struggle and that's what killed Russell Huntley.
"It was now clear that intelligence had failed to adequately assess the strength of Japanese resistance. "The Japanese had built an elaborate system of underground fortifications. -The intelligence had no idea what we were up against. ≈If intelligence had worked as it should, I don't think we would have been sent to this island.
It's terrible, but you have to solve this for them. - We have to let Niki die? - No, you have to let one of them live. You have to give Niki's cord blood because she's weaker. And she needs it.
I'm a Gypsy! All this worry and anxiety - no wonder you're not yourself, my poor little thing. Twister! You said it right about the song. I've got a worry, and I want to put an end to it.
Because - this is important, Amy - the forest is full of angels. You're gonna have to walk like you can see. What do you mean? Look, just walk. Time energy, what does it need?
Van Nuys, California. Where is the beautiful room Here. A beautiful room in an abandoned muffler factory in Van Nuys, California? Where do you think it should be?
Capital said you transferred from New Jersey six months ago, and you still have a fresh perspective. You know, thanks, but I have a shrink appointment. Unmade bed, no ring on my finger. You moved here to be closer to your daughter. So you've got nothing but a job besides your daughter, and you're proud of it.
Ah, Mr. Denver. Please, call me George. George, thank you again for your outstanding donation. Oh, I know how important Fancelli's work is to Italian sculpture. I can't just let it sit in the family attic collecting dust.
The door. Why not a door? Sometimes you get stuck on something and you don't even realize why. You open yourself up and go with the flow, wherever the universe takes you. Okay, so the universe led her to a door, and she became completely obsessed with it, and she redrew it 20 times until it was perfect.
It might, uh. shake their conscience for a while. But they'd do the same thing they did before. Swallow your pride, Bessie. Be silent. Accept the injustice and don't let it poison your love for these children.
I ran away. Let me go! I'm just a pilot! This man, for example, is here for a purpose. And now he has served it.
You don't have a dog. And remember, my daddy wants C-11 safe and sound. Well, we always do what your daddy says, don't we? Relax, I've got 300,000 reasons to bring this thing back assembled. The plan is, we trank her, get her to the surface, Santos sticks her with your remote, and your men bring her back to your boat, assuming your whole cheromancy thing works.
We've gotten more reports of this half shark, half octopus terrorizing the coast. Calm down, don't panic. There is a way to stop this beast. Sacrifice a virgin. Yes, the Mexican Fish and Game Commission assures me that the only way to stop the beast is to present it with a beautiful virgin.
Just making a point. But I see you defending Fisher right away. I'm defending him? Oh, mom. .. I can't sleep, I can't think, I can't string two words together. Every thought is immediately followed by another that contradicts it.
Yeah, that's right. I'm proud of you, Penelope. Despite everything that's happened, you came back. and the job is done. I used to run at the sight of blood. And two days ago, I was running towards it.
There's already an explanation, according to the papers. Yes. Some children are just born evil. What do you want me to do? George, you criticize the system you work in, but you belong to it.
Why make our jobs easier? But it goes online as Dreamweaver. And he's cute. He said the picture makes me look like a gangster. Yeah, I'll tell her.
Beyond what our eye can normally see in the realm of the unseen, one discovers the precise management of heat that allows a bee swarm to be a one-of-a-kind and successful kind of organization. But what is all this heat for? Well, look closely and the infrared camera will reveal exactly how the heat is concentrated in the central area where the brood colony is at the heart of the hive, where the young pupa bee is growing. This bee may seem unremarkable, but viewed in infrared, it is bright orange, showing its role as a special "heating" bee. The bee heats itself as a result of the vibrations of its flight muscles, these vibrations allow it to heat up to 44°C, a temperature previously considered lethal for a bee.
Thus, even as the wing travels upward, the smoke continues to tend downward, doubling its lifting power And you can't do that with an airplane. By exploring the invisible world of high speeds, engineers are discovering a whole range of animal secrets that can be used to design better flying machines. So why do we miss so much of what's around us when it's so obvious to other creatures? For example, a fly can perceive reality at 100 images per second, allowing it to maximize its speed without crashing into objects.
- There's one problem to discuss first. - What's that? - Al Parker's lawsuit against you. It's a civil case. - It's been dropped, hasn't it?
The hammer. The one I used to kill with. It's a little dull, but, uh. You have to use it to keep it sharp. Blood nourishes it, makes it shine.
I am now acting governor of Fortitude. Eric. Eric... I need you to focus right now. This town has been through a terrible experience. It needs to get back to normal.
- Give me the names! I gave them to my informants, - Give me the names! Give me the names! - ...I can continue to serve him faithfully,
- Boston? - Fools. You're all fools if you believe it will be as he says. - Have I not proven my loyalty to our common cause? - What happens when our enemy realizes that all he has to do to win is take this common cause from us?
- She slipped away in this mess. - I don't get it. She went to all this trouble to give you the virus, and then she just ran away? She saw me fighting the virus. She's waiting for me to give in to it.
The infected piled up at the watchtower. - She slipped through the clutter. - I don't get it. She went to all this trouble to give you the virus, and then she just ran away? She saw me fighting the virus. She's waiting for me to give in to it.
- And I also have a gift for my youngest son. That podcast you started. It touched me. - You mean the live show? - Yeah, that one. It made me realize you're an adult now.
I love you. Cass, what did you do? What I should have done. This world, this miserable, godforsaken world needs you. It needs every last Winchester, and I'm not gonna let you die.
Was that the last time you saw her? No. Her body was lying, uh. right here. His story is convincing. He's believable.
He knows I asked you. And he knows you said no. Yeah, that's what I said, and now I'm saying yes. You can have him as soon as he's born. We'll give him everything, Marnie.
Well, not really yours, because they're stolen. Okay, that was fun. Let's go. You're good at timing. You know how to carefully pull out a shovel and put legs on it.
Kind of an Achilles' heel. For the Destroyer? No, in the general sense of overwhelming evil..... The Destroyer is like the dark forces of the universe that cause the apocalypse. "When an unconquerable beast appears and only death is destined for those who oppose it, only the power of a single blood can defeat the great evil and destroy the Destroyer.
Can I be unusually direct with you? I can't imagine that this-- - Poison? It didn't just affect his face, if you know what I mean. - I think it did. - It also affected his penis and gave it an unusual sea cucumber texture, which is great for vaginal orgasms.
Who did he call? I don't know. I didn't ask. If mr. Bloom was walking around with his son's phone, He could open the app, find a new user with a password, and call him from the restaurant.
That was before I realized there was nothing but sarcasm in it. You wanted our child to have a relationship with the biological father. - But if you keep getting so worked up, I'm starting to think I don't know you at all. What if I can make him more like you? I can give him the ability to learn your heart.
Thank you for your honesty. The seizures have stopped, but his brain is swelling. Uh, Rick. That's his name. I hope the manitol helps him.
This is a counseling session, not a Love Line program. Then think about yourself, what personal contribution you can make, consolidate influence, control, access to decision making. You're right. Rhodes won't give you the head of CID, but his successor might. He'll need a deputy.
Let's proceed from that. I asked him to draw a small circle. Maybe at least in this case he'll make an effort. Maybe he'll attract attention with a simple circle. That's the impression I got from that circle, John. He lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, determination, passion and honesty.
I didn't even consider Novak's father a murderer. Well. he was always willing to defend my honor. He thought I regretted my affair with Lucia. And you didn't? I ended it because of her sadism.
I looked up this Fibonacci series in the Encyclopedia Britannica. Here's what I don't get. Flowers. How do they know math? Does a flower realize it has to have a certain number of petals? Why does it even care?
- (Ravi) For someone who's been kicked in the kidneys, you're suspiciously happy. What are you happy about? (whispers): Jesus. G.P.S. - (major) slipped it in his pocket.
Of course, this means that the "GSF" model harms animals, and that is definitely bad. But it does have some positive aspects - listen to the sound it makes! At medium speed, the engine sounds dreary, like the howl of a lonely dog. But if you turn up the revs, it sounds the way an atmospheric five-liter V8 should. In terms of power and torque it is far from supercharged German competitors, but driving is a real pleasure.
Four of his bodyguards burst into the room and I killed them all. Since that day, fear comes to me before every fight, but I meet it as a friend. He makes you faster, stronger, smarter. As long as YOU control him and don't let him control you.
I take responsibility. I do. But I need your help. If this gets out, people are gonna panic, and I need everyone to stay calm while we deal with it, okay? The Light has an agenda. If we reveal ourselves to him.
And I will not tolerate that threat. And we're at an impasse again. Maybe not. Our world is at a breaking point. War is the last thing it needs.
That we could go out. Don't change the subject. I'm talking about Alex. Karev's pissed, so I give a sick kid a chance. And he's offering him a Band-Aid.
It's funny, isn't it? You'll leave, and Maloryu will be mine to deal with. He'll take advantage of Shaana's death to ban any new initiatives. I bet he will. If you stayed on as director, you could stand up to him. But I don't know how.

- That's our ceiling! Four! - Abby. We all respect the scientific approach. I've dedicated my life to it.
It seems... I think it smells like that. human baby. Mowgli is from my pack, Sherkhan. Mowgli? They named him.
- It tastes like rubber. - No! It's nice, but I think if you're eating tofu, why pretend you're eating turkey or hamburger or whatever? You're giving tofu an inferiority complex. Let it be what it wants to be.
Thank you. Our wine is the blood of God. It will not harm you. Father, Ali Khan doesn't drink alcohol. His faith forbids it.
He's not here forever. He needs you. It's time, Ser Davos. Open the door. Let those inside join their brothers in peace. We'll even release the wolf north of the Wall where it belongs.
My mother's parents threw her out. She did everything she could to feed me, to keep me clothed. I didn't see how it broke her. But I wish, oh, how I wish she were here so I could hug her, tell her she was good, and strong, and the bravest woman I've ever known. Shame keeps us imprisoned if we let it.
I'm not saying anything. Look, punk, there's two ways out of this situation. the easy way and the hard way. Boss, tell him what complicated means. First, Steven, we'll fill out form number 38E-J1, declaring you insubordinate. We'll send it to the D.A., but will he give it the go-ahead?
Killing animals? What does that mean? What does that sound like to you? Jesus, you're the dumbest owner I've ever known. No wonder the fucking cat ran away from you. Did you remember to give him that thing called cat food?
- How much did he charge? - Ten dollars for ten milligrams. - You know where he got it from? - I think he had a prescription from a doctor. - You know how much it cost him?
At Otter Banks? About ten years ago. Fuck, my brother's still alive. You know what I like about the ocean? I love how much he doesn't give a fuck about you.
Who will speak in his defense? I will, but there must be others. Plenty. The prosecution has already prepared for the trial. And no doubt there will be many who will be happy to assist him.
- Yeah, I can feel it. - He's right in front of your foot. - It's coming out, it's coming out. - Okay. (sighs) Just don't let it fall.
Yelling is not the answer here, Chief Sousa. Where did Agent Carter go? What's the range? Souza was half a mile from the burst and managed to hit it. The only hitch is that it needs recharging after each use.
I don't deserve this, Martha. And stop harassing me. Your wife suggested it. Well, let's get you a room. It's changed a lot since you've lived here, Chip. A lot. Oh, this flower grows any way it wants, huh?
But Lucy? So she escaped from her confinement. That's very interesting. But I'm confused about something: a ghost can seep through walls, so why would it need a passageway?
You're just a narrow-minded moron who's afraid he might not be worthy of something more perfect. Why? And how are you going to stop the ghost? By finding out what it wants.
I've lost count of the number of times you've been there for me. No. No! I think you suffer more from this world than you're willing to admit. You want to control it without letting it control you.
The only way I know how to fight darkness is to be dark. And I don't want to be that person anymore. I'm running for mayor. And I promise you I will never stop fighting to save this city. You're all worried that this town is dying. I'm here on behalf of an organization that wants you to let it die.
Truth be told, this plan is similar to what I wanted to do with the Glades, only on a much larger scale. Let me guess. You don't think destroying the whole world is crazy? This world is crazy. It can't be saved. It needs a reboot.
He's already a beacon drawing your enemies to you. Perhaps the best solution is obvious. Trust him to the person who loves each of you most. I can disguise myself. If he needs to exist, at least I can take him far away.
- You killed him! - I saw him in his coffin. - Please remove the young man from the courtroom now. He was my father, and now he's gone! I urge you to disregard this outcry and not let it influence your decision in this case.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin. But my capsule was blown off course, and by the time I got to Earth, my cousin had grown up to become Superman. And so I kept my powers hidden until recently, when an accident forced me to reveal my secret. Many people know me as an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media. But secretly, I work with my adopted sister at the DEO, where we protect our city from alien life and anyone who wishes to do it harm.
But I understood enough to respond to his looks. On our first date, he'd learned that I was scared of the woods. - That's funny. - He thought so, too. So he said: "Sabina, fear will make you stronger if you look it in the eye."
We're distributing. - I take it you haven't told him yet. - Uh, not yet. He was supposed to go on tour 2 days ago, but it got postponed. I'll tell him.
Walking by phone was invented in 1984 by a Japanese neurologist. A rational solution, young lady. For shy people. How's your cat? Did you give him magnesium?
You know what, Lydia? You're no better than Valentine. But at least he had the guts to tell the Undead that he wanted them dead. You're, uh. hiding behind the law. I'm not hiding behind it, Isabel, I'm just following it.
Get out of here immediately before the police escort you out! Three months later. I understand your reasoning, but I will not tolerate further interference from Mr. Carter. It is my understanding, Mr. Laco, that the coffin is currently unprotected from the outside air, which means that its contents are gradually disintegrating. It's the discovery of the century, and you're letting it crumble to dust.
I'd say stop whining. Stop thinking about yourself. "pick up the phone and do what the client needs." Great advice from Olivia Pope. Then why can't I follow it?
He should be at the top. He wants to be useful, to do things. So, uh. What's the matter? So his mind doesn't take him where he shouldn't be.
- No, he won't stay. Enzo, get down too. That's enough. Marie, you know the child needs a mother. He needs a father, too.
That's right. That's exactly right. But you were right. This town is in trouble. It needs help.

But secretly, I work with my adopted sister at the DEO, where we protect our city from alien life and anyone who wishes to do it harm.
Please tell me you've heard enough that she's right. You're afraid of me. Now you're afraid of Nona. I understand that fear. But we can't let it control us.
These aren't. So the deceased was standing in a puddle when he decided to give his speech. - But the bride wasn't. But, sir, look at this. The wire was exposed, allowing it to make contact with the whole structure.
That's probably why this movie sucks. Here we are discussing "Cold Hearted," and then you screwed up. Miss, I'm sorry. How can you not like this movie? I just think it was rated higher than it deserves.
Oh, no. It's all in the past. Who are you trying to fool? Me or yourself? The heart needs what it needs.
It's mostly found on construction sites. Was Nolan remodeling the kitchen? Not exactly. Modern granite is treated with a polyurethane sealer, but this one didn't have a sealer, so it's old. It's at least 100 years old, and back in the day, granite was used for headstones.
Lanier: The next big surprise came when this thing infected our lab. We found out that the worm was looking for controllers! It was quite selective in its targets. It didn't try to manipulate every controller on the network that it could find.
I just think that we should, uh. Aria, enough. Drink your mimosa. How are we gonna find the phone? I can try sending him an IP packet.
- Maybe. - Because... it's just a thought, and I'm just saying the first number that comes to mind, you know.... Of course. ...dropping 57 charges won't do anything for Edgar. To make a good pâté, you have to fatten up the goose before you snap its neck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I feel like we should say something to each other. We're in this together. Us against the world. The world won't know what it's up against.
You were right. The animal that wants to watch the world burn.... That's you. But you have other qualities. What's your point? Don't deny the beast in you. But don't let it control you. I can help you.
Actually, there's three of us. Pleased to meet you. My name is Malcolm Merlyn. Uh, okay. The new suit's nice, but I think it still needs the modifications Cisco was talking about.
- They were already in beta when we bought them. It's practically ready to go. Because they pulled it off the shelf. It's boilerplate code provided by the credit card companies. They just spruced it up.
Chris Petronelli. The gun was in his right hand. - Okay. - Chris is left-handed. So someone put the gun in his hand.
It's gonna get worse. Look. What's wrong with him? It's called beri-beri. The body is depleted of minerals.
"He is the ultimate prince of darkness. He uses the souls of those you care about to fool and deceive you. "Hylan, Damon-- they've been defeated. But this demon still hopes to return. And Holyoke will do everything in his power to help him rise.
Let me show you. Here, this way, please. This serum, when refined, will be able to split a person's personality in two and separate the higher, nobler qualities from the primitive monster that every human is born with. Intriguing. Imagine a man who controls his inner monster rather than submitting to it.
Ms. James is back in medical school? Yes, and I'm rather lonely without her. But I am still able to confirm that Mr. Fellows did die of cyanide poisoning. - As you originally suspected. - Yes, but it seems he didn't drink it, and I found no trace of how the cyanide was administered.
But it feels so much faster. Oh, my God! You also get a battalion of mechanics for your money. But, alas, no handbrake. So, now I've taken it and, uh. yes. removed the steering wheel, so I can't put it in gear and keep it from rolling.
What if a temporary device was used? Where's the time device, Casey? We didn't find anything. We both know the fire didn't start on its own. Why don't you let him rest?
So what did you keep in the basement? That's what our perp needed. Johnny K's stash. Small arsenal of very expensive weapons, most illegal in Hawaii. So the dude steals a bulldozer, makes it bulletproof, tears down the wall during business hours when the basement's sure to be open.
- That's our ceiling! Four! - Abby. We all respect the scientific approach. I've dedicated my life to it.

I'm not saying anything. Look, punk, there's two ways out of this situation. the easy way and the hard way. Boss, tell him what complicated means. First, Steven, we'll fill out form number 38E-J1, declaring you insubordinate. We'll send it to the D.A., but will he give it the go-ahead?
Killing animals? What does that mean? What does that sound like to you? Jesus, you're the dumbest owner I've ever known. No wonder the fucking cat ran away from you. Did you remember to give him that thing called cat food?
- How much did he charge? - Ten dollars for ten milligrams. - You know where he got it from? - I think he had a prescription from a doctor. - You know how much it cost him?
At Otter Banks? About ten years ago. Fuck, my brother's still alive. You know what I like about the ocean? I love how much he doesn't give a fuck about you.
Who will speak in his defense? I will, but there must be others. Plenty. The prosecution has already prepared for the trial. And no doubt there will be many who will be happy to assist him.
- Yeah, I can feel it. - He's right in front of your foot. - It's coming out, it's coming out. - Okay. (sighs) Just don't let it fall.
Yelling is not the answer here, Chief Sousa. Where did Agent Carter go? What's the range? Souza was half a mile from the burst and managed to hit it. The only hitch is that it needs recharging after each use.
I don't deserve this, Martha. And stop harassing me. Your wife suggested it. Well, let's get you a room. It's changed a lot since you've lived here, Chip. A lot. Oh, this flower grows any way it wants, huh?
But Lucy? So she escaped from her confinement. That's very interesting. But I'm confused about something: a ghost can seep through walls, so why would it need a passageway?
You're just a narrow-minded moron who's afraid he might not be worthy of something more perfect. Why? And how are you going to stop the ghost? By finding out what it wants.
I've lost count of the number of times you've been there for me. No. No! I think you suffer more from this world than you're willing to admit. You want to control it without letting it control you.
The only way I know how to fight darkness is to be dark. And I don't want to be that person anymore. I'm running for mayor. And I promise you I will never stop fighting to save this city. You're all worried that this town is dying. I'm here on behalf of an organization that wants you to let it die.
Truth be told, this plan is similar to what I wanted to do with the Glades, only on a much larger scale. Let me guess. You don't think destroying the whole world is crazy? This world is crazy. It can't be saved. It needs a reboot.
He's already a beacon drawing your enemies to you. Perhaps the best solution is obvious. Trust him to the person who loves each of you most. I can disguise myself. If he needs to exist, at least I can take him far away.
- You killed him! - I saw him in his coffin. - Please remove the young man from the courtroom now. He was my father, and now he's gone! I urge you to disregard this outcry and not let it influence your decision in this case.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin. But my capsule was blown off course, and by the time I got to Earth, my cousin had grown up to become Superman. And so I kept my powers hidden until recently, when an accident forced me to reveal my secret. Many people know me as an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media. But secretly, I work with my adopted sister at the DEO, where we protect our city from alien life and anyone who wishes to do it harm.
But I understood enough to respond to his looks. On our first date, he'd learned that I was scared of the woods. - That's funny. - He thought so, too. So he said: "Sabina, fear will make you stronger if you look it in the eye."
We're distributing. - I take it you haven't told him yet. - Uh, not yet. He was supposed to go on tour 2 days ago, but it got postponed. I'll tell him.
Walking by phone was invented in 1984 by a Japanese neurologist. A rational solution, young lady. For shy people. How's your cat? Did you give him magnesium?
You know what, Lydia? You're no better than Valentine. But at least he had the guts to tell the Undead that he wanted them dead. You're, uh. hiding behind the law. I'm not hiding behind it, Isabel, I'm just following it.
Get out of here immediately before the police escort you out! Three months later. I understand your reasoning, but I will not tolerate further interference from Mr. Carter. It is my understanding, Mr. Laco, that the coffin is currently unprotected from the outside air, which means that its contents are gradually disintegrating. It's the discovery of the century, and you're letting it crumble to dust.
I'd say stop whining. Stop thinking about yourself. "pick up the phone and do what the client needs." Great advice from Olivia Pope. Then why can't I follow it?
He should be at the top. He wants to be useful, to do things. So, uh. What's the matter? So his mind doesn't take him where he shouldn't be.
- No, he won't stay. Enzo, get down too. That's enough. Marie, you know the child needs a mother. He needs a father, too.
That's right. That's exactly right. But you were right. This town is in trouble. It needs help.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin. But my capsule went off course and by the time I got here, my cousin had grown up to become Superman. So I kept my abilities hidden until recently, when an accident forced me to reveal my secret. Many people know me as an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media. But secretly, I work with my adopted sister at the DEO, where we protect our city from alien life and anyone who wishes to do it harm.
Please tell me you've heard enough that she's right. You're afraid of me. Now you're afraid of Nona. I understand that fear. But we can't let it control us.
These aren't. So the deceased was standing in a puddle when he decided to give his speech. - But the bride wasn't. But, sir, look at this. The wire was exposed, allowing it to make contact with the whole structure.
That's probably why this movie sucks. Here we are discussing "Cold Hearted," and then you screwed up. Miss, I'm sorry. How can you not like this movie? I just think it was rated higher than it deserves.
Oh, no. It's all in the past. Who are you trying to fool? Me or yourself? The heart needs what it needs.
It's mostly found on construction sites. Was Nolan remodeling the kitchen? Not exactly. Modern granite is treated with a polyurethane sealer, but this one didn't have a sealer, so it's old. It's at least 100 years old, and back in the day, granite was used for headstones.
Lanier: The next big surprise came when this thing infected our lab. We found out that the worm was looking for controllers! It was quite selective in its targets. It didn't try to manipulate every controller on the network that it could find.
I just think that we should, uh. Aria, enough. Drink your mimosa. How are we gonna find the phone? I can try sending him an IP packet.
- Maybe. - Because... it's just a thought, and I'm just saying the first number that comes to mind, you know.... Of course. ...dropping 57 charges won't do anything for Edgar. To make a good pâté, you have to fatten up the goose before you snap its neck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I feel like we should say something to each other. We're in this together. Us against the world. The world won't know what it's up against.
You were right. The animal that wants to watch the world burn.... That's you. But you have other qualities. What's your point? Don't deny the beast in you. But don't let it control you. I can help you.
Actually, there's three of us. Pleased to meet you. My name is Malcolm Merlyn. Uh, okay. The new suit's nice, but I think it still needs the modifications Cisco was talking about.
- They were already in beta when we bought them. It's practically ready to go. Because they pulled it off the shelf. It's boilerplate code provided by the credit card companies. They just spruced it up.
Chris Petronelli. The gun was in his right hand. - Okay. - Chris is left-handed. So someone put the gun in his hand.
It's gonna get worse. Look. What's wrong with him? It's called beri-beri. The body is depleted of minerals.
"He is the ultimate prince of darkness. He uses the souls of those you care about to fool and deceive you. "Hylan, Damon-- they've been defeated. But this demon still hopes to return. And Holyoke will do everything in his power to help him rise.
Let me show you. Here, this way, please. This serum, when refined, will be able to split a person's personality in two and separate the higher, nobler qualities from the primitive monster that every human is born with. Intriguing. Imagine a man who controls his inner monster rather than submitting to it.
Ms. James is back in medical school? Yes, and I'm rather lonely without her. But I am still able to confirm that Mr. Fellows did die of cyanide poisoning. - As you originally suspected. - Yes, but it seems he didn't drink it, and I found no trace of how the cyanide was administered.
But it feels so much faster. Oh, my God! You also get a battalion of mechanics for your money. But, alas, no handbrake. So, now I've taken it and, uh. yes. removed the steering wheel, so I can't put it in gear and keep it from rolling.
What if a temporary device was used? Where's the time device, Casey? We didn't find anything. We both know the fire didn't start on its own. Why don't you let him rest?
So what did you keep in the basement? That's what our perp needed. Johnny K's stash. Small arsenal of very expensive weapons, most illegal in Hawaii. So the dude steals a bulldozer, makes it bulletproof, tears down the wall during business hours when the basement's sure to be open.
Oh, my God. Are you serious? Well, you can't, can you? I mean, with a baby inside. I mean, you could hurt him, right?
≈If you'll allow me to explain. ƒeon, you're very pleased with the Petravaal. -The kouts are a smashing success. It won't cost you a thing. ¬One droid was decommissioned yesterday, it can't be repaired. Let me install the program for him.
To the Globe. A few years ago. After the Porter case, I got tons of calls. I had 20 priests alone in Boston, but I couldn't go after them without press. So I sent you a list of names and you wouldn't let it go.
How did people take the prospect of an inevitable end? They devoured it like a chocolate eclair. The end didn't scare them. They came up with a package for it. Video games, TV shows, books, movies. Mankind rejoiced heartily and rushed towards the apocalypse with enthusiasm and vigor.
Except for Choi, but, you know, I guess we'll have to start without him. First of all, welcome to our little reunion. You're all very important to Eden, which means you're important to me, too, and we miss you, and we love you. You know, we're all on a journey, and we think it's important to have loved ones accompanying you on that journey, and honestly, we've done just that. We want to reopen the house and give him and us a chance to start over, so....
Do you remember? Peggy's coming with me. Joy will spend half the time with us. We'll take her paper forest. It belongs to Joy, and it belongs in this house.
Is that a member of the King? More than that. Yes? You must live up to your equal, James. Yes! I will match him!
Good job, Jay. I'm gonna have to drag myself to school tomorrow. If you find a crying baby, you-- A. Scold him. B. Lock him up in the tower. C. Give him a bottle.
So... Really? I'm sorry, is your lowlife buddy gonna offer you anything more interesting than a five-year contract with me? Quinn, he's a great guy, and he loves me. I think I should give him a chance.
If you have time, come and have a look at the model, it's very accurate. Lucy, can I interrupt you for a moment? Uh, thank you. I got a message from Lolessa. He wants the password to his Facebook page. What's he want it for?
Club life didn't appeal to him much, and he longed for Reggie and the darker side of the gangster world. You turn your fucking back on it and life does its dirty tricks, you know? That year at Christmas, we weren't together. Reggie had a warrant out on him a long time ago. He appealed the last six months of his sentence, but it was denied.
Kerosene extracts the drug from the leaf. And then sulfuric acid cleans and purifies it. Then you take it and mix it with gasoline. And then we just release the product from that solution. We let it dry.
They burned the huts on the beach and then the houses in town. When all of Nassau was a smoking ruin, they turned their attention to the island. They raped, killed, pillaged. All because there was no fort. The man in charge let it become untenable.
What do you say? You want to take one home? Don't joke about that. I rescued a wolf cub when I was your age. He was about two months old.
We grow all trees from the same rhizome. We call her "mother." Her? Michael discovered the mother quite by accident when our entire garden was struck by a terrible rot. Only one tree survived by absorbing the fungus and preventing it from destroying itself.
I still remember how to forge your signature. Let's go meet your team. Pawnee National Park Rangers, this is Ron Swanson, your new supervisor. Rangers, my name is Ronald Ulysses Swanson. Our job is to go around this park and make sure no one hurts it.
Yeah, I've been there. It's a fine line. Hey! Last week, there was a creepy ghost looking for her. He had black hair, but his skin was transparent, and he didn't like me, but that's just because I'm a ghostbuster at heart.
Nothing worked. A few months ago, we sent a sprinkler out here. Raccoons ate the wheels off it. Councilman Dexhart represents this neighborhood, and 10 years ago when he was elected, he promised to clean it up. But instead, he just gave it a fancy new name:
I can't. Crazy. I still can't believe you turned off the extra alarm. You're like a sleepy ninja. My heart wants to stay in bed with you, and it wants to stay in bed with you.
Okay, what's next? Dogs and cats in Nightingale? The question itself is ridiculous. How about a skunk student? Should he be allowed to be a Warbler?
So, to make it easier for the doctor to settle in here, he'll be joining the Guggenheim to look into the use of adrenal extract in surgery. - This is the first I've heard of adrenal extract. - It's a curious substance obtained from the adrenal glands of animals by a Polish doctor named Cybulski. I don't know what he calls it, but we call it adrenaline. You're going to help us find a practical application for it.
Was anyone there, other cheerleaders, players? My boyfriend, but we left separately. Bruise on his neck. I'm telling you, I choked him. By the color, it's a couple days old.
Stop it. You helped save the world today. I don't know what you're talking about. The meteorite is out there somewhere. It has an unexplainable power.
It's beautiful. Oh, you know? I was really nervous because I was thinking, "I don't want to be "another thing for a poltergeist to throw!" We try not to say things like that, it gives him ideas.
-That's enough. -Talk! We didn't get here by accident. -It's a sign. -Talk! Don't answer him, Wim.
You take care of yours. Find those shooters and close this case. We're working on all fronts. You're a good ally, Justin. That's why our business, and others like it, will guarantee your re-election.
All right. Uh-huh. Here are the instructions. To counter this threat, the police must cooperate with us and defame and discredit the movement at every opportunity. Why don't we tie their shoelaces and vise their nipples? All right, there's a body in the gutter. Forensics says it's almost a month old.
I'm combing the hotel. It's clear. We need to hurry. Did your quiet voice finally tell you something about Samin? No, but Ms. Thompson will. At least she might know what our adversary is doing at the plant and how he's manipulating the people of Maple.
I was waiting for a train on the subway. He said: "That's a cool jacket. You want to give it to me, don't you?" And I said, "Yeah." И... like an asshole, I give him my jacket.
She's right. We have to be strong to win. Let's do it. Where is this object? Who is like the Beast, and who can stand against it?
Sarge, I expected this from the first day I met her. She just... couldn't handle life. Why did she leave you? The marriage was a failure. We let it go on.
No signs of a struggle. There's a small scratch on the forehead, but it healed long before time of death. So how does one die alone in bed from asphyxiation? Mercaptan. It's a compound that's added to natural gas to give it a special odor.
Which would have been a disaster that would have forced Rome to call in the troops and the waters of the Mediterranean would have turned red with Jewish blood. I disagree with you that he was a threat. This is why you will never be high priest. The Jewish people have survived the tyranny of many empires through pragmatism and compromise. A careful leader will allow it to survive Roman rule as well.
You must miss him terribly. Mrs. Strong. To what do I owe the pleasure? Or perhaps I've offended you in some other way of which I was not previously aware? I understand your anger, Captain. And I want to apologize for causing it.
What do you think will happen? Phase one. Contact. A single alien from a race many years ahead of our own easily sneaks aboard a human ship. The alien makes contact. He seems hostile, but he doesn't want blood.
Alan York? The astronaut? One of the first men to walk on the moon. I want to eat his brain. I think he still needs it.
Not if you have to be a fucking snitch to do it. Jesus, stop playing the righteous man. In our line of work, if you want to survive, you'll do it. Not me. I have a code. And according to it, I don't rat out my own.
I've helped you before. Maybe there's a way I can help you again. In our line of work, if you want to survive, you'll do anything. - But not me. I have a code. And according to it, I don't give up on my own.
Is it that bad? We have one dragon. In the end, you either kill it, tame it, or digest it in its stomach. His name is Help the Others. If I tame him, can I give him a cooler name?
The truth is, in a moment of weakness, I slept with you, and I shouldn't have. Mike, I can't let you cross the line. I won't. Look. I don't deny that I have a vested interest in catching Mark, but I'm not gonna let it affect my work.
Chlo! Oh, my God. Chlo! Did you know that by 16 weeks, your baby is no bigger than an avocado but can hear everything? You're supposed to talk to him and sing to him.
But... I guess he never really believed it. 20 years later, Lucas Rome still hurt him, still scared him. You know, uh. I think your father chasing those relics was his way of trying to end the nightmare. But, uh. instead, he just gave it a new life.
You don't want to talk about it? What do you want to talk about? You want to talk about the cop downstairs who took a bullet from him? I just want to eat, okay? Or do you want to talk about how he shattered his elbow?
I realized all my mistakes, okay? I've studied this virus. I think I can disarm it. It'll work, but it won't have teeth. Yeah, but by removing its teeth, you'll release it through the city's transportation network.
We must govern ourselves according to our laws so that this city and its inhabitants will never again fall under Roman law. That is all well and good. But as I understand it, this Boaz has surrendered himself. And these are the men who claim to keep the law of Moses? You, uh. you who received the law from the angels but disobeyed it!
Stop. I said stop! What's the point? The world is trying to die. We have to let it.
I owed him, so I couldn't say no. - Why did Jake need a gun? He said they'd been broken into a few times. That he was worried about Katie. He needed it for protection.
Yeah. No sign of a struggle. We got his clothes, keys to the jeep, cell phone, wallet with credit cards and money. And according to Francis' son, his diary is missing. Apparently, he attached a lot of importance to it.
Kid. Hands are tied. But he's thinking, what the hell? I'm gonna run, seize the moment. I got him down. I pull out my gun and put it in his mouth.
I did it with Juan Largo. JUAN LARGO: Why, hey, you're a sexy thing. I heard about the fiesta diploma. I'd like to give it a shot.
If that's the case, stop following us. This could be the end. This temple is not just stones and mortar put together by human hands. It is the lord's house on earth, his home, his holy of holies. And it is in danger.
Whiskey? This is no time for a drink. Madam, if you can't handle your surroundings. Alcohol is a disinfectant. He'll feel better.
Dear Diary. In a town far from home, Rachel Earle was running. Yes, that's right, running. It's not every day you see Rachel Earl running, but this was an emergency. Even if Johnny Depp had beckoned me with his penis from the top of the hill, he would have had to wait.
- Maybe too much. - You can't like mummies too much. - Okay, but we need to do some recon. Do these villagers know about the temple? Do they worship it?
We found it in the air conditioning unit near the bench just outside the courtroom. Looks like a .22 to me. Nice work, Dwayne. - Thanks, chief. - Get it to Forensics and see if it matches the bullet that killed Jack.
I mean, uh. this phone? Yeah, don't be silly. Just hand me the phone. No. I think he's fine. lying down.
But he was smart and resourceful. He was battered. He was between a rock and a hard place. He was in unusual circumstances. It must be forgotten! And to see a moldable lump of clay. Can it be shaped before we present it to the jury.
Stay away from David and Amanda Clarke. - Is Victoria calling? - I won't answer it. It's called self-preservation. You should follow it.
According to my calculations, this creature was brought to us by the current from Greenwich. About three hours in the water. И? If someone wanted it to be found and mistaken for the work of surgeons, he relied too heavily on chance. Wouldn't the provocateur take care to make his deed known? Not just let him swim wherever God sends him.
Does that mean you're taking back Cookie and Andre, too? Is that what you mean? Let's take it one step at a time, okay? Hakeem, you got a good career ahead of you. Come back to Empire, we'll release your album, give it a huge boost.
Why? He had the best escape plan in the history of mankind. The Sudden Extinction was a solitary event. The flood had occurred three years ago on October 14, and the ark had taken with it all the living creatures it needed. Why in heaven's name would it take anyone else?
The police couldn't find him. His wife or his mother didn't come out to pick him up. Now this child is in a foster home, and he's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay. He will grow up and it will be hard for him to get close to people, it will be hard for him to give and receive love.
Evelyn told me. - So you understand. - Of course I understand. The automobile is your enemy. And my best friend. Please give it a second chance.
She's a nice lady whose husband fell off a roof. You have to stop. Does anyone have any cologne? Gin? No. I can't use cologne until I prove I'm up to it.
The military will now be snooping under every hollow. Dead special agent, is there a spy on the Hill? Speaking of Indians, what's your gal doing with a vacuum cleaner? I don't know. She worships it.
Now, don't waste your time. Booth has been in the office for ten years. Believe me, I'd give anything to have him here. Why did Booth bring a gun with him? He wouldn't have needed it at the Quantico base.
We downloaded what the console recorded at Scott Barrett's house. We know he was playing golf on his console before he was attacked. So this is our killer. These two men are fighting over something that looks a lot like a golf club. During the fight, the club smashed Scott's cell phone after hitting him in the head.
She lives in the same house she lived in with her ex-boyfriend? Yeah. And actually, it's his house. And he's not fucking her? Nope. So she lives in his house for free, he takes her to parties, and she doesn't give him any?
I'm here for me. Whatever you like about me, maybe you'll find it in her. But please leave me alone. Where's the file? Where it belongs.
Why the fuck did he stop that fight, J? I wasn't fucking there, so I can't say who's right, right? - You were here. I was there, and I'm telling you he did it because he didn't need him in the first place.
- Don't blame my ship! - Your stupid ship did it! - My ship doesn't do anything. - It melted the baby! - ...unless you tell it to!
I'm running for mayor. Don't say congratulations all at once. So you're serious. Last week, Lance said the city needs someone who'll step into the light, who won't hide behind a mask. It needs a leader.
Isn't that enough? It's our first Christmas together. I've never been happy. I just want a quiet evening with you and Hope, our family, and I don't care if their house burns down. For one night, I'll let it burn.
I'm so sorry. I know I promised we'd spend this night alone. It was even a really ridiculous plan where we were gonna drink hot whiskey and watch "it's a Wonderful Life" together, and here we are. You don't have to apologize. Tonight it was me. I saw their house on fire and decided not to let it burn down.
So why did you do it? Because I don't trust myself. I'm weak. I've forgotten who I am. You have to find your voice and let it sing.
Take your time. Anything around the vocal cords can cause more swelling. You pop it, and the tissue around it swells up like a balloon, and your chance is gone. I know, I know, it's like driving a truck on eggshells. Find your voice and let it sing.
Do you have any proof? All right, listen up. Violence spreads like a fire. It only takes one spark to burn the bridges of trust between us. And once it's started, it doesn't care who it burns.
But you still have plenty of time to help your people. You have the power in your hands, and I want to help you use it right. Go on. All that's needed is your blessing. If the Prime Minister comes to you about a construction project in the Himalayas, smile at him.
I was sent to earth to protect my brother. But my pod went off course and by the time I got here, my brother was all grown up and Superman. And I hid my powers until an accident forced me to show my powers. To most people, I'm an assistant at Katko World Wide Media. But in confidence, I work in the TWO with my half-sister to protect my city from aliens and anyone who wants to harm it.
Nah, it's just some hand foreplay stuff. nothing special. Well, I mean, depends on what age you were, technically, it's almost rape. Uh... But, uh, you get it. I let him.
Where does he keep them? In his jet, in his flying freezer that won't land. He's got a fuel tanker. Not anymore. We clipped his wings.
You, uh. you're gonna move to another city as soon as this is over. You think once we sign this contract, in this negotiation, I'm gonna find someone else? You got a fucking inflated ego. The orchestra is my family. I'm not gonna let anyone or anything hurt it.
You're black! You of all people should understand that. Unfortunately, I do, Ms. Hapstol. But the law is the law. It's my duty to follow it, regardless of my personal feelings.
Now, who wants to go see Jesus? - I brought your robe. I know you hate all those hospital shirts that air out your butt. My butt will air out when I tell it to.
You were supposed to find the scotch, Gail! I didn't want to be wrong twice. Don't worry about it. He's fine in there. He likes it.
- Right. It got better. Google had that problem too. Has the algorithm ever mistaken a white person for an animal? Why would it do that?
No. Not that much. Why? Why does he have trouble identifying African-Americans but not whites? My guess is because we didn't give him enough samples.
He has no criminal record, no enemies as far as his friends know, no suspicious debts. And his ex's alibi checks out. She was in Philly all last night. Hopefully, she won't be in a hurry to get her truck back. He needs some air.
I promise I'll tell Snotlout where I hid his favorite axe. Hey. Hey, Snotlout, it's trying to escape! Come on, girl, we gotta block the exit. The guys will never believe it was here if we let it get away.
Let's help the others. Hiccup, there's too many of them! And the Winged Terror isn't helping at all. We can do it if we stay out of his fog. Hiccup, why don't you explain to him that we're the good guys?
Oh, my God. Are you serious? Well, you can't, can you? I mean, with a baby inside. I mean, you could hurt him, right?
≈If you'll allow me to explain. ƒeon, you're very pleased with the Petravaal. -The kouts are a smashing success. It won't cost you a thing. ¬One droid was decommissioned yesterday, it can't be repaired. Let me install the program for him.
To the Globe. A few years ago. After the Porter case, I got tons of calls. I had 20 priests alone in Boston, but I couldn't go after them without press. So I sent you a list of names and you wouldn't let it go.
How did people take the prospect of an inevitable end? They devoured it like a chocolate eclair. The end didn't scare them. They came up with a package for it. Video games, TV shows, books, movies. Mankind rejoiced heartily and rushed towards the apocalypse with enthusiasm and vigor.
Except for Choi, but, you know, I guess we'll have to start without him. First of all, welcome to our little reunion. You're all very important to Eden, which means you're important to me, too, and we miss you, and we love you. You know, we're all on a journey, and we think it's important to have loved ones accompanying you on that journey, and honestly, we've done just that. We want to reopen the house and give him and us a chance to start over, so....
Do you remember? Peggy's coming with me. Joy will spend half the time with us. We'll take her paper forest. It belongs to Joy, and it belongs in this house.
Is that a member of the King? More than that. Yes? You must live up to your equal, James. Yes! I will match him!
Good job, Jay. I'm gonna have to drag myself to school tomorrow. If you find a crying baby, you-- A. Scold him. B. Lock him up in the tower. C. Give him a bottle.
So... Really? I'm sorry, is your lowlife buddy gonna offer you anything more interesting than a five-year contract with me? Quinn, he's a great guy, and he loves me. I think I should give him a chance.
If you have time, come and have a look at the model, it's very accurate. Lucy, can I interrupt you for a moment? Uh, thank you. I got a message from Lolessa. He wants the password to his Facebook page. What's he want it for?
Club life didn't appeal to him much, and he longed for Reggie and the darker side of the gangster world. You turn your fucking back on it and life does its dirty tricks, you know? That year at Christmas, we weren't together. Reggie had a warrant out on him a long time ago. He appealed the last six months of his sentence, but it was denied.
Kerosene extracts the drug from the leaf. And then sulfuric acid cleans and purifies it. Then you take it and mix it with gasoline. And then we just release the product from that solution. We let it dry.
They burned the huts on the beach and then the houses in town. When all of Nassau was a smoking ruin, they turned their attention to the island. They raped, killed, pillaged. All because there was no fort. The man in charge let it become untenable.
What do you say? You want to take one home? Don't joke about that. I rescued a wolf cub when I was your age. He was about two months old.
We grow all trees from the same rhizome. We call her "mother." Her? Michael discovered the mother quite by accident when our entire garden was struck by a terrible rot. Only one tree survived by absorbing the fungus and preventing it from destroying itself.
I still remember how to forge your signature. Let's go meet your team. Pawnee National Park Rangers, this is Ron Swanson, your new supervisor. Rangers, my name is Ronald Ulysses Swanson. Our job is to go around this park and make sure no one hurts it.
Yeah, I've been there. It's a fine line. Hey! Last week, there was a creepy ghost looking for her. He had black hair, but his skin was transparent, and he didn't like me, but that's just because I'm a ghostbuster at heart.
Nothing worked. A few months ago, we sent a sprinkler out here. Raccoons ate the wheels off it. Councilman Dexhart represents this neighborhood, and 10 years ago when he was elected, he promised to clean it up. But instead, he just gave it a fancy new name:
I can't. Crazy. I still can't believe you turned off the extra alarm. You're like a sleepy ninja. My heart wants to stay in bed with you, and it wants to stay in bed with you.
Okay, what's next? Dogs and cats in Nightingale? The question itself is ridiculous. How about a skunk student? Should he be allowed to be a Warbler?
So, to make it easier for the doctor to settle in here, he'll be joining the Guggenheim to look into the use of adrenal extract in surgery. - This is the first I've heard of adrenal extract. - It's a curious substance obtained from the adrenal glands of animals by a Polish doctor named Cybulski. I don't know what he calls it, but we call it adrenaline. You're going to help us find a practical application for it.
Was anyone there, other cheerleaders, players? My boyfriend, but we left separately. Bruise on his neck. I'm telling you, I choked him. By the color, it's a couple days old.
Stop it. You helped save the world today. I don't know what you're talking about. The meteorite is out there somewhere. It has an unexplainable power.
It's beautiful. Oh, you know? I was really nervous because I was thinking, "I don't want to be "another thing for a poltergeist to throw!" We try not to say things like that, it gives him ideas.
-That's enough. -Talk! We didn't get here by accident. -It's a sign. -Talk! Don't answer him, Wim.
You take care of yours. Find those shooters and close this case. We're working on all fronts. You're a good ally, Justin. That's why our business, and others like it, will guarantee your re-election.
All right. Uh-huh. Here are the instructions. To counter this threat, the police must cooperate with us and defame and discredit the movement at every opportunity. Why don't we tie their shoelaces and vise their nipples? All right, there's a body in the gutter. Forensics says it's almost a month old.
I'm combing the hotel. It's clear. We need to hurry. Did your quiet voice finally tell you something about Samin? No, but Ms. Thompson will. At least she might know what our adversary is doing at the plant and how he's manipulating the people of Maple.
I was waiting for a train on the subway. He said: "That's a cool jacket. You want to give it to me, don't you?" And I said, "Yeah." И... like an asshole, I give him my jacket.
She's right. We have to be strong to win. Let's do it. Where is this object? Who is like the Beast, and who can stand against it?
Sarge, I expected this from the first day I met her. She just... couldn't handle life. Why did she leave you? The marriage was a failure. We let it go on.
No signs of a struggle. There's a small scratch on the forehead, but it healed long before time of death. So how does one die alone in bed from asphyxiation? Mercaptan. It's a compound that's added to natural gas to give it a special odor.
Which would have been a disaster that would have forced Rome to call in the troops and the waters of the Mediterranean would have turned red with Jewish blood. I disagree with you that he was a threat. This is why you will never be high priest. The Jewish people have survived the tyranny of many empires through pragmatism and compromise. A careful leader will allow it to survive Roman rule as well.
You must miss him terribly. Mrs. Strong. To what do I owe the pleasure? Or perhaps I've offended you in some other way of which I was not previously aware? I understand your anger, Captain. And I want to apologize for causing it.
What do you think will happen? Phase one. Contact. A single alien from a race many years ahead of our own easily sneaks aboard a human ship. The alien makes contact. He seems hostile, but he doesn't want blood.
Alan York? The astronaut? One of the first men to walk on the moon. I want to eat his brain. I think he still needs it.
Not if you have to be a fucking snitch to do it. Jesus, stop playing the righteous man. In our line of work, if you want to survive, you'll do it. Not me. I have a code. And according to it, I don't rat out my own.
I've helped you before. Maybe there's a way I can help you again. In our line of work, if you want to survive, you'll do anything. - But not me. I have a code. And according to it, I don't give up on my own.
Is it that bad? We have one dragon. In the end, you either kill it, tame it, or digest it in its stomach. His name is Help the Others. If I tame him, can I give him a cooler name?
The truth is, in a moment of weakness, I slept with you, and I shouldn't have. Mike, I can't let you cross the line. I won't. Look. I don't deny that I have a vested interest in catching Mark, but I'm not gonna let it affect my work.
Chlo! Oh, my God. Chlo! Did you know that by 16 weeks, your baby is no bigger than an avocado but can hear everything? You're supposed to talk to him and sing to him.
But... I guess he never really believed it. 20 years later, Lucas Rome still hurt him, still scared him. You know, uh. I think your father chasing those relics was his way of trying to end the nightmare. But, uh. instead, he just gave it a new life.
You don't want to talk about it? What do you want to talk about? You want to talk about the cop downstairs who took a bullet from him? I just want to eat, okay? Or do you want to talk about how he shattered his elbow?
I realized all my mistakes, okay? I've studied this virus. I think I can disarm it. It'll work, but it won't have teeth. Yeah, but by removing its teeth, you'll release it through the city's transportation network.
We must govern ourselves according to our laws so that this city and its inhabitants will never again fall under Roman law. That is all well and good. But as I understand it, this Boaz has surrendered himself. And these are the men who claim to keep the law of Moses? You, uh. you who received the law from the angels but disobeyed it!
Stop. I said stop! What's the point? The world is trying to die. We have to let it.
I owed him, so I couldn't say no. - Why did Jake need a gun? He said they'd been broken into a few times. That he was worried about Katie. He needed it for protection.
Yeah. No sign of a struggle. We got his clothes, keys to the jeep, cell phone, wallet with credit cards and money. And according to Francis' son, his diary is missing. Apparently, he attached a lot of importance to it.
Kid. Hands are tied. But he's thinking, what the hell? I'm gonna run, seize the moment. I got him down. I pull out my gun and put it in his mouth.
I did it with Juan Largo. JUAN LARGO: Why, hey, you're a sexy thing. I heard about the fiesta diploma. I'd like to give it a shot.
If that's the case, stop following us. This could be the end. This temple is not just stones and mortar put together by human hands. It is the lord's house on earth, his home, his holy of holies. And it is in danger.
Whiskey? This is no time for a drink. Madam, if you can't handle your surroundings. Alcohol is a disinfectant. He'll feel better.
Dear Diary. In a town far from home, Rachel Earle was running. Yes, that's right, running. It's not every day you see Rachel Earl running, but this was an emergency. Even if Johnny Depp had beckoned me with his penis from the top of the hill, he would have had to wait.
- Maybe too much. - You can't like mummies too much. - Okay, but we need to do some recon. Do these villagers know about the temple? Do they worship it?
We found it in the air conditioning unit near the bench just outside the courtroom. Looks like a .22 to me. Nice work, Dwayne. - Thanks, chief. - Get it to Forensics and see if it matches the bullet that killed Jack.
I mean, uh. this phone? Yeah, don't be silly. Just hand me the phone. No. I think he's fine. lying down.
But he was smart and resourceful. He was battered. He was between a rock and a hard place. He was in unusual circumstances. It must be forgotten! And to see a moldable lump of clay. Can it be shaped before we present it to the jury.
Stay away from David and Amanda Clarke. - Is Victoria calling? - I won't answer it. It's called self-preservation. You should follow it.
According to my calculations, this creature was brought to us by the current from Greenwich. About three hours in the water. И? If someone wanted it to be found and mistaken for the work of surgeons, he relied too heavily on chance. Wouldn't the provocateur take care to make his deed known? Not just let him swim wherever God sends him.
Does that mean you're taking back Cookie and Andre, too? Is that what you mean? Let's take it one step at a time, okay? Hakeem, you got a good career ahead of you. Come back to Empire, we'll release your album, give it a huge boost.
Why? He had the best escape plan in the history of mankind. The Sudden Extinction was a solitary event. The flood had occurred three years ago on October 14, and the ark had taken with it all the living creatures it needed. Why in heaven's name would it take anyone else?
The police couldn't find him. His wife or his mother didn't come out to pick him up. Now this child is in a foster home, and he's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay. He will grow up and it will be hard for him to get close to people, it will be hard for him to give and receive love.
Evelyn told me. - So you understand. - Of course I understand. The automobile is your enemy. And my best friend. Please give it a second chance.
She's a nice lady whose husband fell off a roof. You have to stop. Does anyone have any cologne? Gin? No. I can't use cologne until I prove I'm up to it.
The military will now be snooping under every hollow. Dead special agent, is there a spy on the Hill? Speaking of Indians, what's your gal doing with a vacuum cleaner? I don't know. She worships it.
Now, don't waste your time. Booth has been in the office for ten years. Believe me, I'd give anything to have him here. Why did Booth bring a gun with him? He wouldn't have needed it at the Quantico base.
We downloaded what the console recorded at Scott Barrett's house. We know he was playing golf on his console before he was attacked. So this is our killer. These two men are fighting over something that looks a lot like a golf club. During the fight, the club smashed Scott's cell phone after hitting him in the head.
She lives in the same house she lived in with her ex-boyfriend? Yeah. And actually, it's his house. And he's not fucking her? Nope. So she lives in his house for free, he takes her to parties, and she doesn't give him any?
I'm here for me. Whatever you like about me, maybe you'll find it in her. But please leave me alone. Where's the file? Where it belongs.
Why the fuck did he stop that fight, J? I wasn't fucking there, so I can't say who's right, right? - You were here. I was there, and I'm telling you he did it because he didn't need him in the first place.
- Don't blame my ship! - Your stupid ship did it! - My ship doesn't do anything. - It melted the baby! - ...unless you tell it to!
I'm running for mayor. Don't say congratulations all at once. So you're serious. Last week, Lance said the city needs someone who'll step into the light, who won't hide behind a mask. It needs a leader.
Isn't that enough? It's our first Christmas together. I've never been happy. I just want a quiet evening with you and Hope, our family, and I don't care if their house burns down. For one night, I'll let it burn.
I'm so sorry. I know I promised we'd spend this night alone. It was even a really ridiculous plan where we were gonna drink hot whiskey and watch "it's a Wonderful Life" together, and here we are. You don't have to apologize. Tonight it was me. I saw their house on fire and decided not to let it burn down.
So why did you do it? Because I don't trust myself. I'm weak. I've forgotten who I am. You have to find your voice and let it sing.
Take your time. Anything around the vocal cords can cause more swelling. You pop it, and the tissue around it swells up like a balloon, and your chance is gone. I know, I know, it's like driving a truck on eggshells. Find your voice and let it sing.
Do you have any proof? All right, listen up. Violence spreads like a fire. It only takes one spark to burn the bridges of trust between us. And once it's started, it doesn't care who it burns.
But you still have plenty of time to help your people. You have the power in your hands, and I want to help you use it right. Go on. All that's needed is your blessing. If the Prime Minister comes to you about a construction project in the Himalayas, smile at him.
I was sent to earth to protect my brother. But my pod went off course and by the time I got here, my brother was all grown up and Superman. And I hid my powers until an accident forced me to show my powers. To most people, I'm an assistant at Katko World Wide Media. But in confidence, I work in the TWO with my half-sister to protect my city from aliens and anyone who wants to harm it.
Nah, it's just some hand foreplay stuff. nothing special. Well, I mean, depends on what age you were, technically, it's almost rape. Uh... But, uh, you get it. I let him.
Where does he keep them? In his jet, in his flying freezer that won't land. He's got a fuel tanker. Not anymore. We clipped his wings.
You, uh. you're gonna move to another city as soon as this is over. You think once we sign this contract, in this negotiation, I'm gonna find someone else? You got a fucking inflated ego. The orchestra is my family. I'm not gonna let anyone or anything hurt it.
You're black! You of all people should understand that. Unfortunately, I do, Ms. Hapstol. But the law is the law. It's my duty to follow it, regardless of my personal feelings.
Now, who wants to go see Jesus? - I brought your robe. I know you hate all those hospital shirts that air out your butt. My butt will air out when I tell it to.
You were supposed to find the scotch, Gail! I didn't want to be wrong twice. Don't worry about it. He's fine in there. He likes it.
- Right. It got better. Google had that problem too. Has the algorithm ever mistaken a white person for an animal? Why would it do that?
No. Not that much. Why? Why does he have trouble identifying African-Americans but not whites? My guess is because we didn't give him enough samples.
He has no criminal record, no enemies as far as his friends know, no suspicious debts. And his ex's alibi checks out. She was in Philly all last night. Hopefully, she won't be in a hurry to get her truck back. He needs some air.
I promise I'll tell Snotlout where I hid his favorite axe. Hey. Hey, Snotlout, it's trying to escape! Come on, girl, we gotta block the exit. The guys will never believe it was here if we let it get away.
Let's help the others. Hiccup, there's too many of them! And the Winged Terror isn't helping at all. We can do it if we stay out of his fog. Hiccup, why don't you explain to him that we're the good guys?
I've always wanted wings. I'd like a pair of wings. Anything else, sir? Yes, please. I want an African owl. Spread its wings and fry it with potatoes.
It's a very difficult job. I'd say it's a watchmaker's job. He also didn't bother hiding the origin of the original parts. What about the bio-core? He was shot in the head.
It was nothing like a quantum brain assembled in a lab. But it was a real bot with no inhibitions... and no protocols. For eight days, we had free dialog with this bot. We learned from it, and it learned from us. But then, as one of us predicted... the day would come when it would no longer need our help and would start learning on its own.
Are you jealous? Shut up! It doesn't make any sense. What? This skeleton, it can't be more than six months old.
He had a heart attack. Probably caused by a thrombosis from the burns. He's stable now, but, uh. his blood counts are extremely low. There's a risk of another thrombosis or embolism. And this time, he's not gonna make it.
Are you talking about the orphanage? What orphanage? St. Madeline's. Outside Brooklyn. He donates a lot of money to it.
- Shh. You're so determined to see the worst. That you can't see the good right under your nose. The world is full of surprises. Let it surprise you.
∆Female reporter: "what we thought was a complex virus causes instant death in some cases, while other people are immune. But within hours, everyone in the infected area is dead. Stay tuned for further developments. - The adapter seems to be in order. (playing guitar) But when I try to play harder. - it's not strong enough and it's too muffled.
If you let go of the mustache, we're the guardians of the future. Come in when you're ready. Stark! You shot a black condor and kicked it in the balls?
Let me call you back. No. No? Eliot Salad read your script. He really liked it.
I like a very clean flavor. so that any residue. clogs the pores in my mouth... desensitizing me to the flavor notes. When you drink coffee. it's hot at first... and you can only smell the aromatic oils. High-quality, lightly roasted coffee at this point is still very inexpressive... in many cases, even watery. Let it cool down.
I need to know you're still there. Have you completely forgotten me? I don't think Joan believed me when I told her you sent me that dream. She cares more about me now than when I was dead to the world. But I know you sent it and I know I need to follow it. Just give me some time, okay?
He took us prisoner and took us to Harrenhal. He killed Lommy. Who's Lommy? He was my friend. Polliver took my sword and stabbed him in the throat.
I left him at the camp and went away. When I came back, he was dead. He asked me to name a mountain after him. Mount Murray in the Congo. When the time came to claim the range by giving it a proper English name, I mean.....
So he introduced his own son as the child of his colleague who was killed at Kanpur. But some places underlined in Mrs. Blaze-Hamilton's Bible mention illegitimate children, which hints that she knew the truth. What is clear is that he made some sort of agreement with Benjamin Pickstock, the forester. He gave the boy to them to raise as their own. Why wouldn't he really be Pickstock's son?
A tribute to the past, maybe. A final touch that leaves no doubt. Making it more than just a legend passed down from father... to son... and then to great-great-great-grandson. So the affair with Ms. Danby? He only needed it to get access to the school.
And you invited her, so..... But it's true... We both went through his penis. And he's... - Dainty. - Normal. I've seen it. I jerked him off by accident once.
...placa de... Now, now, now. Here you go, sweetie. How did you eat all the meat and leave the vegetables? The stomach knows best what it needs.
It's a cure for belladonna poisoning. We haven't gotten the test results back yet. Doctor, please. There could be side effects, seizures, arrhythmias, even epilepsy. I'm not giving him anything until I see the test results.
- Of course you are. I'm a businessman. There can't be organized crime without law and order. I love this city, and I can see it's going to hell. But I'm not gonna let it go down without a fight.
To quote Grandmaster Flash, "You're high on that cocaine. You're as crazy as a cocaine train." When I get back from rehab, I'll probably say cocaine is terrible, but don't believe me. Cocaine is amazing! I give it a million stars!
Countermeasures! We had a countermeasure vehicle that followed the presidential motorcade. It jammed electronic guidance systems, radio-controlled detonators, and even diverted heat-seeking missiles away from the president. I don't understand. We can't stop the worm from attacking the target, so we have to give it a new target.
"When our paths parted." "I didn't even notice that moment. "I didn't realize it." "When and how I was left all alone." "Birthdays are such a thing. '..if you don't pay attention to it, it's not a problem. "But if your family doesn't care about it, that's a big problem.
Or maybe he broke out of the lab somehow. But I think I know how to stop it. The virus only cares about reproducing itself. Its artificial version does that unimpeded. So it no longer needs to mutate, it's stable and easier to defeat with a vaccine.
- No. What do you need it for? For dick pics and porn. Why do you need the phone from "The Wire" for that? I'm still on a family plan and I don't really understand how the cloud service works and I don't trust it.
You know what? Let me get this straight. You're not me. You can't cut a record, sell it alone. And the only reason Avery's producing your album is because I let him.
Looks like Gabriel's chip made him vulnerable to this kind of attack. So the memories are still in his head. Just need to, uh. plug them in. Yeah, and that's the mystery of the mind. Given time and the right incentive, sometimes it finds another way, sometimes it doesn't.
I'm sure you weren't even inside her when it happened. - I don't have an accomplice. - You show up on the rich boy's doorstep, "I've got a scratch on my head, I've been in a terrible accident." He lets you in the house and you sneak into his bunk and give it to him like you're his first.
I do. I hate cancer. I hate cancer so much that it's my life's work to destroy it. And I believe the best way to do that is to face it, look it in the eye and destroy the bastard.
- I made a compilation. - No! Especially for you. Sorry about that cupcake my brother threw at you. He can't eat gluten, so he got mad.
I'll give it away. Your fiancé bought a metal detector that he used to comb a thousand square meters around that merry-go-round. Guess where he found it. In a pigeon's nest. He had to fight off four pigeons.
April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people in my life. That's why I hired them. Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring civil servants. This office can really function without you. And soon it will have to.
He was a very decent man. The thing is, he died the day after he stopped here, and that's why I'm here. And I'm looking for a volume of poetry. He gave it to you, didn't he? He said he didn't need it anymore.
Richie and the boy head downstairs to our bags. In another five minutes, me and Miley will go downstairs. Everyone needs to put the hero function on "off." I've made a plan. Everybody follow it, or I'll shoot you.
Okay, what do we have for Chris? I got a Pawnee Town mug. And this cool jacket. No, I think that's Chris' jacket. Okay, so we know he's gonna love it.
Go out the window, and surrender to the glory of the Sontaran Empire. Shush! Doctor? I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I managed to let it slip away.
You were spotted two nights ago on the corner of S and Fifth. Four blocks from here. That's a bold assumption. Aggressive. I often see opponents start with a powerful move, but the rest of their game rarely matches it.
They're the best. They've spent centuries tidying this up because it's the only thing you can see under the burka. A child needs a burka. It's a baby? He needs botox.
Press Enter. WHO ARE YOU? Be polite. The computer is talking to you. Answer it.
Wherever I go, you follow me. Now I'm starting to realize this is my home. Besides. this world is foreign to me. It's better if you don't get used to it. It won't last long.
I'm sorry. You're a great guy, and you deserve better. - Look, you've already made your choice. I'm not happy about it, but your community service ends next week.
So I'm gonna need to, uh. Get a tetanus shot? Raise the bar? No, a condom. I'm going to have sex, and I want to give it to him good.
Last season of "Arrow." .... This town still needs saving. It doesn't need the Hood. It needs a hero.
- Throwing away college brochures. - Why? - What do you mean why? I'm not going to go there. I'll keep the kid, and when he's 16 or 17 and hates me, then I'll think about college.
- You're wrong. Jonathan designed it when he worked for Tony Gianopolous, so it's his property. - What do you want? - I don't want anything. I'm here to tell you that you can do whatever you want with Jonathan Sidwell, but if you use his algorithm, we'll sue you for every dime you made with it.
I can't get back on the bus again. Please show me some trust. Howard? This bike is amazing. It doesn't need gas, you don't need insurance, and you can park anywhere.
I'm bringing rhythm back into my life! She took it better than I thought she would. You feel that, Virginia? You really love that old grill, don't you? I do. Each burger is infused with the memorable odor of the hundreds of burgers that preceded it.
The best way to end the day is with a 10k run. You gave the bracelet to Paul? Did I track Paul? I felt sorry for the bracelet. I figured he could use a run.
He can't create entire societies like an ant, or weave a web and trap you... like a spider. To be honest, I don't know what he does. But I know what he can't do. His body is so hard, you can't crush him. One day, when you learn how strong you are, and no matter how hard it gets, you won't be crushed. You can stop worrying about the things you can't do and start dreaming about the things you can do.
- No. But it's a service dog. It gives you VIP access to places you normally can't get into, like an early visit to Barney's store. Keep going. And 20 bucks a day until we find him a permanent home.
If you found someone inside, I'd be very surprised. Thank you. We found a small bus. It's not running, but it can be fixed in a couple days. Father says he doesn't need it.
That's it. Am I doing something wrong? Believe me, if you were on the stage of the Albert Hall, the audience would stand up and applaud! I want the baby to be okay. I don't want to hurt him.
- All right. I'll take the dog. I'm sorry, but it's evidence in the case. That dog is a goddamn hero. And I'm not gonna let him sit around in the dust.
It's calcium. It's for the baby. For what? I said it's for the baby. It's good for him.
- Look at that! What? There's a nice-looking mushroom in that tree over there. It's a brown trout. I'm gonna give it a good kicking.
Come to think of it, there was another guy. When my dad retired. I arranged for him to have this room, he had it for a couple weeks. Please tell me you remember his name. No. No, but I remember he was a daredevil, and I remember giving him a great number.
It's easier if I do it. No, no, no. Mom. Tell me. You sprinkle a light layer and then you let it settle.
It's the deadliest and stupidest thing I've ever done. How long have you two known each other? Don't answer that. The army gave me a number of very specific skills. Then I was handed over to him as his assistant.
Because my diplomat brother thinks that's what my people need. People follow Ihab Rashid because he listens to their voices. How else can we lead them after you? Your tongue is your enemy. Give it free rein and it will betray you.
Colonel Byrd, did you find it? ... Wait, my desk reset again. Found it, found it, okay. According to the Yosemite Sam scroll. According to it, "the water spirits were responsible for similar weather anomalies over five katuns and nine years ago." Katunov?
We discussed it with Zuko, and I've thought it over. I have to do this. Don't expect us to sit still and let Zaheer just take you away. The world is barely in balance. It needs the Air Nation.
Mike, this is serious. We need that list. And we need it tomorrow. I'm on it. Good news, Louis. Not only did I file the contract under the wrong date and in the wrong section, but I added 10,000 almost identical ones.
Don't take this the wrong way, but does your dad have a suit that he wears to court? - Yeah, that was his lucky suit. - What happened? - He was found guilty. Great, then he won't be needing it.
Disgusting demon. Used to be good friends with Lamashtu. But now she can't stand him. I can imagine that. Take this child into your dark womb and give it eternal life.
They would hang upside down on the roofs of the latrines, then start climbing down there and scoop up handfuls of human excrement and toilet paper, and they would eat it. They would even dip into the cesspool themselves, which you can observe, and emerge covered in feces after a liquid lunch. According to the research paper, "The animal would scoop up the semi-liquid manure with one paw and then eat directly off the paw. When more people gathered near the latrine to watch this strange behavior, the sloth left the latrine and climbed the nearest tree." So he doesn't like being watched.
My portrait hasn't changed since I got here. I don't see any reason to change it now. Really? This one? That's the first one. It's 30 years old.
- October 31st. October 31st? You fire people on Halloween? I thought the holiday had gotten a little too mellow. I wanted to bring more fear back to it.
- Rohan with the monks. The ship is ready to sail. Why aren't you ready yet? - The children and I have talked it over and decided to stay. This is our city, and it's going to need all the help it can get.
We still know who the real hero is. You mean the rat rug on his head? Guys, do you think this is from a real mink? Well, hopefully it's got holes in it. Do you think he lets it run on the wheel at night?
I've always wanted wings. I'd like a pair of wings. Anything else, sir? Yes, please. I want an African owl. Spread its wings and fry it with potatoes.
It's a very difficult job. I'd say it's a watchmaker's job. He also didn't bother hiding the origin of the original parts. What about the bio-core? He was shot in the head.
It was nothing like a quantum brain assembled in a lab. But it was a real bot with no inhibitions... and no protocols. For eight days, we had free dialog with this bot. We learned from it, and it learned from us. But then, as one of us predicted... the day would come when it would no longer need our help and would start learning on its own.
Are you jealous? Shut up! It doesn't make any sense. What? This skeleton, it can't be more than six months old.
He had a heart attack. Probably caused by a thrombosis from the burns. He's stable now, but, uh. his blood counts are extremely low. There's a risk of another thrombosis or embolism. And this time, he's not gonna make it.
Are you talking about the orphanage? What orphanage? St. Madeline's. Outside Brooklyn. He donates a lot of money to it.
- Shh. You're so determined to see the worst. That you can't see the good right under your nose. The world is full of surprises. Let it surprise you.
∆Female reporter: "what we thought was a complex virus causes instant death in some cases, while other people are immune. But within hours, everyone in the infected area is dead. Stay tuned for further developments. - The adapter seems to be in order. (playing guitar) But when I try to play harder. - it's not strong enough and it's too muffled.
If you let go of the mustache, we're the guardians of the future. Come in when you're ready. Stark! You shot a black condor and kicked it in the balls?
Let me call you back. No. No? Eliot Salad read your script. He really liked it.
I like a very clean flavor. so that any residue. clogs the pores in my mouth... desensitizing me to the flavor notes. When you drink coffee. it's hot at first... and you can only smell the aromatic oils. High-quality, lightly roasted coffee at this point is still very inexpressive... in many cases, even watery. Let it cool down.
I need to know you're still there. Have you completely forgotten me? I don't think Joan believed me when I told her you sent me that dream. She cares more about me now than when I was dead to the world. But I know you sent it and I know I need to follow it. Just give me some time, okay?
He took us prisoner and took us to Harrenhal. He killed Lommy. Who's Lommy? He was my friend. Polliver took my sword and stabbed him in the throat.
I left him at the camp and went away. When I came back, he was dead. He asked me to name a mountain after him. Mount Murray in the Congo. When the time came to claim the range by giving it a proper English name, I mean.....
So he introduced his own son as the child of his colleague who was killed at Kanpur. But some places underlined in Mrs. Blaze-Hamilton's Bible mention illegitimate children, which hints that she knew the truth. What is clear is that he made some sort of agreement with Benjamin Pickstock, the forester. He gave the boy to them to raise as their own. Why wouldn't he really be Pickstock's son?
A tribute to the past, maybe. A final touch that leaves no doubt. Making it more than just a legend passed down from father... to son... and then to great-great-great-grandson. So the affair with Ms. Danby? He only needed it to get access to the school.
And you invited her, so..... But it's true... We both went through his penis. And he's... - Dainty. - Normal. I've seen it. I jerked him off by accident once.
...placa de... Now, now, now. Here you go, sweetie. How did you eat all the meat and leave the vegetables? The stomach knows best what it needs.
It's a cure for belladonna poisoning. We haven't gotten the test results back yet. Doctor, please. There could be side effects, seizures, arrhythmias, even epilepsy. I'm not giving him anything until I see the test results.
- Of course you are. I'm a businessman. There can't be organized crime without law and order. I love this city, and I can see it's going to hell. But I'm not gonna let it go down without a fight.
To quote Grandmaster Flash, "You're high on that cocaine. You're as crazy as a cocaine train." When I get back from rehab, I'll probably say cocaine is terrible, but don't believe me. Cocaine is amazing! I give it a million stars!
Countermeasures! We had a countermeasure vehicle that followed the presidential motorcade. It jammed electronic guidance systems, radio-controlled detonators, and even diverted heat-seeking missiles away from the president. I don't understand. We can't stop the worm from attacking the target, so we have to give it a new target.
"When our paths parted." "I didn't even notice that moment. "I didn't realize it." "When and how I was left all alone." "Birthdays are such a thing. '..if you don't pay attention to it, it's not a problem. "But if your family doesn't care about it, that's a big problem.
Or maybe he broke out of the lab somehow. But I think I know how to stop it. The virus only cares about reproducing itself. Its artificial version does that unimpeded. So it no longer needs to mutate, it's stable and easier to defeat with a vaccine.
- No. What do you need it for? For dick pics and porn. Why do you need the phone from "The Wire" for that? I'm still on a family plan and I don't really understand how the cloud service works and I don't trust it.
You know what? Let me get this straight. You're not me. You can't cut a record, sell it alone. And the only reason Avery's producing your album is because I let him.
Looks like Gabriel's chip made him vulnerable to this kind of attack. So the memories are still in his head. Just need to, uh. plug them in. Yeah, and that's the mystery of the mind. Given time and the right incentive, sometimes it finds another way, sometimes it doesn't.
I'm sure you weren't even inside her when it happened. - I don't have an accomplice. - You show up on the rich boy's doorstep, "I've got a scratch on my head, I've been in a terrible accident." He lets you in the house and you sneak into his bunk and give it to him like you're his first.
I do. I hate cancer. I hate cancer so much that it's my life's work to destroy it. And I believe the best way to do that is to face it, look it in the eye and destroy the bastard.
- I made a compilation. - No! Especially for you. Sorry about that cupcake my brother threw at you. He can't eat gluten, so he got mad.
I'll give it away. Your fiancé bought a metal detector that he used to comb a thousand square meters around that merry-go-round. Guess where he found it. In a pigeon's nest. He had to fight off four pigeons.
April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people in my life. That's why I hired them. Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring civil servants. This office can really function without you. And soon it will have to.
He was a very decent man. The thing is, he died the day after he stopped here, and that's why I'm here. And I'm looking for a volume of poetry. He gave it to you, didn't he? He said he didn't need it anymore.
Richie and the boy head downstairs to our bags. In another five minutes, me and Miley will go downstairs. Everyone needs to put the hero function on "off." I've made a plan. Everybody follow it, or I'll shoot you.
Okay, what do we have for Chris? I got a Pawnee Town mug. And this cool jacket. No, I think that's Chris' jacket. Okay, so we know he's gonna love it.
Go out the window, and surrender to the glory of the Sontaran Empire. Shush! Doctor? I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I managed to let it slip away.
You were spotted two nights ago on the corner of S and Fifth. Four blocks from here. That's a bold assumption. Aggressive. I often see opponents start with a powerful move, but the rest of their game rarely matches it.
They're the best. They've spent centuries tidying this up because it's the only thing you can see under the burka. A child needs a burka. It's a baby? He needs botox.
Press Enter. WHO ARE YOU? Be polite. The computer is talking to you. Answer it.
Wherever I go, you follow me. Now I'm starting to realize this is my home. Besides. this world is foreign to me. It's better if you don't get used to it. It won't last long.
I'm sorry. You're a great guy, and you deserve better. - Look, you've already made your choice. I'm not happy about it, but your community service ends next week.
So I'm gonna need to, uh. Get a tetanus shot? Raise the bar? No, a condom. I'm going to have sex, and I want to give it to him good.
Last season of "Arrow." .... This town still needs saving. It doesn't need the Hood. It needs a hero.
- Throwing away college brochures. - Why? - What do you mean why? I'm not going to go there. I'll keep the kid, and when he's 16 or 17 and hates me, then I'll think about college.
- You're wrong. Jonathan designed it when he worked for Tony Gianopolous, so it's his property. - What do you want? - I don't want anything. I'm here to tell you that you can do whatever you want with Jonathan Sidwell, but if you use his algorithm, we'll sue you for every dime you made with it.
I can't get back on the bus again. Please show me some trust. Howard? This bike is amazing. It doesn't need gas, you don't need insurance, and you can park anywhere.
I'm bringing rhythm back into my life! She took it better than I thought she would. You feel that, Virginia? You really love that old grill, don't you? I do. Each burger is infused with the memorable odor of the hundreds of burgers that preceded it.
The best way to end the day is with a 10k run. You gave the bracelet to Paul? Did I track Paul? I felt sorry for the bracelet. I figured he could use a run.
He can't create entire societies like an ant, or weave a web and trap you... like a spider. To be honest, I don't know what he does. But I know what he can't do. His body is so hard, you can't crush him. One day, when you learn how strong you are, and no matter how hard it gets, you won't be crushed. You can stop worrying about the things you can't do and start dreaming about the things you can do.
- No. But it's a service dog. It gives you VIP access to places you normally can't get into, like an early visit to Barney's store. Keep going. And 20 bucks a day until we find him a permanent home.
If you found someone inside, I'd be very surprised. Thank you. We found a small bus. It's not running, but it can be fixed in a couple days. Father says he doesn't need it.
That's it. Am I doing something wrong? Believe me, if you were on the stage of the Albert Hall, the audience would stand up and applaud! I want the baby to be okay. I don't want to hurt him.
- All right. I'll take the dog. I'm sorry, but it's evidence in the case. That dog is a goddamn hero. And I'm not gonna let him sit around in the dust.
It's calcium. It's for the baby. For what? I said it's for the baby. It's good for him.
- Look at that! What? There's a nice-looking mushroom in that tree over there. It's a brown trout. I'm gonna give it a good kicking.
Come to think of it, there was another guy. When my dad retired. I arranged for him to have this room, he had it for a couple weeks. Please tell me you remember his name. No. No, but I remember he was a daredevil, and I remember giving him a great number.
It's easier if I do it. No, no, no. Mom. Tell me. You sprinkle a light layer and then you let it settle.
It's the deadliest and stupidest thing I've ever done. How long have you two known each other? Don't answer that. The army gave me a number of very specific skills. Then I was handed over to him as his assistant.
Because my diplomat brother thinks that's what my people need. People follow Ihab Rashid because he listens to their voices. How else can we lead them after you? Your tongue is your enemy. Give it free rein and it will betray you.
Colonel Byrd, did you find it? ... Wait, my desk reset again. Found it, found it, okay. According to the Yosemite Sam scroll. According to it, "the water spirits were responsible for similar weather anomalies over five katuns and nine years ago." Katunov?
We discussed it with Zuko, and I've thought it over. I have to do this. Don't expect us to sit still and let Zaheer just take you away. The world is barely in balance. It needs the Air Nation.
Mike, this is serious. We need that list. And we need it tomorrow. I'm on it. Good news, Louis. Not only did I file the contract under the wrong date and in the wrong section, but I added 10,000 almost identical ones.
Don't take this the wrong way, but does your dad have a suit that he wears to court? - Yeah, that was his lucky suit. - What happened? - He was found guilty. Great, then he won't be needing it.
Disgusting demon. Used to be good friends with Lamashtu. But now she can't stand him. I can imagine that. Take this child into your dark womb and give it eternal life.
They would hang upside down on the roofs of the latrines, then start climbing down there and scoop up handfuls of human excrement and toilet paper, and they would eat it. They would even dip into the cesspool themselves, which you can observe, and emerge covered in feces after a liquid lunch. According to the research paper, "The animal would scoop up the semi-liquid manure with one paw and then eat directly off the paw. When more people gathered near the latrine to watch this strange behavior, the sloth left the latrine and climbed the nearest tree." So he doesn't like being watched.

- Get back! - No, Dinkum, there's wires! - It's phone and cable. - The electricity's on the other side. - No, that's not it! You cut the pole down, but the wires won't let it fall!
I don't understand what's going on with your car. Well, I got a very favorable offer. A trade-in. It's not really a car. Yeah, this pickup truck is a real upgrade. It's only five years old.
Beautiful. With a zero-turn radius? Uh-huh. Best suspension ever. It can't even handle Florida's sandy soil.
Just to get the cat back in? He could come back. To our apartment? He's been there for, like, six hours. Why would he go back there?
The scariest thing ever. - But it's not your turn. I didn't give you chlamydia. Yes, you did. Why else would you have gotten it?
You put in too much wood. The more wood, the bigger the fire. It needs air.
I hope he comes back unharmed. - Yeah, me too. - Hit him in the face, Feder! Lick his bicep! Lick it! Bite him! Lick his tan!
Yeah. I think I see it. What grade of purity is it? VS1. Some would give it a higher grade.
Stole it from my sister. Look, he likes it. Here. Don't be a pussy! Put some lipstick on him! - Why?
You want a headline when you save 3,000 jobs in your district. - 12 votes? - 12 votes. I can muster 10, maybe 11. It's so refreshing to work with someone who starts saddling a gift horse rather than looking in his mouth.
At the bank? That's silly. I personally don't care who owns the gold. I care about my city. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let it go to waste because of greed and greediness.
Patricia had just finished recording "Crimes of Passion" at Sound City I just met him one day and that was it - we just did it. I mean, I knew him for like 15 minutes before we recorded the song. He had a pit bull, and he brought this dog into the studio, and he was walking around, watching everything. And he threw him a basketball.
No. I've wanted to be a doctor my whole life. So you've spent your whole life wanting to help people physically while you're being mean to them? I'm not known for my approach to patients. No, you're known for it.
There was only one, and he wasn't little. Look, he was 14. She was his teacher. Do we really want a pedophile living in the neighborhood? Fuck, if he was 14 and he had a teacher who looked like that and didn't mind?
The beginning of the Meiji era... Edo capitulated... Remnants of the Shogun's defeated army flee north to Edo 1869 Second year of the Meiji Era If one day you face a wild bear one-on-one. Look him straight in the eye, and try to figure out which one of you is the enemy of the other.
And no one could argue with that, since no one but me remembered the fucking rules. Poor bastard. It's been hanging for three hours, hasn't it? I hate this, Nicky. We have a city code, but we haven't followed it in a long time.
You know, I've never done this before, but I'm definitely willing to give it a try. You're a pillow. Damn lawn. It absorbs, like, 800 gallons of water. Why not let it turn brown and die?
I'm just a sophomore. No. You're gonna bum around waiting for an older guy to boss you around? No way! You know, Jesus wrote in the Bible somewhere, "Don't hide your light under a vessel." You gotta let it shine!
- Swallow it. Just do it. - Oh, God. Swallow it. Let it go.
You have my address. What makes you think this guy stole my I.D.? Because I saw him. Your pass with his picture on it. Why would he need it?
To get the shipment out of Sudan. He cooperated. In exchange for killing the bill. No. In exchange for me not helping him succeed.
and I ran into my brother, who also had a secret. We made such a mess in the bedroom. - Michael. -Job? And I was excited to give him a lecture.
Sister Bernadette will fix it in no time. Her water's not broken yet. The breech seems to be the right shoulder. We'll have to do an external rotation of the fetus. We'll try to turn the baby around to make it easier to come out.
Helping me visualize a leg that doesn't hurt. That's it. Now, uh. look at that. Я... are you kidding me? We're rerouting your brain, reminding it what happened.
Oh, it's, uh... that's from the airship Norway, isn't it? It was the first airship to cross the North Pole. Pete and I took it, Artie, two years ago? Yeah, he's been in Egg Quarantine until now. It's time to find him a home.
Arlo did it? I'm not as magnanimous as Francis. I would destroy Henry Crowder over and over again, at any cost.... Over and over and over and over again. Once you make a decision, set your path, follow it all the way to the end, at least....
Ah, the investigation. I'm sure you both have a lot to do, and--and so do I. Yeah. (chuckles) Hey, how was your flight? Thanks to it, I'm here.
Yes? Why don't you hire me to do it? Because I need a job now more than ever. In fact, I've now been told in a job interview that there is no such thing as "gallery curator" anymore. Yeah, well, I think the world already has the three curators it needs.
Don't give me any reason to get rid of you. Looking for something? Shit. Tried to hide it so you'd find it later. I can't do anything with this unpretentious key, but I can change his fob.
Don't even think about it. There was a dog on 80th when I worked there. I still got teeth marks on my ankle. My dad said he'd drown him in the river if I didn't get rid of him. I'll take him in or at least find him a home or something.
- He certainly has plans for me. I brought tea. I just, uh. I can't drink it. Well, just so it doesn't go to waste.
Wait. If he wants to marry Jimmy, maybe we should see if he really wants Jimmy for a husband. That's a good idea. Jimmy should press him for sex. He'll like it for the first couple months, but then it'll just become routine.
Detoxing an addict is, in Tristan's parlance, "Killing Isolde." "You'll feel much better afterwards." Of course opium is unique, the euphoria of it is more powerful than health. To it I owe the finest hours of my life.
If something goes wrong and we crash, who will apologize first? First I'll check your pulse to make sure you're still alive, then I'll ask you to apologize. Besides the confusing road book, there was one more thing to worry about. This car was specially built for the World Rally Its weight is only 1200 kilograms and its brakes are custom made to help it stop.
With a note saying it contained ashes from Dresden. My father wanted his ashes returned to his homeland. Since he died in the fire along with Dresden in 1945, these ashes are basically.... - The old baron's ashes? Well, I know where it belongs.
I hear there's gonna be fireworks. Sometimes you act like you're 8 years old. That baby was the most precious thing to me. He was the most important thing in my life. I let him come between us.
- Liodes, don't insult the gods. - As long as I'm here, you fear nothing. Neither men nor the gods. - Artemis, watch over our queen Penelope and our island of Ithaca. Give him the stability and prosperity she had.
Talking like that gives me a headache. I'll talk to him. I'm not gonna let him get in your head. The law is the law, right? And cops serve it.
You made it easy for me to say yes. So...so we're okay. We're fine. Our marriage is fine? Why wouldn't it be?
What a beautiful gift. Do you know where he went? Ah, so many corridors, so many possibilities. You're going to tell me what you did to your rabbit. Did you hurt him?
As if she had been photographed with me, like a child with a parent. Then she started looking for me, changed her code to take care of me. She acted like a human being. But the world doesn't need a human to protect it. It needs a Machine.
Yeah, let me tell you something. This ass doesn't work anymore. This ass is closed. I don't want to be bait. Let the president take it up the ass. He might like it.
I'm sure he'd rather go to Disneyland. But before we jump to any conclusions, let's talk to Rivera about it, okay? I'll tell you one thing, nobody's gonna judge me in my own house. You know what? We owe it to Jesus to find out more about this camp before we say no to him.
So that's what you were trying to tell me before. Hope is stronger than loss. And the human spirit remains the most powerful weapon on this planet. It's a gift. If you keep it alive, it will lead you to victory.
How you doing? I'm as fit as a butcher's dog. And you've got a new car? Yes, you're the very first person to drive a Vauxhall Astra Tech Line. As this was the maiden voyage of our new car, we decided to give it a little send-off.
No. The best part was when the guy brought his hand spider in a jar. No! Yes, I'm serious! He said he felt sorry for him and couldn't leave him home alone.
People say that you can only get syphilis through sexual contact if there is tissue damage. That's not true! What if you get pregnant? You'll infect the newborn baby! He'll be given a death sentence before he's even given a name.
Let's go! I don't know where Oliver Queen is. But I know he's not here. This town is dying. And it needs someone to protect it and breathe new hope.
Excuse me, Mrs. Stanley. Phryne, where did you put my briefcase? I have papers to sign. I think it ended up in my room, Aunt P. Well, what's it doing in there?
To make Rainbow Bangla smarter, put a panda next to it. I agree with David. When you're in danger, you eat whatever you can get your hands on. If a rhino turns around and is like, "Sorry, no pizza until Ibiza," he's destined to die.
Slowly, Meatlug. Wait for him, wait for him. Ponytail. Nothing like a ponytail at the right time, huh, girl? All right, let's see how he likes it.
What's the matter with the marvelous karate angel? Barry! I've been thinking. Your karate act. It needs a professional director.
The label turned him down for a reason. He has crazy, pseudo-artistic fantasies about how this album should turn out. It's gonna suck! It's gonna suck! We're not gonna let it suck.
It's finally here. "Thundergun On Attack: Unrated Director's Cut." 13 extra minutes of movie. And it's unrated. They couldn't even give it a rating.
Let me guess-- fruit? I'm gonna make you a fruitarian after all, Mr. K. Fine. Hmm? Here's a little housewarming gift. He needs sunshine, and there's a gift card in there.
That scream will disorient our dragons. Oh, come on! The Death Scream was destroying all the islands. Looks like he tunneled under them and then made them collapse. But why would he do that?
Funny, when he was alive, he had no idea what a key role he'd play when he died. Yeah. It was called Operation Mincemeat. Now you can sign up for the service while you're alive, and it will monitor your Twitter and Facebook, and when you die, it will continue to post from you until the executor of your will, whom you yourself appoint, tells it to stop. - While you're alive, you can leave him feedback on how good he is.
20. Good news. We've got a few offers. This guy's got a handle on his finances. He wants to tear this house down, he just needs the land.
And an ant! There he is. He was an excellent artist, as you can see. And he describes exactly how he made the ant not move. He said, "I gave him a quarter of a pint (jill) of brandy,
They limit our movements on the map because it is impossible to travel faster than light. It's a universal speed limit. What does that mean? Imagine someone sitting here with a telescope. If I wanted a signal, a flash of light, to reach this event, let's say some alien from a distant galaxy watching us through a telescope, and then it, this influence, the light, to travel
Fire is not a toy. What a cute little guy. - Hey, get back! No, no, no, stop! He likes me!
Yeah. It's okay, baby. Welcome to Earth, blue friend. To avoid enslavement, I offer you the finest, most refreshing beverage Earth has to offer. He loves it!
Down the hall, turn left, and then you'll see a guard with a strange eye..... Shut up! My dark prince. Come to daddy. I don't think he likes you.
- Get back! - No, Dinkum, there's wires! - It's phone and cable. - The electricity's on the other side. - No, that's not it! You cut the pole down, but the wires won't let it fall!
I don't understand what's going on with your car. Well, I got a very favorable offer. A trade-in. It's not really a car. Yeah, this pickup truck is a real upgrade. It's only five years old.

And no one could argue with that, since no one but me remembered the fucking rules. Poor bastard. It's been hanging for three hours, hasn't it? I hate this, Nicky. We have a city code, but we haven't followed it in a long time.
You know, I've never done this before, but I'm definitely willing to give it a try. You're a pillow. Damn lawn. It absorbs, like, 800 gallons of water. Why not let it turn brown and die?
I'm just a sophomore. No. You're gonna bum around waiting for an older guy to boss you around? No way! You know, Jesus wrote in the Bible somewhere, "Don't hide your light under a vessel." You gotta let it shine!
- Swallow it. Just do it. - Oh, God. Swallow it. Let it go.
You have my address. What makes you think this guy stole my I.D.? Because I saw him. Your pass with his picture on it. Why would he need it?
To get the shipment out of Sudan. He cooperated. In exchange for killing the bill. No. In exchange for me not helping him succeed.
and I ran into my brother, who also had a secret. We made such a mess in the bedroom. - Michael. -Job? And I was excited to give him a lecture.
Sister Bernadette will fix it in no time. Her water's not broken yet. The breech seems to be the right shoulder. We'll have to do an external rotation of the fetus. We'll try to turn the baby around to make it easier to come out.
Helping me visualize a leg that doesn't hurt. That's it. Now, uh. look at that. Я... are you kidding me? We're rerouting your brain, reminding it what happened.
Oh, it's, uh... that's from the airship Norway, isn't it? It was the first airship to cross the North Pole. Pete and I took it, Artie, two years ago? Yeah, he's been in Egg Quarantine until now. It's time to find him a home.
Arlo did it? I'm not as magnanimous as Francis. I would destroy Henry Crowder over and over again, at any cost.... Over and over and over and over again. Once you make a decision, set your path, follow it all the way to the end, at least....
Ah, the investigation. I'm sure you both have a lot to do, and--and so do I. Yeah. (chuckles) Hey, how was your flight? Thanks to it, I'm here.
Yes? Why don't you hire me to do it? Because I need a job now more than ever. In fact, I've now been told in a job interview that there is no such thing as "gallery curator" anymore. Yeah, well, I think the world already has the three curators it needs.
Don't give me any reason to get rid of you. Looking for something? Shit. Tried to hide it so you'd find it later. I can't do anything with this unpretentious key, but I can change his fob.
Don't even think about it. There was a dog on 80th when I worked there. I still got teeth marks on my ankle. My dad said he'd drown him in the river if I didn't get rid of him. I'll take him in or at least find him a home or something.
- He certainly has plans for me. I brought tea. I just, uh. I can't drink it. Well, just so it doesn't go to waste.
Wait. If he wants to marry Jimmy, maybe we should see if he really wants Jimmy for a husband. That's a good idea. Jimmy should press him for sex. He'll like it for the first couple months, but then it'll just become routine.
Detoxing an addict is, in Tristan's parlance, "Killing Isolde." "You'll feel much better afterwards." Of course opium is unique, the euphoria of it is more powerful than health. To it I owe the finest hours of my life.
If something goes wrong and we crash, who will apologize first? First I'll check your pulse to make sure you're still alive, then I'll ask you to apologize. Besides the confusing road book, there was one more thing to worry about. This car was specially built for the World Rally Its weight is only 1200 kilograms and its brakes are custom made to help it stop.
With a note saying it contained ashes from Dresden. My father wanted his ashes returned to his homeland. Since he died in the fire along with Dresden in 1945, these ashes are basically.... - The old baron's ashes? Well, I know where it belongs.
I hear there's gonna be fireworks. Sometimes you act like you're 8 years old. That baby was the most precious thing to me. He was the most important thing in my life. I let him come between us.
- Liodes, don't insult the gods. - As long as I'm here, you fear nothing. Neither men nor the gods. - Artemis, watch over our queen Penelope and our island of Ithaca. Give him the stability and prosperity she had.
Talking like that gives me a headache. I'll talk to him. I'm not gonna let him get in your head. The law is the law, right? And cops serve it.
You made it easy for me to say yes. So...so we're okay. We're fine. Our marriage is fine? Why wouldn't it be?
What a beautiful gift. Do you know where he went? Ah, so many corridors, so many possibilities. You're going to tell me what you did to your rabbit. Did you hurt him?
As if she had been photographed with me, like a child with a parent. Then she started looking for me, changed her code to take care of me. She acted like a human being. But the world doesn't need a human to protect it. It needs a Machine.
Yeah, let me tell you something. This ass doesn't work anymore. This ass is closed. I don't want to be bait. Let the president take it up the ass. He might like it.
I'm sure he'd rather go to Disneyland. But before we jump to any conclusions, let's talk to Rivera about it, okay? I'll tell you one thing, nobody's gonna judge me in my own house. You know what? We owe it to Jesus to find out more about this camp before we say no to him.
So that's what you were trying to tell me before. Hope is stronger than loss. And the human spirit remains the most powerful weapon on this planet. It's a gift. If you keep it alive, it will lead you to victory.
How you doing? I'm as fit as a butcher's dog. And you've got a new car? Yes, you're the very first person to drive a Vauxhall Astra Tech Line. As this was the maiden voyage of our new car, we decided to give it a little send-off.
No. The best part was when the guy brought his hand spider in a jar. No! Yes, I'm serious! He said he felt sorry for him and couldn't leave him home alone.
People say that you can only get syphilis through sexual contact if there is tissue damage. That's not true! What if you get pregnant? You'll infect the newborn baby! He'll be given a death sentence before he's even given a name.
Let's go! I don't know where Oliver Queen is. But I know he's not here. This town is dying. And it needs someone to protect it and breathe new hope.
Excuse me, Mrs. Stanley. Phryne, where did you put my briefcase? I have papers to sign. I think it ended up in my room, Aunt P. Well, what's it doing in there?
To make Rainbow Bangla smarter, put a panda next to it. I agree with David. When you're in danger, you eat whatever you can get your hands on. If a rhino turns around and is like, "Sorry, no pizza until Ibiza," he's destined to die.
Slowly, Meatlug. Wait for him, wait for him. Ponytail. Nothing like a ponytail at the right time, huh, girl? All right, let's see how he likes it.
What's the matter with the marvelous karate angel? Barry! I've been thinking. Your karate act. It needs a professional director.
The label turned him down for a reason. He has crazy, pseudo-artistic fantasies about how this album should turn out. It's gonna suck! It's gonna suck! We're not gonna let it suck.
It's finally here. "Thundergun On Attack: Unrated Director's Cut." 13 extra minutes of movie. And it's unrated. They couldn't even give it a rating.
Let me guess-- fruit? I'm gonna make you a fruitarian after all, Mr. K. Fine. Hmm? Here's a little housewarming gift. He needs sunshine, and there's a gift card in there.
That scream will disorient our dragons. Oh, come on! The Death Scream was destroying all the islands. Looks like he tunneled under them and then made them collapse. But why would he do that?
Funny, when he was alive, he had no idea what a key role he'd play when he died. Yeah. It was called Operation Mincemeat. Now you can sign up for the service while you're alive, and it will monitor your Twitter and Facebook, and when you die, it will continue to post from you until the executor of your will, whom you yourself appoint, tells it to stop. - While you're alive, you can leave him feedback on how good he is.
20. Good news. We've got a few offers. This guy's got a handle on his finances. He wants to tear this house down, he just needs the land.
And an ant! There he is. He was an excellent artist, as you can see. And he describes exactly how he made the ant not move. He said, "I gave him a quarter of a pint (jill) of brandy,
They limit our movements on the map because it is impossible to travel faster than light. It's a universal speed limit. What does that mean? Imagine someone sitting here with a telescope. If I wanted a signal, a flash of light, to reach this event, let's say some alien from a distant galaxy watching us through a telescope, and then it, this influence, the light, to travel
Fire is not a toy. What a cute little guy. - Hey, get back! No, no, no, stop! He likes me!
Yeah. It's okay, baby. Welcome to Earth, blue friend. To avoid enslavement, I offer you the finest, most refreshing beverage Earth has to offer. He loves it!
Down the hall, turn left, and then you'll see a guard with a strange eye..... Shut up! My dark prince. Come to daddy. I don't think he likes you.
Die! It's not a magnum. I handled it with one hand. Jamarcus, how do you turn off the transmitter? The orb seems to be energizing it. Why don't we take the orb away?
Do you copy? Janek, listen to me. The ship is taking off! What's she carrying? Don't let it go.
Then we're going to the Cindy Sherman exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. And there's a new restaurant opening today. I'm sorry, Dan. Except for cindy sherman and her unflattering self-portraits, it looks like you've planned the perfect day. But he'll have to wait.
I thought he didn't know Mary at all. I have no remorse. An unexpected turn, Morse, no doubt. A family disgrace. Is it the child's fault that it was destined to be born?
I'm like a river in winter. - We'll go to your father's parting together. - Why? Because you're the one who set this whole thing up. I'm not the one who showed him that hamster in your panties.
Is something wrong? Yeah. I can't eat off a plate, so why don't you leave me some? Well, I don't know. Lois, he's our guest. Give it to him.
And there's red and red right there. Is that a common mistake? No. But I'll have to check the description of this ball. You know, it's about 100 years old.
That's why they needed us - to finish what they started. There's something wrong here. Oh, my God. Run! Don't let him aim!
Just before you were right. Do a lumbar puncture. Find out what's causing the meningitis. You said you wouldn't interfere with my diagnoses. And you said I couldn't help him.
Mommy missed you. Mr. Rossi, Mr. Django, I'm warning you. We didn't do anything-- ah, you meant them. Force of habit. The jury will disregard this stunt and not let it affect their verdict.
- Look, if she wants to come into my camp-- - Her camp. ...and stick her dick everywhere, let her. I'm not afraid of that dick. I'm gonna look him in the eye and say:
Cleaver, is that really necessary? Look, Michelle may have to testify, and she may face tougher questions than these. But she's just an actress, Cleaver. And she's not the one who bought that knife. But she's the one who, in the movie, stabs him between the ribs.
Right. Go on. He has magnetism. I think he was wearing my scarf. It suits him.
The U.S. Attorney has enough to indict. When things go smoothly with the Irish, I'll do my best to drop all charges against Manson. I read the letters. I'm not stabbing you right now just because the cartel deal has to go through. Leaving my club is one thing, but I can't let it die. It's part of me.
Do you need anything? No. But, uh. I've been thinking about the baby. I should probably get him diapers and clothes and stuff.
Did you kill Sean Brown? Yeah. He saw the gun. Turned and ran. I wanted to shoot sideways... but you can't miss and not lose face, so I shot him in the back.
For smoking a joint? Card counting. I mean, sure, I smoked a joint, but I got kicked out for card counting. What? It's my brain. I can't stop it from memorizing.
My sister's cell phone. What? Your all-inclusive week at Marbella for her phone. Does it work? Why wouldn't it work?
Proceed. The Court of Inquiry will meet in two days to consider the facts against your honor and to decide whether criminal charges should be brought. Why a court of inquiry? My guess: for the personal anonymity of the participants. - Okay, fine, but he still needs a judge.
Double cylinder. Is that a Triumph? Don't even look at it. Didn't you want to bore the cylinders? Looks like it could use a tune-up.
We can't do it without you. Lauren, you're my favorite too. I'm back with you and I'm never gonna get better! Hey, I just got home from work, so I haven't had a chance to change. You're working? That's what sports are all about. We have distractions, but it's hard not to get totally caught up in it.
You're confusing that with extreme stupidity. - It was a questionable call, but they teach it. What's the meeting about? - Keep going. By comparison, CBS had Times Square as the centerpiece when News Night had it at 3 min. 20 sec.
- Aah! How'd it go? I realized I didn't tell you what you needed to buy. Why? Everyone knows you can't give a baby solid food until he's four months old and sitting up.
And some people make this place for themselves. Grab your guns! This is not the time to be overzealous! But then the world around them changes, and the place they made disappears. Each dragon has its own unique abilities that give it its own special place in the world.
You're pathetic. I didn't lose your job for you, Wade. You did it yourself. You want to know what's pathetic? It's pathetic to kidnap a 12-year-old girl to make her one of those recruits you no longer have power over. I'll give you some advice, and only one chance to follow it-- let Sarah go.
Try saying no to Mrs. Dunwoody. She'll tell you how awful life is as a single mom. About how it tarnishes you for the rest of your life. And how happy you can make some full family. And most importantly, about how the best thing you can do for your child is to give them to other people who will give them everything you can't.
Anything to put him away. Restore justice for Amanda Tanner and Gideon Wallace, please. No. No? I am the law, and the law is me, and I have to follow it from time to time,
I almost got impaled on his horn, I'm telling you. - So what did you do? - I took out my folding knife, pulled out the blade, barely in time, I must say, and plunged it into his left eye. I'll never forget the blood-curdling scream he let out. - You stabbed him in the eye?
So, uh. I can hug a cactus now? ! No! You can't hug anything! But this poor cactus! Я... Я... He needs me!
before it shattered. - Well, it's better than ripping it off the ceiling, right? I agree. The light reflex is very interesting. It affects about a third of the population.
- Harman is awesome! I mean, he organized an omelet station for the staff, but that's . it's not a big deal. It's really cool. That pineapple was growing on a Hawaiian plantation yesterday. Don't trust him.
We talk on skype and try to correspond as much as we can, but only once we were "together" when we both watched and criticized Trimay. These songs are going to be timeless and why is there no zydeco here? *I can't stand this indecision* *Promise you'll never need it* *This is just one newspaper headline, should we believe it?
I didn't want to keep it in my house. My brother said he'd take it. You gave it to your brother? Last week. What did he need it for?
I promoted Pradeep because he deserved it. A small confession: I find the laws against prostitution in this country somewhat outdated. Sex is a commodity. Why shouldn't it have its own market then?
Is that your son? Uh-huh. Looks like that beech has seen some action. I'm selling it if you're interested. It's only 2 years old, 16GB RAM, Intel Core i7 processor and I can personally guarantee it's spent less than 20 minutes on an astronaut's penis.
But I come to work, I watch the news every day..... It feels like the world is falling apart. How can I give life to a child in this horror? The world's always falling apart, brother, since the beginning of time. But having kids, having a family, that's what keeps it from falling apart.
That Magic Screen for Adults really put you in a better mood. Oh, yeah! You can watch it like this... or like this. any way you want or don't want... and there's a cool Revival game called "Virtual Stapler." Sounds like a real stapler and it never runs out of paper clips unless you tell it to.
Help us track them. The green color is the same color we found on the cockpit door. What? You're saying someone damaged the plane with my tools? No, we're guessing maybe you damaged it.
Die! It's not a magnum. I handled it with one hand. Jamarcus, how do you turn off the transmitter? The orb seems to be energizing it. Why don't we take the orb away?

For the next six hours, he was still alive. Why wait? I mean, if the guy wanted to rob Hixton, why not just take him home and clean out his safe? And then there's Hixton's gun. Why would he need it and where'd he get it?

All yours, Bart Simpson. Hmm. Hmm! Marge, do you want collector plates from Thicker Than Water? Homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. It's 25 years old.
Baked ham with pineapple, musk gourd, stuffed chayote, carrots from Aunt Odette's recipe. How's the steak, Dad? It's kind of pink. It's supposed to be. I know how you like it. Cut off the horns, warm his ass up a little, and put it on a plate.
I know, I only look like a nerd. The water in the cabin is supersaturated with salt and kept at the same temperature as the human body, so that the person inside floats in complete silence and darkness, separated from all worldly stimuli. In the movie The Other Hypostases, William Hurt entered the cabin naked. To return himself to a primitive disembodied state and free his mind, allowing it to drift into other realms.
Gelatin Peace Dance You may be in gelatinous, but not even Mochi Phantom could perform such intricate moves Said the clerk. Behold, the dance of peace. A dance so intricate, I can barely follow it.
Wind. A strong wind is a storm. I'm wondering what. Is our barn going to collapse? It won't.
That's a nice left twist, all right? Come on, baby! You can do it! Come on, Danny! Come on, baby, give it to him.
Near Tunisia, a year ago. Perfectly preserved in a tomb. You have no idea what you've really messed with. A fire elemental can't be contained once it's released. You can't just whistle at it like a dog.
Now I massage him for 40 to 50 minutes. It's a difficult job for the students. Very often, the octopus looks like rubber. It has no odor. We massage it to give it softness.
Well, you could try to put him on his hind limbs like a bird, but in this case you can see how badly his balance is off when walking. He looks very unsteady, and worse, his tail is actually dragging on the ground. Now let's get him on all fours. The webbing on the wings, which are attached to the hind limbs, is noticeably in the way. You can see that he's not very comfortable on the ground.
Quetzalcoatl was doing a quadropedal takeoff. But how did he actually fly? There's a real way to find out. The modern glider is about the same size as a giant pterosaur, has the same thin and narrow wings, and is also extremely light. This flying machine is very lightweight, it doesn't even need an engine.

It was all just to get back at Stackhouse. You lied so I'd help you escape. Well, I had a place to go back to. If you're gonna shoot me, shoot me. I had a plan, too, and I'm gonna follow it.
It wouldn't cost me anything, but I can't make exceptions just because you're my friend. But I'm doing a good job. Maybe not as much as you used to, but remember, I came up with the slogan for Coca-Cola. Hell, you're millionaires because of it!
It was Benjamin's time. He had succeeded. However, the battle has just begun. As the sperm whale tries to free himself, they swim up to throw another harpoon. They have to stop it from diving in and dragging the boat behind them.
"Look, a golden calf..." "Looks like an exploding badger." "Looks like seven weasels." "...stacked together." "It's a calf, or a dog, or-- His name is Kenny." "Let us worship him."
Yeah. The problem is, that's not entirely true. At heart, we all follow the rules like sheep following the flock. We don't break the proTocol. We obey it to a "T" (to the middle).
But he ended up in the hospital, where a new CT scanner was lucky enough to find a ruptured diaphragm. Cut it off, please. Thank you. (chuckles) Plus, there were a couple of excellent surgeons here who could help him.
Not before. What good would that do us? There's a gas station on Lowell Street. About eight kilometers from Discovery Park. It was right on his way.
People in the electric chair are more relaxed. He'll be fine. My dad would throw me in the car, lock the doors, and not even look back. Exactly, you have such a great relationship with your father. He called his belt "the enforcer." He never used it.

Each half of the room worked together to control the racket on their side of the screen. If a person held the red side on their remote, the computer sensor picked up the signal and the racket on the screen moved down. If there was a green signal, it moved up. But they had to act in concert. During the game, when the ball moves back and forth, if it goes down and heads along that trajectory, some people have to press the red button to keep it from moving to the top all the time.
Yes, remote-controlled hummingbirds that could record outdoor conversations. I led the project. And after the project failed because of interference in a crucial test. I pushed it forward anyway. I couldn't let it go to waste.
Then he was stricken with ALS. You know what it did to him? First his arms went away, then his legs, his speech, even his breathing. He couldn't control them. His mind knew what he needed, but his body.....
Got it. Also. didn't you see his face? According to the police. you were standing very close to each other. I didn't, he took my gun. And you let him?
See this? What a busty lady! No, look. The pendant around his neck. I mean. the killer took it off and put it in his hands.
There is a hypothesis that they may have had a sense of compassion. similar to the way we treat each other. In the Georgian town of Dmanisi, fossils have been found that partly confirm this. They found the remains of a man who had lost all of his teeth, due to infection or old age or both, and this man was so sick that someone had to help him. Other members of his group would have to help him, for example, to chew his food in order for him to survive.
And sometimes I like myself more as a person than you do. You want to know what kind of man I am? Strict, but fair. I tell it like I see it. And I see a kid who asked to be given a chance and who still hasn't decided if he wants it or not.
A man gets off the train. Walks up to Nucky Thompson, puts a bullet in him. Right here. Just 'cause I told him to. - What do you think about that? -I think the world's about to find out what kind of man it's gonna have to deal with.
You loved her, but you never proposed to her. She would have said no! This is where all your worries, all your fears rise! Your greatest fear is her rejection. Don't let it destroy us all.
There won't be anyone. One can, still, take it easy, as great pioneers are often underestimated at first. During this epic ride, I've been referring to it as the TGV12, or a sports train. But I don't think that's right. I don't think that gives it the credit it deserves.

I just bought another painting. Come on. Your house is gorgeous. I know it is. But it's gonna need some serious cleaning after all this rabble's gone.
What's wrong? What is it? I feel like the baby's kicking. That's impossible. He's only eight weeks old.
You know what happened to my household last night. Please come inside. So, uh. What the hell are you guys playing at? Only that, uh. given what's happened to the pub, you realize it needs rebuilding and financial investment.
It's okay. We'll talk about it. Bösiger's looking for you. Wow, a rabbit. - Can I give him a piece?
Just a second. I'm conducting an experiment. With the dice from Dungeons & Dragons? Yes. From now on, I've decided to make all small decisions by rolling dice, thereby freeing my mind to do what it does best: enlighten and amaze.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I want this in return. What the hell is that? It's my friend Tony's groin. He e-mailed me a picture of it last night. He had a little valve problem last year, and his doctor replaced a catheter through his groin.

This meant that mysterious electrical currents could pass through some things and could not through others. This led Gray to divide the world into two types of substances. He called them insulators and conductors. Insulators held an electric charge in them and did not allow it to move - such, for example, are silk or hair, glass and resin.
I suggest. The consumer is impatient. The consumer is not nice. The consumer wants satisfaction here and now. He'll want more tomorrow.
He abandoned our marriage a few years ago. My husband was a drug addict. - Heroin? - Adrenaline. He never had enough.
- Calm down, Luke. - Daddy's dick is in a bad mood. - Hey, lady, give it to him. - Maybe later? Hey, buddy, give it to him!
I don't like him. -You need fresh air. -I have melanoma. -I put sunscreen on you. -I don't trust him.
For the next six hours, he was still alive. Why wait? I mean, if the guy wanted to rob Hixton, why not just take him home and clean out his safe? And then there's Hixton's gun. Why would he need it and where'd he get it?

All yours, Bart Simpson. Hmm. Hmm! Marge, do you want collector plates from Thicker Than Water? Homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. It's 25 years old.
Baked ham with pineapple, musk gourd, stuffed chayote, carrots from Aunt Odette's recipe. How's the steak, Dad? It's kind of pink. It's supposed to be. I know how you like it. Cut off the horns, warm his ass up a little, and put it on a plate.
I know, I only look like a nerd. The water in the cabin is supersaturated with salt and kept at the same temperature as the human body, so that the person inside floats in complete silence and darkness, separated from all worldly stimuli. In the movie The Other Hypostases, William Hurt entered the cabin naked. To return himself to a primitive disembodied state and free his mind, allowing it to drift into other realms.
Gelatin Peace Dance You may be in gelatinous, but not even Mochi Phantom could perform such intricate moves Said the clerk. Behold, the dance of peace. A dance so intricate, I can barely follow it.
Wind. A strong wind is a storm. I'm wondering what. Is our barn going to collapse? It won't.
That's a nice left twist, all right? Come on, baby! You can do it! Come on, Danny! Come on, baby, give it to him.
Near Tunisia, a year ago. Perfectly preserved in a tomb. You have no idea what you've really messed with. A fire elemental can't be contained once it's released. You can't just whistle at it like a dog.
Now I massage him for 40 to 50 minutes. It's a difficult job for the students. Very often, the octopus looks like rubber. It has no odor. We massage it to give it softness.
Well, you could try to put him on his hind limbs like a bird, but in this case you can see how badly his balance is off when walking. He looks very unsteady, and worse, his tail is actually dragging on the ground. Now let's get him on all fours. The webbing on the wings, which are attached to the hind limbs, is noticeably in the way. You can see that he's not very comfortable on the ground.
Quetzalcoatl was doing a quadropedal takeoff. But how did he actually fly? There's a real way to find out. The modern glider is about the same size as a giant pterosaur, has the same thin and narrow wings, and is also extremely light. This flying machine is very lightweight, it doesn't even need an engine.

It was all just to get back at Stackhouse. You lied so I'd help you escape. Well, I had a place to go back to. If you're gonna shoot me, shoot me. I had a plan, too, and I'm gonna follow it.
It wouldn't cost me anything, but I can't make exceptions just because you're my friend. But I'm doing a good job. Maybe not as much as you used to, but remember, I came up with the slogan for Coca-Cola. Hell, you're millionaires because of it!
It was Benjamin's time. He had succeeded. However, the battle has just begun. As the sperm whale tries to free himself, they swim up to throw another harpoon. They have to stop it from diving in and dragging the boat behind them.
"Look, a golden calf..." "Looks like an exploding badger." "Looks like seven weasels." "...stacked together." "It's a calf, or a dog, or-- His name is Kenny." "Let us worship him."
Yeah. The problem is, that's not entirely true. At heart, we all follow the rules like sheep following the flock. We don't break the proTocol. We obey it to a "T" (to the middle).
But he ended up in the hospital, where a new CT scanner was lucky enough to find a ruptured diaphragm. Cut it off, please. Thank you. (chuckles) Plus, there were a couple of excellent surgeons here who could help him.
Not before. What good would that do us? There's a gas station on Lowell Street. About eight kilometers from Discovery Park. It was right on his way.
People in the electric chair are more relaxed. He'll be fine. My dad would throw me in the car, lock the doors, and not even look back. Exactly, you have such a great relationship with your father. He called his belt "the enforcer." He never used it.

Each half of the room worked together to control the racket on their side of the screen.

Wait! You really think there's a real, loaded gun in the theater? - What kind of gun is that? - A starter's pistol, for racing. Been there a while, but it shouldn't be in the theater, you need a license.
Uh, hello. Yes, it's me. Official duty. It's Dragneu. Give it to him and seal it.
Otherwise, he would have attacked you. You have to be very careful of lone wolves. Get in there. Go on. Throw it to him.

Oh no, he just needs to blow off a little steam. What's it like for the battery? ! Mom, like it or not, you made a commitment, and maybe it doesn't mean anything to you anymore, but you owe it to this family to save your marriage - and give it another try.
That's right. Of course you did. No, I didn't catch him. He killed three of my men. I gave him an elephant tranquilizer, and he didn't give a shit.
- Right. - And he had special wires that he could... - Special wires. - ... attach to a flower, and it kind of shakes and stuff, because even though you can't see it, flowers recognize bad energy. If you shake the flower, it doesn't like it.

Sometimes little fish swim in there. Bye, little fish. You see what I have to deal with? He still hasn't picked a defense style. He better hurry up, or he's gonna have to see this for the rest of his life.
And only heard in my old lady's fairy tales. Let me know when you're in the mood for a laugh. I've got some great jokes. She doesn't want to give birth today because of my ex-wife. Doesn't want them to have the same birthday. I'm afraid the baby doesn't ask when it's due.
Except, can I borrow his cell phone? You want his cell phone? Well, actually, it's his cell phone. I just-- He doesn't need it anymore.
Push. Ryan, do a good deed. There's a pool net in the back of my truck. It's a long pole with a frame and a net on the end. Could you take it and shove it up his ass?
The passengers of this train have a one-way ticket to the future. The train begins to speed up, going faster and faster. Soon it starts circling the Earth, over and over again. To reach the speed of light, you have to spin around the Earth really fast - seven times a second. But no matter how fast the train can go, it will not reach the speed of light because the laws of physics will not allow it.
"there is a very deep and unexpected connection. between nature's mysterious capacity for self-organization and the chaotic consequences of the butterfly effect. "Hewring, Selousov, Way, and Horenz all discovered different facets of this connection, one truly universal idea. They discovered that the world around us can be, at a deep level, at its very core, unpredictable. But the same causes that make it unpredictable also allow it to create patterns and structures.
Watch when she's done talking on the phone. You have to tell her real quick. It's like you're ripping off a Band-Aid. Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't do that. I usually let it soften in warm water and fall off on its own--
It's too much for one day. Why don't we just let the kid be black today? Here, Ted. Seize the moment! I think you need a Salvador Dali to capture this moment, but I'm not letting it slip away.
Are you ready to crawl contentedly under the covers and fall asleep? Are you really sure you can reactivate the holographic crystal with synchronized light jolts? No, not reactivate it. Speak to it in its language. Show it who's in charge.
Okay. 5 minutes, no walls. What did you expect to get out of our couple's reunion with noah? Noah was always a very popular, inquisitive guy who also realized that God had a plan for him, And he would follow it step by step.
Don't feel bad. On Elephant Day my workers tricked me by painting my face and I walked around with my pockets out of my pants. It was a lot of fun until I pulled out a gun. Why would Rajiv make such a celebration? And why would Asha play along with him?
And the Swedes are paying for it? Very much so. I told you they don't steal from us. You hunted a deer? I took it with my own hands and twisted its neck.
It is considered one of the few American supercars. Its name alone strikes fear into the heart. "SRT" stands for "street and racing technology", and the "10" means there are 10 cylinders under that enormous hood. The Viper is the most American car I've ever driven. It's all about power, absolutely no refinement, and it doesn't care what the rest of the world thinks.

Wow. And Pauline loves him. She'll figure it out. I invited him for an aperitif. You did? Is he happy here?

How do you know about Jedi? You're right. He was the first to do a trick; I think it involved decapitating a goose. - You're right. И... he ripped its head off to impress the pharaoh, and it's described in an ancient scroll.
Ha Ni! How old is this table? When you first made cold noodles. It's older than me. Bingo! It's 21 years old! And not a scratch!
Another bacterium had a simpler, fully functioning mechanism. This one was missing 40 of its 50 parts, which is 80%, and it functioned perfectly. So the mildest thing you can say about these claims, about minimal complexity of structure, key to the theory of Intelligent Design, is that they're wrong - they're just wrong, on the basis of science. Miller has shown that the flagellum was not an organ too complex to have emerged through evolution. It didn't need an Intelligent Designer.

But no matter how fast the train can go, it will not reach the speed of light because the laws of physics will not allow it.
"there is a very deep and unexpected connection. between nature's mysterious capacity for self-organization and the chaotic consequences of the butterfly effect. "Hewring, Selousov, Way, and Horenz all discovered different facets of this connection, one truly universal idea. They discovered that the world around us can be, at a deep level, at its very core, unpredictable. But the same causes that make it unpredictable also allow it to create patterns and structures.
Watch when she's done talking on the phone. You have to tell her real quick. It's like you're ripping off a Band-Aid. Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't do that. I usually let it soften in warm water and fall off on its own--
It's too much for one day. Why don't we just let the kid be black today? Here, Ted. Seize the moment! I think you need a Salvador Dali to capture this moment, but I'm not letting it slip away.
Are you ready to crawl contentedly under the covers and fall asleep? Are you really sure you can reactivate the holographic crystal with synchronized light jolts? No, not reactivate it. Speak to it in its language. Show it who's in charge.
Okay. 5 minutes, no walls. What did you expect to get out of our couple's reunion with noah? Noah was always a very popular, inquisitive guy who also realized that God had a plan for him, And he would follow it step by step.
Don't feel bad. On Elephant Day my workers tricked me by painting my face and I walked around with my pockets out of my pants. It was a lot of fun until I pulled out a gun. Why would Rajiv make such a celebration? And why would Asha play along with him?
And the Swedes are paying for it? Very much so. I told you they don't steal from us. You hunted a deer? I took it with my own hands and twisted its neck.
It is considered one of the few American supercars. Its name alone strikes fear into the heart. "SRT" stands for "street and racing technology", and the "10" means there are 10 cylinders under that enormous hood. The Viper is the most American car I've ever driven. It's all about power, absolutely no refinement, and it doesn't care what the rest of the world thinks.
Your eloquence has enchanted the Old Bailey, Mr Garrow. It is unfortunate that you will have to remain silent at your own trial. What business have you with me? I may be against you, but I admire you. Like you, I'm-- ..part of this world, though I don't belong to it.
Wow. And Pauline loves him. She'll figure it out. I invited him for an aperitif. You did? Is he happy here?
I'm saved!", I confess how awful my life has been so far. I was walking by the closet and heard a squeak. It's horrible. What is he going to eat? He needs live food.
How do you know about Jedi? You're right. He was the first to do a trick; I think it involved decapitating a goose. - You're right. И... he ripped its head off to impress the pharaoh, and it's described in an ancient scroll.
Ha Ni! How old is this table? When you first made cold noodles. It's older than me. Bingo! It's 21 years old! And not a scratch!
Another bacterium had a simpler, fully functioning mechanism. This one was missing 40 of its 50 parts, which is 80%, and it functioned perfectly. So the mildest thing you can say about these claims, about minimal complexity of structure, key to the theory of Intelligent Design, is that they're wrong - they're just wrong, on the basis of science. Miller has shown that the flagellum was not an organ too complex to have emerged through evolution. It didn't need an Intelligent Designer.
I've already cut them up. We ate too much of them. This watermelon is very sweet. Like honey! Watermelon should taste like watermelon. Why should it taste like honey?
It doesn't matter, Terranuova! And this is my nephew! He has cirrhosis of the liver. How young he is! ... to devote your life to him?
I'm someone who might be able to help you with your problem. You know, you don't seem to be in the best shape of your life right now. Just tell me about your son, Jack. He's 6 years old, and he has a congenital heart defect. And he's getting worse. He's--
Afraid I'm gonna use the stapler to break through? Water's boiling. And look for some towels. In a confined space, bypassing a cell phone jammer comes down to a game of "whose signal is stronger." An interference generator transmits a strong signal over a wide frequency band, but it can't compete with a kilometer-long local-network mesh network, which acts as one big antenna.
So why does it have that shape? ! I'm not afraid to be a prude, but when designing chairs, I deliberately use archetypes. Let's say you want to design a chair. Where do you start? How do you make it unique and different from so many others?
Where is he? - I see you're back to being the hero of the last two seconds. - Yeah, dad. It was crazy. When Doug threw the ball, I knew exactly where it was going to go.
Do you feel it? Feel what? A high ratio of positive to negative ions. Unfriendly air. But you can't let it beat you.
Reese? How do we disprove William's alibi? Tidwell looks good in that suit. I'm just saying, you know, nice suit. It looks good on him.
Have I ever succumbed to that temptation? No, I'm not that kind of politician. "DePizot, make me a hot dog real quick. It's nothing personal, little lady, the next one's yours. I have my own moral code and I always follow it.
And if he stops screaming, it's not because the pain has lessened. His throat, pharynx and vocal cords are torn and altered. He literally can't make a sound. Now his pituitary gland has to work harder than usual, flooding his body with endorphins to ease the pain, but then it stops working too. Anyone else would have died of shock long ago, but his essence won't let him.
Dad, I know you don't believe in me, but I need them to believe in me. Are you sure I'm the one who doesn't believe in you, Jack? Is one of these yours? The machine jammed. It just needed a little push.
Have you seen Phil, or at least the blood trail that leads to Phil? He's not here. I'm stuck. Maybe the piece of meat isn't absorbing enough nutrients. I guess I could try to make a mouth on it.
We need to drive him upstairs and capture him. David Lodge? You still have the truck? So what now? It's warm, he likes it warm.
This is our interpreter. That's who makes up the legend of who we are and why we do things this way and not that way. It's also the hemisphere that makes mistakes. The advantage of the right hemisphere is that it's illogical, it doesn't pick and choose what's worth paying attention to. it draws conclusions that defy logic. Your intuition is a gift from the "silent loser". I'll get him tickets to a cool baseball game.
- Hey, hey! I'm calling the cops! - Oh, he's stuck. - I'm calling the cops! Get out of there! The lock on the cash register is designed to keep it from opening.
I want to know when he started shooting at you. Yes? We just said something about--about taking the car. We didn't actually take it. And he pulled a gun. I'm surprised you didn't take it from him and shove it down his throat.
That's exactly what Hunt explicitly forbade. If she poses for me and you accompany her. I'll protect you from your desires, and she'll protect me from mine. I don't know. Now that Millais is off the list, Ruskin needs a new protégé. I must write a masterpiece as soon as possible and shove it under his nose.
- I noticed. Thank you. What exactly is so good about chocolate? The substance itself or the crunch of your teeth on it? I prefer to let it melt slowly on my tongue.
Oh, no! It's okay, cry. Here, take another box. Here, put a cooler bag on it, that's-- Don't let it go to waste.
So, technically, he's the one staring at me. I'm sorry. He's from a small town. He's never seen a tough businessman like you before. Well, tell him to act more professional in the future.
Listen. I've heard the instructions and now go in peace. Cookie. What, uh. was it nice to take it out on the kid? As if he didn't have enough of his own messed up head.
The way we left things... I didn't like it. The thing is, I came home today, and I was going to do what I always do. Write in my journal. I've always done that since my mom gave me my first journal when I was 10. To him I can tell him everything I feel.
Does any of this say "pee"? Not that I know of. Ancient metalworkers turned iron into steel by accident. Unaware of anything, they carburized iron by heating it with charcoal, thus turning it into low grade steel. But they believed that this was a way of tempering the molten metal, allowing it to harden.
- No. It's fine. It's okay. Intervention, intervention. He's got a weird fetish for old women and he can't resist it.
Come on in. Get out. Get it out of here. He should be outside. He's not allowed in the waiting room.
- So, uh. Nicky Phillips? - Right here. You're taking that flower with you? Yeah, I'll transplant it. It needs to live in a deciduous forest. - Not on our patio. - It's cool.
It's a problem I've tried to solve many times - without success. - Keeping the human brain alive? It's very difficult. You see, it's not enough to just give it blood and oxygen.
The FBI found that 80% of mortgage fraud was initiated by lenders, not borrowers. You know, most of the anger was, uh. was directed at the borrowers. But who you should be furious at is the CEOs who became fabulously wealthy by following a strategy based on fraud. The Wall Street people and their friends at the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury and in Washington, in the Capitol, that's where the evil was; and if the people wanted to vent their anger, they had to vent it against these people.
The sharp peaks of the mountains rise above a continuous green cover. This is one of the wettest regions on the planet. It is here that an unusual and very ancient amphibian lives. The Guyana harlequin is only 2.5 centimeters long, slightly larger than a postage stamp. The harlequin's special sticky legs help it climb to the tops of tall trees.
Wait a minute! I've got a new trick! What is it? We light Lucy on fire and launch her at the enemy! And his name:
What are you guys so serious? Relax a little, hehehehehe You're Count Vampiro's guests Look at his cloak! It's waving all by itself! Remember, don't look him in the eye!
Haven't you heard? He escaped from the zoo this morning. Is there a zoo here? Uh, no, I'm just.... whatever. Whatever it is, I'm not gonna let him get to you.
Keats! Pardon me, miss. But if the princess has already left the dwarf, I mean, can't we keep his love monologue? We'll have to rewrite it. We'll find another place for it.
Here, child. Wear it today. It will protect you. Solomon. He needs you.
It doesn't matter, Terranuova! And this is my nephew! He has cirrhosis of the liver. How young he is! ... to devote your life to him?

This is our last chance. If you haven't changed your mind, now's the time. All right. Operation Mardonius Port Oslo, April 27, 1943 Get that damn dog out of here and give him something to eat!
Look at me! That's it, breathe! It's gonna be okay. Can you hear me? When our people came here from Romania, this thing hid among them. They built this fort away from the humans. - And while we give it food.
If you want him back, you have to get rid of her. Yeah, well, how do I do that? Wait, that's not right. How do I do it? The same way you've always done it. Whenever you wanted a guy, you did one of 50 different ways to make the girl disappear. You'd take a matchbook from a hotel, write your number on it and slip it in his pocket,
I'm here because you need help. So it's either the top or I'm leaving. All right. You take the top, I'll push. Don't let it slip out of your girly hands and crush me.
My dick is fucking fantastic! Yeah, it's a fantastic dick! Congratulations! So how much longer do you have to wait? Well, it still needs to be fully formed, but it's pretty soon.
Well, he's still got a little bit of shaping to do, but he'll be here soon enough. Let me feel how it fits in your hand. No, don't open it! Oh, no! Don't let him escape from the lab!
So you've killed people? How many? Too many. Because all people, even you, reach some point in life when they take responsibility for the world they live in, and they have to make a decision whether to endure it or confront it, change it.
So all we have to do is filter the B6 out of the blood. Prep him for plasmapheresis. Just because he didn't salute doesn't mean he can't do it. Please find where that voice is coming from. And tell him to get out of my head.
Found some articles about a local miracle. - Yeah? Yeah. In 1985, there was an empty field outside of town. 6 months later, a huge oak tree appears. They say it looks about 100 years old.
At first, everything. But then, uh. they move on to the long-eared pig. - To what? - He means human meat. I'll remember that phrase. The hunger builds until they can't resist it anymore,
In previous episodes. I'm going to have a baby. I'm going to have a baby. But I won't be able to be a father.
Kulishov A-85 is a beautiful flying machine. Like a beautiful bird. It's almost flawless in its design. Almost flawless? It needs a man to fly.
Ah, a time-honored example. When you look at a drawing, your brain perceives then a duck, then a rabbit, then a duck again. But it always comes back to the duck. Even though it's really neither. But this illustrates the brain's attempts to interpret a random sensory stream and give it meaning.
Okay, it's coming up. Tell me when it's eighty-four and a half. Blue. The human brain is like a computer. Green. It needs electricity to work. But after death, the body doesn't produce it.
I'm not really interested in American history. It's mostly lies, just like high school gossip. Lies. I'm gonna give you some advice. You don't have to follow it, but I'll tell you anyway.
I need Dell or just a pair of hands. What is that, a jumpsuit? - They want to start living a healthy lifestyle. - Liquefying fat? It doesn't liquefy fat, but it helps it break down.
How's it going, Dad? Words can't describe it, Chris. Going around the Earth at eight kilometers per second, watching the sun rise over the sea in Japan. it's indescribable. Plus, I had plenty of time to chase the baldy - it's pretty great in space, except after a while it feels like a Christmas toy with snow falling. Peter, instead of wasting your free gasoline on comical antics, why not find a more constructive use for it?
This is a really serious problem, -etc. ≈If you don't believe me, take a look at this graph I brought you. You see... it shows that unemployment in 2008. It's upside down. ≈Naturally! "The whole world is upside down and someone has to help it.
- No, I didn't say anything to him. - He's smart. You don't think he'll figure it out? Look, I can't. We had that dog for 10 years, but he didn't shed a tear when he died. He broke his neck and hid him in the garage, didn't shed a tear because he didn't care.
I am convinced, having studied who wrote these guidelines and who set these standards, that there is no need for such high recommendations. And unfortunately, those who set the standards were heavily influenced by the dairy industry. The situation is similar with iron. There is a need to consider... rethink our iron guidelines and ask the question, can we get the amount of iron we need from, shall we say, plants? And the answer is undoubtedly yes. The body's ability to control its needs needs to be considered and protected by giving it the right type of resources to work with.
But why get so mad? It's such a nice canyon. It's big. Yeah, a big, big canyon. Oh, I wish I had a name for it.
My headlight's dying. It's dying! The headlight's dying! There was another bright spot. Richard's Taliban bike had decided it liked the rain even less than I did.
James attached his bike to a traditional fishing boat, using the engine to turn the propeller. You've completely dismantled your bike! It's not even a motorcycle any more. There's no front wheel. The motor's not where it's supposed to be.
The machine tortures matter. Picture after picture, images of what the universe looked like in the first moments after creation flash before us. The particles that appear in these collisions cannot be seen because of their small size. Their presence is only detected by the traces they leave behind as they pass through the sensor. One of the ways in which we learned about the proton, and the first of our experiments, was to detach an electron from an atom and give the proton increasing velocity, allowing it to pass through a mass of atoms and fly into a piece of ordinary matter,
Get up. We gotta go. Come with me. We have a plan. We're gonna follow it.
Not here, over there! Come here! Your horse is thirsty. Come here! Let's give him a drink!
We can't let him reach the valley, he'll retaliate! He will-- Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it's agitated, it's hard to see anything. But if you let him calm down, the answer would be obvious.
I know. Have you seen your dad? Yeah, he's fine. Capricorn still has one copy left. He wants me to read him The Shadow.
Our worst fears have been realized - They're all dead. Had it not been for the horrific events of last week, the Munich Olympics would have gone down in history as the joyous Games we all hoped it would be. We have to live in a world where there is still a lot of hatred and violence. We have to accept the challenge of danger and we cannot accept that..... Gentlemen, we have been entrusted by the State to fight terrorism in this country and put an end to it if possible.
Her family is sponsoring a charity event and her sisters will be there, okay? Uh, okay. You both think the dinner's gonna cook itself? No, but that at least the lettuce will come out of the fridge by itself. Go and get that awful bread out of here. And send him to Africa, where he belongs.
Get over here now! Patient's conscious! Help me! He's looking at you. Say something to him.
Where is he? Water. Lift it up. Does he speak our language or is he just repeating what he's heard? No, he seems to understand our language already.
Now are they no better than ordinary marble, which is wise to wear as well as beautiful? Joe Blomfield, you're the best flatterer in the world. Or perhaps I should say you belong in a museum. You don't deface a masterpiece, Maggery. You let it exist.
He's in conference. Give her something for the pain. Now, let me take a look. Is something wrong with my baby? He's not feeling well.
This is our last chance. If you haven't changed your mind, now's the time. All right. Operation Mardonius Port Oslo, April 27, 1943 Get that damn dog out of here and give him something to eat!

The machine tortures matter. Picture after picture, images of what the universe looked like in the first moments after creation flash before us. The particles that appear in these collisions cannot be seen because of their small size. Their presence is only detected by the traces they leave behind as they pass through the sensor. One of the ways in which we learned about the proton, and the first of our experiments, was to detach an electron from an atom and give the proton increasing velocity, allowing it to pass through a mass of atoms and fly into a piece of ordinary matter,
Get up. We gotta go. Come with me. We have a plan. We're gonna follow it.
Not here, over there! Come here! Your horse is thirsty. Come here! Let's give him a drink!
We can't let him reach the valley, he'll retaliate! He will-- Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it's agitated, it's hard to see anything. But if you let him calm down, the answer would be obvious.
I know. Have you seen your dad? Yeah, he's fine. Capricorn still has one copy left. He wants me to read him The Shadow.
Our worst fears have been realized - They're all dead. Had it not been for the horrific events of last week, the Munich Olympics would have gone down in history as the joyous Games we all hoped it would be. We have to live in a world where there is still a lot of hatred and violence. We have to accept the challenge of danger and we cannot accept that..... Gentlemen, we have been entrusted by the State to fight terrorism in this country and put an end to it if possible.
Her family is sponsoring a charity event and her sisters will be there, okay? Uh, okay. You both think the dinner's gonna cook itself? No, but that at least the lettuce will come out of the fridge by itself. Go and get that awful bread out of here. And send him to Africa, where he belongs.
Get over here now! Patient's conscious! Help me! He's looking at you. Say something to him.
Where is he? Water. Lift it up. Does he speak our language or is he just repeating what he's heard? No, he seems to understand our language already.
Now are they no better than ordinary marble, which is wise to wear as well as beautiful? Joe Blomfield, you're the best flatterer in the world. Or perhaps I should say you belong in a museum. You don't deface a masterpiece, Maggery. You let it exist.
He's in conference. Give her something for the pain. Now, let me take a look. Is something wrong with my baby? He's not feeling well.
So when you're 60, she'll be 120. Where'd you get that cell phone? - From that guy. - The dead guy? - So what, he doesn't need it.
Nate, you need to go back to bed. Right now. Blood chemistry and urinalysis confirmed the blood in his urine was caused by kidney failure. He's on dialysis. And he's gonna need it for the rest of his life.
I've got him. Why don't you just relax? We'll take care of everything. Oh, I know. We have a plan, and we're following it.
They watch other shows on our channel, but now they won't because they'll be told it's not patriotic to watch NBS, and at the moment people want to be patriotic. By watching television? By doing anything... Guys, I can't spend all day on you guys. How is it possible that at a time when the whole country, including the two of us, is united, a little harmless sketch offended someone? Is true patriotism so fragile that it can be harmed by a late night comedy show?
Its causes are not exactly known, according to one theory it is our body's way of protecting the fetus from food toxins that could damage its tiny organs at this critical stage of development. Another theory is that it is a protective response of the mother's immune system, which is weakened so as not to suppress the developing embryo. The fetus is perceived by the immune system as a parasitic organism. It sucks the mother's energy and takes the substances it needs from her body. It has its own life support system, the placenta.
Almost immediately, there was a problem, and it was a serious one. -According to the tried and trusted science of the time, electrons should lose their energy, run out of speed and spiral down to the ground in less than the blink of an eye. eisenford's concept contradicted the known laws of nature. he didn't care about the challenge he posed to scientific society. This almost completely empty space was not going to behave as it was supposed to.
Yes, Your Honor. This is a matter of exceptionally disgusting negligence and destruction of property. Extremely disgusting negligence. This set was passed down from my great-great-grandmother. And it was over 200 years old.
This is a matter of exceptionally disgusting negligence and destruction of property. Extremely disgusting negligence. This set was passed down from my great-great-grandmother. And it was over 200 years old. How old would you say it was?
What the hell is that? Try to relax, Benny. Benny, try to relax. It was my great-great-grandmother's. And it was 200 years old.
I'm not gonna lose it. Everything finally makes sense. The world is a beautiful shining place. I wouldn't trade it for this. - If he's real, the pills won't hurt him.
No, no, it's okay. It's okay! It's okay! Look, my dick must be an inch away from his face, and it's coming, just coming over his face. -Fucking hell. What if he's kicking because he doesn't like it?
Your father should deposit it in the bank. The restaurant sucked him dry. So let him get rid of it. He's put his whole life on it. It's not about the money. Isn't Ian helping him get back on his feet?
That's the way it is. The question is, for whom? - You have the list, right? - Yeah. Good, follow it.
- You know what you have to do. - Anyway, your role model is a suspect. - He may be innocent. - You won't publicly condemn him? - You're entitled to your view, but don't let it come between us.
The environment is changing. I think it's somehow reacting to our presence in it. - And what do you base that on? Look, this is the world, right? But here, let's imagine the world as a living thing. If it were somehow conscious, it would eventually become aware of our influence on it.
Pass it on, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit! - Yeah, hand him over! - First, you have to promise you won't hurt him!
No, they're the bus itself. You see, they're the transportation that gets us here. They drop us off and we go on our way. And they continue on their own route. And the problem is, we keep trying to get back on that bus instead of just letting it keep going.
So when you're 60, she'll be 120. Where'd you get that cell phone? - From that guy. - The dead guy? - So what, he doesn't need it.

That's a good idea. Give me your triangle. You're crazy! Give it to me! Give it to him.
I made that pasta over there, it has vitamin C and calcium! This tofu and seaweed burger was made by Natsumi-san. It's low in calories, eat it! It'll stir in your stomach anyway. He likes it. If he didn't like it, he wouldn't eat it.
Since 1977, our country has stopped keeping suicide statistics. "Self-inflicted suicide." That's what they called it. Even though this act has nothing to do with murder. It knows neither the sound of blood nor passion.
"Self-murder." That's what they called it. Even though the act has nothing to do with murder. He knows neither the sound of blood nor passion. He knows only death. The death of hope.
There's power and lyricism. And most importantly, simplicity. There's only one problem. You're copying me, Anna Holtz. Is that a bad thing? The world doesn't need another Beethoven, but maybe it needs you.
Very funny. It's done. I'll get it for you. What do I need to do with the fire? - Just let it burn.
Under Lord Caldlow's care, she will never need anything. Well, think about it. Lord Caldlow would also like you to have this as a demonstration of his honesty. Robert Angier's diary, including the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick. - He never learned it.
Number one. Number one on London's most wanted list. Okay, cool. Say that again. The most precious thing on Earth is the human brain, and yet we let it die.
But that was 300 years ago. What was he waiting for? Perhaps only one cell survived. Slowly adapted over generations, and survived thanks to humans, changing hosts one by one. But why would he want the throne?
A little wider. Okay, just relax. - Okay, okay. The sensitivity's a little heightened. Well, I hope you're not in love with that tooth, Lieutenant, because I'm afraid it's gonna have to go.
I can't be alone! It's not fair! - I've got your pod! - The pod is dead! - No, no, it needs warmth.
It's not fair! - I have your pod! - The pod is dead! - No, no, it needs warmth. - It needs more than just warmth.
What about it? I'm not kidding...but that drawing just moved. And this one! She didn't draw the torch, he did. But it needs more than just heat, Doctor!
Give it to him. No. Give it to him, Kristina. What's wrong with you? He needs it to operate.
- Come on. Come on. - Let's do it. Okay, caffeine is for seizures. What are doughnuts for? To absorb some of the coffee so it doesn't burn a hole in your stomach.
Where have you been? I've been thinking. About what? That in a minute this computer's gonna start beeping, and when it does, you're not gonna do anything. You're gonna let it go to zero. and on and on. and you don't press the button.
They can't rest until they reach it. The main part has already gotten there safely. Finally, the stragglers emerge from the dust. The exhausted calf is still blinded by the sand. Its mother does her best to help it.
But they're beautiful. I thought there was no electricity. I thought where would I put my propeller? Propeller? It needs running water.
We'll run more tests. In that case, can I have some morphine? I want you to check the fetal screen every half hour. What's the point? The baby's about where it needs to be, and you know you're gonna have to open her up, So why not just get it over with?
And now I'm left with nothing but my lover and this worthless truck. Wait a minute. You don't need a truck, I need a job, you need money, I got a severance package.... You're gonna buy Max's truck? What, he doesn't need it anymore?
Why? You have to learn to speak with a Seoul accent to talk there. Then they won't ignore you and help you find your father's house. What do you mean with a Seoul accent? I learned it from watching movies.
There he is, the master of disguise. Nautilus tries to stay away from the octopus. Its small tentacles have sensitive chemical receptors, picking up the slightest trace of both prey and predator. And now it's using its water cannon to blow away sand. The nautilus uses very little energy to swim; it only needs to eat once a month.

I doubt it's in Vienna and I don't think it's at home. I'll check the registration records. Parking tickets might give you something. I won't cut off your oxygen, he's been doing it for 12 years. He turned it into an art form. That's absurd. Impossible. Did you ever call him at the MUZ? Nick used a pager, and so did I.
He's dangerous three nights of a full moon. And you don't download porn like your peers? I'm sorry for making conversation. Oh, well, okay. What's a werewolf doing in L.A.? He's supposed to be terrifying the country girls.
Here! Don't annoy him! What's that? It's just a sphinx. Throw him a book.
Don't annoy him! What's that? It's just a sphinx. Throw him a book. Throw him a book, they love them.
You should have protested months ago, too. The plans have been on display in the planning office for a year. Were they? You shouldn't have gone down to the basement. Mr. Kent, do you realize how much damage that bulldozer will do if you just let it drive over you?
The love of my life. But death took it away. Like you, I have learned that men who have lost their human form must be fought without question, without pity. Anger is a source of great power. But if you let it go, it will destroy you. It almost did to me.
- You'll laugh. I brought it up from the bottom of the sea. Mankind's oldest flute, the same age as the mammoths. Carved from the bone of a woolly rhinoceros. Poor guy! Wasn't he hot?
Then how will you help him? You've always been there for him. I have. And I am. He has a God-given talent, and this is the only chance to let it grow.
The world hasn't stood still since your death, Cage. Onboard drones, anti-aircraft countermeasures... and fuel tanks that let you fly around the world three times without refueling. You can turn in your fur coat. You have my word, no one will steal it. But I can't guarantee it won't leave here on its own.
The more roses you have on cupid's day, the more popular you are, right? Thanks for the advice, Kent. I'll keep it in mind. I didn't say the rose was from me. But it is from you, isn't it?
These flowers were brought for you in Daimler class. I know I don't look my best for this, but you have my word the flowers are legit. That's cool. And this rose is for you, too. It's pretty special.
And this rose is for you, too. It's quite unusual. It stands out from the others. Thank you. Hey, I-- Didn't say it was from me.
It's quite unusual. It stands out. Thank you. Hey, I, uh. Didn't say it was from me. But whoever it's from, it's got a certain message, so, uh.
Look at us, Wilson! We're like something out of a horror movie! We're pale and bald and angry and lonely and-- And they're so gorgeous and-- Our daughter is a hundred times better than that disgusting kid. - She's not our daughter!
Oh, no. What's the matter? Let me see. Did you see my soul? Is it still there?
That boy across the room. I fell in love. Я... I just, uh. fell in love with him at first sight. And we had a life. It was beautiful, and it was hard.
I mean. - Hey, Smurfette. - Hey. (chuckles) This thing is safe, right? Is it safe?
- Ready, Zabiyaka? - Roger that. It's working! This thing understands me. It's able to focus on Zabiyaka's core trait.
You're just in time to see a scientific discovery. What's going on here? None of your business, Weasel. That's fine. Listen up! If this vegetable hat tells us that Zabiyaka is strong, maybe it can tell me what Etta means.
You've been looking for these blue creatures for a long time. But this hat is from a very different place. Yes. Where? Where is it from?
Here we go! Stop it, Azrael. I can't adjust the machine because of your incessant yelling. Yes, Azrael, listen to her. She purrs like a kitten.
WILLIAMSBURG BANK Good morning, sir. Welcome to our bank. I'll take a pager for you now, and you'll speak to a bank specialist as soon as one is available. What does this thing do? It's gonna light up and vibrate.
"Old gangster." That's illegal, right? Gentlemen, Prohibition has been repealed. Marijuana has wonderful medicinal properties. It cures all diseases.
Okay. Breathe slowly. Concentrate on the flashlight. Lisa, I see a shark! It's coming towards you!
It rained last night. We have three guests and a sink full of dishes. Okay, okay. It's 2.5 kilometers to the pumping station. Sometimes it goes out.
A long time ago. And the Holy Land? Jerusalem? He says this water is not fit to drink. It flows past that place.
Where is he? I need to see him now! Was your flash drive in a safe place before you gave it to John? Yes, of course it was. It was our insurance policy.
They removed the sidewalk in front of the post office. Your shoes have local clay on them, it's very distinctive. - Yeah, your little apartment. - How did you know that? - Well, on your salary, it had to be modest, and you spent all the money on a cottage, didn't you?
No, really. Really? You're really serious? That joke's outdated. It's not funny anymore.
Well... A parting gift. How kind. The cane. Yes, it was mine. a long time ago.
My boss. Big Boss Baby Boss. Why is she yelling? See the pie chart? Wow, it looks like a pie.
Isn't that right? It was impossible until you gave me the main ingredient. My secret blend. It's mine! It's all mine.
Who's ticklish? Here you go. Well, that's my story. Our story. Lucky for me and my brother, it ends well.
Black people may not realize it, but it's hard for everyone right now. Our lives aren't that much different. - What the hell? - We got struck by lightning? - It must have gone through the heating blanket.
Stolen. Okay, Mr. Jones, where was the last place you left your car? If we knew, we'd find it in a heartbeat, wouldn't we? Well, could you describe the car? It's terrible, always in for repairs.
One of which is liver. Which is perfect for Terence. Exactly. His liver will never be on the transplant list. It will go directly to your nephew.
The other Iron Fists I knew were brutal and relentless in their mission to protect K'un-L'un from the Hand. They would never walk out of the Great Joust to save some girl's life. How did you know my father? I've lived long enough to observe the changes that have happened to the world. But this change, it seems significant.
What if she doesn't talk? She will. Good. (chuckles) Did you think this idea was totally lame? It doesn't suck, okay?
I don't think Gandhi would agree with you. Okay, I'm not special, but I've seen enough people die to know the value of life. What about the lives that Gao is destroying? Hey, uh. Turbulence is scary, but it's not dangerous.
Qi healing. Reiki is considered a pseudo-science, but they say it cures tumors and all sorts of ailments. So maybe it's more real than I thought. Qi is the breath of life. It empowers the Iron Fist.
Oh, really? You're done, Harold. I've spent too many years hating you. You're going to prison. Only this time it won't be as pleasant as the one you spent the last 13 years in.
- What? There's-- Dude, this shit is all cloudy. You gotta get rid of this shit, man. Dean had it.
In the conference room. Mr. Rand, I know I speak for all of us, we're very happy to have you back with us. For good this time. This war isn't over. Well, the whole point of war is that it happens if both sides believe they're good.
Opportunity. Chance. And that's the main foundation on which our team stands. And that hope belongs to me. It belongs to me, you son of a bitch!
Garbage that someone threw out. But if you want a mystery, how about a shit puddle? What the hell is going on with it? Why isn't it spreading? Why doesn't it harden? - It's moving.
Frank, Frank, before you do anything, I want to give you a valentine. Unheard of! Right in front of me? - Really? Charlie! - It's for both of you.
Yeah, I mean, I have my moments. but I'm happier than I've ever been. - Hey Mia, what's up? - Did Hosse tell you about his exhibition? It was great!
How much did she get out of it? Well, Mary. I see you're looking at our little task. Small'? It's a big one.
But it was never enough. Until you. When you first appeared, I was going to crush you, but I knew only you could see what the other gods could not. Now you will join me, and by joining forces, we can finally end the pain, suffering and destruction they bring. And turn the earth into the paradise it was before them.
There's no getting away from it, Dom. One way or another, we're gonna have to talk about it. Fate's a funny thing. It's tricky. It gives you beautiful moments, but sometimes it gives you this.
It's a million-dollar show car. Our job is to keep the attention off of it. It has the opposite psychological effect. The house won't even notice it. It's bright orange.
Boom! Rolling. I'll just be a second. Where's the smile? There it is.
This is it. the moment of truth. As you can see, the flames have formed a reflective surface on the glass, also known as an arsenic mirror. Your father was poisoned. Judging by the density of the mirror, I suspect that dose sent the old man quickly to the grave. I'll tell you, in the later stages, it affected his mental clarity.
Load it up! How's your religion these days, Coop? My what? Your religion, your faith. After all these years of service, it's become rags, Your Majesty.
How to say... It depends on the intentions behind that fire. And the major gave us a date. The day after tomorrow. If you read these stars, you get the same date, and it's headed this way.
That's a great excuse. So you really can't take that thing off? No, I can't. I don't get it. It's part of me.
Spencer gave me this one the day Yvonne and I were supposed to leave town. And then she asked me for a goodbye kiss, then I thought it was weird for Spencer. Okay, Toby, I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with Ezra? I didn't look in the book until today. It's not hers.
And then she asked me for a goodbye kiss, then I thought it was weird for Spencer. Okay, Toby, I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with Ezra? I didn't look in the book until today. It's not hers. It doesn't belong to Spencer.
It's a lost cause. The entire province is only 4% of the country's population. It's strategically pointless. I'd back away from the idea. The problem with guerrilla warfare is that it's pointless.
The lightning will strike the rod that will guide it into the tunnel. We'll grab the Horseman and put him in the bunker. There'll be a trap. Okay. How do we stop him from grabbing the lightning and getting out before he's trapped? If the lightning strikes again, it'll hit the rod.
Three. No, no, no! Stop! The Horseman's whip didn't go deep enough to take him, but it left a wound on his back. He was thrown into the tank, and the wound contaminated the water. It mixed with the liquid from the barrel and made him stronger.
Well, we should have sent someone else. So many soldiers. We tend to lose a couple. Especially if they're scared. There are rumors of magic. If there was, it wouldn't be yours, would it?
Is that so? I'm glad you banned it. I'm glad not to use it. Magic was a drug worse than opium. How much good did it do us against the Eternal Beast?
The wagon will pass and no one will stop it. No one will chase them. That's a smart plan. It's Dorothy's plan. When she gets to Glinda, she'll stop this war before it starts.
This vortex chamber can send you home. The only thing I ask is that you stop Glinda first. And she gave me the only weapon that could kill a witch. - Not the only one. - When she gets to Glinda, she'll stop this war before it starts.
Nothing. I died and came back to life. I think I might be able to conjure up a few incantations. Don't push, calling on magic. It'll come to you.
But if we had more fighters..... - How? - Underhill Plantation. The largest and richest property on the island. Over two hundred slaves live there. It's well defended.
Spending the night with the queen, you died... There are worse deaths. Clothes and hairstyles change over time, but this queen always had a party. And the kings kept coming for her. The power of our queen, which is given to all women, is the power of rebirth and creation. She makes some men kneel down and offer gifts.
- Starve them? - They used to starve themselves. 40 days, not for faith, but out of necessity. Starvation is an ancient form of prayer, and these guys have never starved. They just take food out of the fridge, throw it in the microwave and watch it spin.
I'm fine, really. - What happened? - I told you, a bike, a branch, a scratch. That's it? Mom, I promise I'll tell you everything about my life, it's so exciting.
Duran? Yeah, sure. Good choice, kid. I prefer jazz, but all music is good in its own way. It makes every day a good day.
You can tell. Tell him if he doesn't call tonight, he may not even come home. Chaos theory. But, you see, chaos theory isn't about chaos itself. It's about how small changes in a big system can affect everything.
- All right. Uh-huh. Uh, thank you. What am I supposed to see? Just a shadow on the moon. Look, it's slowly growing.
- Yeah. I'll probably just, uh. hand the project off to another student. That sounds friendly. A friend of mine is studying friendship theory. It helps with stress.
Look out there! Oh, my God! Well, uh. I like this car. It smells new.
Honey, you'll always be my valentine. That's a little creepy, don't you think? You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates, are you? You know what, working at the movie theater. I don't think it's good for you.
If that's the case. And if you want to discuss them with someone who isn't related to you... I'll let you know. Look, I hated high school. I couldn't wait to graduate. It was hell for me.
Every culture since antiquity has survived this way - it is defined by what it rejects. As long as progress exists, there will always be human waste in its wake. Sooner or later it becomes necessary to answer the question - what to do with them? In London, they just call them criminals. They throw them into a deep, dark pit and hope it doesn't overflow.
Sooner or later it becomes necessary to answer the question - what to do with them? In London, they just call them criminals. Throw them into a deep, dark pit and hope it doesn't overflow. But justice demands that we do otherwise. Civilization should not be judged by who it rejects, but how it deals with the rejected.
- Anyway, Dr. Vaughn. by the way, that's an awful name. Morty and Summer fixated on your obsession with pickles to avoid therapy. I think this case is the best insight into your family's dysfunction. You and your father may have a very specific dynamic. And it is far from rewarding.
Morty and Summer fixated on your obsession with pickles to avoid therapy. I think this case is the best insight into your family's dysfunction. You and your father may have a very specific dynamic. And it's far from a reward. It's a punishment.
Mom! Where's the head? - What? - My head. Where is it?
- What? - My head. Where is it? It's not really your head, is it? I mean, technically, it belonged to someone else.
Where is it? It's not really your head, is it? I mean, technically, it belonged to someone else. - I'm gonna ask you a few questions. - First you're gonna tell me where it is.
It's not really your head, is it? I mean, technically, it belonged to someone else. - I'm gonna ask you a few questions. - First you're gonna tell me where it is. It's right here in the refrigerator.
And they know it. That's why they're so afraid of you and me. If we can capture Nassau, if we can dispel the illusion that England is invincible, raise a rebellion that will sweep across the New World, then yes. I suppose they'll notice us. - "An excess of sanity can be madness, and the greatest madness is to see life as it is, not as it should be."
Can we talk for a minute? You don't even know what you're asking. Am I in a book? Yes. Is it about my life?
Yes, it's natural. It's common in the wild. A smaller animal will cower in the teeth of a larger predator. It's a genetic instinct. At some point, the food realizes it's food.
You're watching all the Israelis like you're on TV. Technical glitch. So? A Russian traveling circus shows a squirrel running in a wire wheel. The squirrel thinks it's spinning the wheel, but if it stops running, its legs get tangled in the wire and the squirrel breaks its legs.
Are you supposed to sing? For the past two years I've been working on the song trail. I don't have to tell you that every congregation has it different, so I've had to learn step by step every sacred space, every ceremony, every word. You want my song? It's the last one.
Honey, I don't know where he is. And he would have let me know if I should know. I got it. You took your book. It's not mine, it's Matt's.
It doesn't matter. You're not gonna tell me, but you told Lori? Who else are you gonna tell? Matt? He's gonna want to add visions to your book. It's not mine!
I think you like her. You want to be a Jesus superstar because you're important then. You like it? I love it! She's awesome!
To be honest, your story's better. My story's true. Come on, Matt. - It's all true. It's, uh. It's based on fact.
I'd be happy to help. You already did when you found the house. Oh, come on. You're not gonna let me see this killer car for myself? It's not murderous.
You're just gonna dump him? That's good news. If this Kevin thing doesn't work out, who cares? Officer Coalopard's going down tomorrow with the rest of us. But if it does, sweet Lorelei.
Nausea or discomfort may occur as you walk past a working laser matrix. Do not touch the sensor. Enter the camera, close the port behind you, and turn the knob to the left. All the way in. It will remain in this position.
When you're ready, we'll begin the procedure. You will hear three beeps. After the third beep, the chamber will fill with liquid. The liquid will be the same consistency as water, but it's not water. It contains irradiated metals.
- Yeah. She sent a note. - She did? She's already got everybody under control? - She's offering a trade.
A cookbook so we can make dinner. I assume everything but the lamb. My private library is open to you at any time. It's mostly law books, but there are other sections, from Italian cooking to the world's most dangerous mold. I suppose it's not as good as the libraries you've been using, but...
- Is this war more important than her life? Answer me. I want to hear it from you. Is this war more important than her life? - Now, with so much at stake. She is more important. - Get out of here!
But I don't want to risk her life anymore. If I have to give up the chest to free her, I'm glad I took it. - Everything. Everything was in our hands. The war was already in the air, it was real.
- So you sent one of these groups to their deaths. - The important thing is they'll tell us where he is. - I wish he knew. How much you learned from him. - The enemy's wrist is where the attack originates. It's her past, from which she is inseparable.
And it is perhaps one of his greatest creations. A canonical work of individuals putting aside their differences for the common good. But in its time, the work was ridiculed, called a "smear", "the work of an amateur". There were stories about people who hired Rembrandt and refused to pay because they were dissatisfied with the resemblance. The painting was not appreciated, and when it was transported from one hall to another, they decided that it was too big, and then simply cut it off on several sides.
- Hey. Keith was telling me about you. - Hi. - We saw your speech. - It was beautiful.
One time. It didn't hit any of us. I think he did it by accident, but still. When he saw Lonnie, he almost shit himself. Dropped the gun so fast, it was like it was burning his hands.
A girl can't just be friends with a guy. There has to be sex. Or love. In my experience, love gets you killed as much as passion. It stirs up bad things. Mutual or not.
А! You've met my muse. Fascinating, isn't she? Frightening, indeed. Who is she?
I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday. I think our VIP is not missing, but kidnapped. Hello, Special Agents Bowman and Howard. FBI. If the camera can see, it won't answer you.
New capsule trajectory, minus 0.32. The capsule will fly past us. - Rory? - I'm on the trajectory. She's not far away.
I thought your parents went to see you. They did, but, uh. it's a long story. I read your book. We all did. It made a lot of noise around here.
Hodgins, slow down. Talk to me. I can see you're upset. I'm telling you, if I could get down to the basement, that needle wouldn't be evidence. I'd stick it in his neck so it would pierce every organ in its path.
She'll be seen by a doctor from Chichester on arrival. - Dr. Turner. - Uh, Sister. did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left? No, I did not. She was not in her chambers, and when I went to her room before breakfast, it was empty.
Did Ezra say he wanted to postpone the wedding? We haven't talked about it. Then go with plan "A." What does that mean? Aria, you plan this wedding and she'll be waiting for him while he says good-bye to Nicole.
- Of course you are. - I support you. - In whatever decision you make. - It's not your problem. Aria, you plan the wedding and she'll be waiting for him while he says good-bye to Nicole.
He's probably even more broken inside than you are. Thank you. You're welcome. Try this pizza. It's good.
- How long has it been here? - I don't know. Maybe this thing's broken? It's not broken. It's thinking.
Literally. Wait a minute, do you hear that? It sounds like a hum and then a bunch of clicks. Trust me, this joke makes all kinds of noises. I know, I just can't tell if it's mechanical or electrical.
It was made much later. It was about turning revenge into a game. A game? I came back here today because I didn't want whoever sent that note to get it. Where is it?
No, no, no. No one's gonna tell Ali about this. Did you see this book with your own eyes? Yeah, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it. Where is it now?
Were you drunk? No. Butterflies are classic. They suck. Okay, I'm sorry I didn't get your artistic opinion and stuffed a lame butterfly. Well, it's beautiful.
or I'll twist your balls off. Poh-la-la-la. There's a very simple way out of this. - Not now. - The farm is worth a lot of money. Just found out it's on a huge uranium deposit.
I understand Goward, and I'm sorry to mislead you. The thing is. you had to be sure first. I'm not talking about the heart attack you almost gave me. Chuck, this tape. I'm not exactly sure what part it plays.
I'll be quiet. - Thank you. - But I don't approve. You just broke up with Maggie, and you're buying jewelry for some other girl? She's not some other girl.
Thank you. It's safe here. I use it when I visit. Got any food for him? Come on, it's on board.
Get some coffee, boys. It's no good sleeping on duty. Did you take care of that battery? Yeah. It did die, but we replaced it a couple hours ago.
Let's wait and see what we're dealing with. She's not a threat. And we're not gonna let it be. This thing is a living weapon, a killing machine. She's not a machine.
She's not a danger. And we're not gonna let it be. This thing is a living weapon, a killing machine. She's not a machine. She's not human.
Me, too. Naomi? She hid behind a container near the end of the lower deck, in the tail. There's a bad view. Go left. She should be there.
Naomi? She hid behind a container near the end of the lower deck, in the tail. It's a bad view. Go left. She should be there. We'd see if she moved.
It's not a dumb animal. The device she ripped from her chest is an emergency regulator, like a control and guidance module. A fucking control module. It was an incendiary device, okay? A bomb that's supposed to destroy this thing if it gets out of control, okay?
I can definitely shake it down one of the holes. Out of the question. That maneuver would tear him in two. This thing is strong as hell. I don't think it's gonna stumble and fly into space.
Your suit will only filter out a fraction, and then your heart will stop. You know a lot about death. Yeah, apparently. Super. Despite her current form, she was human.
Prepare for weightlessness. It's coming out. She's stopped. Shit. She's going back to Holden.
Naomi said the creature feeds on radiation, right? Yeah. It sucks radiation like a mosquito sucks blood. When we first found the protomolecule, it was hugging the reactor core. So? It's looking for a power source.
On my signal, get the cannonball. Come on. Get it out! She's out the door. She's coming for you! All right, there she is!
Guns. Electromagnetic guns. Atomic bombs. No weapon brings peace. No one knows what a protomolecule wants or what it does, but it's used anyway.
Atomic bombs. No weapon brings peace. No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it does, but it is used anyway. It's spread too far apart to be sure of its destruction. It's part of the equation now, and it always will be.
He injected Jonathan with demon blood. Why would he do that? He's sick. He thought the demon blood would make his unborn child strong. And it did.
Why would he do that? He's sick. He thought the demon blood would make his unborn child strong. And it did. But it also made him. evil.
If she can accept you with all this, I'm pretty sure she can accept you for who you are. Okay? You know, mustard is actually rich in antioxidants. It's actually healthy.
I traveled to fucking India and came face to face with a cobra! And all I got was its stupid box! That stupid box is sacred. You know why? It contains the soil from Camille's grave.
Magnus, tell me, is it possible? Yes or no? Sure, there are magicians who have done it. But what you're talking about is dark magic. It's very unpredictable.
Wait a minute. Are you sleeping in a coffin? No, it's a canoe. And, mom. The blood isn't fake. It's real.
For the answers you seek, we must enter the Citadel. But we can't let any demonic filth get through. Adamas is too fragile. So celestial water energy will help us determine if you can enter. It will destroy any contamination on contact.
- Did you? - No. I never read it. I've never seen it. I just have a rough idea what it's about.
We agree. One of the lost treasures of the Zambezi, right? Mr. Lucas, you have something we've come a very long way for. Part of the Spear of Destiny. Where is it?
Uh, coffee? No. I'm good. Thanks, Ida. I wanted to thank you personally for your support. I doubt it had any effect.
It should. Whatever you say. Here we go, Harry. That tattoo. It's SWAT.
My son honored that commitment. He sacrificed his life. So by wearing this uniform, I honor his memory, just as you honor the memory of all officers who have died in the line of duty. Wear it with pride. Respect what it represents... serve and protect the citizens of Los Angeles.
No. Nothing. Is everything okay? I wanted to talk to you about Callie's senior paper. Yeah, I heard it made a splash.
Is everything okay? I wanted to talk to you about Callie's senior paper. Yeah, I heard it was a big hit. Yeah. It did, and it's really great.
He was terrified. Felicity, what's really going on? The NSA file we used to free John was part of a databank that a group of hackers gave me, and it contained data that I used to pressure the director of Detralink. You mean you blackmailed him? - Well.... - For that database to contain exactly what you needed for this particular guy, it would have to be huge.
He knew how to avoid hitting them. And before he opened fire, he put on a ski mask. Looks like a laborer's overalls. Forfeather Repair. It's been bankrupt for six years.
Why don't you like to talk about it? I just don't like it when you guys fight when I'm trying to work. There's nothing wrong with a little healthy bickering, Felicity. It's healthy if it leads to something, and this one is going nowhere. Actually, I don't agree that it should lead to something, nor do I agree that it's unhealthy.
Not a scratch. What's this door made of? Celtium. It's an alloy designed by the U.S. government to withstand a nuclear blast. Are you saying if we had a warhead in here, it couldn't handle it?
You shouldn't have left Nick. He gave us no choice. The battle isn't over. It is for Nick. If we'd stayed there, it would have been over for us.
Where'd he get it from? He kept it in his hiding place, wrapped in a cloth. I forgot I had it. Nick left it on the bed when he got the wand to heal you. It's very old.
The protomolecule froze around the reactor core. Starved to death. Did you energize it? HOLDEN: Uh-huh. And it started to move.
Day-to-day decisions are made by the managers of Rotogen. "They have complete autonomy. ¬ We only intervene in such small projects when the company has exceeded its budget. "So these left-wing employees managed to make a profit and a war while staying within budget? Maybe we should poach them. "Rotogen is a bio-technology research firm. "It was a government contract on the eba station.
All right. [Sighs] Go ahead. These voices I'm hearing. I think this thing takes, I don't know, consciousness - or whatever it is that makes us human? It's eating it, and then it's spewing it out in some other form.
And the data is transmitted here. This communications relay station is abandoned. But at least someone who did this on Eros must be there. To find out what's going on, we have to take this station. It's unattended, barely even visible on radar. But there's a residential ring, which means someone's home.
Somebody's got to keep these fools from shooting each other. No, I'm not gonna sit on the sidelines. All right, then. I'm gonna go clean up the cabin. Leave it. She'll be waiting for you when you get back.
Curiosity is not a crime. Too bad, or you'd be in jail for the rest of your life. Shopping list and household bills. Did you, uh. see that last entry? I suppose you can tell us what it means.
Ibis and Jackal have been in the business for 200 years. Bone pins. Thread for muscle. Paint for skin. We have to take care of your flesh because it can't take care of itself anymore.
The power of fire is a fiery power. Not godlike. But it is godlike. And they believe it. It fills their spirit every time they pull the trigger.
Just don't make me go back there again! The money! Now! No! I have so much to teach you, Bruce. But your pain. It's keeping you from becoming the man I need you to be.
Do you know why you were quickly defeated? No. Your rage, Bruce. Blinding you. You seek to control her, but she's been controlling you since that night.
- The canines are staying with me. - Harvey, there's gonna be a lot of people at the train station at 5:00. Even after we evacuate, thousands will be infected. Not if we find the bomb. But I'm guessing it's not out in the open.
- I'm just trying to be realistic, Wally. I can do that. Look, I want my life to mean something, more than just a daughter or a sister or a girlfriend, but a reporter. This story will help me with that. It will show that I, Iris West, meant something.
Look, I want my life to mean something, more than just a daughter or a sister or a girlfriend, but a reporter. This story will help me do that. It'll show that I, Iris West, meant something. - You know, my life was a lot simpler before my sister came along. - But it's so much better now, isn't it?
Wait, that's the exact opposite of how my blood makes cells regenerate. Exactly. Can we use my blood to save her? Look, I don't think your blood will help us save Iris. But I'm pretty sure it can help us defeat Yorkin.
if you don't get it right the first time, try again and again. You have to stop him. I don't have the power to do that right now. I need you to put your blood inside him. It'll react with his cells and neutralize his abilities.
We sent Grodd there after the last attack. Grodd's there? How did your father even think to go there? We got a mathematical cryptogram from our S.T.A.R. Labs. It was quite complex.
We can do this. You've seen the future. You know there will be an attack. If we find out exactly where it's going to happen, we can launch a preemptive strike on Grodd. Stop the attack before it even starts.
- It's not an eared one, it's a bumpy one. You've been studying this thing for hours, can we or can we not find out where Savitar is? All right, all right, let's get to the point. As far as we can tell, this thing is made up of a frictionless material whose molecules are always in motion. So it appears to be stationary on the outside, but inside it, nothing stops.
Cisco said, or showed me, that you've been off the team for a long time. And I know I'm the reason why. Iris' death must have taken me away from all of you. I mean. I mean, it must have brought me closer to you.
Look... I admit, it's pretty hard not to wonder what if I'd had a daughter instead of a son, but that's the least of it compared to why it happened. I made a big mistake. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Barry, there are wars being fought over this technology. If something happens and it falls into the wrong hands, people could die.
Gladly. You go first, of course. Thank you. Reminds me of the movie "Jaws." They don't show the shark because they can't afford to make it look good.
I know. It's hard, but we'll get through it, buddy. No, this picture-- Hold on a second. Where is it?
What about it? We need to know the amount of each component. We get the proportions wrong, we kill Chloe. The professor kept the formula to himself. He liked to brag that it only existed in his head.
- This song is not just about love at first sight. It's about life, about the risks that two people took when their lives and destinies crossed. It was always about the music. Lucius' music was my oxygen. It was like blood running through my veins.
- Yeah. We saw the teaser for When Cookie Met Lucius. - It's the bomb! - Lucius' music was my oxygen. It was like blood coursing through my veins.
She recommended him? Like hell she did. Lucius, this company belongs to me. - No, it's ours. - It belongs to me and my family.
Stay away from my daughter! Cass, you-- We completed the mission. It was a mission. It was horrible, but necessary. We were in the right.
But if... If I could go back in time and change everything, three years ago, I would. Because he's out there somewhere, isn't he? Still. Alive. And free. You know? After all this talking, all this therapy. This rage doesn't go away, it just keeps getting worse.
What are you doing? Yes. Here. The man on the tape is running towards a field on the edge of Flintcombe Farm, where there's a track running through it. You follow that track and it comes out to a road here, which means, uh.
This is the Serpent Hall. Look around. This is a lizard wing... and this is... a winged lizard. Look at the yellow coloration of the abdomen, it indicates camouflage and cowardice. And it can fly?
- Stefano! Stefano. Yes. Well, there's a spare room upstairs. It's small, but like I said, I have three kids living with me,
- I'm very grateful to you, Dad. - You're not grateful. You've been waiting for this, and you're taking it for granted. You don't notice it, but when I stop doing things, you will. I swear by the grace of God. - The essence of God's mercy, as I understand it, is that she expects nothing from you but love and devotion, which I have never denied you.
The universe is 14 billion years old No one knows what came before And no one knows how big the universe really is. И... It could be infinite."
I'm sorry, did you say... Mulberry or Mott Street? - I said Mott. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's just around the corner.
I have to ask. When you got there and realized it was beyond you, why didn't you just go home? We were too afraid of embarrassing ourselves. Especially when people started making fun of us, like when we wanted to build a school out of... out of mud blocks. We built one wall and it just fell down.
Thanks anyway! Good afternoon. I'm calling about the Charles McGill meeting. That's why I'm calling. I think it's this week, but, uh.
- All right, great. Let's strategize, where do we expand, Colorado or Utah? I'll see you at 7:00. This McGill thing. Are you sure it won't burden you?
Even doctors take time to make sense of these illnesses. Would you say your illness affects your ability to think clearly? No. Only physically. It causes me terrible pain.
It's just a play on words. The important thing is this. To understand what I was thinking, you have to see Chuck through my eyes. You need to know if I thought this tape was proof. And I say it proves only one thing:
Did I tell you I think I found a new apartment? You promised there'd be an awkward silence between us. - You're funny. It's in a promising neighborhood called Go-Oh.
I've thought about it, and I've decided. I've decided to give this tape to you instead of them. Maybe it'll give you the strength to blame them and save us from financial ruin. Good-bye, Trace. And good luck. Maybe it'll give you the strength to blame them and save us from financial ruin.
- I don't know. The steering wheel locked up. This thing's skidding. - Can you get it started? - No, everything's off. It's not going anywhere.
Until Kuznikov showed up at his house at an extremely opportune moment. Gretchen's waiting for more suspects to come forward. She's smart. Then why isn't she accusing you? Treason is front-page material, Brent. It won't just end your career, it'll destroy your family for generations.
There's nothing more you can do. And don't despair. I don't think the Betty thing is over. Nice room. It's too pink.
I don't think the Betty story is over. Nice room. It's too pink. It doesn't feel right anymore. No, I like it, it's so girly.
- Hey. What's up? - Uh, hi. He used to be on the soccer team. But I quit. When I saw that notebook of Chuck's. And I might know where it is.
Who is Jennifer Gibson? There's more. Oh, my God. Don't tell me you're on this crazy witch hunt. It's not a witch hunt, and she's not crazy.
And if this keeps up, pretty soon, the Coopers won't exist anymore. And there's nothing I can do to stop it. Betty, don't do this. Don't give up. Your family is definitely falling apart right now, but it's not gonna fall apart because of you.
Get out! Get out! What are you looking at? The party's over. It's over!
But I lied. And instead, I threw you a party you didn't even want. Why? There's something very, very wrong with me. It's like there's a darkness in me that sometimes overwhelms me, and I don't know where it comes from.
And given recent events, it's possible he could have hired him for other jobs. Like going after Jason as payback for what the Blossoms did to him. I want to help your investigation. I want the truth. Whatever it is.
This is outrageous. I will write an article about it, and not for Blue and Gold, but for the Register. It's a history of the city. As long as it doesn't mention my father. No, it'll be about your father, Jug.
The night of the murder, Gail Myers called me at 3:00 to tell me that Amy hadn't come home yet. I went to Billy's to ask if he knew where Amy was. The cat was sleeping next to him. He turned around and gave her a squeeze, she got mad and scratched his cheek.
Honestly, I don't know. And you never will. What I want to know is, why hasn't anyone taken on Nasiri before? That's the irony of freedom. It allows our enemies to destroy us.
Bile flow is normal. The most beautiful purple in the world. It is. How's the hepatic artery? Look at that, it's practically dancing.
A real rich man never worries about getting poor. I don't know what you're talking about, baby. You're the number one selling author this year, no one is saying you're going to be poor. Lawrence, tell me what your favorite thing about Scott's book is. Well, uh. it's interesting to young people because it's so rebellious.
I don't know what you're talking about, poopsie. You're the number one selling author this year, no one's saying you're going to be poor. Lawrence, tell me what your favorite thing about Scott's book is. Well, uh. it's interesting to young people because it's so rebellious. It's different from all the others.
Are you confused? I've been confused ever since it came out of my vagina. God, Mom, don't talk about your vagina. Why not? It's in perfect condition.
Why? It's garbage. I can't show this to my father, okay? If he's gonna give us this client, we need to get in the game. Our work has to be Ivy League level, and right now it's Arizona State level.
The magnesium in the laxative caused hypomagnesemia - shortness of breath, low blood pressure, arrhythmia... - That explains the blood? - It explains the vomiting. But he also suffered from an undetected aortic aneurysm. Everything else so depleted his system that it exploded.
Trixie, I've been dancing to Nurse Douglas' tune all night. I don't need any more exercise, thank you. Nurse Crane. The early bird gets the worm. Or at least she lines up all the worms and determines which ones are likely to cause the most trouble.
Why can't you find anything? - Because our room is a mess. - Then clean it up. I do. And then it gets cluttered again.
Young man, may I ask what you're doing? Pulling weeds. That's not a weed. It's the common fleabane. It grows freely, so it thrives.
No one knows where the soul is. Maybe it lives in the heart.
No one knows where the soul is. Maybe it lives in the heart? In the brain? What part of our body is it hiding in?
May I give her your wishes? Of course you can, but you'd better give her my love. These are frightening times. Why do we have to paint our windows? Well, the property of white paint is that it deflects heat from the initial blast.
Have fun. I'm fine with just sitting here with you, not doing anything special, and seeing what happens. What if this works? Did the electroshock therapy help at all? It was, uh. enlightening.
Your change is 11 euros. (Thank you. (Leon) Dad! Noah has a radio-controlled car in his backpack. (Lucas) What? It won't fit in there.
If you stick around for another 20 minutes, you'll see how much stronger it is. I can't wait for you to see the new and improved Rebecca. The question is. will you have the strength to kill her? My army of the dead will change the world for the better. It will correct the imbalance created by the recent wars.
What time did you leave the club yesterday? В 6:30? 7:00? The closing practice? It could be crucial.
I'm sorry. So what are we looking for? The main event is Mercury reversing. It'll look like the planet's moving backwards. But it's, uh. it won't?
You know I collect all sorts of military antiques? Two years ago I got my hands on an original 1916 declaration issued by the Irish Citizen Army Volunteers during the Easter Rising. Did I mention it was an original signed by Patrick Pearce* himself? You do as I ask, it's yours.
We had a deal. I'd like it to be more than that. If you think I'm gonna work for you. And you will. Because we found your weakness. It's standing right next to you.
They didn't have to. Sean is black. From the same part of town where the church stands. Guys, I think there's something wrong with our justice system. And it's getting worse because of vigilante justice.
Fred Johnson has proven himself to be a true friend of the Beltway. But as much as I fear war between Earth and Mars, I fear peace between them even more. For then they will turn their eyes on us again. Planets are not like us. An Earthling cannot look at a thing and not wonder who it belongs to.
Not yet, sir. My mother was foreign minister and took me on a diplomatic trip there when I was 15. I've trained in Earth gravity since I was a kid, but it feels different on the ground. The gravity nails one to a place. And it also depresses their spirit.
She's slipping away. I can feel it. No. No. She's still here.
Well, it could have been five, but I turned down Robie Lowe. Twice. That pain never seems to go away. Okay, that's what I said about childbirth. But she's leaving.
I'm a doctor, and that's doctor-patient confidentiality, you understand. If you're trying to catch me, try harder. You can come back with a court order, put me away, but I'll still never tell you a word about my patients. I'm just wondering what could have been said in that session to justify such a huge sum. It was commensurate with the other bonuses at Ax Capital.
You already know how to do that. Mary. What color is this wall? White. What color do you want it to be?
So make her that way. Change it. Turn the wall red, Mary. Just make it red. It's red.
I understand. It's what summer smells like to me. It's been that way all my life. But you won't appreciate it until you're as far away as I was. In a place so cold and dangerous, so devoid of life, you won't know how precious and vulnerable it is.
I realize it seems like a lot, but medication can help reduce panic attacks, dysphoria, anxiety, fear after PTSD. PTSD? Cults are all about controlling your mind, and you've been controlled for a long time. Right, right. I spoke to my coworkers, and they gave me information about a support group. It's for people who are victims of mind control.
И ... put blood on it. Mike, is it possible to put a bomb in that radio that could cause that kind of damage? Yeah. But I didn't check inside. If there was a bomb and it went off while you were examining the body--
I have a flawless shot. Dr. Palmer, are you asking me out on a date? No, no, I just want to practice my close-range punch. Okay, but be warned, I will crush you. Your confidence is impressive, but let's see how it holds up against the mill on the 12th hole.
Can you imagine having a baby in Georgia? Oh, my God. We need to pick someone we can trust for sure. Why don't you use Gary's sperm? Cause it's just sitting there.
I have a theory. Oh, my God. - What? It's the whole Helen thing. She's everywhere.
I think I'm in love. In love with what? Florida. - Florida? If you ever had a good idea, it died alone.
We'll see. But in the meantime, Quentin, Elin, Penny and Margo need battle magic. We're teaching martial arts? It used to be a required class.
All right, let's go. As far as I can tell, there's no interference. The vault is secure. So your booth can move? It can go anywhere?
Hold on a second. The room's still inside the booth. It's not an adjoining room. No. Doctor! It's more inside than outside!
TARDIS. If you're from another planet, why did you name your box in English? In another language, the abbreviation would be meaningless! - People don't usually pay attention to that. - It looks like a phone booth.
In another language, this abbreviation would be meaningless! - People don't usually pay attention to it. - She looks like a phone booth. Yeah, that's her disguise. She's kind of hiding.
That's saying a lot. Since when does the county do things by the book? I noticed one thing. They haven't interviewed anyone at the Bramford power plant. It's only four miles from where Luxman disappeared.
I'm on the run. I need a place to hide. They know about Bud. They put out an APB on his car. It's outside his shop.
Why? After what happened to us, we need to know what it is and where it came from. The answer may be on the tissue. I'm not sure about that. We need to find out where its power comes from before it kills any of us.
Nick! What was that? At the spice shop, a hand came out of the mirror? First I saw it, then I felt it. It was strangling her.
She was covered in leaves and lichen and slime, with branches instead of hands, and she picked him up. Picked him up and picked him up. - What about you? I shot her, and she didn't give a shit. And then I ran away because I thought she'd come after me.
Maybe we can do something, playfully, without harming the forest. Like a toxic dump? I think I have an idea. - What is it? - My brother and I used to love this book when we were little. Where is it?
Here! We brewed a special ointment. "Reptilian humanoids: pathology, diagnoses, treatment." Here! "Vle di Bouyi." It smells disgusting, and it's only bad for creatures with scales.
- Please. There may be information in there that can help us defeat this skull. Books can be just as dangerous. Waiting for this thing to come after us is even more dangerous, Adalind. I think one of the reasons it's connected to me is because I see these symbols.
we'll think about it. What if you don't find her? Or what if you find her, but you can't go back? Oh, my God! The wand didn't go through. It can't.
Or if you find her and you can't go back? Oh, my God! The wand didn't go through. It can't. It's not from there.
You shouldn't have come here alone! You shouldn't have come for me. Eva. You don't owe anyone anything. I don't know what you're trying to prove. But you-- I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm trying to kill this thing before it kills us.
They buried the stick? That's what everyone thinks. But it's more than that. It's not just a stick. For one thing, it heals.
You need witch's blood to get through to the other side. A wand? So Nick followed Eve. But the wand stayed here. She can't get in there.
Earlier in the show. - They told me you were dead. - That's what I thought. I hope the wand does what we think it does. - It's healing her.
Oh, my God. He killed everyone. Except me, and I don't know why. Maybe he thought you were dead or, uh. maybe the wand is protecting you. If my wand protects me, why didn't it help Hank or Wu?
- You can. With the power of the united blood. - We tried that. - No, we haven't. The power of your blood, the blood of the Grimm ancestors, all of us. it's in you.
With the power of the united blood. - We tried that. - No, we haven't. The power of your blood, the blood of the Grimm ancestors, all of us. it's in you. It makes us who we are.
Ross. Ross! Search the place! "Young Captain Ross is truly sorry." Oh, yes, he'll be sorry he sent home a hat because it won't fit his head when I pay him back!
Another dozen men escaped, but we split up. They headed for the coast. I left my post. The thought of freedom overwhelmed me. It overwhelms us all.
Madam President, let me tell you a story about my childhood in the suburbs of Gurjaani. You thought you had caught a fish, but it was a tire. The tire was full of fish. It's a beautiful story. It teaches a very valuable lesson, but I have to go.
It's just always like that, you know? He'll do something, then I'll do something back, and so on. That kind of friendship? I don't even know how to describe it. - Was it legendary?
I don't. Are we just gonna listen to this song over and over again the whole way through? I'm just trying to understand. Tammy said "Walk To The Peak" was God's favorite. It's so haunting.
- Or you. I'm still very young. And really ambitious. I don't argue, captain, but I can wait. And I like my life the way it is, you know?
Who are you and what did you do to Carisi? You really think so? We'll talk in 20 years. We will. And you'll realize that, uh. work doesn't change you, it reveals who you really are.
Nothing. I did that last week, too. It was at the store, and I was there buying stuff for the house. That's usually where black people shop. I hear a patrol car pull up. I heard it stop.
The sooner we start the fight..... Emergency radiation. Yeah. A small dose just to stabilize the tumor in his lung. It'll cure the pancreatitis and give you and your father some time to choose your treatment. And if I do agree to surgery afterward, will it be safer?
My wife had a necklace, a gift from her mother. И... she never took it off, but in the accident, the clasp broke. And I know she wished she had it on. I understand. It could be in her hands during surgery.
I mean medication, social training to help you understand body language. There's a new therapy called stimulation, but I'd recommend you try the traditional methods first. Stimulation? Transcranial magnetic stimulation. So far it's only been approved for depression, but there's also interesting evidence that it can help people with spectrum disorder.
We spent a lot of money. No one could find anything. Mom, it's not your stomach. It's my head. It's throbbing.
Always has been. Wow. A couple of years ago, he realized the mountains weren't enough for him. He loved his life. It's not over.
I'll give you time. Why did he do it? Even if he was in trouble, why? I don't know. Have you ever seen Jason do that trick where you pick a card from the deck and it ends up in his pocket?
I'd like that book for once, I-I could determine-- No. No. No one's gonna touch it. When this is over, I will personally destroy this book. Because it's dangerous, of course.
- software that programs you to die. - Maybe. But I have something you'll never have. a soul. that will exist even after I'm dead. What makes you so sure I don't have one? If the soul doesn't come from flesh and blood or my ones and zeros, it must come from somewhere else, somewhere that isn't connected to our physical bodies.
- Yes, sir. That's enough for now. Agent Simmons? Not comforting news, I'm afraid. The serum that gave you your powers. it's, uh. theoretically lethal.
- Because of what? Glioblastoma of the brain. I know, boring. It's just a variety of brain tumors. But at least it's in a very interesting place,
They stole you out of his life. What if he never knew me? What if he doesn't remember? This, uh. reality is flawless. - It's enticing.
You know what? It's a long story. Just, uh. move on. The Resistance must have an operational base. - Where is it?
- On my command. I was so sure. I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing. No, she's building it here, just not in this world. And now I know what it's for.
Maybe I'll experience it now. with you. By all means, destroy this body. It was designed only to kill. My head, which you ripped off, now controls many of these machines. And you don't know where it is.
- I'm as surprised as you are. - What happened? Darkhold. My arm still hurts. Why won't it heal?
Okay. I'm your long-lost twin sister. I look just like you. I even have a tiny dimple on my chin. She's your doppelganger.
Not a single shot could have come from the car. What does that mean? That the shots were fired before. I don't know exactly when, but definitely before the incident. Helen, they were fired by someone standing by the car when it was stationary.
The vault? In Osaka. What if the soul doesn't fit? It's like organ donation. The body rejects a kidney if it doesn't fit.
Blue blood. Blue eye. Our car was that color. Found it on a classifieds site. It smelled like maple syrup.
Very nice. I almost forgot about that. Holy shit. A rose is a rose, but not here. It has to mean something here.
And at the moment when hope is gone, our savior will stand before the terrified masses. Genius. The world's on its knees, wondering where it belongs, just like a girl in a threesome. Your uniform. Some might find it a little flamboyant.
Genius. The world is on its knees, wondering where to stick it, just like a girl during a threesome. Your uniform. Some people think it's a little bright. It's, uh. striking.
Where we first met. Newton believed that light was made up of particles. Professor Godfrey was talking about the wave theory of light. And you walked through the door. Well, a wave needs a medium in which to propagate.
Well, I'd rather not, uh. keep my partner waiting. Uh, sure. Uh, sure. I just, uh. wanted to give you a gift to thank you for, uh. your candor. It's priceless.
I reach out for him, but... he slips away. Like a ghost at dawn. And I stay here. I wish this story had been different. I wish it had shown me in a better light.
Having fun, Dad? Yes! Good! But you could turn the music down a bit. - What? The music. it's very loud.
I hope you can hear me. Tell Daddy and Sahar I'm okay. - Oh, Jonesy, thank God! - (yoga) I'm not Jonesy! We know about your secret room, where is it?
- (Abdullah) Nice try, but I'm no help to you. I got my own problems. - Are you praying in here? You got a signal in here? - (Hassan) I think I'll have the fish fry. - (Abdullah) It's for beer, not halal.
Sounds wonderful. - It's cold. - Yeah, I don't cook hot. I'm afraid to turn on the stove. It might catch fire.
And even higher in heels. Are you arresting me? ! Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence, that's not possible. So I'll have this blood analyzed, and if it turns out to be the victim's, I'll arrest you.
- Sorry to interrupt. - Perfect timing, Gideon. Your daughter Lily's algorithm has located another piece of the Spear. Well, trouble doesn't come alone. Where is it, Gideon?
It's about time. You know what that kind of power makes me? A villain? A devil? It makes me God.
Don't call me that. You prefer human language, wife? I am no longer bound to you. The bed has been cold for 300 years without you. It always has been.
So you're saying that Jeremiah Danvers, former DEO agent and missing father of Alex and Kara, has returned from Cadmus with news that our enemy has developed nuclear weapons using Kara's extraterrestrial heat vision radiation, and that they're going to blow up National City and just kill us all? Will this place hold up against the bombs? You can track the remnants of Kara's heat vision radiation. Right, yeah, if the bomb is loaded, then yeah, I can locate it until it detonates.
No! No! No! No! The painting. Where is it?
What's up, girl? So-so. I got something for you. I just finished running a diagnostic on this little beauty. And she, my friend, is in perfect condition.
That's all that matters. Unless they use the Supergirl defense. What? It's a thing criminals use to get charges dropped. She deeply resents the defense attorney.
You'll have a shitload of FBI agents at your disposal, and here's how I suggest you use them: Axelrod. Bobby Axelrod's actions are almost impossible to trace. So we need to monitor not only his operations, but everyone he comes in contact with and everyone they come in contact with. The pattern will be subtle, but it will be there.
So the director shouldn't expect so many competencies for such a salary Das vare läherlih? /nem. Isn't that funny? / ME? ME. I think she'll be good for you.
- You don't need to know. And neither does Dominic, okay? Two bottles on the count, but only one leaves the bar. - What happens to the second bottle? - It magically disappears, and the paperwork checks out.
They're not right. Sometimes they're wrong. You stopped answering Christmas cards. I'm sorry. My career, it's kind of consumed me.
- That boy who has your magic wand. - Sonic screwdriver. - What do you mean, a screwdriver? - In a very broad sense. - Why is it sonic?
You're insane. No. I'm being reasonable. Monogamy is not natural. It's created by religious authority.
They run through the pipes. They tend to... rise because of the capillary effect... I have a physics question. Today I was in the bathtub, dunked my head and at the same time my hairbrush hit my finger. It landed on the cast iron and the sound was very loud under the water.
Yes. Why? Scientists think that light travels through a special invisible medium. It's called the ether. But if it's invisible, how do we know it's there?
- Yeah. No judgment. She's a beauty. Deadly, but beautiful. Yes, sir. Take care of the rifle, and it will take care of you.
But you. You have a gift. Come on. What do you think of this sculpture? I don't know, it's just a sculpture. Focus, Liz. It sucks. It sucks.
Mileva has a marvelous mind. I can see why you were attracted to her. It was like an eternity ago. Love is a chemical reaction. Sometimes it burns.
I'll contact B.D.M.D. Hoover will take care of the professionals. Thank you, sir. I'll leave the Kleenex for now. If you screw up again, she'll be waiting for you.
And appease them by offering something the critics can't argue with - proof. In the form of astronomical photographs. Take Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun. Unlike the other seven planets, Mercury's orbit doesn't follow Newton's laws. It's different.
I can assure you that the rumors remain at the speculation stage, but still I would be careful. Scandal is very hard to stop, and it always ends worse for women than for men. Thank you, Berta, but I'm afraid I must leave you. And the deflection must surely be exactly 83 hundredths of a second of an arc. We'll use Riemann geometry for this, it contains some invariants for transformations....
We should stop and take a look. That's what an old car is. Ruiz! Give me the flashlight from the glove compartment. - I used to work on my dad's car. If it overheats.
- (Angus) We'll work on it. - (ravi) And exhale. - (Liv) What's happening? - (ravi) the good news is the fluid is out of your lungs for now. But it'll come back and take its revenge.
I like Claire. I thought you knew. I like Diaz, but we can't go down because of what she did. You can't pull the lever. You have to let fate take its course or it's gonna get back at you.
И... and I used to be used to the fact that before, you could-- you could, if you wanted to, you could find someone to talk to, you know? Or, uh. Or keep their secrets and... Now it's, "Fuck you, prisoner. I'm gonna ruin your fucking life just because I can." It's like human kindness just evaporated and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.
But what's in the comments? The comments are usually positive. "Fuck the system." "Give these ladies what they want." That sort of thing. I guess you can't deny cruelty when it pops up in your Facebook newsfeed.
Because we won. We fought and we won. And you're a blind asshole. And you-- My humanity was gone for a while. but it's slowly coming back.
- No, you pick one. One there, you know, where people can see it. My tattoo's not for me. It's-- It's for other people.
It's a long story. You taught me something. That, uh. Love hurts. You taught me that life-- It hurts.
There's hope that people are thinking straight. Darling. Don't fill your bright head with gloomy thoughts. The war is finally over. I can't help feeling it's only just begun.
- Uh-huh. I guess that's how they did it. It was hard collaborative magic. Yeah, here are the notes for version 2.0. It's much easier.
Uh, sure. David, come on in. I just read your article. It's impressive. I hope it gives you something to shoot for on quantum theory.
David, come in. I just read your article. It's impressive. I hope it gives you something to shoot for on quantum theory. Yeah, and it came just in time.
I don't have much talent, but I'm very, very curious, Alice. I was just asking questions, like you. That's the most important thing. Anyone can do that. You know, I was looking at the moon last night and I wondered why it wasn't falling.
You want to have children. What would you do if it was your son, Shahir? - Okay. - Enucleating the tumor. It's in a tricky spot, right on the pancreatic duct.
All my life I've been nice, polite, never bothered anyone. You know what I got for that? Dog shit in my locker, chewing on the seat of my bike. beaten up on the way home from school. And you don't want to go back to that. That tumor may have made me crazy, but it also made my life better.
Gahr... - Oh, my God. - What's wrong with him? Maybe I just have a crooked uterus. No, Catherine, it's porcelain and perfect.
I went back for him, and he-- I'm sorry. Did you see what it was? And the radio? It wasn't working.
If they're working with spies, I'll find them. I assume you're well motivated. It's healing nicely. Sabine will be pleased. I could defend Marigold better if I knew what she was about,
Alec? What are you doing in my father's office? You mentioned his model train. He doesn't use it anymore. I think it reminds him too much of what life used to be like.
Translate if you need to, Cristina, I'll understand. Or you can stay and go on a mission next time. I won't-- I won't keep you. The information's been sent to Berlin. It matches the rumors they heard from Oslo, Bergen.
With one dick you can jack off by yourself and that's it, but when you have three, suddenly you're having sex for six. Is that more powerful? I don't think your metaphor makes any fucking sense at all. It doesn't have to. She just distracted you for the time it took Alice to strengthen the spell, which is what a protection spell is supposed to do.
All right, gentlemen? We've figured out your game, Philbrick. We've compared stories. Someday I'll tell the truth, but you won't believe it. Because it's more extraordinary than your tiny minds can comprehend.
She was normal. My heart is broken. But we're gonna be okay, right? Everything will go back to normal and we'll set a new wedding date. Oh, it's gonna be beautiful.
♪ I'll wake her up ♪ ♪ Your heart is before me ♪ ♪ Your heart is before me ♪ ♪ I have your courage ♪ ♪ She turned me ♪
- You're a devil. You are your mother's child. God will punish you for your sins. - This disease. It will play into our hands.
When this car went into production in 1990, it was considered outstanding because it was as fast and exhilarating as a Ferrari. But unlike the Ferrari of the day, it was amazingly reliable and very easy to drive. "Honda discontinued it 12 years ago, but they eventually made a replacement for it. So I went to our proving ground to see what the new one was like. This is it. It costs £138,000.
They have no mechanical connection to the pedal. And that's because they harvest energy and send it to the battery for charging. It's much smarter than what the Porsche 918 does, a car that costs five times as much. And then there's the hybrid system. It doesn't use one electric motor, as you might expect, but three.
Well-trained men remove its casing, which will then be transplanted in a neat two-hour operation SAFETY ON THE SEA to the internal organs of the earth-digging V8. The next morning my incredible car was ready. Incredibly, in a barn I was able to create something that the entire automotive industry could not. It's a true sports SUV. DIFFERENTIAL OFF-OFF-OFF I've called it the MGD. Now let's see how it performs on the road.
No. I put a reserve on it. - What reserve? - 100 000. - 100 000? - So it didn't sell at all and you spent 14,000 corporate pounds?
The pumps feed the result up through the cabin and into this water purification system. And you get the purest drinking water at the end. Food, you're gonna need it. I have a chicken. She lays eggs, they go in there.
That's my urine! Did you make this? Yes, he did! I'd back off if I were you. The problem with chicken is that it's running around inside and it's very...
They put the door in the wrong place. It should have been moved much farther back. That's genius. There's something else. It doesn't have the beauty of design.
I know, it was cool. It's like watching a gorilla who found an apple and a banana in his cage. I love apples, but I love bananas too - what do I want, an apple or a banana? - Hammond. - You know, you could have both. - Hammond. This is a magnificent car and it only costs 60,000.
If you make a car that's great for racing at the Nürburgring, it's made just for that, and nothing else. It's like equipping a house for a game of laser quest. It would be great for a laser quest game, but would be unsuitable for a party because it's dark, full of lasers and fog and music, and people will think they're in Star Wars. Or you could get a dog and train him as a guard, which is great if you live in a warehouse and need a guard dog. But if you take it home as a pet, it will eat your kids. And completely useless.
He's weird. We were walking through the airport, recently connecting in Chicago, and he started: "Jeremy, smell my jacket." - Really? - Yeah. That's what he said: "Smell my jacket." I said: "Why?" "Because it smells like old record players."
And then you had to strap it to the boat. I don't understand straps with buckles. - There's plenty of water in the boat. - It was already there when I bought it. It's leaking.
I'll catch up to that boat. Oh, great. Look at that sun. That's the fastest thing I-- Why is it faster than me?
We loved it in the Caribbean. And so did our camera crews. And we thought it would be great to make a movie next week about comparing the car culture of the French, Germans and British. - Yeah, that was a great idea. - Great. But Mr. Wilman, our producer, decided that it wasn't great at all, and that instead we would go to the north of France with three old cars and drive in the rain there.
Yes. Chicken is a vegetable. No, it's not. Scientifically, a chicken is a vegetable. If you cut off its head, it keeps running... There you go! So it doesn't have a mind. - It's a highly evolved vegetable.
Yes! No May? No, nor will he be, for I was in another part of the harbor, according to my cunning plan. Last night, when these two had gone to bed, I had arranged that our boat would be waiting for me in the harbor. Here she is.
Let's talk about the main point, which is: James May, you lost and crashed our boat. - That's true. - Wait a minute. My car was closer to England than yours. Yeah, and it was also closer to the bottom of the sea than ours.
It's all irrelevant, because my car is the only one that hasn't broken down. Mine was perfectly fine, too, Hammond. Mine was as reliable as James's hands. The amazing thing is, nobody knows what happened to it. It fell off the tow truck.
Mine was perfectly fine, too, Hammond. Mine was as safe as James's hands. The amazing thing is, nobody knows what happened to it. It fell off the tow truck. No, nobody knows what fault caused it to end up on that tow truck.
It's a new way of understanding yourself as a human being. The last word in luxury. That statement is a bit expensive, isn't it? If you have the money for a car like this, you can buy a Jaguar and you'll have £130,000 left over to hire a PR man, he'll push you on TV and you'll declare how cool you are. It costs £130,000 more for a reason.
It has the same basic aluminum structure inside as the Jaguar XE, which is a great car, so that's a good thing. I only have a supercharged three-liter six-cylinder engine, which means 375 horsepower, which is 225 less than - let's be honest - James' luxuriously trimmed version of the Audi Q7. But it's a lightweight car, so you can't call it slow. I like the way this thing behaves. I like that when changing direction, when turning, it controls its weight, which is there, along the axles, which makes it feel nimble and light.
We're not that stupid. Just like leaving the gates open at the lions in a safari park doesn't mean we're all going to run to a lion picnic. The British economy has grown 58% in the last 15 years. And the German economy has grown 102%. All this is because we drive at 32 km/hour and they drive at 320 km/hour. Speed is good for business. It also saves lives.
The reboot completely wiped my memory. Android, can I do something? Don't even think about it. The neural link is a major advantage. It allows complete control of the ship - shields, navigation, weapons.
I have an idea. 5-AYA: Six, come in. Go ahead. Talk to me. Jake said to pump up the rear tire. It's flat.
How soon will it reach the outer edges of the station? If the present rate of collapse is maintained, in less than half an hour. 2-AYA: Are you sure? I double-checked the readings. Whatever that white wall outside is, it's getting closer.
2-AYA: Are you sure? I double-checked the readings. Whatever that white wall outside is, it's coming. We've got to hurry. Get the engine and get out of here before it hits us.
You think you can convince the workers? Yes. I'll show them it's the best thing for them. I gotta say, you surprised me. You got a bad reputation, but it's not true.
What's he doing out there? We're on our way. You should know. The anomaly is increasing in intensity. It appears to be drawing power from the station's fusion reactor.
When my comrade Boone woke up, he said it was a portal. He also said he could hear voices. Maybe he does. He was possessed by a creature like that. We were able to get it out, but what if it was affecting him?
Do you think you've lost faith, Father? Faith? How could I lose it? I have just seen the demon and the smoke rising from the abyss, sent to torment us, just as the Gospel said. I am afraid, not because I am losing my faith, but because it is stronger than ever.
Engaging stabilizers. Inverting engine thrust. What else am I missing? By surrendering to the power of-- Meditation doesn't help land a stupid ship! But it does help me stay on my feet.
Great, so Cassandra and I will go to New York, and you guys can go to South Carolina. No. I should go there alone. He can be a little cranky. Eve can't go anyway. I have my own mission and it takes priority.
- Oh, yeah. Last time we spoke, you were in the anger stage. Now you've moved on to bargaining. You can't really bargain with a tumor. So if, uh. it could stay a part of you and you could go on living?
You have to believe me. Let me prove it. - How? - The secret lab. If it's really there, we're telling the truth.
Soon a butterfly will be born from it. When I was little, like you, I saw it happen. But the butterfly was having a hard time. So I decided to help it. I opened the cocoon very carefully and the butterfly crawled out. But it couldn't fly.
We've got a lot of them here - me, Sacker - who were given a place when they were born. But you came here knowing what it's like to be an outsider, that's why you're so fierce. But rage still rules you, not you over it. Right now, it's directed at me, and it's doing you no good. Turn it to another target, and it becomes a weapon, not a problem.
Axelrod lacks five of the eight virtues of bushido. - Six. He's been impolite often enough. - In that case, samurai honor doesn't require silence or suicide. It requires revenge.
Is it bad for my reputation? - If you didn't say it, it would hurt the campaign, but I can make it into an anti-bullying manifesto, and when you and I are done, you'll be signing baseball bats to voters. - (laughs) Okay. This is my greatest vulnerability. And it's in your hands.
No, it's the deliberate abuse of the man who beat and raped me. Well, they fit everything. Colonel Omar al-Saleh is pushing women's rights harder and harder year after year. Absolutely, and that's why this photo op is so important. It sends an important message.
I suppose you'll be needing my plane? - May I, please? - Well, since you ask. I want to say something about my paella. It's so good, what happens when you taste it, Will?
- Yes! Excellent. So, what do you think of our manuscript? I mean, it's a rough draft, but, uh. - I think it's very interesting.
Thank you. - That was amazing. - Yeah. As my dad used to say, "If that speech were a horse, it would be a unicorn."
- Absolutely. I think you should be honored that I thought your story was special enough to use. Did you really like it? Uh, actually, uh. You know, my dad used to have a saying. He used to say, "If this speech were a horse, it would be a unicorn.
I think you should be honored that I thought your story was special enough to use. Did you really like it? Uh, actually, uh. You know, my dad used to have a saying. He used to say, "If that speech were a horse, she'd be a unicorn. Because it was magical."
Look, I've been in this situation. With a stroller? I'm just asking because it's like I'm already with a stroller. This wedding is not gonna make it to the wedding palace. I don't think it's gonna make it to the car.
I always end up there, too. We'd like to officially invite you to the party. Yeah. You should invite them. She can be a slumber party.
- (Major) Okay. (Ravi) You know, I've prepared a whole speech. Sincere and funny. Deep. But what's the point if you're gonna forget it anyway? Let's just say it was brilliant.
I don't know how to do that, ma'am. Yes. I'll try. I understand your concern, Senator. Student loan reform is a priority for you, and it will be for the president and me.
Anything else? He told us to get the book from the widow. Yeah, it's gonna be tough now, but if we see Azra-- Baji, I know where the book is. Not bad. You should have stepped in sooner. It's in the conservatory.
My blood will no longer kill an innocent. Please. Only your blood can save us. My blood is a curse. But it will allow me to hide in the rain.
We have to give you anesthesia. And if we don't? You'll die. The liver needs time. I mean, we're keeping it here as a precaution, but it needs to heal itself.
You have to forgive yourself. Forgive yourself, Charlie. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No! They had to live! All your life, Charlie, you've been surrounded by death, and it's still coming for you.
Your package. it squeaks or whistles. Which one? The box. It's alive.
I hope so. Look how we got the truth out of each other. Yeah. And you and your aura. I think it's, uh. bright, iridescent, pastel.
I'm not going on sick leave. Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend hurt you, and then tried to inject you with poison. I think you deserve a couple days of sick leave. You've been working on that leopard tattoo for two weeks. maybe Sandstorm didn't put it on Jane because it's lame. Or did they realize she might expose them?
- It's a nice apartment. I saw the knife that killed Jones. That's not your knife, that's Freddy's. Peterson solved the leopard tattoo. It leads to Cat Jarrett.
So it's all for nothing? Not necessarily. We just need to show these pictures to Roman. I don't think that's a good idea. No, the tattoo doesn't point to Pharrell, it points to Kat.
But some alumni use it in life after college to justify some shady business deeds. Like being a key figure in the dark internet. Let he who is without sin-- Focus, Rich. This version of the formula. what's it for?
He? Are you serious? Check out his harness. That's Willy Wonka's golden ticket. It opens every door in this building.
I want to know salvation! Syphilis. The great pox. For a while I masked his sinful rash and skillfully applied theatrical makeup, but now..... It has overwhelmed his mind.
Get a house like this. Living the American dream. Yeah, I'm not exactly cut out for the laid-back country life. You know what I mean. Whatever you think of your old life, it was better than this one.
How's the mental status? Good, she's calm. I mean her husband. And how do you use this thing? It's for rectal exams.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter at all. That's not what this is about. I literally ruined my entire life for this play. That's why I'm here, sir. And the crazy thing is, it's really good, it is.
When? You know, they just, uh. They make it so complicated, man. It's too fucking complicated. We're gonna go back to that bar next week. And one way or another, we're gonna get our money. Yeah, I'm gonna live the life I was supposed to have instead of waiting for it to find me.
The photographer initially agreed to provide us with her work, but backed out at the last minute. Why did she decide to back out? Okay, I just, uh. I think it's a story worth fighting for. It's pure gold to us. She is what she is, no play on words.
That's not what we discussed. I know, I, uh... I took a swing. Definitely. She's perfect.
No, I'm not hungry. How about you? Do you have any specialties? The crispy pork with Chinese broccoli is probably our favorite. It's amazing.
L-A-Y-C... Mr. Hunley, are you refusing to cooperate with the investigation? This is Sergeant Arnott, leave a message. Sarge, we've got the license plate number. It belongs to Nicholas Huntley, Roz's husband.
I want the full version of Cottan's dying declaration. - Morning, Ian. - Good morning, sir. Sir, as you know, my department operates under unilateral protection. This part of the tape was released because it was used in court.
It's not working out. Roz Huntley has proven that you are an ineffective organization. - A corrupt organization. - Sir, I must protest! You know Ted, I don't think we know the half of Matthew Cottan's dealings, and the real reason you're keeping the full tape secret is because it will give the critics of AC-12 a trump card.
The younger copy is in somber contemplation of his future, of what he will become. If you're interested, there are other copies from this period in the next room. - I beg your pardon. - Hmm? Where can I find an Abyssinian ceramic collection? "Alas, it is not on display."
I've put the fight in your favor. Did you ask her about the camera? -What? Your camera. It's in her locker.
There's still a lot to do before we shoot. Are we filming here? - In this gray, depressing hole? No. Bash and I are gonna look at the set. It's expensive, but I don't write the checks, so--
- Yeah - you eat what you want? Well... Sometimes we get airplane food and sometimes we get Lebanese food - It's different, but it's very good
- I didn't invite you - I wanted to support women's sports I have a new parking lot at work. My car is dirty. It's under a fig tree.
This is gonna be awesome. Who would even throw this out? The net's a little crumpled. You're what? It's perfect.
I'm still me! - For now. All your power, Margaret. Hard-won power. Can you feel it slipping through your fingers?
Yo. Am I dreaming? I-- I saw a chunk of ice, a huge one. Can you take me to it? - (syd) can you take me to it? - (david) "can"? - I keep thinking about that door, the way it comes and goes.
Your rational part. You're having a nervous breakdown. a stress response. Your power is trying to save you. It created me.
She didn't write "unbearable" with an E. She wrote her "life has become unbearable" with an E. There's no such word. Our situation is not "unbearable." It's "unbearable."
So what are you gonna do? Send James to kill him? James has a terrible habit of creating the very problems he's supposed to solve. Why did you leave the eyewitness? He gave me a purpose, but it was false.
YEAR: 2046 Here. Finally getting the pool done? Do we need this wall? It's load-bearing, so yes.
Do we know them? And more importantly. do any of them look like me? That's the problem with first responders. You're connected to time, but you can't see the big picture. It's moving and changing.
- He said that every German needs to see the City of Lights at least once - so he organized an invitation for me. - Hmm! Here's to the Brigadefuhrer. I don't like vodka. It burns my throat. - Haha!
That's how I choose to think of him, if anyone can take him. Isn't that sad? No, not really. It's like a soul, you know? No one knows for sure if it exists.
I've been looking all over for you. You shouldn't be here, Monty. Nobody should be here. Do you know why the moon is red? Is it really red?
Nothing could be more legitimate. Mossad ran a shadow operation on American soil. If the FBI finds out about this, there'll be an international incident. - Where's the system? - It's right here.
James Maddox was just convenient. The BNM money allowed me to buy someone at the top of the food chain. I promised them a telecontrol system capable of overcoming the Iron Dome. After six months of work, I have no intention of starting over. So where is it?
You guys know Arkani's making a bomb, but you don't know if he has a lair nearby? No. And it's not a bomb. It's a missile guidance system designed to penetrate the Iron Dome. In the wrong hands, it could endanger thousands of lives.
No. And it's not a bomb. It's a missile guidance system designed to penetrate the Iron Dome. In the wrong hands, it could endanger thousands of lives. Then I'd rather have it in my hands.
I'm sure it'll all work out. I admit I'm surprised. I'm not amazed at a lot of things, but this is a miracle, that's all. We recovered a bullet from the body. It matches the caliber of the revolver we found in your possession, the one that was recently fired.
Thank you, sir. And congratulations again. Are you sure you want me to do this? Perhaps it's best left to someone else. I want the truth, wherever it leads.
But nothing here says Florence Lesser was murdered. What? The newspaper thumbnail. That's the clue. And I think I know where it is.
And I think I know where she is. My umbrella! What do you hope to find? A miniature of the newspaper, sir. Where is it?
A victim of a broken heart. But then that idiot, my husband, fancied himself a home defense against burglars. What are you doing? Everything okay in there? When a butterfly needs to get out of its chrysalis, it looks for the weakest point.
I'm stuck and I can't move forward. What do you think is slowing you down? I slept with Eddie. Love is often stronger than faith. It can be a prison that keeps us from becoming who we could be.
What do you think is slowing you down? I slept with Eddie. Love is often stronger than faith. It can be a prison that keeps us from becoming what we could be. It weakens us. I want you to close your eyes, Sarah.
Uh, no. Better yet. no suspension. I'm doing my best, but you're not helping. I can't let disobedience to authority get in the way. You can't make my job here any harder than it already is.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. I got her, I got her. Get her back on the ice. The mother's remaining kidney is thrombosed. She's dead.
And they shouldn't. - Hey! Hey. Busy? Yeah, I'm gonna paint a wall and watch it dry.
A flash drive. Did it look like this? Yes. And what happened when we put this flash drive into our computer? It ran a virus on our system.
How did I not see it on the bank statement? Why put the money I need to escape in the dead of night in the bank? It's in my getaway bag. It's hard not to take it personally, but, uh. where is that bag? It's in the, uh. в...
They'd like to destroy him. Let me put it any way you lawyers like. Your clients bought a stolen car, and now, to avoid seeing the rightful owner behind the wheel, they want the car scrapped. Mr. Hite fertilized an egg. She's half his.
- Yeah. Well. To stand trial for Margaret's murder. You also have to find the club. Otherwise, the prosecution will say you got rid of it by killing Margaret. Any idea where it is?
- Let's get started. Here's what we know: Rutger, uh. ate Josh's beluga-- Wait, this squiggly thing is a fish? Draw waves on top so it's underwater.
Go ahead. I'll listen, I promise. I won't cover my ears. Okay, Trixie can go to private school, and that's really, really good for her. But she's super exclusive, and I'm not sure I want her growing up in that environment.
He's ugly. That's the main thing. Okay, here's the plan. We have a fight. It escalates, and I dramatically turn the table.
Next time, I'd prefer an MRI. Do you have any idea how expensive that is? I've got another year on my I.V.P., and I-- Look, the MRI won't hurt. It's gonna hurt me because there's no indication that he needs it.
If it's in her esophagus, chances are it's also in her spine. You risk paralyzing her if you try to get it out. Okay. We can at least remove the tumor from her heart, get rid of her symptoms. Sure, it'll grow back, but slowly, she'll have more time.
Daddy! Mommy! Natalie showed me a snake! - It was a caterpillar. - She said it would one day turn into a beautiful butterfly.
Look, whatever happens, you don't have to release me, no matter how bad it gets. Thank you. I wanted to thank you, Linc. I want to thank you for your sacrifice. I want you to know it won't be in vain.
She just laughed and said, "We'll see about that." That night she took the boy from the cell across the hall. Dragged him into her tower and whipped him. He screamed, his screams echoing off the walls, begging for someone to stop her. I reached my cell door, it was open.
People are ugly. I'm just saying Koreatown has a rich and complex history, presenting unique political challenges. You've said it and said it and said it. Look, I'd listen to you talk about zoning all day long, but the blue Subaru that shot at us isn't going to find itself, so we'd... The point is, I requested backup for you, and it just showed up.
Don't you get it, man? Your impulse was a "scar" of reality triggered on your subconscious. A "scar" of reality. So, what does this fun gun do? In theory, it targets irregularities in the hippocampus, and acts like a "Ctrl+Z" on memories.
So, what does this fun gun do? In theory, it targets abnormalities in the hippocampus, and acts like a "Ctrl+Z" on memories. "Ctrl+Z"? Like the "undo" command on a computer. Well, I was going to try the new version on my last test subject, but then I got scared it might melt brains.
Sumerian alabaster statuette. 5,000 years old. From who? Should I leave it on the table? It's very beautiful.
"A Trojan horse to infect the file system? I'm an amateur, but I'm a fast learner. And the negative view? One of these days, our luck's gonna run out. She's gonna snap and ruin everything.
I'll repeat the question: what kind of doctor? Endocrinologist. I have a tumor in my brain. It's not malignant, but, uh.
Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna grab my laundry and go to the laundromat. Uh, just one question. It's in the basement.
- I don't know how this thing works. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I need it to-- I need it to spin.
What's this? It's, uh. my theme song. Also known as a distress signal. You like distress calls? It's when you see the true face of the universe... when it asks for your help.
Die with dignity. No... - No! Our vitals. He's hooked them up to the cooling system. If we die, it'll open up.
Doctor! Look, a stone mound from the Picts' civilization. A bird! What's wrong with her? She said "darkness".
A bird! What's wrong with her? She said "darkness." That's why we're in a hurry - it's not so bright this time of day. But she's talking!
So stupid. I mean, there it is: I did this because I'll never give me a F. Yeah, but philosophy is something bigger than that. It teaches you how to really think.
Last year I climbed mountains in Canada. I'm sorry, sir. But your map doesn't fit. - What? It's rejected.
300 pounds! 300 pounds? Well, I've always said I think this lamp is rather... ugly. You obviously don't love it enough! Be careful, it's ancient Roman.
Be careful, it's Roman. I wonder if it's from around the time those coins were found at Chedworth. - We're engravers, not auctioneers. If you want it refurbished, it'll cost a pound and a half. It's in perfect condition.
We're like the Flintstones. There's a program called Lotus 1-2-3. Could save you a lot of time. I might make a suggestion to the boss if I knew what we were talking about. I can show you how it works.
¬all of you stay home or find shelter. "What if you-- Listen, it's flooding out there. √Where? In the kitchen. "there's water everywhere. "it's coming in.
Death is a huge minus for me. I like them young and alive. Don't forget that. Are you sure this batch is okay. Well, I haven't checked, because that way I'd destroy the cure target, but yeah, it's fine.
- No, I won't sign it! God, you're a fucking sadist! You're insane. I'm tempted to say yes just to watch you waste your time. This technology wasn't working when Peter described it, and it's not working now.
God, you're a fucking sadist! You're insane. I'm tempted to agree just to watch you waste your time. This technology wasn't working when Peter described it, it's not working now. - In fact, it's working now.
You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. It's not going to explode. The rocket, it's not gonna blow up with us.
Not yet. Who knows what the URC will do with what you've given them. You think it's just information, But it could just be a distraction. Who knows what doors it'll open.
Smashing a guard's head in for a baseball card, I think that's awful. Uh, look. I had nothing to do with that. Please, Mr. Charles, if you insist on being innocent, it'll only make things worse when we find the stolen item in your car or your house or wherever. Why don't you tell us where it is?
Come on, get out. This way, how are you? Admiring yourself, Ms. Traub? Or are you looking for blood spatter from your ex-boyfriend's murder? When we found blood on Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Pride Bunark or his accomplice.
Admiring yourself, Ms. Traub? Or are you looking for blood spatter from your ex-boyfriend's murder? When we found blood on Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Pride Bunark or his accomplice. We were wrong. It was Ryan's.
I can't stop thinking about M.K. and Cosima, who is out there alone somewhere. Why do I love my sisters so much when they ruined my life. Hey, your life isn't ruined. It's just waiting for you to come back and rock.
You're wonderful. I'm so glad I have this choice. Edward was a scientist. He always told me that energy is not created or destroyed. That it just exists.
Beauty is inevitable. This car smells like cherries. Can we keep it? No, sweetie. It's a rental.
Hi, Naomi. My mom wanted to thank you for letting me stay with you this weekend. No problem. Nice car. It's a rental.
I don't want to look at you. I don't want to... I don't want to do anything with you. Why are you here? Because I want to help you, because I love you. I'm so tired of people who talk about love and have no idea what it means.
Caspar used to check out of the hotel if he didn't like the carpet. What are you working on? Trying to create the perfect apartment. It's not going anywhere. If you cure a dog, it should be healthy.
A homemade filter that your department buys for all the townspeople. Odd, you didn't tell me you held a patent. You have a degree in materials science. And before civil service, you tried your hand at entrepreneurship. However, your water filtration system didn't find its niche, it was too expensive for the average consumer and not high-end enough for large institutions.
- That's-- - Stupid, really stupid. I'm sorry. - That's great, Josh. I think you just invented democracy, and it's gonna save Fillory.
Hunger, yeah. Right. (chuckles) Mitchell's on a diet right now, by the way. How are you eating now? Less. Honey, I see what you're doing, but this whole control thing. it's messy.
My minister has been killed. His wife is murdered. A murderer has taken her own life. And this epidemic continues to spread. It is within my walls.
His wife was murdered. The killer took her own life. And this epidemic continues to spread. It is within my walls. It is in my blood and in my mind.
Go ahead. Shall we dance? I'd love to. That's a beautiful song. Can you tell me what it's about?
Don't do that. What? That cute little brainiac smile of yours, don't do that. I didn't realize I was doing it. You do, and it's annoying and kind of judgmental, to be honest.
What's inactive? The pyramid. We're monitoring it. Why? What was she doing?
Get straight to the explanation. It's the Doctor. Found it. A laboratory in Yorkshire. In a nutshell, a displaced decimal point that created a bacterium that turns all living things into dirt. And why would it destroy the world?
We give him two minutes, then we go in. Agreed? Agreed. There's a toxic air filtration system in here. It runs every half hour.
Agreed? Agreed. There's a toxic air filtration system in here. It runs every half hour. It'll release the bacteria into the atmosphere.
I too hope to visit you sometime in the future. "There are places." That's right. It's a beautiful day. planned. The only thing that was impromptu was that speech, but, you know, it's, uh. you know. like. I think it's cool.
We're leaving. - Why? - You lied. You stole our trip. It was our family tradition, and you may think it's stupid, but it's ours.
Dr. Smith, you may remember Dr. Chakrabarti, our pathologist. He used to work at the CDC, and we asked him to come in and help translate the scientific language. I don't think you'll need much translating. All month long, Seattle has been watching tens of thousands of deaths. The epidemic is mutating rapidly, and it's drug resistant.
There are over a billion intelligent species in this galaxy alone. Knowing how to kill them is an even greater challenge. On this planet, we serve as executioners of all living things. Destroying a Time Lord is a special honor. The technology is strictly calibrated. As you can see, it will stop both hearts and all three brainstems, as well as launch a cellular shockwave that will block the ability to regenerate.
On this planet, we serve as executioners of all living things. Destroying a Time Lord is a special honor. The technology is strictly calibrated.

Mr. McDuck! An efficient clean energy source that can power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electricity. Oh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to another Scottish billionaire's claim that the real diamond belongs to him? This trinket? It's nice, but it's obviously badly cursed.
The guy needed a moment to say goodbye to his entire comic book collection. We have a couple more questions. Starting with, uh. why is Dan's missing painting for sale here? This is the first time Lady Wellin Marsapple, heroine of the Ogden Tweedlehut series, has appeared in print. And who says she's missing?
If he's got a CD player. But the Golf probably still has a cassette player. And May's wrong about that, of course. This car may be a thing of the past, but listen to it. It's accelerating now, you can probably hear it, but I haven't done anything.
Only 4,500. How do you survive that? I think we've proven that it's not worth buying a car like this yet. Don't even argue. It's not ready. - Yes, it is.
Unbelievable. - Things are different now, aren't they? - It's amazing. It's unbelievable. Listen to this. My shirt is older than anything we can see from this window. James, your shirt is older than Carthage. It's already a rarity.
Yes, sir. - But you'll do it first thing in the morning. It's late. That's enough for today. I'd also like to stop by the library while it's open, pick up a copy of The Blazing Tree, but if anyone wants a beer afterward....
Me? Yeah, what did you think when you first read it? Uh, well, uh. You know. It's, uh. rich in memories.
It would not have been difficult for someone so skilled in forging signatures to forge Esther's handwriting. It must have been pretty easy to get your hands on a copy of Esther's signature. And then all you had to do was plant a fake note in her purse after you killed her. But as resourceful as it was, the suicide note also exposed you. It was typed, which means it was somehow not credible.
- We're not going anywhere without the access code. - I didn't think of that. There's another problem. Thrawn's almost found your base. - Tell me where it is.
No. You'll find out when we get there. - If he destroys it before then. Tell me where it is, and I'll delete it from the database. If it's even there.
Look, Emily. I trust you. If you really think I should do this commercial, then I will. No. Because it's terrible.
Okay, seriously, she's not going in my helicopter. Jackie, can you come in, please? Did you guys want something? No, but the fat guy from Ohio wants his shirt back. It was bought at Talbots.
And I realized, Claire, that we have to fundamentally change the way we think and the way we act. Who lives in the White House is no longer about-- It's who owns it. Isn't the presidency the pinnacle of a politician's achievement? The real power is not here. It's outside this realm.
Who lives in the White House is no longer important..... It's who owns the house that matters. Isn't the presidency the pinnacle of a politician's accomplishments? The real power is not here. It's outside this sphere. It's above it, but it only acts in concert with it.
Don't tell me. I want it to be a surprise. So you've finally decided to return this car? Yeah. You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it is.
I want it to be a surprise. So you've finally decided to return this car? Yeah. You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it is. I took it to a toy train store, and it showed that everyone there was sad.
You know, they're very persistent guys, they're bound to find out. Okay, I have nothing to hide. Tom was a great sailor, really, but he went out once when a storm was forecast. And he took his son with him. An 8-year-old son. And when the storm came, it was bigger than he expected.
Sir? So, uh. the inspector was right. After killing Tom Lewis, Frank Henderson came down here and hid in this compartment. And stayed there the whole time we were searching the boat. Until she returned to port and he had a chance to escape.
We'll find him. We don't even know where he is. Yes, you do. This magic helps those with true love find each other. It can open the door that leads to Hook.
James Wackler had a safety deposit box in the bank. Convinced Tatum to have me there. Guess what was inside? The memory card that Wackler stole from Roxanne's hidden camera. She recorded her murder.
In cold blood. And the son faked his own suicide. I believe that's when Steve took Steve's cufflink. But your plan needed a twist. After all, why would a passing cleaning lady say the room was locked if it was open?
Shit. No laptop. What are we doing here? Look, Jake's shirt. It looks like it was on fire.
Use your feet, Jeffrey. Not your mouth. You're funny. I'm looking forward to your presentation. I'm sure it'll be great.
- Rewind. - Did you see this? He put the bag behind the pot. Let's go. Is it in there?
He put the bag behind the pot. Let's go. Is it in there? Is she in there? - She's here!
Wait, you're saying he put a gun in his-- It's not gonna take an interrogation to prove his guilt. You're gonna need this. Thank you, Lord, for the life you give us. It's full of labor and commitment, sorrow and joy.
I want you to know that I'm getting married. That's great news. Congratulations. I'd love for you to come to the wedding. When is it?
For a long time I was completely comfortable knowing that I could die at any moment, that I could walk out of here into the street and get shot. I'm used to that. But lately, I can smell it in the air around me. It's like death. creeping up on me from the corners of the room. And I don't know if it's coming for me.
He had a little trouble in the woods last night. Nothing life-threatening. That's good. But this thing is attacking us. Now it's attacking us near our house.
Lock the door behind me. - The roof. Red. The roof, red. - What? It was red.
I can't say that, Nathaniel. Because I don't want to go back to 1942. I know I have to. I know I have a destiny, and we shouldn't disrupt time any more than we do now. But I have to believe that time is stronger than that. And if I have a destiny, it will wait.
When I get back, we'll talk. We're coming with you. - What's going on? - Our friend Calvin tried to jump up and pull the fire escape down. He grabbed it, but it fell on top of him.
- Doc, we made a deal. In blood. We belong to the Black Badges, and if they find Dolls, they'll shoot him on sight. Winona, I was supposed to get the serum two days ago. It's not ready.
They could be something much bigger. My magic? Why not your magic? Darling, don't you see? Your magic is useful because it's unstable.
What now? There's only one way to find out. You ready? Yeah. What is it? This thing. it's been siphoning my magic out of me.
Reboot. Started last September. A lot of people involved. I take it you didn't coordinate this operation with the police or any other agency? No, no, no, no, it's highly classified.
Actually, C.O. Crowley wants to transfer you to 27. They need people for the third shift. Night shift. - Are you serious right now? - She was free.
Seriously? How'd it go? - It did. Did you notice these tire prints? And this little scratch on the ground; looks like it's from something on the car.
Let's run through your expenses. What's your rent? I don't want to say. Is it that much? I don't want to say because I don't know what it is.
That's exactly what they're waiting for. I mean, they have to be fought with cunning, or knowledge, or time. Caleb's right. These people are unpredictable. Your strategy was useful for a while, but if it's no longer useful, you should change tactics.
Thanks, Todd. You're welcome. So, does anyone else want to say a few words? Yeah, I do. Every time there's hope in my life, hope dies.
Hello? Hey, buddy, still looking for a place to stay? Uh, uh. yeah. Why do you ask? Well, you know, we have an extra bedroom, and if you need it, it's yours.
Which, unlike the body, is allowed to tickle. You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. I think I had a premonition. Gentlemen, a very interesting thing just happened to this spoon. If she didn't sing "Be Our Guest," I'm against it.
Are we still talking about the spoon? It's nice to see you're interested in Amy's work Don't get me wrong. Neurobiology is nothing more than the science of gray jelly-like matter. But when it touches physics, gas on the floor, Martha, we're going for a ride.
I don't know, check your body for tattoos? Leonard, be nice. She's kidding! Wait, wait, wait. Where's my bag? My phone and wallet are in my bag. It's right here.
Oh, great! Did you miss the big thing this weekend? What? The conference. It seemed so important to you.
Voice mail? Lucado, pick up the phone! Why don't you call Jeremy again? How long will it take for that thing to eat its way out of here? I'm sure if I get off, it'll eat me!
Bag that thing, and Jeremy knows what to do. She... Didn't have any questions. I do. When you broke those demon eggs, did you get wet? Well, I love my job, but it's been a long time since she bought me dinner.
- Fight it. - It's-- It's-- It's-- - Waverly. - Winona! Remember when you made me drink grape soda until she turned up her nose?
I'm so sorry, are you okay? Yeah, don't worry, I'm fine. MONTY: I got this thing, I'm trying to find a use for it. As you can see, it's not even good for propping up a door.
Yeah. All your stuff's soaking wet in here. People who lived here before me said they waterproofed in the '90s. The problem with water, especially underground, in a house like this. - It finds a way to seep in.
The point is, Helen knew that coin meant I was with her. She wasn't alone. It's just a coin, Owen. That no-one, not Maxwell Flattshill or Alice Winter, will notice. And it will remind you that you're not alone until you don't need it any more.
"Sandstorm may control the building, but they don't know it as well as I do. There's another basement under the building. And a technical elevator. In the 80's the city started remodeling to extend the N subway line. It went under the building where our office is.
- No. That was just part of it. Shepard has gathered all of us in this room to be the successors to a government she considers corrupt, a government she intends to destroy. The attack on the country is not over. It's just begun.
This is a matter of national security. It is our duty to remain in this bunker until otherwise instructed, We become the successors to the United States government. The attack on the country is not over. It's just begun.
They're just all resting. Why isn't anyone resting in the new break room? - Because it's a huge pile of crap. - It's horrible. It's unusable.
Look at the map work. It's amazingly simple. Trying to flatter. Didn't work. It's Boyle's card, and to put it mildly, it's worthy.
You changed the tire after all. I'll take that as a win. Okay, you were right about the break room. Yeah. Nobody likes it, and it's not functional.
According to the phone records, we think Ocampo's still in Brooklyn. Is it true you still have a bullet in your thigh from the shootout with the Canarsie killer? - No. Shit. - It's in his jaw.
- И? - And that was the act of an asshole! - Santiago! You did it! - And you've been listening to fucking classical music all day. It's too loud!
Where'd you find the steering wheel? Nowhere. There was a Frisbee in the trunk, so I glued it on. That's right. I unmacguided the thing, and it works perfectly.
- Don't be ashamed, okay? I'm so proud of you. You're being proactive. - Checking your fertility when you're not even thinking about doing it in the near future is a mature move. - Yeah, listen. Honey, I mean, I appreciate your support, it's important.
You grew up in prison? Van, did you know I'm the only senior vice president in this building who doesn't have an office? Emily, you grew up in a box. You're like a tropical fish that grows up in a coral reef, but if you take it out and give it an office, it dies. - What?
It's none of your business. There's no hope anymore. No. There's hope. It's everywhere.
She found out I had writers and a focus group.... At the end of the fucking letter, you should have captioned it. "Approved by mother and sister." But love is worth it. It's worth it.
I want a big, tall guy... "That's my boyfriend. I'm mad at my boyfriend!" I'd wear his jacket. It's too big for me.
A little accident. I got drunk... but I'm fine. She puked on her beard, you can't wear it. Even better. She couldn't catch it...in the toilet.
What's the latest from Black Badges? Eventually you and your boys are going to have to get in the game, because neutrality is the devil's ally. And, brother... The devil is close. There's an abandoned chapel on Highway 62. It's right next to Juan Carlo's store.
There's no time. She's already here. Damn, sooner than expected. She's looking for the third seal. The seal isn't mine, and I don't know where it is.
When they resurrect their dead demon husband, she'll be there to help send him where he belongs. After everything Winona did to get that seal... How can I? You can say I made you do it. That I ordered you to. I don't even know where it is.
Damn it, Oliver, I told you. It's over. The bluff worked. What do you mean it worked? I got a number, and it's good.
The world hasn't stood still since your death, Cage. Onboard drones, anti-aircraft countermeasures... and fuel tanks that let you fly around the world three times without refueling. You can turn in your fur coat. You have my word, no one will steal it. But I can't guarantee it won't leave here on its own.
The more roses you have on cupid's day, the more popular you are, right? Thanks for the advice, Kent. I'll keep it in mind. I didn't say the rose was from me. But it is from you, isn't it?
These flowers were brought for you in Daimler class. I know I don't look my best for this, but you have my word the flowers are legit. That's cool. And this rose is for you, too. It's pretty special.
And this rose is for you, too. It's quite unusual. It stands out from the others. Thank you. Hey, I-- Didn't say it was from me.
It's quite unusual. It stands out. Thank you. Hey, I, uh. Didn't say it was from me. But whoever it's from, it's got a certain message, so, uh.
Look at us, Wilson! We're like something out of a horror movie! We're pale and bald and angry and lonely and-- And they're so gorgeous and-- Our daughter is a hundred times better than that disgusting kid. - She's not our daughter!
Oh, no. What's the matter? Let me see. Did you see my soul? Is it still there?
That boy across the room. I fell in love. Я... I just, uh. fell in love with him at first sight. And we had a life. It was beautiful, and it was hard.
I mean. - Hey, Smurfette. - Hey. (chuckles) This thing is safe, right? Is it safe?
- Ready, Zabiyaka? - Roger that. It's working! This thing understands me. It's able to focus on Zabiyaka's core trait.
You're just in time to see a scientific discovery. What's going on here? None of your business, Weasel. That's fine. Listen up! If this vegetable hat tells us that Zabiyaka is strong, maybe it can tell me what Etta means.
You've been looking for these blue creatures for a long time. But this hat is from a very different place. Yes. Where? Where is it from?
Here we go! Stop it, Azrael. I can't adjust the machine because of your incessant yelling. Yes, Azrael, listen to her. She purrs like a kitten.
WILLIAMSBURG BANK Good morning, sir. Welcome to our bank. I'll take a pager for you now, and you'll speak to a bank specialist as soon as one is available. What does this thing do? It's gonna light up and vibrate.
"Old gangster." That's illegal, right? Gentlemen, Prohibition has been repealed. Marijuana has wonderful medicinal properties. It cures all diseases.
Okay. Breathe slowly. Concentrate on the flashlight. Lisa, I see a shark! It's coming towards you!
It rained last night. We have three guests and a sink full of dishes. Okay, okay. It's 2.5 kilometers to the pumping station. Sometimes it goes out.
A long time ago. And the Holy Land? Jerusalem? He says this water is not fit to drink. It flows past that place.
Where is he? I need to see him now! Was your flash drive in a safe place before you gave it to John? Yes, of course it was. It was our insurance policy.
They removed the sidewalk in front of the post office. Your shoes have local clay on them, it's very distinctive. - Yeah, your little apartment. - How did you know that? - Well, on your salary, it had to be modest, and you spent all the money on a cottage, didn't you?
No, really. Really? You're really serious? That joke's outdated. It's not funny anymore.
Well... A parting gift. How kind. The cane. Yes, it was mine. a long time ago.
My boss. Big Boss Baby Boss. Why is she yelling? See the pie chart? Wow, it looks like a pie.
Isn't that right? It was impossible until you gave me the main ingredient. My secret blend. It's mine! It's all mine.
Who's ticklish? Here you go. Well, that's my story. Our story. Lucky for me and my brother, it ends well.
Black people may not realize it, but it's hard for everyone right now. Our lives aren't that much different. - What the hell? - We got struck by lightning? - It must have gone through the heating blanket.
Stolen. Okay, Mr. Jones, where was the last place you left your car? If we knew, we'd find it in a heartbeat, wouldn't we? Well, could you describe the car? It's terrible, always in for repairs.
One of which is liver. Which is perfect for Terence. Exactly. His liver will never be on the transplant list. It will go directly to your nephew.
The other Iron Fists I knew were brutal and relentless in their mission to protect K'un-L'un from the Hand. They would never walk out of the Great Joust to save some girl's life. How did you know my father? I've lived long enough to observe the changes that have happened to the world. But this change, it seems significant.
What if she doesn't talk? She will. Good. (chuckles) Did you think this idea was totally lame? It doesn't suck, okay?
I don't think Gandhi would agree with you. Okay, I'm not special, but I've seen enough people die to know the value of life. What about the lives that Gao is destroying? Hey, uh. Turbulence is scary, but it's not dangerous.
Qi healing. Reiki is considered a pseudo-science, but they say it cures tumors and all sorts of ailments. So maybe it's more real than I thought. Qi is the breath of life. It empowers the Iron Fist.
Oh, really? You're done, Harold. I've spent too many years hating you. You're going to prison. Only this time it won't be as pleasant as the one you spent the last 13 years in.
- What? There's-- Dude, this shit is all cloudy. You gotta get rid of this shit, man. Dean had it.
In the conference room. Mr. Rand, I know I speak for all of us, we're very happy to have you back with us. For good this time. This war isn't over. Well, the whole point of war is that it happens if both sides believe they're good.
Opportunity. Chance. And that's the main foundation on which our team stands. And that hope belongs to me. It belongs to me, you son of a bitch!
Garbage that someone threw out. But if you want a mystery, how about a shit puddle? What the hell is going on with it? Why isn't it spreading? Why doesn't it harden? - It's moving.
Frank, Frank, before you do anything, I want to give you a valentine. Unheard of! Right in front of me? - Really? Charlie! - It's for both of you.
Yeah, I mean, I have my moments. but I'm happier than I've ever been. - Hey Mia, what's up? - Did Hosse tell you about his exhibition? It was great!
How much did she get out of it? Well, Mary. I see you're looking at our little task. Small'? It's a big one.
But it was never enough. Until you. When you first appeared, I was going to crush you, but I knew only you could see what the other gods could not. Now you will join me, and by joining forces, we can finally end the pain, suffering and destruction they bring. And turn the earth into the paradise it was before them.
There's no getting away from it, Dom. One way or another, we're gonna have to talk about it. Fate's a funny thing. It's tricky. It gives you beautiful moments, but sometimes it gives you this.
It's a million-dollar show car. Our job is to keep the attention off of it. It has the opposite psychological effect. The house won't even notice it. It's bright orange.
Boom! Rolling. I'll just be a second. Where's the smile? There it is.
This is it. the moment of truth. As you can see, the flames have formed a reflective surface on the glass, also known as an arsenic mirror. Your father was poisoned. Judging by the density of the mirror, I suspect that dose sent the old man quickly to the grave. I'll tell you, in the later stages, it affected his mental clarity.
Load it up! How's your religion these days, Coop? My what? Your religion, your faith. After all these years of service, it's become rags, Your Majesty.
How to say... It depends on the intentions behind that fire. And the major gave us a date. The day after tomorrow. If you read these stars, you get the same date, and it's headed this way.
That's a great excuse. So you really can't take that thing off? No, I can't. I don't get it. It's part of me.
Spencer gave me this one the day Yvonne and I were supposed to leave town. And then she asked me for a goodbye kiss, then I thought it was weird for Spencer. Okay, Toby, I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with Ezra? I didn't look in the book until today. It's not hers.
And then she asked me for a goodbye kiss, then I thought it was weird for Spencer. Okay, Toby, I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with Ezra? I didn't look in the book until today. It's not hers. It doesn't belong to Spencer.
It's a lost cause. The entire province is only 4% of the country's population. It's strategically pointless. I'd back away from the idea. The problem with guerrilla warfare is that it's pointless.
The lightning will strike the rod that will guide it into the tunnel. We'll grab the Horseman and put him in the bunker. There'll be a trap. Okay. How do we stop him from grabbing the lightning and getting out before he's trapped? If the lightning strikes again, it'll hit the rod.
Three. No, no, no! Stop! The Horseman's whip didn't go deep enough to take him, but it left a wound on his back. He was thrown into the tank, and the wound contaminated the water. It mixed with the liquid from the barrel and made him stronger.
Well, we should have sent someone else. So many soldiers. We tend to lose a couple. Especially if they're scared. There are rumors of magic. If there was, it wouldn't be yours, would it?
Is that so? I'm glad you banned it. I'm glad not to use it. Magic was a drug worse than opium. How much good did it do us against the Eternal Beast?
The wagon will pass and no one will stop it. No one will chase them. That's a smart plan. It's Dorothy's plan. When she gets to Glinda, she'll stop this war before it starts.
This vortex chamber can send you home. The only thing I ask is that you stop Glinda first. And she gave me the only weapon that could kill a witch. - Not the only one. - When she gets to Glinda, she'll stop this war before it starts.
Nothing. I died and came back to life. I think I might be able to conjure up a few incantations. Don't push, calling on magic. It'll come to you.
But if we had more fighters..... - How? - Underhill Plantation. The largest and richest property on the island. Over two hundred slaves live there. It's well defended.
Spending the night with the queen, you died... There are worse deaths. Clothes and hairstyles change over time, but this queen always had a party. And the kings kept coming for her. The power of our queen, which is given to all women, is the power of rebirth and creation. She makes some men kneel down and offer gifts.
- Starve them? - They used to starve themselves. 40 days, not for faith, but out of necessity. Starvation is an ancient form of prayer, and these guys have never starved. They just take food out of the fridge, throw it in the microwave and watch it spin.
I'm fine, really. - What happened? - I told you, a bike, a branch, a scratch. That's it? Mom, I promise I'll tell you everything about my life, it's so exciting.
Duran? Yeah, sure. Good choice, kid. I prefer jazz, but all music is good in its own way. It makes every day a good day.
You can tell. Tell him if he doesn't call tonight, he may not even come home. Chaos theory. But, you see, chaos theory isn't about chaos itself. It's about how small changes in a big system can affect everything.
- All right. Uh-huh. Uh, thank you. What am I supposed to see? Just a shadow on the moon. Look, it's slowly growing.
- Yeah. I'll probably just, uh. hand the project off to another student. That sounds friendly. A friend of mine is studying friendship theory. It helps with stress.
Look out there! Oh, my God! Well, uh. I like this car. It smells new.
Honey, you'll always be my valentine. That's a little creepy, don't you think? You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates, are you? You know what, working at the movie theater. I don't think it's good for you.
If that's the case. And if you want to discuss them with someone who isn't related to you... I'll let you know. Look, I hated high school. I couldn't wait to graduate. It was hell for me.
Every culture since antiquity has survived this way - it is defined by what it rejects. As long as progress exists, there will always be human waste in its wake. Sooner or later it becomes necessary to answer the question - what to do with them? In London, they just call them criminals. They throw them into a deep, dark pit and hope it doesn't overflow.
Sooner or later it becomes necessary to answer the question - what to do with them? In London, they just call them criminals. Throw them into a deep, dark pit and hope it doesn't overflow. But justice demands that we do otherwise. Civilization should not be judged by who it rejects, but how it deals with the rejected.
- Anyway, Dr. Vaughn. by the way, that's an awful name. Morty and Summer fixated on your obsession with pickles to avoid therapy. I think this case is the best insight into your family's dysfunction. You and your father may have a very specific dynamic. And it is far from rewarding.
Morty and Summer fixated on your obsession with pickles to avoid therapy. I think this case is the best insight into your family's dysfunction. You and your father may have a very specific dynamic. And it's far from a reward. It's a punishment.
Mom! Where's the head? - What? - My head. Where is it?
- What? - My head. Where is it? It's not really your head, is it? I mean, technically, it belonged to someone else.
Where is it? It's not really your head, is it? I mean, technically, it belonged to someone else. - I'm gonna ask you a few questions. - First you're gonna tell me where it is.
It's not really your head, is it? I mean, technically, it belonged to someone else. - I'm gonna ask you a few questions. - First you're gonna tell me where it is. It's right here in the refrigerator.
And they know it. That's why they're so afraid of you and me. If we can capture Nassau, if we can dispel the illusion that England is invincible, raise a rebellion that will sweep across the New World, then yes. I suppose they'll notice us. - "An excess of sanity can be madness, and the greatest madness is to see life as it is, not as it should be."
Can we talk for a minute? You don't even know what you're asking. Am I in a book? Yes. Is it about my life?
Yes, it's natural. It's common in the wild. A smaller animal will cower in the teeth of a larger predator. It's a genetic instinct. At some point, the food realizes it's food.
You're watching all the Israelis like you're on TV. Technical glitch. So? A Russian traveling circus shows a squirrel running in a wire wheel. The squirrel thinks it's spinning the wheel, but if it stops running, its legs get tangled in the wire and the squirrel breaks its legs.
Are you supposed to sing? For the past two years I've been working on the song trail. I don't have to tell you that every congregation has it different, so I've had to learn step by step every sacred space, every ceremony, every word. You want my song? It's the last one.
Honey, I don't know where he is. And he would have let me know if I should know. I got it. You took your book. It's not mine, it's Matt's.
It doesn't matter. You're not gonna tell me, but you told Lori? Who else are you gonna tell? Matt? He's gonna want to add visions to your book. It's not mine!
I think you like her. You want to be a Jesus superstar because you're important then. You like it? I love it! She's awesome!
To be honest, your story's better. My story's true. Come on, Matt. - It's all true. It's, uh. It's based on fact.
I'd be happy to help. You already did when you found the house. Oh, come on. You're not gonna let me see this killer car for myself? It's not murderous.
You're just gonna dump him? That's good news. If this Kevin thing doesn't work out, who cares? Officer Coalopard's going down tomorrow with the rest of us. But if it does, sweet Lorelei.
Nausea or discomfort may occur as you walk past a working laser matrix. Do not touch the sensor. Enter the camera, close the port behind you, and turn the knob to the left. All the way in. It will remain in this position.
When you're ready, we'll begin the procedure. You will hear three beeps. After the third beep, the chamber will fill with liquid. The liquid will be the same consistency as water, but it's not water. It contains irradiated metals.
- Yeah. She sent a note. - She did? She's already got everybody under control? - She's offering a trade.
A cookbook so we can make dinner. I assume everything but the lamb. My private library is open to you at any time. It's mostly law books, but there are other sections, from Italian cooking to the world's most dangerous mold. I suppose it's not as good as the libraries you've been using, but...
- Is this war more important than her life? Answer me. I want to hear it from you. Is this war more important than her life? - Now, with so much at stake. She is more important. - Get out of here!
But I don't want to risk her life anymore. If I have to give up the chest to free her, I'm glad I took it. - Everything. Everything was in our hands. The war was already in the air, it was real.
- So you sent one of these groups to their deaths. - The important thing is they'll tell us where he is. - I wish he knew. How much you learned from him. - The enemy's wrist is where the attack originates. It's her past, from which she is inseparable.
And it is perhaps one of his greatest creations. A canonical work of individuals putting aside their differences for the common good. But in its time, the work was ridiculed, called a "smear", "the work of an amateur". There were stories about people who hired Rembrandt and refused to pay because they were dissatisfied with the resemblance. The painting was not appreciated, and when it was transported from one hall to another, they decided that it was too big, and then simply cut it off on several sides.
- Hey. Keith was telling me about you. - Hi. - We saw your speech. - It was beautiful.
One time. It didn't hit any of us. I think he did it by accident, but still. When he saw Lonnie, he almost shit himself. Dropped the gun so fast, it was like it was burning his hands.
A girl can't just be friends with a guy. There has to be sex. Or love. In my experience, love gets you killed as much as passion. It stirs up bad things. Mutual or not.
А! You've met my muse. Fascinating, isn't she? Frightening, indeed. Who is she?
I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday. I think our VIP is not missing, but kidnapped. Hello, Special Agents Bowman and Howard. FBI. If the camera can see, it won't answer you.
New capsule trajectory, minus 0.32. The capsule will fly past us. - Rory? - I'm on the trajectory. She's not far away.
I thought your parents went to see you. They did, but, uh. it's a long story. I read your book. We all did. It made a lot of noise around here.
Hodgins, slow down. Talk to me. I can see you're upset. I'm telling you, if I could get down to the basement, that needle wouldn't be evidence. I'd stick it in his neck so it would pierce every organ in its path.
She'll be seen by a doctor from Chichester on arrival. - Dr. Turner. - Uh, Sister. did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left? No, I did not. She was not in her chambers, and when I went to her room before breakfast, it was empty.
Did Ezra say he wanted to postpone the wedding? We haven't talked about it. Then go with plan "A." What does that mean? Aria, you plan this wedding and she'll be waiting for him while he says good-bye to Nicole.
- Of course you are. - I support you. - In whatever decision you make. - It's not your problem. Aria, you plan the wedding and she'll be waiting for him while he says good-bye to Nicole.
He's probably even more broken inside than you are. Thank you. You're welcome. Try this pizza. It's good.
- How long has it been here? - I don't know. Maybe this thing's broken? It's not broken. It's thinking.
Literally. Wait a minute, do you hear that? It sounds like a hum and then a bunch of clicks. Trust me, this joke makes all kinds of noises. I know, I just can't tell if it's mechanical or electrical.
It was made much later. It was about turning revenge into a game. A game? I came back here today because I didn't want whoever sent that note to get it. Where is it?
No, no, no. No one's gonna tell Ali about this. Did you see this book with your own eyes? Yeah, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it. Where is it now?
Were you drunk? No. Butterflies are classic. They suck. Okay, I'm sorry I didn't get your artistic opinion and stuffed a lame butterfly. Well, it's beautiful.
or I'll twist your balls off. Poh-la-la-la. There's a very simple way out of this. - Not now. - The farm is worth a lot of money. Just found out it's on a huge uranium deposit.
I understand Goward, and I'm sorry to mislead you. The thing is. you had to be sure first. I'm not talking about the heart attack you almost gave me. Chuck, this tape. I'm not exactly sure what part it plays.
I'll be quiet. - Thank you. - But I don't approve. You just broke up with Maggie, and you're buying jewelry for some other girl? She's not some other girl.
Thank you. It's safe here. I use it when I visit. Got any food for him? Come on, it's on board.
Get some coffee, boys. It's no good sleeping on duty. Did you take care of that battery? Yeah. It did die, but we replaced it a couple hours ago.
Let's wait and see what we're dealing with. She's not a threat. And we're not gonna let it be. This thing is a living weapon, a killing machine. She's not a machine.
She's not a danger. And we're not gonna let it be. This thing is a living weapon, a killing machine. She's not a machine. She's not human.
Me, too. Naomi? She hid behind a container near the end of the lower deck, in the tail. There's a bad view. Go left. She should be there.
Naomi? She hid behind a container near the end of the lower deck, in the tail. It's a bad view. Go left. She should be there. We'd see if she moved.
It's not a dumb animal. The device she ripped from her chest is an emergency regulator, like a control and guidance module. A fucking control module. It was an incendiary device, okay? A bomb that's supposed to destroy this thing if it gets out of control, okay?
I can definitely shake it down one of the holes. Out of the question. That maneuver would tear him in two. This thing is strong as hell. I don't think it's gonna stumble and fly into space.
Your suit will only filter out a fraction, and then your heart will stop. You know a lot about death. Yeah, apparently. Super. Despite her current form, she was human.
Prepare for weightlessness. It's coming out. She's stopped. Shit. She's going back to Holden.
Naomi said the creature feeds on radiation, right? Yeah. It sucks radiation like a mosquito sucks blood. When we first found the protomolecule, it was hugging the reactor core. So? It's looking for a power source.
On my signal, get the cannonball. Come on. Get it out! She's out the door. She's coming for you! All right, there she is!
Guns. Electromagnetic guns. Atomic bombs. No weapon brings peace. No one knows what a protomolecule wants or what it does, but it's used anyway.
Atomic bombs. No weapon brings peace. No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it does, but it is used anyway. It's spread too far apart to be sure of its destruction. It's part of the equation now, and it always will be.
He injected Jonathan with demon blood. Why would he do that? He's sick. He thought the demon blood would make his unborn child strong. And it did.
Why would he do that? He's sick. He thought the demon blood would make his unborn child strong. And it did. But it also made him. evil.
If she can accept you with all this, I'm pretty sure she can accept you for who you are. Okay? You know, mustard is actually rich in antioxidants. It's actually healthy.
I traveled to fucking India and came face to face with a cobra! And all I got was its stupid box! That stupid box is sacred. You know why? It contains the soil from Camille's grave.
Magnus, tell me, is it possible? Yes or no? Sure, there are magicians who have done it. But what you're talking about is dark magic. It's very unpredictable.
Wait a minute. Are you sleeping in a coffin? No, it's a canoe. And, mom. The blood isn't fake. It's real.
For the answers you seek, we must enter the Citadel. But we can't let any demonic filth get through. Adamas is too fragile. So celestial water energy will help us determine if you can enter. It will destroy any contamination on contact.
- Did you? - No. I never read it. I've never seen it. I just have a rough idea what it's about.
We agree. One of the lost treasures of the Zambezi, right? Mr. Lucas, you have something we've come a very long way for. Part of the Spear of Destiny. Where is it?
Uh, coffee? No. I'm good. Thanks, Ida. I wanted to thank you personally for your support. I doubt it had any effect.
It should. Whatever you say. Here we go, Harry. That tattoo. It's SWAT.
My son honored that commitment. He sacrificed his life. So by wearing this uniform, I honor his memory, just as you honor the memory of all officers who have died in the line of duty. Wear it with pride. Respect what it represents... serve and protect the citizens of Los Angeles.
No. Nothing. Is everything okay? I wanted to talk to you about Callie's senior paper. Yeah, I heard it made a splash.
Is everything okay? I wanted to talk to you about Callie's senior paper. Yeah, I heard it was a big hit. Yeah. It did, and it's really great.
He was terrified. Felicity, what's really going on? The NSA file we used to free John was part of a databank that a group of hackers gave me, and it contained data that I used to pressure the director of Detralink. You mean you blackmailed him? - Well.... - For that database to contain exactly what you needed for this particular guy, it would have to be huge.
He knew how to avoid hitting them. And before he opened fire, he put on a ski mask. Looks like a laborer's overalls. Forfeather Repair. It's been bankrupt for six years.
Why don't you like to talk about it? I just don't like it when you guys fight when I'm trying to work. There's nothing wrong with a little healthy bickering, Felicity. It's healthy if it leads to something, and this one is going nowhere. Actually, I don't agree that it should lead to something, nor do I agree that it's unhealthy.
Not a scratch. What's this door made of? Celtium. It's an alloy designed by the U.S. government to withstand a nuclear blast. Are you saying if we had a warhead in here, it couldn't handle it?
You shouldn't have left Nick. He gave us no choice. The battle isn't over. It is for Nick. If we'd stayed there, it would have been over for us.
Where'd he get it from? He kept it in his hiding place, wrapped in a cloth. I forgot I had it. Nick left it on the bed when he got the wand to heal you. It's very old.
The protomolecule froze around the reactor core. Starved to death. Did you energize it? HOLDEN: Uh-huh. And it started to move.
Day-to-day decisions are made by the managers of Rotogen. "They have complete autonomy. ¬ We only intervene in such small projects when the company has exceeded its budget. "So these left-wing employees managed to make a profit and a war while staying within budget? Maybe we should poach them. "Rotogen is a bio-technology research firm. "It was a government contract on the eba station.
All right. [Sighs] Go ahead. These voices I'm hearing. I think this thing takes, I don't know, consciousness - or whatever it is that makes us human? It's eating it, and then it's spewing it out in some other form.
And the data is transmitted here. This communications relay station is abandoned. But at least someone who did this on Eros must be there. To find out what's going on, we have to take this station. It's unattended, barely even visible on radar. But there's a residential ring, which means someone's home.
Somebody's got to keep these fools from shooting each other. No, I'm not gonna sit on the sidelines. All right, then. I'm gonna go clean up the cabin. Leave it. She'll be waiting for you when you get back.
Curiosity is not a crime. Too bad, or you'd be in jail for the rest of your life. Shopping list and household bills. Did you, uh. see that last entry? I suppose you can tell us what it means.
Ibis and Jackal have been in the business for 200 years. Bone pins. Thread for muscle. Paint for skin. We have to take care of your flesh because it can't take care of itself anymore.
The power of fire is a fiery power. Not godlike. But it is godlike. And they believe it. It fills their spirit every time they pull the trigger.
Just don't make me go back there again! The money! Now! No! I have so much to teach you, Bruce. But your pain. It's keeping you from becoming the man I need you to be.
Do you know why you were quickly defeated? No. Your rage, Bruce. Blinding you. You seek to control her, but she's been controlling you since that night.
- The canines are staying with me. - Harvey, there's gonna be a lot of people at the train station at 5:00. Even after we evacuate, thousands will be infected. Not if we find the bomb. But I'm guessing it's not out in the open.
- I'm just trying to be realistic, Wally. I can do that. Look, I want my life to mean something, more than just a daughter or a sister or a girlfriend, but a reporter. This story will help me with that. It will show that I, Iris West, meant something.
Look, I want my life to mean something, more than just a daughter or a sister or a girlfriend, but a reporter. This story will help me do that. It'll show that I, Iris West, meant something. - You know, my life was a lot simpler before my sister came along. - But it's so much better now, isn't it?
Wait, that's the exact opposite of how my blood makes cells regenerate. Exactly. Can we use my blood to save her? Look, I don't think your blood will help us save Iris. But I'm pretty sure it can help us defeat Yorkin.
if you don't get it right the first time, try again and again. You have to stop him. I don't have the power to do that right now. I need you to put your blood inside him. It'll react with his cells and neutralize his abilities.
We sent Grodd there after the last attack. Grodd's there? How did your father even think to go there? We got a mathematical cryptogram from our S.T.A.R. Labs. It was quite complex.
We can do this. You've seen the future. You know there will be an attack. If we find out exactly where it's going to happen, we can launch a preemptive strike on Grodd. Stop the attack before it even starts.
- It's not an eared one, it's a bumpy one. You've been studying this thing for hours, can we or can we not find out where Savitar is? All right, all right, let's get to the point. As far as we can tell, this thing is made up of a frictionless material whose molecules are always in motion. So it appears to be stationary on the outside, but inside it, nothing stops.
Cisco said, or showed me, that you've been off the team for a long time. And I know I'm the reason why. Iris' death must have taken me away from all of you. I mean. I mean, it must have brought me closer to you.
Look... I admit, it's pretty hard not to wonder what if I'd had a daughter instead of a son, but that's the least of it compared to why it happened. I made a big mistake. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Barry, there are wars being fought over this technology. If something happens and it falls into the wrong hands, people could die.
Gladly. You go first, of course. Thank you. Reminds me of the movie "Jaws." They don't show the shark because they can't afford to make it look good.
I know. It's hard, but we'll get through it, buddy. No, this picture-- Hold on a second. Where is it?
What about it? We need to know the amount of each component. We get the proportions wrong, we kill Chloe. The professor kept the formula to himself. He liked to brag that it only existed in his head.
- This song is not just about love at first sight. It's about life, about the risks that two people took when their lives and destinies crossed. It was always about the music. Lucius' music was my oxygen. It was like blood running through my veins.
- Yeah. We saw the teaser for When Cookie Met Lucius. - It's the bomb! - Lucius' music was my oxygen. It was like blood coursing through my veins.
She recommended him? Like hell she did. Lucius, this company belongs to me. - No, it's ours. - It belongs to me and my family.
Stay away from my daughter! Cass, you-- We completed the mission. It was a mission. It was horrible, but necessary. We were in the right.
But if... If I could go back in time and change everything, three years ago, I would. Because he's out there somewhere, isn't he? Still. Alive. And free. You know? After all this talking, all this therapy. This rage doesn't go away, it just keeps getting worse.
What are you doing? Yes. Here. The man on the tape is running towards a field on the edge of Flintcombe Farm, where there's a track running through it. You follow that track and it comes out to a road here, which means, uh.
This is the Serpent Hall. Look around. This is a lizard wing... and this is... a winged lizard. Look at the yellow coloration of the abdomen, it indicates camouflage and cowardice. And it can fly?
- Stefano! Stefano. Yes. Well, there's a spare room upstairs. It's small, but like I said, I have three kids living with me,
- I'm very grateful to you, Dad. - You're not grateful. You've been waiting for this, and you're taking it for granted. You don't notice it, but when I stop doing things, you will. I swear by the grace of God. - The essence of God's mercy, as I understand it, is that she expects nothing from you but love and devotion, which I have never denied you.
The universe is 14 billion years old No one knows what came before And no one knows how big the universe really is. И... It could be infinite."
I'm sorry, did you say... Mulberry or Mott Street? - I said Mott. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's just around the corner.
I have to ask. When you got there and realized it was beyond you, why didn't you just go home? We were too afraid of embarrassing ourselves. Especially when people started making fun of us, like when we wanted to build a school out of... out of mud blocks. We built one wall and it just fell down.
Thanks anyway! Good afternoon. I'm calling about the Charles McGill meeting. That's why I'm calling. I think it's this week, but, uh.
- All right, great. Let's strategize, where do we expand, Colorado or Utah? I'll see you at 7:00. This McGill thing. Are you sure it won't burden you?
Even doctors take time to make sense of these illnesses. Would you say your illness affects your ability to think clearly? No. Only physically. It causes me terrible pain.
It's just a play on words. The important thing is this. To understand what I was thinking, you have to see Chuck through my eyes. You need to know if I thought this tape was proof. And I say it proves only one thing:
Did I tell you I think I found a new apartment? You promised there'd be an awkward silence between us. - You're funny. It's in a promising neighborhood called Go-Oh.
I've thought about it, and I've decided. I've decided to give this tape to you instead of them. Maybe it'll give you the strength to blame them and save us from financial ruin. Good-bye, Trace. And good luck. Maybe it'll give you the strength to blame them and save us from financial ruin.
- I don't know. The steering wheel locked up. This thing's skidding. - Can you get it started? - No, everything's off. It's not going anywhere.
Until Kuznikov showed up at his house at an extremely opportune moment. Gretchen's waiting for more suspects to come forward. She's smart. Then why isn't she accusing you? Treason is front-page material, Brent. It won't just end your career, it'll destroy your family for generations.
There's nothing more you can do. And don't despair. I don't think the Betty thing is over. Nice room. It's too pink.
I don't think the Betty story is over. Nice room. It's too pink. It doesn't feel right anymore. No, I like it, it's so girly.
- Hey. What's up? - Uh, hi. He used to be on the soccer team. But I quit. When I saw that notebook of Chuck's. And I might know where it is.
Who is Jennifer Gibson? There's more. Oh, my God. Don't tell me you're on this crazy witch hunt. It's not a witch hunt, and she's not crazy.
And if this keeps up, pretty soon, the Coopers won't exist anymore. And there's nothing I can do to stop it. Betty, don't do this. Don't give up. Your family is definitely falling apart right now, but it's not gonna fall apart because of you.
Get out! Get out! What are you looking at? The party's over. It's over!
But I lied. And instead, I threw you a party you didn't even want. Why? There's something very, very wrong with me. It's like there's a darkness in me that sometimes overwhelms me, and I don't know where it comes from.
And given recent events, it's possible he could have hired him for other jobs. Like going after Jason as payback for what the Blossoms did to him. I want to help your investigation. I want the truth. Whatever it is.
This is outrageous. I will write an article about it, and not for Blue and Gold, but for the Register. It's a history of the city. As long as it doesn't mention my father. No, it'll be about your father, Jug.
The night of the murder, Gail Myers called me at 3:00 to tell me that Amy hadn't come home yet. I went to Billy's to ask if he knew where Amy was. The cat was sleeping next to him. He turned around and gave her a squeeze, she got mad and scratched his cheek.
Honestly, I don't know. And you never will. What I want to know is, why hasn't anyone taken on Nasiri before? That's the irony of freedom. It allows our enemies to destroy us.
Bile flow is normal. The most beautiful purple in the world. It is. How's the hepatic artery? Look at that, it's practically dancing.
A real rich man never worries about getting poor. I don't know what you're talking about, baby. You're the number one selling author this year, no one is saying you're going to be poor. Lawrence, tell me what your favorite thing about Scott's book is. Well, uh. it's interesting to young people because it's so rebellious.
I don't know what you're talking about, poopsie. You're the number one selling author this year, no one's saying you're going to be poor. Lawrence, tell me what your favorite thing about Scott's book is. Well, uh. it's interesting to young people because it's so rebellious. It's different from all the others.
Are you confused? I've been confused ever since it came out of my vagina. God, Mom, don't talk about your vagina. Why not? It's in perfect condition.
Why? It's garbage. I can't show this to my father, okay? If he's gonna give us this client, we need to get in the game. Our work has to be Ivy League level, and right now it's Arizona State level.
The magnesium in the laxative caused hypomagnesemia - shortness of breath, low blood pressure, arrhythmia... - That explains the blood? - It explains the vomiting. But he also suffered from an undetected aortic aneurysm. Everything else so depleted his system that it exploded.
Trixie, I've been dancing to Nurse Douglas' tune all night. I don't need any more exercise, thank you. Nurse Crane. The early bird gets the worm. Or at least she lines up all the worms and determines which ones are likely to cause the most trouble.
Why can't you find anything? - Because our room is a mess. - Then clean it up. I do. And then it gets cluttered again.
Young man, may I ask what you're doing? Pulling weeds. That's not a weed. It's the common fleabane. It grows freely, so it thrives.
No one knows where the soul is. Maybe it lives in the heart.
No one knows where the soul is. Maybe it lives in the heart? In the brain? What part of our body is it hiding in?
May I give her your wishes? Of course you can, but you'd better give her my love. These are frightening times. Why do we have to paint our windows? Well, the property of white paint is that it deflects heat from the initial blast.
Have fun. I'm fine with just sitting here with you, not doing anything special, and seeing what happens. What if this works? Did the electroshock therapy help at all? It was, uh. enlightening.
Your change is 11 euros. (Thank you. (Leon) Dad! Noah has a radio-controlled car in his backpack. (Lucas) What? It won't fit in there.
If you stick around for another 20 minutes, you'll see how much stronger it is. I can't wait for you to see the new and improved Rebecca. The question is. will you have the strength to kill her? My army of the dead will change the world for the better. It will correct the imbalance created by the recent wars.
What time did you leave the club yesterday? В 6:30? 7:00? The closing practice? It could be crucial.
I'm sorry. So what are we looking for? The main event is Mercury reversing. It'll look like the planet's moving backwards. But it's, uh. it won't?
You know I collect all sorts of military antiques? Two years ago I got my hands on an original 1916 declaration issued by the Irish Citizen Army Volunteers during the Easter Rising. Did I mention it was an original signed by Patrick Pearce* himself? You do as I ask, it's yours.
We had a deal. I'd like it to be more than that. If you think I'm gonna work for you. And you will. Because we found your weakness. It's standing right next to you.
They didn't have to. Sean is black. From the same part of town where the church stands. Guys, I think there's something wrong with our justice system. And it's getting worse because of vigilante justice.
Fred Johnson has proven himself to be a true friend of the Beltway. But as much as I fear war between Earth and Mars, I fear peace between them even more. For then they will turn their eyes on us again. Planets are not like us. An Earthling cannot look at a thing and not wonder who it belongs to.
Not yet, sir. My mother was foreign minister and took me on a diplomatic trip there when I was 15. I've trained in Earth gravity since I was a kid, but it feels different on the ground. The gravity nails one to a place. And it also depresses their spirit.
She's slipping away. I can feel it. No. No. She's still here.
Well, it could have been five, but I turned down Robie Lowe. Twice. That pain never seems to go away. Okay, that's what I said about childbirth. But she's leaving.
I'm a doctor, and that's doctor-patient confidentiality, you understand. If you're trying to catch me, try harder. You can come back with a court order, put me away, but I'll still never tell you a word about my patients. I'm just wondering what could have been said in that session to justify such a huge sum. It was commensurate with the other bonuses at Ax Capital.
You already know how to do that. Mary. What color is this wall? White. What color do you want it to be?
So make her that way. Change it. Turn the wall red, Mary. Just make it red. It's red.
I understand. It's what summer smells like to me. It's been that way all my life. But you won't appreciate it until you're as far away as I was. In a place so cold and dangerous, so devoid of life, you won't know how precious and vulnerable it is.
I realize it seems like a lot, but medication can help reduce panic attacks, dysphoria, anxiety, fear after PTSD. PTSD? Cults are all about controlling your mind, and you've been controlled for a long time. Right, right. I spoke to my coworkers, and they gave me information about a support group. It's for people who are victims of mind control.
И ... put blood on it. Mike, is it possible to put a bomb in that radio that could cause that kind of damage? Yeah. But I didn't check inside. If there was a bomb and it went off while you were examining the body--
I have a flawless shot. Dr. Palmer, are you asking me out on a date? No, no, I just want to practice my close-range punch. Okay, but be warned, I will crush you. Your confidence is impressive, but let's see how it holds up against the mill on the 12th hole.
Can you imagine having a baby in Georgia? Oh, my God. We need to pick someone we can trust for sure. Why don't you use Gary's sperm? Cause it's just sitting there.
I have a theory. Oh, my God. - What? It's the whole Helen thing. She's everywhere.
I think I'm in love. In love with what? Florida. - Florida? If you ever had a good idea, it died alone.
We'll see. But in the meantime, Quentin, Elin, Penny and Margo need battle magic. We're teaching martial arts? It used to be a required class.
All right, let's go. As far as I can tell, there's no interference. The vault is secure. So your booth can move? It can go anywhere?
Hold on a second. The room's still inside the booth. It's not an adjoining room. No. Doctor! It's more inside than outside!
TARDIS. If you're from another planet, why did you name your box in English? In another language, the abbreviation would be meaningless! - People don't usually pay attention to that. - It looks like a phone booth.
In another language, this abbreviation would be meaningless! - People don't usually pay attention to it. - She looks like a phone booth. Yeah, that's her disguise. She's kind of hiding.
That's saying a lot. Since when does the county do things by the book? I noticed one thing. They haven't interviewed anyone at the Bramford power plant. It's only four miles from where Luxman disappeared.
I'm on the run. I need a place to hide. They know about Bud. They put out an APB on his car. It's outside his shop.
Why? After what happened to us, we need to know what it is and where it came from. The answer may be on the tissue. I'm not sure about that. We need to find out where its power comes from before it kills any of us.
Nick! What was that? At the spice shop, a hand came out of the mirror? First I saw it, then I felt it. It was strangling her.
She was covered in leaves and lichen and slime, with branches instead of hands, and she picked him up. Picked him up and picked him up. - What about you? I shot her, and she didn't give a shit. And then I ran away because I thought she'd come after me.
Maybe we can do something, playfully, without harming the forest. Like a toxic dump? I think I have an idea. - What is it? - My brother and I used to love this book when we were little. Where is it?
Here! We brewed a special ointment. "Reptilian humanoids: pathology, diagnoses, treatment." Here! "Vle di Bouyi." It smells disgusting, and it's only bad for creatures with scales.
- Please. There may be information in there that can help us defeat this skull. Books can be just as dangerous. Waiting for this thing to come after us is even more dangerous, Adalind. I think one of the reasons it's connected to me is because I see these symbols.
we'll think about it. What if you don't find her? Or what if you find her, but you can't go back? Oh, my God! The wand didn't go through. It can't.
Or if you find her and you can't go back? Oh, my God! The wand didn't go through. It can't. It's not from there.
You shouldn't have come here alone! You shouldn't have come for me. Eva. You don't owe anyone anything. I don't know what you're trying to prove. But you-- I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm trying to kill this thing before it kills us.
They buried the stick? That's what everyone thinks. But it's more than that. It's not just a stick. For one thing, it heals.
You need witch's blood to get through to the other side. A wand? So Nick followed Eve. But the wand stayed here. She can't get in there.
Earlier in the show. - They told me you were dead. - That's what I thought. I hope the wand does what we think it does. - It's healing her.
Oh, my God. He killed everyone. Except me, and I don't know why. Maybe he thought you were dead or, uh. maybe the wand is protecting you. If my wand protects me, why didn't it help Hank or Wu?
- You can. With the power of the united blood. - We tried that. - No, we haven't. The power of your blood, the blood of the Grimm ancestors, all of us. it's in you.
With the power of the united blood. - We tried that. - No, we haven't. The power of your blood, the blood of the Grimm ancestors, all of us. it's in you. It makes us who we are.
Ross. Ross! Search the place! "Young Captain Ross is truly sorry." Oh, yes, he'll be sorry he sent home a hat because it won't fit his head when I pay him back!
Another dozen men escaped, but we split up. They headed for the coast. I left my post. The thought of freedom overwhelmed me. It overwhelms us all.
Madam President, let me tell you a story about my childhood in the suburbs of Gurjaani. You thought you had caught a fish, but it was a tire. The tire was full of fish. It's a beautiful story. It teaches a very valuable lesson, but I have to go.
It's just always like that, you know? He'll do something, then I'll do something back, and so on. That kind of friendship? I don't even know how to describe it. - Was it legendary?
I don't. Are we just gonna listen to this song over and over again the whole way through? I'm just trying to understand. Tammy said "Walk To The Peak" was God's favorite. It's so haunting.
- Or you. I'm still very young. And really ambitious. I don't argue, captain, but I can wait. And I like my life the way it is, you know?
Who are you and what did you do to Carisi? You really think so? We'll talk in 20 years. We will. And you'll realize that, uh. work doesn't change you, it reveals who you really are.
Nothing. I did that last week, too. It was at the store, and I was there buying stuff for the house. That's usually where black people shop. I hear a patrol car pull up. I heard it stop.
The sooner we start the fight..... Emergency radiation. Yeah. A small dose just to stabilize the tumor in his lung. It'll cure the pancreatitis and give you and your father some time to choose your treatment. And if I do agree to surgery afterward, will it be safer?
My wife had a necklace, a gift from her mother. И... she never took it off, but in the accident, the clasp broke. And I know she wished she had it on. I understand. It could be in her hands during surgery.
I mean medication, social training to help you understand body language. There's a new therapy called stimulation, but I'd recommend you try the traditional methods first. Stimulation? Transcranial magnetic stimulation. So far it's only been approved for depression, but there's also interesting evidence that it can help people with spectrum disorder.
We spent a lot of money. No one could find anything. Mom, it's not your stomach. It's my head. It's throbbing.
Always has been. Wow. A couple of years ago, he realized the mountains weren't enough for him. He loved his life. It's not over.
I'll give you time. Why did he do it? Even if he was in trouble, why? I don't know. Have you ever seen Jason do that trick where you pick a card from the deck and it ends up in his pocket?
I'd like that book for once, I-I could determine-- No. No. No one's gonna touch it. When this is over, I will personally destroy this book. Because it's dangerous, of course.
- software that programs you to die. - Maybe. But I have something you'll never have. a soul. that will exist even after I'm dead. What makes you so sure I don't have one? If the soul doesn't come from flesh and blood or my ones and zeros, it must come from somewhere else, somewhere that isn't connected to our physical bodies.
- Yes, sir. That's enough for now. Agent Simmons? Not comforting news, I'm afraid. The serum that gave you your powers. it's, uh. theoretically lethal.
- Because of what? Glioblastoma of the brain. I know, boring. It's just a variety of brain tumors. But at least it's in a very interesting place,
They stole you out of his life. What if he never knew me? What if he doesn't remember? This, uh. reality is flawless. - It's enticing.
You know what? It's a long story. Just, uh. move on. The Resistance must have an operational base. - Where is it?
- On my command. I was so sure. I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing. No, she's building it here, just not in this world. And now I know what it's for.
Maybe I'll experience it now. with you. By all means, destroy this body. It was designed only to kill. My head, which you ripped off, now controls many of these machines. And you don't know where it is.
- I'm as surprised as you are. - What happened? Darkhold. My arm still hurts. Why won't it heal?
Okay. I'm your long-lost twin sister. I look just like you. I even have a tiny dimple on my chin. She's your doppelganger.
Not a single shot could have come from the car. What does that mean? That the shots were fired before. I don't know exactly when, but definitely before the incident. Helen, they were fired by someone standing by the car when it was stationary.
The vault? In Osaka. What if the soul doesn't fit? It's like organ donation. The body rejects a kidney if it doesn't fit.
Blue blood. Blue eye. Our car was that color. Found it on a classifieds site. It smelled like maple syrup.
Very nice. I almost forgot about that. Holy shit. A rose is a rose, but not here. It has to mean something here.
And at the moment when hope is gone, our savior will stand before the terrified masses. Genius. The world's on its knees, wondering where it belongs, just like a girl in a threesome. Your uniform. Some might find it a little flamboyant.
Genius. The world is on its knees, wondering where to stick it, just like a girl during a threesome. Your uniform. Some people think it's a little bright. It's, uh. striking.
Where we first met. Newton believed that light was made up of particles. Professor Godfrey was talking about the wave theory of light. And you walked through the door. Well, a wave needs a medium in which to propagate.
Well, I'd rather not, uh. keep my partner waiting. Uh, sure. Uh, sure. I just, uh. wanted to give you a gift to thank you for, uh. your candor. It's priceless.
I reach out for him, but... he slips away. Like a ghost at dawn. And I stay here. I wish this story had been different. I wish it had shown me in a better light.
Having fun, Dad? Yes! Good! But you could turn the music down a bit. - What? The music. it's very loud.
I hope you can hear me. Tell Daddy and Sahar I'm okay. - Oh, Jonesy, thank God! - (yoga) I'm not Jonesy! We know about your secret room, where is it?
- (Abdullah) Nice try, but I'm no help to you. I got my own problems. - Are you praying in here? You got a signal in here? - (Hassan) I think I'll have the fish fry. - (Abdullah) It's for beer, not halal.
Sounds wonderful. - It's cold. - Yeah, I don't cook hot. I'm afraid to turn on the stove. It might catch fire.
And even higher in heels. Are you arresting me? ! Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence, that's not possible. So I'll have this blood analyzed, and if it turns out to be the victim's, I'll arrest you.
- Sorry to interrupt. - Perfect timing, Gideon. Your daughter Lily's algorithm has located another piece of the Spear. Well, trouble doesn't come alone. Where is it, Gideon?
It's about time. You know what that kind of power makes me? A villain? A devil? It makes me God.
Don't call me that. You prefer human language, wife? I am no longer bound to you. The bed has been cold for 300 years without you. It always has been.
So you're saying that Jeremiah Danvers, former DEO agent and missing father of Alex and Kara, has returned from Cadmus with news that our enemy has developed nuclear weapons using Kara's extraterrestrial heat vision radiation, and that they're going to blow up National City and just kill us all? Will this place hold up against the bombs? You can track the remnants of Kara's heat vision radiation. Right, yeah, if the bomb is loaded, then yeah, I can locate it until it detonates.
No! No! No! No! The painting. Where is it?
What's up, girl? So-so. I got something for you. I just finished running a diagnostic on this little beauty. And she, my friend, is in perfect condition.
That's all that matters. Unless they use the Supergirl defense. What? It's a thing criminals use to get charges dropped. She deeply resents the defense attorney.
You'll have a shitload of FBI agents at your disposal, and here's how I suggest you use them: Axelrod. Bobby Axelrod's actions are almost impossible to trace. So we need to monitor not only his operations, but everyone he comes in contact with and everyone they come in contact with. The pattern will be subtle, but it will be there.
So the director shouldn't expect so many competencies for such a salary Das vare läherlih? /nem. Isn't that funny? / ME? ME. I think she'll be good for you.
- You don't need to know. And neither does Dominic, okay? Two bottles on the count, but only one leaves the bar. - What happens to the second bottle? - It magically disappears, and the paperwork checks out.
They're not right. Sometimes they're wrong. You stopped answering Christmas cards. I'm sorry. My career, it's kind of consumed me.
- That boy who has your magic wand. - Sonic screwdriver. - What do you mean, a screwdriver? - In a very broad sense. - Why is it sonic?
You're insane. No. I'm being reasonable. Monogamy is not natural. It's created by religious authority.
They run through the pipes. They tend to... rise because of the capillary effect... I have a physics question. Today I was in the bathtub, dunked my head and at the same time my hairbrush hit my finger. It landed on the cast iron and the sound was very loud under the water.
Yes. Why? Scientists think that light travels through a special invisible medium. It's called the ether. But if it's invisible, how do we know it's there?
- Yeah. No judgment. She's a beauty. Deadly, but beautiful. Yes, sir. Take care of the rifle, and it will take care of you.
But you. You have a gift. Come on. What do you think of this sculpture? I don't know, it's just a sculpture. Focus, Liz. It sucks. It sucks.
Mileva has a marvelous mind. I can see why you were attracted to her. It was like an eternity ago. Love is a chemical reaction. Sometimes it burns.
I'll contact B.D.M.D. Hoover will take care of the professionals. Thank you, sir. I'll leave the Kleenex for now. If you screw up again, she'll be waiting for you.
And appease them by offering something the critics can't argue with - proof. In the form of astronomical photographs. Take Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun. Unlike the other seven planets, Mercury's orbit doesn't follow Newton's laws. It's different.
I can assure you that the rumors remain at the speculation stage, but still I would be careful. Scandal is very hard to stop, and it always ends worse for women than for men. Thank you, Berta, but I'm afraid I must leave you. And the deflection must surely be exactly 83 hundredths of a second of an arc. We'll use Riemann geometry for this, it contains some invariants for transformations....
We should stop and take a look. That's what an old car is. Ruiz! Give me the flashlight from the glove compartment. - I used to work on my dad's car. If it overheats.
- (Angus) We'll work on it. - (ravi) And exhale. - (Liv) What's happening? - (ravi) the good news is the fluid is out of your lungs for now. But it'll come back and take its revenge.
I like Claire. I thought you knew. I like Diaz, but we can't go down because of what she did. You can't pull the lever. You have to let fate take its course or it's gonna get back at you.
И... and I used to be used to the fact that before, you could-- you could, if you wanted to, you could find someone to talk to, you know? Or, uh. Or keep their secrets and... Now it's, "Fuck you, prisoner. I'm gonna ruin your fucking life just because I can." It's like human kindness just evaporated and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.
But what's in the comments? The comments are usually positive. "Fuck the system." "Give these ladies what they want." That sort of thing. I guess you can't deny cruelty when it pops up in your Facebook newsfeed.
Because we won. We fought and we won. And you're a blind asshole. And you-- My humanity was gone for a while. but it's slowly coming back.
- No, you pick one. One there, you know, where people can see it. My tattoo's not for me. It's-- It's for other people.
It's a long story. You taught me something. That, uh. Love hurts. You taught me that life-- It hurts.
There's hope that people are thinking straight. Darling. Don't fill your bright head with gloomy thoughts. The war is finally over. I can't help feeling it's only just begun.
- Uh-huh. I guess that's how they did it. It was hard collaborative magic. Yeah, here are the notes for version 2.0. It's much easier.
Uh, sure. David, come on in. I just read your article. It's impressive. I hope it gives you something to shoot for on quantum theory.
David, come in. I just read your article. It's impressive. I hope it gives you something to shoot for on quantum theory. Yeah, and it came just in time.
I don't have much talent, but I'm very, very curious, Alice. I was just asking questions, like you. That's the most important thing. Anyone can do that. You know, I was looking at the moon last night and I wondered why it wasn't falling.
You want to have children. What would you do if it was your son, Shahir? - Okay. - Enucleating the tumor. It's in a tricky spot, right on the pancreatic duct.
All my life I've been nice, polite, never bothered anyone. You know what I got for that? Dog shit in my locker, chewing on the seat of my bike. beaten up on the way home from school. And you don't want to go back to that. That tumor may have made me crazy, but it also made my life better.
Gahr... - Oh, my God. - What's wrong with him? Maybe I just have a crooked uterus. No, Catherine, it's porcelain and perfect.
I went back for him, and he-- I'm sorry. Did you see what it was? And the radio? It wasn't working.
If they're working with spies, I'll find them. I assume you're well motivated. It's healing nicely. Sabine will be pleased. I could defend Marigold better if I knew what she was about,
Alec? What are you doing in my father's office? You mentioned his model train. He doesn't use it anymore. I think it reminds him too much of what life used to be like.
Translate if you need to, Cristina, I'll understand. Or you can stay and go on a mission next time. I won't-- I won't keep you. The information's been sent to Berlin. It matches the rumors they heard from Oslo, Bergen.
With one dick you can jack off by yourself and that's it, but when you have three, suddenly you're having sex for six. Is that more powerful? I don't think your metaphor makes any fucking sense at all. It doesn't have to. She just distracted you for the time it took Alice to strengthen the spell, which is what a protection spell is supposed to do.
All right, gentlemen? We've figured out your game, Philbrick. We've compared stories. Someday I'll tell the truth, but you won't believe it. Because it's more extraordinary than your tiny minds can comprehend.
She was normal. My heart is broken. But we're gonna be okay, right? Everything will go back to normal and we'll set a new wedding date. Oh, it's gonna be beautiful.
♪ I'll wake her up ♪ ♪ Your heart is before me ♪ ♪ Your heart is before me ♪ ♪ I have your courage ♪ ♪ She turned me ♪
- You're a devil. You are your mother's child. God will punish you for your sins. - This disease. It will play into our hands.
When this car went into production in 1990, it was considered outstanding because it was as fast and exhilarating as a Ferrari. But unlike the Ferrari of the day, it was amazingly reliable and very easy to drive. "Honda discontinued it 12 years ago, but they eventually made a replacement for it. So I went to our proving ground to see what the new one was like. This is it. It costs £138,000.
They have no mechanical connection to the pedal. And that's because they harvest energy and send it to the battery for charging. It's much smarter than what the Porsche 918 does, a car that costs five times as much. And then there's the hybrid system. It doesn't use one electric motor, as you might expect, but three.
Well-trained men remove its casing, which will then be transplanted in a neat two-hour operation SAFETY ON THE SEA to the internal organs of the earth-digging V8. The next morning my incredible car was ready. Incredibly, in a barn I was able to create something that the entire automotive industry could not. It's a true sports SUV. DIFFERENTIAL OFF-OFF-OFF I've called it the MGD. Now let's see how it performs on the road.
No. I put a reserve on it. - What reserve? - 100 000. - 100 000? - So it didn't sell at all and you spent 14,000 corporate pounds?
The pumps feed the result up through the cabin and into this water purification system. And you get the purest drinking water at the end. Food, you're gonna need it. I have a chicken. She lays eggs, they go in there.
That's my urine! Did you make this? Yes, he did! I'd back off if I were you. The problem with chicken is that it's running around inside and it's very...
They put the door in the wrong place. It should have been moved much farther back. That's genius. There's something else. It doesn't have the beauty of design.
I know, it was cool. It's like watching a gorilla who found an apple and a banana in his cage. I love apples, but I love bananas too - what do I want, an apple or a banana? - Hammond. - You know, you could have both. - Hammond. This is a magnificent car and it only costs 60,000.
If you make a car that's great for racing at the Nürburgring, it's made just for that, and nothing else. It's like equipping a house for a game of laser quest. It would be great for a laser quest game, but would be unsuitable for a party because it's dark, full of lasers and fog and music, and people will think they're in Star Wars. Or you could get a dog and train him as a guard, which is great if you live in a warehouse and need a guard dog. But if you take it home as a pet, it will eat your kids. And completely useless.
He's weird. We were walking through the airport, recently connecting in Chicago, and he started: "Jeremy, smell my jacket." - Really? - Yeah. That's what he said: "Smell my jacket." I said: "Why?" "Because it smells like old record players."
And then you had to strap it to the boat. I don't understand straps with buckles. - There's plenty of water in the boat. - It was already there when I bought it. It's leaking.
I'll catch up to that boat. Oh, great. Look at that sun. That's the fastest thing I-- Why is it faster than me?
We loved it in the Caribbean. And so did our camera crews. And we thought it would be great to make a movie next week about comparing the car culture of the French, Germans and British. - Yeah, that was a great idea. - Great. But Mr. Wilman, our producer, decided that it wasn't great at all, and that instead we would go to the north of France with three old cars and drive in the rain there.
Yes. Chicken is a vegetable. No, it's not. Scientifically, a chicken is a vegetable. If you cut off its head, it keeps running... There you go! So it doesn't have a mind. - It's a highly evolved vegetable.
Yes! No May? No, nor will he be, for I was in another part of the harbor, according to my cunning plan. Last night, when these two had gone to bed, I had arranged that our boat would be waiting for me in the harbor. Here she is.
Let's talk about the main point, which is: James May, you lost and crashed our boat. - That's true. - Wait a minute. My car was closer to England than yours. Yeah, and it was also closer to the bottom of the sea than ours.
It's all irrelevant, because my car is the only one that hasn't broken down. Mine was perfectly fine, too, Hammond. Mine was as reliable as James's hands. The amazing thing is, nobody knows what happened to it. It fell off the tow truck.
Mine was perfectly fine, too, Hammond. Mine was as safe as James's hands. The amazing thing is, nobody knows what happened to it. It fell off the tow truck. No, nobody knows what fault caused it to end up on that tow truck.
It's a new way of understanding yourself as a human being. The last word in luxury. That statement is a bit expensive, isn't it? If you have the money for a car like this, you can buy a Jaguar and you'll have £130,000 left over to hire a PR man, he'll push you on TV and you'll declare how cool you are. It costs £130,000 more for a reason.
It has the same basic aluminum structure inside as the Jaguar XE, which is a great car, so that's a good thing. I only have a supercharged three-liter six-cylinder engine, which means 375 horsepower, which is 225 less than - let's be honest - James' luxuriously trimmed version of the Audi Q7. But it's a lightweight car, so you can't call it slow. I like the way this thing behaves. I like that when changing direction, when turning, it controls its weight, which is there, along the axles, which makes it feel nimble and light.
We're not that stupid. Just like leaving the gates open at the lions in a safari park doesn't mean we're all going to run to a lion picnic. The British economy has grown 58% in the last 15 years. And the German economy has grown 102%. All this is because we drive at 32 km/hour and they drive at 320 km/hour. Speed is good for business. It also saves lives.
The reboot completely wiped my memory. Android, can I do something? Don't even think about it. The neural link is a major advantage. It allows complete control of the ship - shields, navigation, weapons.
I have an idea. 5-AYA: Six, come in. Go ahead. Talk to me. Jake said to pump up the rear tire. It's flat.
How soon will it reach the outer edges of the station? If the present rate of collapse is maintained, in less than half an hour. 2-AYA: Are you sure? I double-checked the readings. Whatever that white wall outside is, it's getting closer.
2-AYA: Are you sure? I double-checked the readings. Whatever that white wall outside is, it's coming. We've got to hurry. Get the engine and get out of here before it hits us.
You think you can convince the workers? Yes. I'll show them it's the best thing for them. I gotta say, you surprised me. You got a bad reputation, but it's not true.
What's he doing out there? We're on our way. You should know. The anomaly is increasing in intensity. It appears to be drawing power from the station's fusion reactor.
When my comrade Boone woke up, he said it was a portal. He also said he could hear voices. Maybe he does. He was possessed by a creature like that. We were able to get it out, but what if it was affecting him?
Do you think you've lost faith, Father? Faith? How could I lose it? I have just seen the demon and the smoke rising from the abyss, sent to torment us, just as the Gospel said. I am afraid, not because I am losing my faith, but because it is stronger than ever.
Engaging stabilizers. Inverting engine thrust. What else am I missing? By surrendering to the power of-- Meditation doesn't help land a stupid ship! But it does help me stay on my feet.
Great, so Cassandra and I will go to New York, and you guys can go to South Carolina. No. I should go there alone. He can be a little cranky. Eve can't go anyway. I have my own mission and it takes priority.
- Oh, yeah. Last time we spoke, you were in the anger stage. Now you've moved on to bargaining. You can't really bargain with a tumor. So if, uh. it could stay a part of you and you could go on living?
You have to believe me. Let me prove it. - How? - The secret lab. If it's really there, we're telling the truth.
Soon a butterfly will be born from it. When I was little, like you, I saw it happen. But the butterfly was having a hard time. So I decided to help it. I opened the cocoon very carefully and the butterfly crawled out. But it couldn't fly.
We've got a lot of them here - me, Sacker - who were given a place when they were born. But you came here knowing what it's like to be an outsider, that's why you're so fierce. But rage still rules you, not you over it. Right now, it's directed at me, and it's doing you no good. Turn it to another target, and it becomes a weapon, not a problem.
Axelrod lacks five of the eight virtues of bushido. - Six. He's been impolite often enough. - In that case, samurai honor doesn't require silence or suicide. It requires revenge.
Is it bad for my reputation? - If you didn't say it, it would hurt the campaign, but I can make it into an anti-bullying manifesto, and when you and I are done, you'll be signing baseball bats to voters. - (laughs) Okay. This is my greatest vulnerability. And it's in your hands.
No, it's the deliberate abuse of the man who beat and raped me. Well, they fit everything. Colonel Omar al-Saleh is pushing women's rights harder and harder year after year. Absolutely, and that's why this photo op is so important. It sends an important message.
I suppose you'll be needing my plane? - May I, please? - Well, since you ask. I want to say something about my paella. It's so good, what happens when you taste it, Will?
- Yes! Excellent. So, what do you think of our manuscript? I mean, it's a rough draft, but, uh. - I think it's very interesting.
Thank you. - That was amazing. - Yeah. As my dad used to say, "If that speech were a horse, it would be a unicorn."
- Absolutely. I think you should be honored that I thought your story was special enough to use. Did you really like it? Uh, actually, uh. You know, my dad used to have a saying. He used to say, "If this speech were a horse, it would be a unicorn.
I think you should be honored that I thought your story was special enough to use. Did you really like it? Uh, actually, uh. You know, my dad used to have a saying. He used to say, "If that speech were a horse, she'd be a unicorn. Because it was magical."
Look, I've been in this situation. With a stroller? I'm just asking because it's like I'm already with a stroller. This wedding is not gonna make it to the wedding palace. I don't think it's gonna make it to the car.
I always end up there, too. We'd like to officially invite you to the party. Yeah. You should invite them. She can be a slumber party.
- (Major) Okay. (Ravi) You know, I've prepared a whole speech. Sincere and funny. Deep. But what's the point if you're gonna forget it anyway? Let's just say it was brilliant.
I don't know how to do that, ma'am. Yes. I'll try. I understand your concern, Senator. Student loan reform is a priority for you, and it will be for the president and me.
Anything else? He told us to get the book from the widow. Yeah, it's gonna be tough now, but if we see Azra-- Baji, I know where the book is. Not bad. You should have stepped in sooner. It's in the conservatory.
My blood will no longer kill an innocent. Please. Only your blood can save us. My blood is a curse. But it will allow me to hide in the rain.
We have to give you anesthesia. And if we don't? You'll die. The liver needs time. I mean, we're keeping it here as a precaution, but it needs to heal itself.
You have to forgive yourself. Forgive yourself, Charlie. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No! They had to live! All your life, Charlie, you've been surrounded by death, and it's still coming for you.
Your package. it squeaks or whistles. Which one? The box. It's alive.
I hope so. Look how we got the truth out of each other. Yeah. And you and your aura. I think it's, uh. bright, iridescent, pastel.
I'm not going on sick leave. Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend hurt you, and then tried to inject you with poison. I think you deserve a couple days of sick leave. You've been working on that leopard tattoo for two weeks. maybe Sandstorm didn't put it on Jane because it's lame. Or did they realize she might expose them?
- It's a nice apartment. I saw the knife that killed Jones. That's not your knife, that's Freddy's. Peterson solved the leopard tattoo. It leads to Cat Jarrett.
So it's all for nothing? Not necessarily. We just need to show these pictures to Roman. I don't think that's a good idea. No, the tattoo doesn't point to Pharrell, it points to Kat.
But some alumni use it in life after college to justify some shady business deeds. Like being a key figure in the dark internet. Let he who is without sin-- Focus, Rich. This version of the formula. what's it for?
He? Are you serious? Check out his harness. That's Willy Wonka's golden ticket. It opens every door in this building.
I want to know salvation! Syphilis. The great pox. For a while I masked his sinful rash and skillfully applied theatrical makeup, but now..... It has overwhelmed his mind.
Get a house like this. Living the American dream. Yeah, I'm not exactly cut out for the laid-back country life. You know what I mean. Whatever you think of your old life, it was better than this one.
How's the mental status? Good, she's calm. I mean her husband. And how do you use this thing? It's for rectal exams.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter at all. That's not what this is about. I literally ruined my entire life for this play. That's why I'm here, sir. And the crazy thing is, it's really good, it is.
When? You know, they just, uh. They make it so complicated, man. It's too fucking complicated. We're gonna go back to that bar next week. And one way or another, we're gonna get our money. Yeah, I'm gonna live the life I was supposed to have instead of waiting for it to find me.
The photographer initially agreed to provide us with her work, but backed out at the last minute. Why did she decide to back out? Okay, I just, uh. I think it's a story worth fighting for. It's pure gold to us. She is what she is, no play on words.
That's not what we discussed. I know, I, uh... I took a swing. Definitely. She's perfect.
No, I'm not hungry. How about you? Do you have any specialties? The crispy pork with Chinese broccoli is probably our favorite. It's amazing.
L-A-Y-C... Mr. Hunley, are you refusing to cooperate with the investigation? This is Sergeant Arnott, leave a message. Sarge, we've got the license plate number. It belongs to Nicholas Huntley, Roz's husband.
I want the full version of Cottan's dying declaration. - Morning, Ian. - Good morning, sir. Sir, as you know, my department operates under unilateral protection. This part of the tape was released because it was used in court.
It's not working out. Roz Huntley has proven that you are an ineffective organization. - A corrupt organization. - Sir, I must protest! You know Ted, I don't think we know the half of Matthew Cottan's dealings, and the real reason you're keeping the full tape secret is because it will give the critics of AC-12 a trump card.
The younger copy is in somber contemplation of his future, of what he will become. If you're interested, there are other copies from this period in the next room. - I beg your pardon. - Hmm? Where can I find an Abyssinian ceramic collection? "Alas, it is not on display."
I've put the fight in your favor. Did you ask her about the camera? -What? Your camera. It's in her locker.
There's still a lot to do before we shoot. Are we filming here? - In this gray, depressing hole? No. Bash and I are gonna look at the set. It's expensive, but I don't write the checks, so--
- Yeah - you eat what you want? Well... Sometimes we get airplane food and sometimes we get Lebanese food - It's different, but it's very good
- I didn't invite you - I wanted to support women's sports I have a new parking lot at work. My car is dirty. It's under a fig tree.
This is gonna be awesome. Who would even throw this out? The net's a little crumpled. You're what? It's perfect.
I'm still me! - For now. All your power, Margaret. Hard-won power. Can you feel it slipping through your fingers?
Yo. Am I dreaming? I-- I saw a chunk of ice, a huge one. Can you take me to it? - (syd) can you take me to it? - (david) "can"? - I keep thinking about that door, the way it comes and goes.
Your rational part. You're having a nervous breakdown. a stress response. Your power is trying to save you. It created me.
She didn't write "unbearable" with an E. She wrote her "life has become unbearable" with an E. There's no such word. Our situation is not "unbearable." It's "unbearable."
So what are you gonna do? Send James to kill him? James has a terrible habit of creating the very problems he's supposed to solve. Why did you leave the eyewitness? He gave me a purpose, but it was false.
YEAR: 2046 Here. Finally getting the pool done? Do we need this wall? It's load-bearing, so yes.
Do we know them? And more importantly. do any of them look like me? That's the problem with first responders. You're connected to time, but you can't see the big picture. It's moving and changing.
- He said that every German needs to see the City of Lights at least once - so he organized an invitation for me. - Hmm! Here's to the Brigadefuhrer. I don't like vodka. It burns my throat. - Haha!
That's how I choose to think of him, if anyone can take him. Isn't that sad? No, not really. It's like a soul, you know? No one knows for sure if it exists.
I've been looking all over for you. You shouldn't be here, Monty. Nobody should be here. Do you know why the moon is red? Is it really red?
Nothing could be more legitimate. Mossad ran a shadow operation on American soil. If the FBI finds out about this, there'll be an international incident. - Where's the system? - It's right here.
James Maddox was just convenient. The BNM money allowed me to buy someone at the top of the food chain. I promised them a telecontrol system capable of overcoming the Iron Dome. After six months of work, I have no intention of starting over. So where is it?
You guys know Arkani's making a bomb, but you don't know if he has a lair nearby? No. And it's not a bomb. It's a missile guidance system designed to penetrate the Iron Dome. In the wrong hands, it could endanger thousands of lives.
No. And it's not a bomb. It's a missile guidance system designed to penetrate the Iron Dome. In the wrong hands, it could endanger thousands of lives. Then I'd rather have it in my hands.
I'm sure it'll all work out. I admit I'm surprised. I'm not amazed at a lot of things, but this is a miracle, that's all. We recovered a bullet from the body. It matches the caliber of the revolver we found in your possession, the one that was recently fired.
Thank you, sir. And congratulations again. Are you sure you want me to do this? Perhaps it's best left to someone else. I want the truth, wherever it leads.
But nothing here says Florence Lesser was murdered. What? The newspaper thumbnail. That's the clue. And I think I know where it is.
And I think I know where she is. My umbrella! What do you hope to find? A miniature of the newspaper, sir. Where is it?
A victim of a broken heart. But then that idiot, my husband, fancied himself a home defense against burglars. What are you doing? Everything okay in there? When a butterfly needs to get out of its chrysalis, it looks for the weakest point.
I'm stuck and I can't move forward. What do you think is slowing you down? I slept with Eddie. Love is often stronger than faith. It can be a prison that keeps us from becoming who we could be.
What do you think is slowing you down? I slept with Eddie. Love is often stronger than faith. It can be a prison that keeps us from becoming what we could be. It weakens us. I want you to close your eyes, Sarah.
Uh, no. Better yet. no suspension. I'm doing my best, but you're not helping. I can't let disobedience to authority get in the way. You can't make my job here any harder than it already is.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. I got her, I got her. Get her back on the ice. The mother's remaining kidney is thrombosed. She's dead.
And they shouldn't. - Hey! Hey. Busy? Yeah, I'm gonna paint a wall and watch it dry.
A flash drive. Did it look like this? Yes. And what happened when we put this flash drive into our computer? It ran a virus on our system.
How did I not see it on the bank statement? Why put the money I need to escape in the dead of night in the bank? It's in my getaway bag. It's hard not to take it personally, but, uh. where is that bag? It's in the, uh. в...
They'd like to destroy him. Let me put it any way you lawyers like. Your clients bought a stolen car, and now, to avoid seeing the rightful owner behind the wheel, they want the car scrapped. Mr. Hite fertilized an egg. She's half his.
- Yeah. Well. To stand trial for Margaret's murder. You also have to find the club. Otherwise, the prosecution will say you got rid of it by killing Margaret. Any idea where it is?
- Let's get started. Here's what we know: Rutger, uh. ate Josh's beluga-- Wait, this squiggly thing is a fish? Draw waves on top so it's underwater.
Go ahead. I'll listen, I promise. I won't cover my ears. Okay, Trixie can go to private school, and that's really, really good for her. But she's super exclusive, and I'm not sure I want her growing up in that environment.
He's ugly. That's the main thing. Okay, here's the plan. We have a fight. It escalates, and I dramatically turn the table.
Next time, I'd prefer an MRI. Do you have any idea how expensive that is? I've got another year on my I.V.P., and I-- Look, the MRI won't hurt. It's gonna hurt me because there's no indication that he needs it.
If it's in her esophagus, chances are it's also in her spine. You risk paralyzing her if you try to get it out. Okay. We can at least remove the tumor from her heart, get rid of her symptoms. Sure, it'll grow back, but slowly, she'll have more time.
Daddy! Mommy! Natalie showed me a snake! - It was a caterpillar. - She said it would one day turn into a beautiful butterfly.
Look, whatever happens, you don't have to release me, no matter how bad it gets. Thank you. I wanted to thank you, Linc. I want to thank you for your sacrifice. I want you to know it won't be in vain.
She just laughed and said, "We'll see about that." That night she took the boy from the cell across the hall. Dragged him into her tower and whipped him. He screamed, his screams echoing off the walls, begging for someone to stop her. I reached my cell door, it was open.
People are ugly. I'm just saying Koreatown has a rich and complex history, presenting unique political challenges. You've said it and said it and said it. Look, I'd listen to you talk about zoning all day long, but the blue Subaru that shot at us isn't going to find itself, so we'd... The point is, I requested backup for you, and it just showed up.
Don't you get it, man? Your impulse was a "scar" of reality triggered on your subconscious. A "scar" of reality. So, what does this fun gun do? In theory, it targets irregularities in the hippocampus, and acts like a "Ctrl+Z" on memories.
So, what does this fun gun do? In theory, it targets abnormalities in the hippocampus, and acts like a "Ctrl+Z" on memories. "Ctrl+Z"? Like the "undo" command on a computer. Well, I was going to try the new version on my last test subject, but then I got scared it might melt brains.
Sumerian alabaster statuette. 5,000 years old. From who? Should I leave it on the table? It's very beautiful.
"A Trojan horse to infect the file system? I'm an amateur, but I'm a fast learner. And the negative view? One of these days, our luck's gonna run out. She's gonna snap and ruin everything.
I'll repeat the question: what kind of doctor? Endocrinologist. I have a tumor in my brain. It's not malignant, but, uh.
Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna grab my laundry and go to the laundromat. Uh, just one question. It's in the basement.
- I don't know how this thing works. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I need it to-- I need it to spin.
What's this? It's, uh. my theme song. Also known as a distress signal. You like distress calls? It's when you see the true face of the universe... when it asks for your help.
Die with dignity. No... - No! Our vitals. He's hooked them up to the cooling system. If we die, it'll open up.
Doctor! Look, a stone mound from the Picts' civilization. A bird! What's wrong with her? She said "darkness".
A bird! What's wrong with her? She said "darkness." That's why we're in a hurry - it's not so bright this time of day. But she's talking!
So stupid. I mean, there it is: I did this because I'll never give me a F. Yeah, but philosophy is something bigger than that. It teaches you how to really think.
Last year I climbed mountains in Canada. I'm sorry, sir. But your map doesn't fit. - What? It's rejected.
300 pounds! 300 pounds? Well, I've always said I think this lamp is rather... ugly. You obviously don't love it enough! Be careful, it's ancient Roman.
Be careful, it's Roman. I wonder if it's from around the time those coins were found at Chedworth. - We're engravers, not auctioneers. If you want it refurbished, it'll cost a pound and a half. It's in perfect condition.
We're like the Flintstones. There's a program called Lotus 1-2-3. Could save you a lot of time. I might make a suggestion to the boss if I knew what we were talking about. I can show you how it works.
¬all of you stay home or find shelter. "What if you-- Listen, it's flooding out there. √Where? In the kitchen. "there's water everywhere. "it's coming in.
Death is a huge minus for me. I like them young and alive. Don't forget that. Are you sure this batch is okay. Well, I haven't checked, because that way I'd destroy the cure target, but yeah, it's fine.
- No, I won't sign it! God, you're a fucking sadist! You're insane. I'm tempted to say yes just to watch you waste your time. This technology wasn't working when Peter described it, and it's not working now.
God, you're a fucking sadist! You're insane. I'm tempted to agree just to watch you waste your time. This technology wasn't working when Peter described it, it's not working now. - In fact, it's working now.
You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. It's not going to explode. The rocket, it's not gonna blow up with us.
Not yet. Who knows what the URC will do with what you've given them. You think it's just information, But it could just be a distraction. Who knows what doors it'll open.
Smashing a guard's head in for a baseball card, I think that's awful. Uh, look. I had nothing to do with that. Please, Mr. Charles, if you insist on being innocent, it'll only make things worse when we find the stolen item in your car or your house or wherever. Why don't you tell us where it is?
Come on, get out. This way, how are you? Admiring yourself, Ms. Traub? Or are you looking for blood spatter from your ex-boyfriend's murder? When we found blood on Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Pride Bunark or his accomplice.
Admiring yourself, Ms. Traub? Or are you looking for blood spatter from your ex-boyfriend's murder? When we found blood on Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Pride Bunark or his accomplice. We were wrong. It was Ryan's.
I can't stop thinking about M.K. and Cosima, who is out there alone somewhere. Why do I love my sisters so much when they ruined my life. Hey, your life isn't ruined. It's just waiting for you to come back and rock.
You're wonderful. I'm so glad I have this choice. Edward was a scientist. He always told me that energy is not created or destroyed. That it just exists.
Beauty is inevitable. This car smells like cherries. Can we keep it? No, sweetie. It's a rental.
Hi, Naomi. My mom wanted to thank you for letting me stay with you this weekend. No problem. Nice car. It's a rental.
I don't want to look at you. I don't want to... I don't want to do anything with you. Why are you here? Because I want to help you, because I love you. I'm so tired of people who talk about love and have no idea what it means.
Caspar used to check out of the hotel if he didn't like the carpet. What are you working on? Trying to create the perfect apartment. It's not going anywhere. If you cure a dog, it should be healthy.
A homemade filter that your department buys for all the townspeople. Odd, you didn't tell me you held a patent. You have a degree in materials science. And before civil service, you tried your hand at entrepreneurship. However, your water filtration system didn't find its niche, it was too expensive for the average consumer and not high-end enough for large institutions.
- That's-- - Stupid, really stupid. I'm sorry. - That's great, Josh. I think you just invented democracy, and it's gonna save Fillory.
Hunger, yeah. Right. (chuckles) Mitchell's on a diet right now, by the way. How are you eating now? Less. Honey, I see what you're doing, but this whole control thing. it's messy.
My minister has been killed. His wife is murdered. A murderer has taken her own life. And this epidemic continues to spread. It is within my walls.
His wife was murdered. The killer took her own life. And this epidemic continues to spread. It is within my walls. It is in my blood and in my mind.
Go ahead. Shall we dance? I'd love to. That's a beautiful song. Can you tell me what it's about?
Don't do that. What? That cute little brainiac smile of yours, don't do that. I didn't realize I was doing it. You do, and it's annoying and kind of judgmental, to be honest.
What's inactive? The pyramid. We're monitoring it. Why? What was she doing?
Get straight to the explanation. It's the Doctor. Found it. A laboratory in Yorkshire. In a nutshell, a displaced decimal point that created a bacterium that turns all living things into dirt. And why would it destroy the world?
We give him two minutes, then we go in. Agreed? Agreed. There's a toxic air filtration system in here. It runs every half hour.
Agreed? Agreed. There's a toxic air filtration system in here. It runs every half hour. It'll release the bacteria into the atmosphere.
I too hope to visit you sometime in the future. "There are places." That's right. It's a beautiful day. planned. The only thing that was impromptu was that speech, but, you know, it's, uh. you know. like. I think it's cool.
We're leaving. - Why? - You lied. You stole our trip. It was our family tradition, and you may think it's stupid, but it's ours.
Dr. Smith, you may remember Dr. Chakrabarti, our pathologist. He used to work at the CDC, and we asked him to come in and help translate the scientific language. I don't think you'll need much translating. All month long, Seattle has been watching tens of thousands of deaths. The epidemic is mutating rapidly, and it's drug resistant.
There are over a billion intelligent species in this galaxy alone. Knowing how to kill them is an even greater challenge. On this planet, we serve as executioners of all living things. Destroying a Time Lord is a special honor. The technology is strictly calibrated. As you can see, it will stop both hearts and all three brainstems, as well as launch a cellular shockwave that will block the ability to regenerate.

As you can see, it will stop both hearts and all three brainstems, as well as launch a cellular shockwave that will block the ability to regenerate. I know how it works.
Mr. McDuck! An efficient clean energy source that can power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electricity. Oh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to another Scottish billionaire's claim that the real diamond belongs to him? This trinket? It's nice, but it's obviously badly cursed.
The guy needed a moment to say goodbye to his entire comic book collection. We have a couple more questions. Starting with, uh. why is Dan's missing painting for sale here? This is the first time Lady Wellin Marsapple, heroine of the Ogden Tweedlehut series, has appeared in print. And who says she's missing?
If he's got a CD player. But the Golf probably still has a cassette player. And May's wrong about that, of course. This car may be a thing of the past, but listen to it. It's accelerating now, you can probably hear it, but I haven't done anything.
Only 4,500. How do you survive that? I think we've proven that it's not worth buying a car like this yet. Don't even argue. It's not ready. - Yes, it is.
Unbelievable. - Things are different now, aren't they? - It's amazing. It's unbelievable. Listen to this. My shirt is older than anything we can see from this window. James, your shirt is older than Carthage. It's already a rarity.
Yes, sir. - But you'll do it first thing in the morning. It's late. That's enough for today. I'd also like to stop by the library while it's open, pick up a copy of The Blazing Tree, but if anyone wants a beer afterward....
Me? Yeah, what did you think when you first read it? Uh, well, uh. You know. It's, uh. rich in memories.
It would not have been difficult for someone so skilled in forging signatures to forge Esther's handwriting. It must have been pretty easy to get your hands on a copy of Esther's signature. And then all you had to do was plant a fake note in her purse after you killed her. But as resourceful as it was, the suicide note also exposed you. It was typed, which means it was somehow not credible.
- We're not going anywhere without the access code. - I didn't think of that. There's another problem. Thrawn's almost found your base. - Tell me where it is.
No. You'll find out when we get there. - If he destroys it before then. Tell me where it is, and I'll delete it from the database. If it's even there.
Look, Emily. I trust you. If you really think I should do this commercial, then I will. No. Because it's terrible.
Okay, seriously, she's not going in my helicopter. Jackie, can you come in, please? Did you guys want something? No, but the fat guy from Ohio wants his shirt back. It was bought at Talbots.
And I realized, Claire, that we have to fundamentally change the way we think and the way we act. Who lives in the White House is no longer about-- It's who owns it. Isn't the presidency the pinnacle of a politician's achievement? The real power is not here. It's outside this realm.
Who lives in the White House is no longer important..... It's who owns the house that matters. Isn't the presidency the pinnacle of a politician's accomplishments? The real power is not here. It's outside this sphere. It's above it, but it only acts in concert with it.
Don't tell me. I want it to be a surprise. So you've finally decided to return this car? Yeah. You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it is.
I want it to be a surprise. So you've finally decided to return this car? Yeah. You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it is. I took it to a toy train store, and it showed that everyone there was sad.
You know, they're very persistent guys, they're bound to find out. Okay, I have nothing to hide. Tom was a great sailor, really, but he went out once when a storm was forecast. And he took his son with him. An 8-year-old son. And when the storm came, it was bigger than he expected.
Sir? So, uh. the inspector was right. After killing Tom Lewis, Frank Henderson came down here and hid in this compartment. And stayed there the whole time we were searching the boat. Until she returned to port and he had a chance to escape.
We'll find him. We don't even know where he is. Yes, you do. This magic helps those with true love find each other. It can open the door that leads to Hook.
James Wackler had a safety deposit box in the bank. Convinced Tatum to have me there. Guess what was inside? The memory card that Wackler stole from Roxanne's hidden camera. She recorded her murder.
In cold blood. And the son faked his own suicide. I believe that's when Steve took Steve's cufflink. But your plan needed a twist. After all, why would a passing cleaning lady say the room was locked if it was open?
Shit. No laptop. What are we doing here? Look, Jake's shirt. It looks like it was on fire.
Use your feet, Jeffrey. Not your mouth. You're funny. I'm looking forward to your presentation. I'm sure it'll be great.
- Rewind. - Did you see this? He put the bag behind the pot. Let's go. Is it in there?
He put the bag behind the pot. Let's go. Is it in there? Is she in there? - She's here!
Wait, you're saying he put a gun in his-- It's not gonna take an interrogation to prove his guilt. You're gonna need this. Thank you, Lord, for the life you give us. It's full of labor and commitment, sorrow and joy.
I want you to know that I'm getting married. That's great news. Congratulations. I'd love for you to come to the wedding. When is it?
For a long time I was completely comfortable knowing that I could die at any moment, that I could walk out of here into the street and get shot. I'm used to that. But lately, I can smell it in the air around me. It's like death. creeping up on me from the corners of the room. And I don't know if it's coming for me.
He had a little trouble in the woods last night. Nothing life-threatening. That's good. But this thing is attacking us. Now it's attacking us near our house.
Lock the door behind me. - The roof. Red. The roof, red. - What? It was red.
I can't say that, Nathaniel. Because I don't want to go back to 1942. I know I have to. I know I have a destiny, and we shouldn't disrupt time any more than we do now. But I have to believe that time is stronger than that. And if I have a destiny, it will wait.
When I get back, we'll talk. We're coming with you. - What's going on? - Our friend Calvin tried to jump up and pull the fire escape down. He grabbed it, but it fell on top of him.
- Doc, we made a deal. In blood. We belong to the Black Badges, and if they find Dolls, they'll shoot him on sight. Winona, I was supposed to get the serum two days ago. It's not ready.
They could be something much bigger. My magic? Why not your magic? Darling, don't you see? Your magic is useful because it's unstable.
What now? There's only one way to find out. You ready? Yeah. What is it? This thing. it's been siphoning my magic out of me.
Reboot. Started last September. A lot of people involved. I take it you didn't coordinate this operation with the police or any other agency? No, no, no, no, it's highly classified.
Actually, C.O. Crowley wants to transfer you to 27. They need people for the third shift. Night shift. - Are you serious right now? - She was free.
Seriously? How'd it go? - It did. Did you notice these tire prints? And this little scratch on the ground; looks like it's from something on the car.
Let's run through your expenses. What's your rent? I don't want to say. Is it that much? I don't want to say because I don't know what it is.
That's exactly what they're waiting for. I mean, they have to be fought with cunning, or knowledge, or time. Caleb's right. These people are unpredictable. Your strategy was useful for a while, but if it's no longer useful, you should change tactics.
Thanks, Todd. You're welcome. So, does anyone else want to say a few words? Yeah, I do. Every time there's hope in my life, hope dies.
Hello? Hey, buddy, still looking for a place to stay? Uh, uh. yeah. Why do you ask? Well, you know, we have an extra bedroom, and if you need it, it's yours.
Which, unlike the body, is allowed to tickle. You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. I think I had a premonition. Gentlemen, a very interesting thing just happened to this spoon. If she didn't sing "Be Our Guest," I'm against it.
Are we still talking about the spoon? It's nice to see you're interested in Amy's work Don't get me wrong. Neurobiology is nothing more than the science of gray jelly-like matter. But when it touches physics, gas on the floor, Martha, we're going for a ride.
I don't know, check your body for tattoos? Leonard, be nice. She's kidding! Wait, wait, wait. Where's my bag? My phone and wallet are in my bag. It's right here.
Oh, great! Did you miss the big thing this weekend? What? The conference. It seemed so important to you.
Voice mail? Lucado, pick up the phone! Why don't you call Jeremy again? How long will it take for that thing to eat its way out of here? I'm sure if I get off, it'll eat me!
Bag that thing, and Jeremy knows what to do. She... Didn't have any questions. I do. When you broke those demon eggs, did you get wet? Well, I love my job, but it's been a long time since she bought me dinner.
- Fight it. - It's-- It's-- It's-- - Waverly. - Winona! Remember when you made me drink grape soda until she turned up her nose?
I'm so sorry, are you okay? Yeah, don't worry, I'm fine. MONTY: I got this thing, I'm trying to find a use for it. As you can see, it's not even good for propping up a door.
Yeah. All your stuff's soaking wet in here. People who lived here before me said they waterproofed in the '90s. The problem with water, especially underground, in a house like this. - It finds a way to seep in.
The point is, Helen knew that coin meant I was with her. She wasn't alone. It's just a coin, Owen. That no-one, not Maxwell Flattshill or Alice Winter, will notice. And it will remind you that you're not alone until you don't need it any more.
"Sandstorm may control the building, but they don't know it as well as I do. There's another basement under the building. And a technical elevator. In the 80's the city started remodeling to extend the N subway line. It went under the building where our office is.
- No. That was just part of it. Shepard has gathered all of us in this room to be the successors to a government she considers corrupt, a government she intends to destroy. The attack on the country is not over. It's just begun.
This is a matter of national security. It is our duty to remain in this bunker until otherwise instructed, We become the successors to the United States government. The attack on the country is not over. It's just begun.
They're just all resting. Why isn't anyone resting in the new break room? - Because it's a huge pile of crap. - It's horrible. It's unusable.
Look at the map work. It's amazingly simple. Trying to flatter. Didn't work. It's Boyle's card, and to put it mildly, it's worthy.
You changed the tire after all. I'll take that as a win. Okay, you were right about the break room. Yeah. Nobody likes it, and it's not functional.
According to the phone records, we think Ocampo's still in Brooklyn. Is it true you still have a bullet in your thigh from the shootout with the Canarsie killer? - No. Shit. - It's in his jaw.
- И? - And that was the act of an asshole! - Santiago! You did it! - And you've been listening to fucking classical music all day. It's too loud!
Where'd you find the steering wheel? Nowhere. There was a Frisbee in the trunk, so I glued it on. That's right. I unmacguided the thing, and it works perfectly.
- Don't be ashamed, okay? I'm so proud of you. You're being proactive. - Checking your fertility when you're not even thinking about doing it in the near future is a mature move. - Yeah, listen. Honey, I mean, I appreciate your support, it's important.
You grew up in prison? Van, did you know I'm the only senior vice president in this building who doesn't have an office? Emily, you grew up in a box. You're like a tropical fish that grows up in a coral reef, but if you take it out and give it an office, it dies. - What?
It's none of your business. There's no hope anymore. No. There's hope. It's everywhere.
She found out I had writers and a focus group.... At the end of the fucking letter, you should have captioned it. "Approved by mother and sister." But love is worth it. It's worth it.
I want a big, tall guy... "That's my boyfriend. I'm mad at my boyfriend!" I'd wear his jacket. It's too big for me.
A little accident. I got drunk... but I'm fine. She puked on her beard, you can't wear it. Even better. She couldn't catch it...in the toilet.
What's the latest from Black Badges? Eventually you and your boys are going to have to get in the game, because neutrality is the devil's ally. And, brother... The devil is close. There's an abandoned chapel on Highway 62. It's right next to Juan Carlo's store.
There's no time. She's already here. Damn, sooner than expected. She's looking for the third seal. The seal isn't mine, and I don't know where it is.
When they resurrect their dead demon husband, she'll be there to help send him where he belongs. After everything Winona did to get that seal... How can I? You can say I made you do it. That I ordered you to. I don't even know where it is.
Damn it, Oliver, I told you. It's over. The bluff worked. What do you mean it worked? I got a number, and it's good.
Here's your ID. Make sure it's spelled correctly. Company credit card. Company cell phone, keys to the company car. It's a Honda in the H section, west side.
Who the hell are they? I don't know, Leandra. I was thinking, uh. This job. What is it?
Corn. Where's all the corn? The field's all cleaned up. Yeah, we got it all. Well, where is it?
Failed the apnea test. I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer. You left a bullet in his head. Oh, thank you. It's pressing on the medulla oblongata.
And how do you do it? Where do you start? - You don't like the pattern? - No, no, no. It's good.
But it's not really... I'm sorry. Kevin, pick up the phone, please. - I can't. She's in the aquarium.
Follow me, please. This way, please. Fernando was downstairs, and something crawled out of the vent and-- I heard him screaming, so I went to check it out. This thing was dragging Fernando all over the room. I thought it was gonna kill him.
What are ley lines? Invisible lines of energy crossing the Earth. Streams of supernatural energy. It's believed that if you connect the places where something unexplained happened with straight lines, an incredibly powerful knot will form at their intersections. Abby and I dismissed this theory because it seemed completely unprovable.
Uh, you know what? I have a toast in mind. - All right, then. - Let's do it. Physics is the science of moving bodies through space. It can unlock the mysteries of the universe.
I have a toast in mind. - Oh, well. - Let's do it. Physics is the science of moving bodies through space. It can unlock the mysteries of the universe. But it cannot answer the eternal question of the meaning of life.
Waiter. Blink so I know you're sane. - I'm sorry. - Oh, God. My blood is circulating wildly through my body, it's uncomfortable. It's like it's pooling right here.
I'm sorry, "prince." "Then he bent down to kiss her, and said..." That's heresy. How does the story end? I'll tell you how it ends.
I don't feel alone. We weren't supposed to find each other. But we did. He made me feel like my life wasn't over. That it's just begun.
It's a private facility that turns recoverable objects like you into people with extraordinary abilities. If you're hoping to acquire them painlessly. You're wrong. I'm injecting you with a serum that activates mutant genes in your DNA. In order for it to work, we need to put you under extreme stress.
Your stress levels have increased enough to cause a mutation. You sadistic bastard! I cured you, Wade. Mutated cells can heal anything. They attack the tumor as soon as it forms.
He wants me to let go of my guilt and apologize. Robert, what I did to you in senior year of high school was despicable. I've regretted it my whole life, day in and day out. Because gang bullying is a national scourge. It can leave a person with a trauma that will last a lifetime.
Hear me out. I was a fool. Here. I thought my life was a failure. I thought it was ordinary.
- Hold on a second. - Yeah. Oh, my God! Dude, where'd you find it? I used to sleep in it, but it's clean now, don't worry. Yes!
The cut hurts and it's like it's deep. It's not bad. It just needs to be cleaned. Lisa, get my first aid kit, it's in my backpack.
You know, that's what Jack called it. When he saw how much we were spending, he said: "Your little vanity project is gonna bankrupt the federal government." People need their history. It gives them strength.
Every quote from Jack was either Greek or Roman. And that last song, that last side of "Camelot" keeps rolling around in my head. "Don't forget that for a brief shining moment there was Camelot. Jack loved the story. It made him who he was.
And you? Do you feel you treated him fairly? I think the characters we read about on the pages turn out to be more real than the people who were with us. I should have known it was too much to ask to grow old together, to see our children grow up. The darkness may never leave us, but it won't always be so heavy.
- Calm down and don't panic. This thing wants to eat me and you tell me not to panic? Looks like they're mobilizing. David, I hope it's not some kind of Trojan horse. I don't think it's dangerous to us.
This thing wants to eat me, and you tell me not to panic? Looks like they're mobilizing. David, I hope it's not some kind of Trojan horse. I don't think it's dangerous to us. But I'm sure it's dangerous to them.
- I got you! Hold on! - I can't! My glove! It's going to slip!
I'm just a badass. I'm gonna take a leak. You know what this song is about, Michael? I'll tell you. It's about two lovers with too many secrets in their lives who must choose exile or death.
Nadine. Nadine. Hey, wake up. You had brain surgery. It worked.
Everyone just wants to feel confident in life. The bottom line is that no matter how important they are, they always want to be more confident. People worry about it Oh no, they're better than me It's like, gosh, they don't realize that their importance doesn't matter. When confidence walks through our doors it wins every time.
The rebels - mostly remnants of the army of the dictator overthrown two months ago - are not giving up. Their forces are concentrated in the north of the country, near the border with Russia, and here in the capital. These are well-trained soldiers, so the country faces civil war. Moldavia. It used to be part of Russia, then declared independence, but there has been fighting inside the country ever since.
Ladies, please step away from the bus. - I almost forgot. Uh, here. - Should I get the tire iron? You keep it. It's mine.
Our Future. The best and most talented version of who we are and what we stand for. Intelligence reports the Others are preparing for a decisive attack. The Fifth Wave. What form it will take, we don't know.
I saved you. I was wrong. They're wrong. Love is not a trick. It's real.
- Yeah. You're in good hands. Okay? - Yeah. Trust me. Keep your hands off your head because it can still bite.
Father... - I noticed the tower. It's impressive. - I built it for you. - If it were any taller, it would get in my way.
I used to think this was the beginning of your story. Strange thing about memory. It doesn't work the way I thought it would.
We'll go back there immediately and clear that up. It's much more complicated than that. What's complicated? Colonel, you have a call from the Secretary of Defense. Don't release that information until we know what it means.
They haven't shown any aggression. Maybe they have that aggression. That's not the question. Then what is the question? How do we get back to that room if it's at 800 meters?
She needs to come to her senses. I have to log everything. I have to report it immediately. What if that dinghy is from a ship? It's a dinghy, it's not from a ship.
So brave! I knew she'd help. And where is this chronosphere? In the hands of time. She is his.
Rosa wants to keep you. She loves you. Like I don't know my wife loves me. Cory, go find the other saw. Where is it?
I've learned a lot about life from watching you. I've learned to recognize falseness. To distinguish it from the real thing. You taught me a lot. You showed me how not to step on the same rake, how to accept life as it is, to move forward in spite of everything.
Throw it with your hand, you lazy freak! I wouldn't bring it. I'm old-fashioned. Thank you, Duke. I don't like that phrase because it insults our kind, but you're a bad dog!
We've learned everything, thank you, you have no bones! You've told us everything so well. What? Looking for the serum? We have it.
What do you want with this girl and her family? Says he won't tell if you. They're still looking at me. How strange! I wonder why not. Before she showed no sign of timidity.
Can you give me a ride? I don't live far from here. I'm scared alone in the dark. I don't have a car. It doesn't run.
Mom. How does this story begin? It begins like so many stories
Conor, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah? There's plenty of time. About the destruction, that was surprisingly pathetic. Now, I've come to tell you a second story. Is it as bad as the last one?
There's plenty of time. About the destruction, it was surprisingly pathetic. Now, I've come to tell you a second story. Is it as bad as the last one? It ends with a proper destruction, if that's what you mean.
And she still is. And we were in love. Actually, I'm still in love with her. But you see. love alone is not enough. It doesn't carry you.
The universe, the vast expanse of space and matter. It encompasses everything we see and know.
The universe, the vast expanse of space and matter. It encompasses everything we see and know. Since the beginning of time, we have wondered how it came into being.
She's jaundiced, but I think she's gonna be okay. Yeah, it will be. I think I'm gonna name you, uh. Bronwyn. Buddy? Please return to planet Earth. While it still exists.
She learned French by learning this lullaby. Did you know that this song-- There's an echo box in here. Someone's scanning the data traffic. Track where it's transmitting to.
You were reckless. You wrecked a motorcycle you stole. I didn't steal it. I borrowed it. It's faster and obviously insured.
Career? Hence all the family wealth. Stone used to be very valuable. Was? With her consent, it was sunk at the outbreak of war.
Down with Vortigern! Looks like you found a way to wield the sword. I didn't wield it. Come on. He was controlling me.
I won't remind you what happens if he doesn't show up. I'll start with the boy. Take the girl and go. This poison will reveal what is hidden from you. It will reveal what you don't want to see.
I think I hired her...when she was 17. maybe even 16. Let's decide for ourselves what's right. - How do you see the world? - It's ours.
We have to destroy the stone. What? No stone, no ritual, no Seth. - No curse? - Yes. I know where it is.
I apologize to you and Jason Blood, but your fates are now intertwined. And the demon Etrigan will forever be imprisoned in man. And that was the beginning of my sentence to live with Etrigan forever. I didn't think you'd be so willing to give it to me, and though this stone is weak without its other half, it is far from useless.
And the demon Etrigan would be forever imprisoned in man. And that was the beginning of my sentence to live with Etrigan forever. I didn't think you would give it to me so willingly, and though this stone is weak without its other half, it is far from useless. But it is safe here.
- What's going on? - If this were a computer, I'd say it's frozen. Thank you. Felix Faust must have shielded himself from the location spell. There is another way. But it requires contact with someone I'm not on friendly terms with.
You know, someday I'm gonna have to walk home alone. I'm 14 years old. Not on my watch, honey. This neighborhood isn't what it was 40 years ago. That's right. It's safer and prettier.
I'm not going back to your table. And no coins. I'm not a laundromat. I'm in. I want to rob this bank. It's as good as any other.
I'm in. I want to rob this bank. It's as good as any other. So, where do we start? We get in touch with this guy my ex-brother-in-law's in business with. Why should he help us?
Curriculum that develops creative thinking in children. To give them the belief that.... Yes, they can. There was a time when this port handled thousands of ships from all over the world. Now it can rise again.
The east wing. Or, as I prefer to say, the only wing. Watch your step! Welcome to your new home. It's modest but cozy.
I have a cable. I was so lost, I thought I'd never see you again. Attach it to it. This cable is very thin. Do you think it'll hold?
I'm not gonna let you die. Come on, we can do this. Come on. Use the torch, Kate. It'll help scare off the sharks.
All right. I've got two more. I dropped it. Here, take the flashlight. Where is it?
Don't! Don't do it! Stop! Where's the rock? Where is it?
Uh, welcome. I'm Landsat field research manager Victor Nieves. My colleague Steve Woodward, he's taming the data. We're sailing to a place that all merchant ships have avoided for centuries. As the satellite images show, the island is surrounded by a zone of constant storms, which is why it has gone unnoticed.
Everybody chill out! What? I didn't believe it when they said you were coming. I stayed up all night thinking about how Ganpei and I had dreamed of this moment. And now it has come.
Please say hello to my old friends. Hello? I can hear you. Help me, please. I'm in an airplane, and it's about to crash.
Look what you've done to yourself. All those pathetic complicated emotions. I lost count. Emotional context, Sherlock. It's constantly destroying you.
What? I'll find you. I'm looking for you. Hurry, please, because I don't have long. He's leaning in.
But keep the eye. What for? He'll wake up tomorrow and he won't know where his eye is! It's a table. I told you it's like this.
She and her friends from New York use our spa. Oh, good. (chuckles) How did a skunk get into her room? What? A skunk-- how did it get into her room?
Maybe he'll like it. Damn good coffee, Dougie? - Damn good coffee. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's great.
- Sand Buggy! - No! And that's Beth's, uh. shark repellent? You can touch that. It's useless.
Wow! Here you go, Grandpa. Hey, Batman! Get off my padre! Well, he came in handy.
У... you didn't have one. They put you in the copy room. My desk? It was a folding table. С... with a file under one leg, because the floor, it was, uh.
It's like the first time. Oh, my God! How much can I order? And it's not opiate-based? Every test I've run proves it's artificial.
Picture day. He has cancer. I don't understand. He got it from the Rand chemical plant we live near. It's spreading poison through the air, the ground, all around us.
- That's crazy. - No, it's not. People are dying from it. If synthetic heroin hits the streets, it will affect your students. It'll be on their streets, and everything you've done for them won't matter.
I am Madame Gao. Do you remember the purple tree in the center of K'un-L'un Square? You've been to K'un-L'un. Its shadow falls for miles around. And when it blooms, it smells like cane sugar.
Well, it was the apology that got you into this, which is why it's officially a statement. It's the first step in ACR's plan to save the company's image. But... what about the plant? What about it? It could be a cause of disease.
Oh, and the assistants need to get their dental insurance back, so that should be taken care of too. [Laughs] Damn. Unbelievable. Just unbelievable. Yeah, that image, the snake, you know what that means?
Just stay away from me and Joy. I'm sorry. You're like a cancerous tumor, Danny. I'm going to China. That factory, it's in Anzhou.
At first I thought it was a mistake. I wasn't supposed to be Iron Fist. I was looking for a sign. Then I saw this hawk. And I watched it fly farther and farther down the mountainside, and then I realized.
That's when I saw this hawk. And I watched it fly farther and farther down the mountainside, and then I realized. The way to K'un-L'un is open. I could leave. I looked for a sign... and instead it showed me the way.
I don't like you being here. At all. It's late. So there's an elevator. It goes downstairs.
You're not getting in my head again. Now tell me, what are you gonna do about New York? It's time for it to fall. Elevator. He's coming down.
I was taught on Kun-Lun that there is a lesson in every misfortune. And even when you're in pain, there's a way to rise up and find clarity. Is anything becoming clearer? New York. It's becoming home.
I've planned a sexy arc for four episodes. Now that everyone knows about the cameras, it's more like a reality show and I don't like it at all when people know about the filming. What about the show? We wanted to make my mom famous. It's not funny anymore.
Charlie, this is not what I wanted for Fighting Milk. That's right! We're not diarrhea guys. We never wanted to be. It's not for women!
Stop it! - The deal was one trickle, then my line. I specifically stated in the contract that only one trickle was required. And some kind of wrong collar! He's pissing me off.
- A two-dollar instant lottery ticket. - Yeah. You hired an umpire to determine the owner of a two-dollar ticket? - Now you get it. - Now he gets it. Each of us claims ownership of this ticket, and you tell me who it belongs to.
Get a grip. I decided to show and tell you about the most amazing cat of all time. Not only is his name Fred, but, uh. He only has one eye. You can count it, but I guarantee it's one.
Now can I say what I want to say? Okay. Before it was broken, Justin's zoo was the best creative project ever. Way better than the others. It was awesome.
Ares poisoned the human heart with envy and distrust. He turned them against each other. and war spread across the land. And then the gods created us Amazons... to heal the hearts of men with love and bring peace back to the planet. And for a short time, there was peace. But it didn't last.
What are we gonna do? Not much we can do if that's who I think it is. But we can stop that plane. If we could get a radio, we could call in the air force to shoot it down. No, if it goes down, it'll wipe out everyone in a 50-square-mile radius.
We're gonna have to put him away! Bad news, there's a timer inside. If we land him here, it'll be the same thing. Is the gas flammable, chief? Yeah, if you say it's hydrogen-based.
Where did you get this? I found a skeleton. There's a whole skeleton? How much is it worth? It's priceless.
Wait a minute. Simple solutions might just do the trick. If the Eye of God is picking up false coordinates, they're using a data stream relay. Watch what happens. So it's equipped with a downward randomizer.
No well-bred woman would mess with him. And you have no need to be wary of me. We have the same father. You're like an unopened chest in every way. When I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside.
You would risk your son's life? Zilpha. What did you do? I killed him. James, this gunpowder is not ready for transportation because it's unstable.
Oh, my God, Russ! You put a gun in this car? You idiot! What were you thinking? It was in the box on the seat.
It was in the box on the seat. I didn't know there was a gun in there! He could have shot himself! He could have shot us all! It was under my feet!
That's enough. Okay, here. You know what else I know? You don't like peas. They're awful, aren't they?
We're the fucking U.S. Army. We practically invented everything! And now some motherfucker in Brussels is telling us we can't fly our plane because of a volcano in Greenland. So what do we do? Stay in Paris until it "stops erupting"?
- You've been looking at that "nothing" for a long time. - Okay, I stand corrected. I'm looking at this vastness. The ocean, so mighty and vast. It's full of life and mystery.
I hope he's not in there. Let's split up. Look. The passage isn't above us. It's underneath us.
It was a bad idea. It wasn't a bad idea. It was a terrible idea. I told you where the transformer is. I told you how it works.
Your father is a ruthless con man who always has a monstrous plan to hurt someone. What happens when he gets out of bed? You have a plan? I have a plan. I just don't know how devious it is.
Feel your muscles relaxing. Your arms relax. Your eyelids relax. Imagine you are sitting in front of the television. When you turn on the TV, it will play a memory.
I'd say high. About 100%. If there's a station here, then maybe there's a train. And if there is a train. It leads to the Wild Hunt.
Welcome to the Festival of the Beast. Where masks symbolize an unknown horror. And we commemorate the day I banished that horror from our land. But when the two moons align, the Eternal Beast will return, and it will be worse than ever. He will destroy everything in his path.
Tell me, what kind of knowledge is that? Anna? We know that this Beast will come from the sky. Where not every giant can reach. It will have a heart, it will be able to think and feel, and so it can be killed. Don't you agree?
Worship is a lucrative business. The one with the most followers wins. You want to play? Life is long when you have regrets. A moment can last forever when you know how it must end.
- They don't want us to infect anyone. - Why is it on TV? - It's a cover-up. That's why they invented the fire! They brought it to Spain and it spread.
- Huh? I don't have it. - Speak up, I can't hear you. - I don't have it. Where is it?
We've been doing disgusting things like shopping together. I'm sorry! Comparison shopping. That top looks good on you. It's too revealing.
What is it? Hot sauce, horseradish, cabbage, raw egg, and about six other hangover-fighting ingredients. No, don't smell it. Just drink it. Look, I talked to my mom about house arrest and what it entails. She's agreed not to punish you, but on one condition:
Ex nihilo nihil fit. "Out of nothing comes nothing." I just don't like it when people read my...personal stuff. Every poem you write should be about the personal. It should be frightening and terribly embarrassing.
What? From this notebook? - Don't even touch me. - Get out of my house. - It's not your house. - You think it is?
This steak is awesome. - Dad cooked it? - Mom did. Dad does the grilling. - It's damn good.
That shrink is a real pussy talker. Are we going home? Daughter, can I have a syringe now? Oh, God, yes! Daddy, it's in my purse.
Answer me, asshole. You want a tambourine, asshole? See you later, camel driver! Here's the key to the warehouse. Let me know when it's empty.
This bear was probably infected with something. It's hemorrhaging from a gunshot to the head. It's possible. This bear wasn't hungry. He wasn't even fucking hungry.
- Just gardening. To make it grow and grow. - So, what have you been doing cooped up in there all day? Working on your secret project? - Yeah. It's about to come out.
- Thank you! Remember, you can't sing this song. - I got it. - You can play it, but you can't sing it. - Why can't I go to the musical? - It's not for kids.
- The chef... not bad! - And the chef is even better! Madeleine, more bread? - Yes, please. It's so good.
We have to do something. - But that's not what we're doing, daughter! - What about your musical? - What about my musical? - You said it helped you find your purpose in life, and I understand that.
You know, with peanut butter. Man, they loved that stuff. He was the only one who touched it, the only one who took a bite. His saliva. So when you check it out, you know it's not contaminated.
Turns out it was a guy from Nigeria, he just wanted money. But, uh. I live in a small town. Then you should be on Facebook. Because it's like a small town.
- I'm serious. You locked me in a safe. The office safe? How could you forget that? It was open, you talked me into it, and then you slammed the door shut.
How much for the gun? - What? I want to buy your gun. How much? It's not for sale.
Yes? You fucked up coming here. Fuck you all. I saw your drawing. It's so good.
Anytime. Carrie. Hi. How was your day? Well, it started with someone throwing a coffee mug at me.
Was she in New York? I don't know that either. Can you look in her file? Well, not without attracting attention, sir. It's top secret.
Can I borrow a pencil if you're done? Uh-huh. Does everyone in Northern Virginia have a security clearance? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It comes with a Starbucks card.
I saw them. The banker he's talking about is a Mossad agent. It's all a game. The only game was the treaty itself. It just couldn't be enforced.
Evidence. A real van is sitting in their garage over there. - "A real van?" - It's been swapped out, for another one. - And it's here in the garage? !
Administer the meds. - In the process. When people told me catering was a shitty job, they weren't kidding. Oxygen. Come on, where is it?
Ќo didn't send it because your blue federal access petition was denied 'orosho. Well, now I can send you the clearance ј can't you just hand it to me? "I have a flight to Milwaukee in an hour and a half. You see, it's at the post office.
One of them will grow up and cure the cancer, but only if the other one dies now. You don't have to kill the child yourself, you just have to nod for it to happen. Will you nod? If I nod, how will the baby be killed? Will it die in agony or will it die quickly and painlessly?
I killed her hamster. What? - Yes. When you left for the conference and didn't feed him. I came back an hour before you, and he was dead.
- Yes. When you left for the conference and didn't feed him. I got back an hour before you, and he was dead. I went to the neighbor's trash can and dumped him there. Told you he'd escaped.
Don't move, I said! Oh, my God. You look just like him. The president's in the briefing room. He's on lockdown, but the code is 6969.
What? No. No, it's not me. - Yes, it is. It was in the typewriter at the beach house.
So answer right now what you intend to do. - How? How do we do it? - One of you must stay here as a guarantor of the treaty. You'll send someone to the stash, they'll come back and hand the chest to me.
"To invite people to dine with us is to be responsible for their welfare while they are under your roof." But he was an 18th century philosopher and a foodie.... and these were three children with very little experience in cooking. Despite this, the Baudelaire orphans set to work. This spaghetti maker looks like it's from Thomas Jefferson's time. Does it work?
- And Charles Wayne? - Charles Wayne was my closest friend. - Tell me all about him. - I never knew a braver man. No, he had fear, but he didn't give in to it.
This one. This one's not bad. - How many pages? - Nine. But it's good.
I think I caught an empathic STD. Let them rejoice. Hey, Mr. Gorilla, where's the ball? Where'd the ball go? Oh, it's in your goal.
The house is suspended. The House will be suspended. Madam Speaker, I still have Paul, and I find it hard to believe the President wouldn't have an Opinion on the issue at hand. If the good gentleman from Florida will give some of his time, I assure him he will satisfy his question.
Katie, no. If they come, you tell them everything about where to find me, okay? Vince is a dangerous man, but he's not crazy. As long as you stay out of his way, he has no reason to hurt you and your family. I hope you open that safe and I get my 10 grand, even if it is as impregnable as Al Capone's bunker.
If they come, you tell them everything about where to find me, okay? Vince is a dangerous man, but he's not crazy. As long as you stay out of his way, he has no reason to hurt you and your family. I hope you open that safe and I get my 10 grand, even if it's as impregnable as Al Capone's bunker. And if it's empty, where am I gonna get $10,000?
It's related to your legal work. How fast can you get to Bridgeport? This time of day, an hour and a half. Maybe less if you push it. Look, I'm gonna make a killing. But at 4:30 or 5:00, it's gonna turn into a pumpkin.
Oh, God, no. This has to be a mistake. Are you sure it's him? We found this in the dead man's pocket. It was Richard's.
The best moments of the women's tournament in color. Just like live. Maybe, but this is a police station, not a TV store. Fell out of the truck, sir. We wanted to make sure it was working.
I'm from the Lowlands myself. A hick and a simpleton to the core. In all seriousness, come and visit. I've got a pretty decent cellar. I'm sure it's better than mine anyway.
He was only Edison at home. This Aston or Ashford, what do we know about him? Perhaps Miss Palfrey was closer to the doctor than his wife wanted. It came to divorce. My source says he was some kind of local celebrity.
Our working theory is that this hibernation may be a defense mechanism. Everyone is on edge, and Hugh certainly blames himself for it, but honestly, it's a relief to me. Calvin has been growing up very fast, and now I've had time to reinforce the precautions with the team. The box needs to be hermetically sealed, as does the lab, regardless of the risk to Calvin. He's just floating.
The spacesuit's getting hot. Like Siberia in the summer. I'm at the transmitter. Beginning localized diagnostics. It's overheating.
Space suit cooler. Commander? Calvin just showed up. He grabbed my spacesuit. It got bigger.
How? Mutate? Take over the world, kill a bunch of students 39 times? You see, your feelings, that hunted look doesn't come out of nowhere. Where does it come from?
Why don't we go get something to eat? Now we're getting somewhere. Look, a thief! I'm a good detective! Dial your number, and if he calls, he'll never get away.
I can't. I have to prepare the words of my vows. Spending time together is very important. Sister Ursula said I should spend more time studying. The problem with TV is that it completely kills the conversation in the room.
The problem with the TV is that it absolutely kills the conversation in the room. Without that bulky device distracting us, we can have more fun with crafts. And in each other's company. Sister Ursula, may I ask where the television has gone? Suffice it to say, it is now where it brings joy.
It was in one of the urns, sir. Thank you, JP. Florence, do you have the number? Who did the phone belong to? It belonged to you.
Then you carried the body on a stretcher to the volcano and left it where you found it that morning. And then you just had to be patient and wait at the observation point, because the last part of your plan required the arrival of Mayor Richards, who could confirm that you were all at the observation point that morning. And when we checked the log book, it turned out that no one had come or gone from the building between Steven's departure and the mayor's arrival because Victoria had left the door open, allowing you to return. A careful and very resourceful plan. And it almost worked.
- probably for, uh. - Who tried to kill you? It started at the airport. Я... It was a red sedan. He started following me.
- No. Sell. A visit for your passport. An American passport is worth its weight in gold here. With a few changes, it could be a ticket to freedom.
Look, I'm the last one to agree with Mona. - Don't start. - She's right. If this client likes your design. No, it's not mine.
- His company. I underestimated him. He's as cunning as I am. I have something to show you, but promise you won't tell anyone. Ali decides if we keep the baby and we tell everyone it's not Dunhill's, it's mine.
Hell doesn't come when you die. It comes when they take away everything you love.
Hey, gotcha! There's always a smart guy. Every time. You know, I don't care who you are, where you come from or what you've done. If your path led you here, this is where it ends.
Hey, M.K., don't get caught. Hello? Anybody here? That's my friend's compass. What's he doing here?
Don't think I'll forget what happened today. And you'll pay. You didn't mention my garden. The garden is part of your lot, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn. It comes with the house, mom.
- Oh, that's great. Can I, uh. - We're almost done. I'll be there in a minute. And sign my lily pond. It's in my garden. Lily pond.
Maybe I can find another way. There is something you can do. Give me a piece of gum. A piece of gum will get us out of jail? It'll start the process.
Okay, I think there's a possibility that Ennalise did it. - Why? - Her cell phone. The one that Oliver cleaned. Because it contains information about all the bad things we've done.
Where have you been? - Running. - 2 hours? You'll feel better when I have abs. You left your phone, it kept ringing.
And you know what? I don't think he's going to. I don't think Howard is going to let him anywhere near Mesa Verde with that tape. Howard knows it will make HHM look bad. If Chuck has a plan for this tape, I don't know what it is.
Not yet, but he will. There's someone I know who can convince him. Clary? I made you a black coffee with lots of sugar. It's not as good as the Jade Wolf, but still.
Provide facilities for a maritime mission. Find a ship on your own. Alec, the ship is under glamor. The locators won't show it. Well, it won't hide from us if we run right into it.
I promise. You look like you need a drink. And get a towel. Just, uh. just your phone. I'd ask what happened to yours, but I can only assume it got wet.
A demon must be fueled by negative emotions. Anger, hatred, rage. Leads the host to create this creepy itch. So we'll keep scanning for venom and heat signatures. Try to find the host before it strikes again.
Are you sure? She's about this tall, pigtails, always, uh. wears a scarf. Where'd you get that scarf? I didn't. I found it, it's mine.
Don't worry. She's with Magnus. Luke and I will be right there. Take the energy core and disable it. Then no matter who touches the sword, it won't activate.
You're stuck here, Mick. That's why I'm here. To guide you. The amulet. Why is it so important?
- Lies, Professor! This virus is tearing Gotham apart. Then there's nothing in this city more valuable than your antidote. We could demand half of Gotham and the city council would hand it to us on a silver platter. So I'm gonna ask you one last time, where is it?
If the virus has allowed Gotham to show its worst side. then the antidote should be a reminder that there is always hope. A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are. I don't know if Gotham deserves to be saved, but I do know one thing: If anyone can save it, it's you. And in return, I believe he will save you.
So I got it all back. Because I released Black Siren, one of those guards could have died. We almost caught Prometheus. Your plan worked. He was there. No. If it had worked, you would have cuffed him by now.
The prosecutor came to me and, uh. Are you talking about Adrian Chase? That's right. He ordered me to amend the report to say that the Star-Spangled Killer was guilty. That report, and you agreed and signed it, even though you knew it was false. And then you turned it over to the police.
If you don't like it, shoot me. As you wish. This laptop contains 80 million rubles in transfers from Kovar's accounts to accounts Gregor controls. Yes, we know that, to distribute to the Bratva captains. It also contains 40 million rubles in transfers from Kovar that Gregor didn't tell us about.
I came for you. I didn't expect this. It's-- It's not human. Anatoli, when I put this hood on, I told you it helped me control the darkness inside me.
And it worked, by the way. I know what Kovar wants to do. But at what cost? You're a fool if you think a piece of cloth can separate man from monster. Dividing yourself into two people will only make the monster stronger until it's stronger than you.
I don't think so. Check the elevator. Yeah, guys. Curtis is right. According to the elevator's activity logs, it went up, oh, my God, 0.9 seconds. and then just fell in freefall 40 stories.
What do you mean, traumatized? Я... I was heating soup for her. That's all I could do for her. And it was on the stove, and I passed out, drunk. Poor Zoe, trying to grab it, pulled it down, and it burned her hands, really badly...
- How's Chase gonna spread it? It's in the form of an aerosol, so whatever he wants. We need to find out where Chase keeps it and stop him before he sprays it. Cyclotrizan disintegrates very quickly. Which means it leaves a traceable trail.
Looks like Green Arrow is a hero again, whoever he is. Well, the mayor's doing pretty good, too. "Sentinel" reports your approval rating is back up to 70%. What? Has it ever been that high?
The asteroid moves using its own thrust. That's impossible, but that's how it works. Where is it going? We don't know. But it's orbiting the sun.
Do we know why? No. The Mormon generation ship flew to Eros before it started? Fred Johnson said it was an engine check. But given the speed and trajectory of the Novu, it was headed for a collision with Eros.
Well, it looks like some laws of physics have been broken. Maybe God was up to a magic trick. Eros weighs about seven trillion tons? Its temperature has increased by two degrees. Yeah, it's producing, uh.
You named him that yourself. Let me think! Do we see that hovercraft? In the shadow of Eros, no. It's invisible to radar, too.
All right, cowboys and cowgirls. I'm serving up the liquor. Message from the Rocinante. Delay 13 minutes. The ship is accelerating at 15 G's to equalize speed with the target. It will automatically lock missiles onto Eros.
No, me first. Please. Okay. And don't interrupt. I've rehearsed this moment for years, but, uh. now that it's here. I'm confused.
I mean, we'll use my face and my dick. - Okay, and we'll just blur the rest of it. Yeah. And I want to camouflage it, just if we can clip it or blur it or whatever. But the main thing is that we're all going to be naked and my dick, I don't know if it's appropriate enough.
- Lies, Professor! This virus is tearing Gotham apart. Then there's nothing in this city more valuable than your antidote. We could demand half of Gotham and the city council would hand it to us on a silver platter. So I'm gonna ask you one last time, where is it?

And I'm going to start now. So the next time you're alone, you win. Deal? Deal. HR and I just figured out a way to track down Yorkin, and he's, uh. Crazy.
What is it? It's an emergency alert from Joe. He must be on that train. The train won't stop. It won't stop in time.
- What's going on? We're gonna move the train. How do we do that? I'll vibrate it. I'll vibrate it fast enough to get it through the wreckage.
You said you created Savitar? - How? - Look. Four years from now, the future Flash will create a, uh. a temporary doppelganger to fight Savitar. But Savitar will keep this doppelganger alive so he can become Savitar.
It's a vicious circle. There's no beginning, no end. It's an endless vicious circle. Classic chicken and egg story, right? The time doppelganger, he's, uh. he's like a copy of you, right?
- Why? What's the problem? - Uh, okay. It's the gas pedal. It's sucking in a lot of air watts,

It's the Founder's Parade. They bring the bell every year. This is an exact replica. The real one disappeared from the so-called Vickery Bridge in 1992. Anyway, I've spent the last three weeks sending people down this river to look for this bell, and they never found anything.... but I know it exists because it can't be destroyed.
We just need to make more of an effort. - Thank you. - Do you understand me? - I also have a gift for my youngest son. That podcast you started. It touched me.
I was doing some work and I came across this pile. Did you touch it? When I found it, yeah. I thought some client had lost it. It doesn't make any sense that it would be here.
I need to know how to shoot it. Come on. Or you could get eaten by a bear. Is it loaded? It's loaded.
It's enough if her legal guardian gives permission. And in addition to being her husband, I'm also her legal guardian. But this piece of paper is not an official document. It's, uh. it's just a prop. If you look closely, I think you'll see that it's figuratively real.
Damn it! The Baudelaires! The Baudelaires! I brought you a present. It's very spicy.
N-N-No. No, it's, uh. still stolen. My phone. You know, my phone shows me where it is.
- Ma'am. - I see him. I see him. I can give you the address. It's on my fucking phone.
- I see him. I see him. I can give you the address. It's on my fucking phone. - It's on my fucking phone!
What, what? I don't know what the fuck you're showing me. All right. We don't want any trouble. My computer was stolen, and the app shows it's here.
- When is the trial? - It starts tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. - And how long will it last?
- Tomorrow already? - Yeah. How long will it last? - A couple weeks. And when it's over, what happens then?
See what's wrong? I should have checked with Dr. Hamza. Leo, you have neurocysticercosis. A parasitic worm has invaded your brain. It's relatively safe while he's alive, but if he dies, it's serious, so we have to act fast.
But she confuses the past with the present. That's how this disease works. It comes in unpredictable waves. Sometimes the brain is fine. Sometimes it struggles.
No way. Not until I get my daughter back. Even then, I-- The only way to get my daughter back is to give them the laptop intact. Where is it, by the way?
Our story is about a town. A small town. And the people who live there. From the outside, it looks just like many other small towns in the world.
You must. I'm the senior captain of the River Foxes. Is cheerleading still in style? Is being a gay best friend still in vogue? Some people say it's retro, I say it's timeless and iconic.
May I sit down, Jadhead? If you like. - What are you working on? - A novel. It's about that summer and Jason Blossom.
- No, no. I'll do it myself. Follow me.... Jughead. Another fun fact about fear. Sometimes it grows with you.
Congratulations, Mr. Andrews. Looks like you won. I apologize. I'll say this about fear. It never goes away.
Staring out the dirty old window At the cars racing through the city below, I sit alone, wondering why. It's Friday night and everyone's going out. I feel the heat, but it's soothing.
Forget I said anything, okay? Okay. Bye. I changed my mind about Toledo. Can you just put me on the next bus out of town? I don't care where it goes.
This "Danny is a terrorist" thing was my plan B. Never would have used it if it wasn't for that lady in the niqab. You know what? The law should be above everything, like physics. It should be above the media and politicians.

It's traveling to another realm of reality. Each of our subjects described this place with the same words. They drew this. Concentric circles. Scientists and theologians have argued for centuries about what happens to the brain when it starts to work differently.

Isaac. I saw him. What, baby? I saw the most beautiful light. It was everywhere.
- Waldorf salad, please. Can I have a tomato tea sandwich? - Uh, sure. - Uh, thank you. What good is an outfit if it doesn't turn a man into a mental patient?
I need 60 hours a week from everyone, daily reports, lunch will be reduced to 30 minutes. In fact, whatever is going on in your life right now, I recommend canceling it. And then, without hesitation, cancel it again to make sure they understand that everything is... canceled, okay? You know, this conversation reminds me of the old days. It reminds me of New York and Harvard and Yale.

You're the one we're looking for. I got his results. The snowman's potassium levels are normal. Potassium is essential for communication between nerves and muscles. And if it's normal, there's a chance to restart the heart.

Anything? Charged with a sex crime. From what he says, it doesn't sound like he has an alibi. All right. Uh-huh. You've been sitting on that fence for over an hour and you can't remember where it is?
Midwife on the phone. Nurse Winifred, Mrs. Marsh is in labor. I can't deny that this situation worries me. And both parents are dwarfs, so there's a pretty good chance the baby will be the same. But it could still be healthy.
You can have him - as soon as he's born. We'll give him everything, Marnie. - It'll be the baby we never had. - It's gonna be a baby that's gonna be yours, Dot. It'll be yours.
Don't be sad, Auntie Wai. I'm not sad, I'm glad. Look how beautiful the garden is, Patrick. There's so much space. There's plenty of room for the children to run around. Yes, it's quite big.
Oh, Reggie. And we let go of their hands. but not their hearts. Out of the need to be needed, but not out of the need to love. We go to a French restaurant. And since it's French, they serve snails, and where there's snails, there's tongs, garlic oil and a bowl of finger rinse.
Or is the sun on my head? There's no sun in England in October. You see, you understand perfectly well. I'm beginning to worry if this Cuban crisis will ever end. - It seems endless.
Jennifer made her first recording on October 4. October 4th? Wait a minute. October 4th. October 4th. That's the day Cyrus Beene won the vice presidential debate. Admiral Ballard had no problem with free college when he attended it.
What's the cake for your birthday tomorrow? Mmm. What kind of cake? This year, I may not have a cake. But you need cake. It'll sweeten your life for the rest of the year.
Deacon. They say you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first fight? И? It was glorious.
My Sarah. Is that him? That's the virus that's got everyone on edge? Yes. It's getting worse and worse.
From what happened before, this time seems different. Someone new is behind all this. Is it a vaccine simulation? The infected are showing different signs this time. I'm trying to suppress the artificial virus because it seems to be the basis of the infection.
On their own, these viruses either have no power or risk activating on their own. But together, they become an effective, controllable bioweapon. Excellent, Professor. No wonder you survived Raccoon City. If the activator is airborne, it's hard to know where it's going and to whom.
I love your bracelet, Anita. Thanks, Maddie. It's secondhand. It's so old-fashioned. Actually, it's not--
But trust me when I say the turning point is near. This job is different from your usual "find and grab" tactics. Our target is a young man named Holden Matthews. A Google search will tell you he's been in a coma for 12 years. But it won't tell you how dangerous he is.
You're a wolf. None of us are... A wolf is a wolf. The wolf is you. It symbolizes your fears.
None of us... The wolf is the wolf. The wolf is you. It symbolizes your fears. He's knocking on your door, and it's like payback, Ramon.
The water in the sponge represents all the experiences you absorb from the real world. Your consciousness, pain, pleasure. Love. Things that the traditional laws of physics don't apply. And now your brain, it's transferred all that experience right here.
Well, try eating. You'll feel better. Hey, Luke, do you know anyone who might have been involved in that fire? A fire? Yeah, it happened right near campus.

It's yours now. Я... don't-- It's okay. He's yours. He means something to you.
I have no idea. I'm serious. It's for a school report. Google it on your phone. It's dead.
He has been very interested in juvenile detention issues since his time as governor. And we really appreciate him giving us his time. - Right this way. - Uh, okay. (clears throat) The president's schedule's jammed, but he won't be long.
- He said he was fine. Is that my robe? - No. Yeah. He says it feels like money.
I think I can track him in a couple seconds. - No, no, no! - What happened? The other end tripped an emergency switch in the chip's tracking code. It cut off my access.
I'm me. I'm not gonna risk this firm's reputation without hard evidence of innocence. You're you. You have your own office. And it's down the hall.
I've never seen so many Secret Service agents, not even when I was First Lady. You may not see them, but you'll always hear them. They're like mice in a wall. When you're president, that sound never stops. Later, it becomes the noise you look forward to hearing.
We formed a line. Excuse me! Sergeant! IDENTIFICATION... Then I saw the drone. It was watching us.
I'm not your spouse. What? I said, "scalpel." I had a bet with a mastodon. Said he was underclothed.
What did the scrap of bread say when he walked into the operating room? I'm just tired of saying things like, "You need to be more serious." Nothing. He was coma-tastic.
He's ready. I just gave Supergirl the remote. She's the only one who can turn it on. We need to call the DEO. Tell Supergirl it's ready if she needs it.
Can I come with you? Taking control of your life? I'm trying. That scent. You don't know how beautiful it is.
Yes, ma'am. I was just reminding Leonard of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Are you familiar with it? Hap's very familiar with weird Christian allegories, huh, Hap? He especially likes the story of Lot, where his wife turned into a pillar of salt before his eyes. I was referring, by the way, to the part where Lot brings angels into his house and sees that he is surrounded by homosexuals who want to know them.

But it was a taste, kind of a taste of normalcy. It's better when you forget there's a whole world out there. And then you might not feel so fucked up. I don't know. I've been in that world and it's not that good.
The occupation is sending more and more people to the factory. We are nothing more than slave labor for them, and they burn us like firewood. And it's not just a file. Broussard's team found a coded countdown hidden in the Rapa communications. It will end the very day this block is emptied.
"Quietly" refuses to release the docking clamps without Fred Johnson's personal permission. And he won't give it? All right, I'll get right on it. You know, I don't have to let you go. Considering how much time and money I've invested in this ship, it's probably more mine than yours.
- What is it, what? - I got it. I saw it. It was easy for your friend because of the eye. Because he gave her superpowers?
Can I go to the bathroom? - Excuse me? - I'm really freaking out. I have to go to the bathroom. It's downstairs, first right, second left, after the almond cookie machine.
That was Molly's bunk, wasn't it? The tenth? We came into the hospital with measles. When Molly got sick, I rang the bell. It rang and rang, but no one came.

Do you know them? I don't run a hotel. I inherited it from my grandfather. I don't know much about them other than they keep the hotel running. It's not what it used to be.
Yeah. Just sleep. Name, previous address, if available, eviction at 11:00. 305. There's an elevator, but it doesn't work.
Monroe, can you move? The camera fell off. There must be an entrance behind the dresser. Check it out. It's hollow.
Turpentine might work. It's natural, made from pine. But it's pretty toxic. How much would it take to make another batch? I'll just bring in the turpentine, that's all. It's not harmful to pregnant women?
And he'll kill me if I don't do something about it. So maybe it's best to stay away. Nick saw him, too. What if the skull comes after him, too? I thought he disappeared when he saw Nick.
So maybe it's best to stay away. Nick saw him, too. What if the skull comes after him, too? I thought he disappeared when he saw Nick. We don't know exactly why he disappeared.
In our case. it's a child bride. I don't like that combination. That's why she switched to Russian. The monster wants our daughter. He's not getting her.
Come on, sweetheart. This way. Nick and I met here to settle a disagreement about the key. Oh, that. We both decided that it shouldn't fall into your hands.
I showed this to Renard and Adalind. It looks like the Destroyer. And his staff is very similar. Except his staff is all cracked. Well, if it's as old as he is, it makes sense that there'd be a lot of cracks.
Is it wrong to look for love in marriage? When you married Francis, didn't you love him? I married the man I thought I loved. The illusion dissipated within a year. My marriage to Mr. Warleggan was not based on love, but it is more successful on the whole.
There's actually a mass murder here. I chose bubbly over ginger ale. That's not fair! What's wrong with ginger ale? It helps with blood loss, didn't you know that?
Two minutes into the show. So, uh, here it is. Did you hire this Saint? Genesis is too dangerous. When we realized he wouldn't come with us, we told him he had to be destroyed.
And then he threw up by the swing set. But I wasn't mad at him, you know? He always threw up and he always fell down. I wasn't mad because he was wearing a suit and tie. I don't know where he got it from.
- Very good. Good start to the day. You just need to show me where my desk is. Uh, sure. It's right in that office.
If her husband didn't answer the door himself, his phone could have been used by the killer. Is that possible, Mike? Did Mr. Bloom give up his phone? I don't know yet. I'm checking his signal now, looks like it's on its way from Catalina...Richard could have left it at Catalina, come back and shot him. Your ex hated your husband that much?
"let's stick it in the microwave" and I can't cook anything but scrambled eggs and toast and I need a toaster for that. So last night we gave up and went to a restaurant. What kind of restaurant? There's only one on the other side of the river.
He was trying to hide his height because he knew the bus camera would catch him. Everyone knows that, Mark. And you know what that says about your successful businessman, Richard Bloom? Of all the pay phones in the area, our picky Ricky chose this one because he's thought it through very carefully. This successful businessman doesn't rely on luck, and in my very humble opinion, I think this phone is his big mistake, because it shows us his character.
But we still don't have definitive proof that Paul Bloom is our shooter, even if he was at Chandler's house. Oh, there it is, Paul. Look familiar? Now let's see when you last used the OffKey. Then we'll take your phone to Chandler's house and see if it opens the lock.

The King does not love me for my ability to bear children. And certainly not for caring for them. You are free. Did you find the killer? Yes. Who is he?
Yeah, a little offshoot of 11. Lisa. Yes? Curry's cell phone trace was in some wilderness where he stopped for five hours and then the signal went dead.
What is that, a gun? Says he has no idea how the gun got there. All right. [Cell phone rings] What do we do? It's not that easy to get it out. It's already passed the sphincter.
One more time. Close your eyes, Ariel. Okay. Do you see your shield? Now describe it for me. It's gold.
So. Do you see your shield? Now describe it for me. It's golden. It surrounds me.
Do you see your shield? Now describe it for me. It's golden. It surrounds me. It protects me from the pain of others.
And then it was over. My wife was gone. When did Rachel die? Last year. Ovarian cancer. He took her so quickly.
No, not him. Why not? Because he shouldn't go. I'll go in his place. I thought this world meant nothing to you, that it wasn't real.
Why not? Because he shouldn't go. I'll go in his place. I thought this world meant nothing to you, that it wasn't real. - It's not real.
Jeffrey Mays hated our freedom and tried to turn our country into... Tarnishing the name of a good man. Isn't anyone sick of this propaganda crap? It's like I've been drinking poison. A little bit every day, and you don't even notice it's killing you.
- Darkhold technology. - Dar-who again? I've seen this mechanism before. It was designed to create elements out of thin air. It looks like it's creating something even more complex.
My plan is to rebuild the world you're used to..... where the Inhumans are hunted. And we would control the rest. And it won't hurt that the two of us are unstoppable. But your plan isn't perfect. It's too clean.
- I'm ready. Good for you, sweetie. I wish everyone was as good at packing as you are. Hey, Mac, I can't find my suitcase. It was here a minute ago.

There's a picture of me in there. What? -It's not normal. -I'm supposed to be a normal engineer. Open the safe. 11 million dollars won't fit in there. It's too small.
No, thank you. What do you mean? I have a paper due today. - On the Dietrich course? - Yeah. What's it about?
That's right! I remembered. Svetlana. This office doesn't save itself, you know? It's not self-packed because one of us has been working for the last three hours.
Did he? Yes. You see, before sacrificing himself for our sins, our lord gave mankind one last gift - he became a father. For generations, the Grail has protected the entire holy lineage, preparing for only one thing: the end of the world. Only God knows when exactly it will happen, and it is soon.
Also... There's something attached to his rib. Oh, my God! There's a wire. It goes under the skin.
William, if this device is a receiver, how could Gillis hear what we were saying? William, what are you doing? I'm looking for a microphone. There's got to be a microphone in here. Where does it go?
Now don't pay attention to what you hear. What don't you hear? You don't hear the music and the singing and the thousands of people in the streets celebrating St. Ursula's Day. The carnival runs right down this street. It is so loud that it is still ringing in my ears, yet there are no carnival sounds here. The grate was open, but no sound.
- They're all closed. I checked. What about the fire exit? Can you open it from the outside? No, it only opens one way.
My name is Violet Baudelaire, and this is my brother and sister..... Klaus and Sunny, of course. Come on in. - I think the doorbell's broken. - It's disconnected.
If you're implying what I think you're implying, don't you think it's too fast? Even by modern standards? No. I suppose after all we've been through, a kiss would seem rarified. It'll be old-fashioned.
That's the name of Dr. Midnight's killer. - I just don't get it. - Be more specific. The list of misunderstandings could be long. Okay, assuming the Legion took the Spear fragment from there, how did they know it was there?
Can't you see the connection? Poor thing. Anyway, your king is now doing whatever I want him to do, so unless you want him to flood the entire floor with your blood, I guess you'll give up the Spear fragment. My patience is running out. The fragment. Where is it?
- and her defense attorney. - Beer, Professor. Bring six cans. How far are we from the limiter? Looks like it's in the neighborhood.
Cadmus has them locked in cages that are later supposed to kill them. All Lillian has to do is push one button. I can't disable it myself. But there's a magnetic field disruptor in the weapons vault at the DEO. It'll open the cages.
Everything's under control. - Is that why you called me? - Actually, no. I called to get an update on the Daxamite ship. It appears to be in low orbit right now.
Nothing. Got a pen? What are you doing, Mick? I'm writing a screenplay. It's gonna be a bomb.

But we don't have complete information. Of course we do. And we can't rule out that it was closer to..... "Oooooh! It's stuck in the clarinet!
a man's tie is the window to his soul. We just ran a piece on it. Oh, yeah? So, well, what does my tie say about me? It says you're a dedicated civil servant with the bank account to prove it.
- Freeze! Hands in the air! Hands in the air! Step aside. - (Leanne) You stole our gun? - It was hanging from her belt.
Yeah, that's a great idea. And I'll tell everyone else. Because everyone will love that you're banging your coworker's girlfriend. - They'll trust you. - Helen, I didn't come here to fight with you. I came here because-- Yeah, to talk to you about the baby, and to tell you that if it's mine. and I figure there's a good chance of that, I want to be a part of his life.
I asked him to draw a small circle. Maybe at least in this case he'll make an effort. Maybe he'll attract attention with a simple circle. That's the impression I got from that circle, John. It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, determination, passion and honesty. And it reminded me of you.
- Why? What's in those capsules? - I made a mistake. I was very wrong. The settler ship isn't on its way, it's already here.
Yes. - Teaching. But what is ether? What is a substance with such marvelous properties? It turns all physics upside down, but it must exist, otherwise....
I've already tried it 20 times. It's not an anomaly. There must be a new element in the sample. Radioactive. It's hundreds, no. Thousands of times stronger than uranium.
How can she despise the woman who bore her only grandchild? Look at those cheeks. That little guy looks just like Grandpa. Hey, doll, have you seen a tie? I think it's hanging on the bathroom door, son.
Marie. Go see what we found. Don't peek. You thought it was 1,000 times stronger than uranium. This element is a million times stronger, and it's not even in its pure form.
Fat embolism from femoral fractures..... Tachycardia and ventilation problems. Thoughts? We need to deal with the fat now. It's in tiny little pieces.
Just lived with it. Being young, he was much wiser than me. I feel anger. All the time. It's always with me.
I tried to tell you that. You see that? He's got a gun. No. No, no, no. I swear I saw the gun. It was in his hand.
You could have killed me, you crazy bitch! I thought it was-- It's okay. It's okay. It looks like a gun, doesn't it?
It's time to work out. I think I already have. Not until it's done. If it comes out, who do you think the axe will fall on? Who does it always fall on?
Phil Simms. A CIA meeting just as Linda disappeared. Rachel's mystery friend. Yeah, I think we do. The CIA aspect, isn't that a little far-fetched?
Thanks, Dom. Oh, Jason! My dad told me he was here. He said he liked your house. Said he was crazy.
What are you doing here? - Will that do? This car will take you to Chicago. - Take my phone. And make sure it's on.
Stupid face. - (babino) Do you know what he was carrying? - (homeless man) Trash. - (babino) What makes you think he was carrying garbage? - (homeless man) He was carrying a garbage bag.
What else we got? - Yeah. I got something. St. Patrick gave me this phone. It's from Lobos' C.I,
You know, I kind of feel like I'm really in love. I need to get her hooked on my pheromones. We got a meth problem. My finger. It's--
I need to get her hooked on my pheromones. We got a meth problem. My finger. It--it's--it's hurting again.
What happened to you, Suzanne? - I need help! - Okay. We need to get his cells out and smooth them out, or else. But you can't touch the iron because it'll burn your fingers.
- Albert, watch out! Just, uh. Watch where you're going, please. What for? Why look? According to you, this car is a particle, but we didn't see it. And it wouldn't have hit us.
Hitler is insane. Imagine what he'd do with a weapon like that. He'd destroy London, Moscow. Years ago, Fritz Haber convinced me his poison gas would speed up the war. It only made it worse.
However, I want to keep up with the latest news. I guess I'm still living the dream of being a real physicist. Like you. What do you want to know about? I'm most interested in nuclear fission. The magazines say it's going to be a more powerful source of energy than oil.
That's just fucked up. Why the hell would she do that? To kill your friend. I told Moon to calm down, but she was like, "That kid is evil. He can hurt people."
- Yeah, that would be great. - As far as approval. - Yes. The legal committee asked me to send them everything you've written on abortion. Well, I can show them my own abortion if I've got one lying around.
What's this? What do you see? A new body. Another one? The drone. it's stuck.
What you're doing won't bring your family back. Go away. No need to die. There's an engineering bay right below us. If it blows, the ship's dead.
Lumenomancy. I'm a moron. You are. Shut up, I-- I remember. Anyway, the scope, it's in McClane's office.
Excuse me? I added my sacred excrement to the source of all magic. It stinks. I hope you weren't planning on drinking from it. It's hardly drinkable.
Hi. How'd you get into the office? I'm pretty good at this kind of thing. Like disability benefits? It's a little cramped for the two of you, this office.
No, not all of it. All you did was ruin a perfectly good camping van. - No, I didn't! - And your sweater. That's genius! It's all armored.
Yeah, coming down. Roger that, coming down. Oh, my God. I've loaded a high-explosive round. It's also a tracer, and we'll see it fly and converge on the target.
Many months later, I was ready to make a third attempt. An impenetrable fortress. Yes. It's a divine tow truck. I based it on the armored transporter from Aliens. Counting on the fact that if it could protect Sigourney Weaver from those mechanical jaws with teeth, it could protect me from Jeremy Clarkson and James May.
Unfortunately, Jeremy's high-speed U-turn only made matters worse. Go! Go! Slow down! It's falling apart!
You can use wool yarn. And it's, uh. So beautiful, so cozy. How can I explain it? This sweater here would be perfect. - It's homey. - It's nylon.
Its engine mixes fuel with air and then, without any trickery, explodes! Of course, this means that the "GSF" model harms animals, and that is definitely bad. But it does have some positive aspects - listen to the sound it makes! At medium speed, the engine sounds dreary, like the howl of a lonely dog. But if you turn up the revs, it sounds the way an atmospheric five-liter V8 should sound.
Time. Very funny. It wasn't a joke. I've been studying the instantaneous drive for two days now. But I'm no closer to figuring it out. I don't know why it turned on or how to fix it.
That's great. Just what we need. Let's get in there, take it and get out. The signal's too weak to find the engine from orbit. But I've pinpointed it to a small town called Fort Falls, Wisconsin. Uh, hold on.
Oh, that's great. Except, uh. there's a little problem. You brought all this junk with you, and there's no room for a tiny file? I didn't realize it was so important.
Remember how I said that zero is a space bubble, not much bigger than the station? Yes. Well, I know that because I've sent radar beams outward to determine the outer limits of the bubble. And? So it appears to be shrinking now.
And the fact that it seems to be shrinking now. It's collapsing inward. Oh, my God! When we got here, it was over three kilometers in diameter. Now it's less than 2.5. How long before it reaches the outer edges of the station?
That's right. With a tactical nuclear warhead. Looks like it's aimed at the platform. What about the shuttle? It never left.
I thought you all thought it was beautiful. It is. So does a volcanic eruption or a tsunami. There are few things more beautiful than destruction, but that doesn't mean I like it. This fog, are you hoping it'll go away again?
Just like a volcanic eruption or a tsunami. There are few things more beautiful than destruction, but that doesn't mean I like it. This fog, are you hoping it'll go away again? Yes, of course. And it will disappear... once it gets what it came for.
There are few things more beautiful than destruction, but that doesn't mean I like it. This fog, are you hoping it'll go away again? Yes, of course. And it will... as soon as it gets what it came for. What do you think he came for?
A forester I knew many years ago told me about a mother bear who gave birth to three cubs. The foresters monitored the births to make sure they were not threatened by outsiders, but they were shocked when the mother killed the first two cubs herself. They intervened and took the last cub, a boy. Why did she do this? While they were caring for the cub, they learned that he was suffering from a fever and infection.

God loves a trinity. I'm next in line. Larry. When you say that, people who don't understand you think you're not really upset about what happened. No, I'm ruined! This key is German, it's irreplaceable!
Before the regent touched the sword, I slit his throat. Four of his bodyguards burst into the room, and I killed them all. From that day on, fear comes to me before every fight, but I meet it as a friend. It makes you faster, stronger, smarter.
Estrella, do you know what this is? Yes. I told you. We're finding it all over the area. A piece of meteorite, and it lets you walk around in broad daylight.
So how are you gonna get us to Texas on your 43 titty dollars? It's possible there's a stash of cash up your ass. Sweaty, but cash. So you're just gonna close this place up yourself? I got a boat to catch before it leaves for New Orleans.
Taylor Mason, maybe. Some kind of protégé of his. A confidant. Whatever Axe himself is up to, Taylor's always around. I think it's time, long overdue, to change your philanthropic direction and set up a permanent foundation. If it's properly managed, it'll give you a good reputation, like Carnegie, Vanderbilt, make you look good for a long time.
Hey, what do you think of my tie? I designed it myself. It's called "yoloha." It's a combination of "yo" and "aloha." Well, Buzzy, I think it's cool.
And you were filming a story dressed as a homeless woman. Yes, you ate out of the trash. And I'll continue to do all of that in a series of special reports that will go out on our electronic platforms. - They're the future, right? - I've tried my best, but this world is just... It's full of snakes and traps and--
- It's not here. - What? My diary's gone. - Look harder! It should be there!
- Well, uh. - Maybe. I want to take a look at the menu. And I have to say, I'm not sure this crystal is appropriate. I think it's a little elitist.
Yeah. Yeah, mine or yeah, maybe? I don't know. That's the truth. But it could be yours.
I'd show you, but I can't get these pants off. Max, come on. You can't let one bad experience ruin your whole life. Otherwise, I'd never stand on our bath mat again. I don't know why it's always hot.
The last message from my son came to him from the mall. That's where we should go. Why? We must take a stand against those who disrupt the natural order of things. The fog will only leave here when we've redeemed ourselves. It will leave us alone when we live in harmony with each other again.
There are only two ways into town. the train and the main road. Tomek, do you have anything that can help us? Explosives on the tracks. The train will destroy itself. It'll collapse like a broken toy.
- See that window over there? Percy recorded that the killer probably came in through it. - (liv) Why didn't she hear him? - (babino) I don't know. The remote. I wonder what it controls.
Or underestimate mine. You haven't been elected president yet, sir. It won't matter if the party turns its back on you. When Bob Birch builds all your sheep, you'll be begging to be allowed back in. And two years from now, back in Phoenix, you'll look back on that moment over and over again, realizing that it was the beginning of the end.
Check in with your compartment. We'll do a roll call as soon as we can. Do you copy? Do you read me? We're in the rain, it's burning our skin.
Come home alive. I got it. Raven says black rain's coming. She's right. I used to love the rain, now it scares me.
- What color was the festival bracelet? - Blue, right? - Yeah, it was blue. That means she got it in advance. It's for VIPs.
They have a bunker? Their faith was built on surviving the end of the world. Bad news, Abby. Black rain is scarier than we thought. It burns your skin.
Of course you can. Look at it this way. You can get out of this interview by talking about the time a piece of cortex went in your mouth. - It wasn't in my mouth.
No. It was on the news. A therapy cat in a nursing home. Yeah, they say they have that gift. When someone's on death's doorstep, no doubt they'll curl up in a ball on them.
No, no, it's working. Keep going. No, Lyla. There's no blood flowing to the stomach. It's dead.
No problem. What the hell? Does it hurt? No. It's just broken.
What's the big deal about lithium? It's the main component of today's high-capacity batteries. For everything from smartphones to electric cars. Lithium powers things that power everything. It's fast becoming the new oil.
Starting around the time my parents got divorced. But then when Josie and I split up, it was like I hit rock bottom. Because I spent ten years convincing myself that I wouldn't do what my parents did. You know, that my marriage would work out differently. And then, all of a sudden. it turned out the same way.
Kevin! Hello? Oh, my God. That monologue at the end. - Oh, my God, it was amazing!
- This is your moment. - You did it. You got your dream job. Lauren: "Where's my coffee?" Lauren wants coffee before the meeting. Oh, it's in the kitchen where she can make it herself.
I've been going through the traffic camera footage from that night. This is an intersection 400 meters from Tim's house. I didn't see any cabs, but I looked for cars that looked like them. This dark Mercedes E-Class passed in the direction of Tim's house at 23:31. And here it is earlier that evening heading towards Tim's house at 18:36.
Help him, Constable Dasford. For the record, the license plate number is shown to the person being questioned. That's my car. So we have a vehicle crossing this intersection and coming back a couple of hours later. The reason we're interested in this intersection is because it's a couple of hundred meters from where the forensics officer was killed that night.
Real crystal, not like my mom's that passes off glass as crystal. - What kind of robot is that? It's kind of like a robot. It's a robot. It's, uh.
Hey. Hey. What? No, we're not messing with your robot. What? He kissed me, not me kissing him.
No one understands him or wants to act on him. I don't need to read it. We'll shoot it. You should read it. It's great.
I work out as much as I can. I gave birth six months ago. My hips are still a little tight when Cherry makes us jump, I'm a little sweaty, but I'm still here. It's not the training, it's that you think wrestling is stupid. Well, it is stupid.
But-- Not the second time. I knew what I was doing. I was sober, and insecure, and I think I was acting out of a hidden hatred that I didn't even know was there. And then... it came out and, uh. ruined a real friendship. But then I found wrestling, and it saved me.
No longer camping or fishing. Busy working. Forget about work. As soon as I get better, I'll show you the best waterfall in Starwood Rock. It's way out in the middle of nowhere.
- I don't care, I pay for every one. Casey. There's a problem with your equipment request. - What is it? - It's half full.
- Yes, I do. Come on. Get up. - Hurry up. There's a fire. It started in the dressing room.
I can go down and drop to 80 knots. We have to figure out how to get them out. - I wish I had that climbing cat. - Wait, there's a ferry coming in. - Is it gonna make it?
#Primary Problems. What's your point, Ms. Goines? The eyewitness kept a journal, too. I saw him at the Monkey Mansion. It's like a Bible to them, the Testaments, from Old to New and back again.
Well, that's great. Then get to it. Because you were late last time and I had to deal with Roger from TAC-LBC talking about how I run an irresponsible ship. - This ship is not irresponsible. It's leaky and it's sinking fast.
Somebody left him. Probably from this spot. - (cop1) I saw it. - Okay, what's your point? - It was in the trash!
Someone stole the rest of my medicine from my office. - (major) Someone stole-- - (ravi) let's not talk about that yet. I gave you a syringe a couple weeks ago. It's the last one and it's for Liv.
- Bram? - They killed everyone! - Who? - The Rapes. We blew up their ship and they hit the camp, it just vaporized.
Taking pity on the bird, they freed it from its restraints. Shall we begin? A few days later, one snowy night, a girl in white knocked on their door and asked to stay with them to wait out the storm. It snowed on and on. And when it was over, the girl asked to stay with them.
Oh, great. Now we know a million ways to die. Tell us how to survive. How much further to the lighthouse? Oh, so you can talk. It's behind those trees, sweetheart.
I got you. I got you, I got you. And, of course, hugging him. Did you pick the generator? Yeah, it's already in the lab, so we, uh.
I don't know, he said it was urgent. Is this about the deposition? No, actually, it's about a different nightmare scenario. I checked the timer found in the Arkani factory, and it's the most impressive thing we've seen from the BNM, if not other extremists. In fact, it's as good as what the US produces because.... we made it.
We're all done. - Mom! How was the test? - Uh-huh. - Yeah, how'd it go?
I'm gonna check your bandage, okay? I didn't, uh. I didn't, uh. in order. They turned you on and they turned you off, they have charts and conditions.... я... Claire, we're checking your pacemaker. It's working fine.
Grizzly Step is the Russians' viral attack on Vermont's power grid last year. Don't ask me how I know. This code is identical. It was embedded in ITB Energy and will plunge Chicago into darkness in nine hours. And why is it on your computer?
Very rarely. In fact, hasn't your method been banned by the police in Canada and England? I wouldn't say banned. They decided not to use it. Because it led to a large number of false consciousnesses?
Okay, here we go. We recovered a piece of metal. Looks like shrapnel. Okay, it's good, it's good. How big is it?
I'll be on my best behavior. I'll be on my best behavior. I'll be on my best behavior. What about our fee from Ventura Bridge? Is it coming in?
She takes characterizations from general interest websites. For character. - So turn it off. Since you created this bot, turn it off. If you try to tear it down, it'll replicate itself.
For character. - So turn it off. Since you created this bot, disable it. If you try to tear it down, it'll replicate itself. He's pretending to be me.
What happens to the first embryo? Ms. Salano's embryo is used for genetic contribution, and that's it. And it's destroyed? Not destroyed. It's no longer viable.
We've wandered into the far corners of contract law. No, the point is life, Your Honor. Actually, no. An existing embryo is property. The only question is, who owns it?
Good. (clears throat) Anything else, gentlemen? Yes. I have a rebuttal witness. But he'll be really brief.
Do I have to answer, Your Honor? Please. It's not true... He didn't put the story online for political reasons. Fisk thought it was his best story. He thought it would win him an Emmy.
- What about me? What about you? How much money did I give Trump? - I don't know. I didn't evaluate your contribution, it doesn't fit into my speech.
My curiosity is piqued. Mine, too. I love a mystery. Do you know how this list could hurt the firm? Are we sure it will?
Let's find out where my father was before he died. I got it. It's an island. I've seen this island on a lot of maps. He was doing business with Netland.
Maybe they were looking for shelter. Maybe. What about the power source? It's not there, but it's close. With the storm, I can't tell where it is or what it is.
What have you got there? This storm's gonna wipe the paint off. I'm talking about the mission. We're moving toward the power source. It's getting close.
Fresh air. Careful, Master Jedi. It's very deep. I saw a bug in here. But it broke the bridge, so I couldn't get across.
It's perfect. Yeah, I guess that's what Uriel was trying to say. Before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The wreckage is here." I thought it was bullshit, but-- I guess that's why the blade didn't ignite. It wasn't whole.
Guys, this is a music label. The symbol on the phone we found is the logo. And they decided to put out this kind of music willingly? It's a vanity label. It only exists to make this guy's music.
What's the protocol? It's just, uh. It's protocol, okay? Give me a break. I'd like to know what it is.
Oh, my God. Okay. (chuckles) Okay, I think we're ready. Tell me what you see. I see a rod and, uh. it's sticking out of a red-brown substance.
G: How... how will it affect her? G: Seeing you on the news, in jail? W: It's going to haunt her for the rest of her life. W: Frank. W: You have a choice, and I don't know what it is, but please. just figure something out.
There's something going on with the magic. The source is in Fillory. - The flow is jumping. - They're trying to fix it. Maybe it's going away.
- Remote control? - That's something just unbelievable. The lunar module appeared for a second, but it looked like it was about to fall to the surface of the moon. Where the hell is the command module? It's off course.
And my grandfather's happiness, my father's happiness, that's real. I'm sorry to interrupt. But you might want to prepare for a confrontation. The good news is we found the command module. The bad news is, it's heading straight for a cluster of space rocks.
It's hard to explain, but we need to know where the knight is buried. You dragged me off the battlefield to ask me about old myths? It's war out there, you fools! I suppose the view from the trenches is pretty grim. It was the end of the world for me.
How do you punish a mole without publicity? The way you usually do. We'll act first. We'll think later. According to our statistics, a Western ISIS hostage has a 25% chance of coming back alive. What if he's a secret agent?
What are the options? Destroy or don't destroy the camp. So what do we do? We can't destroy the camp if our agent is there. I didn't say he was there.
We use what works. Did your friend Shaana give you a similar bracelet? It's exactly the same. And you don't wear it. Too bad, it's beautiful. It's stolen, like everything else.
- I'm going back. - Good. (sighs) You'd give up everything I'm offering for a hostage? Yes. Then he's not just a hostage.
Your operation needs our drone? In exchange, we'll share our source. A drone in exchange for a source? I think it's worth it. He's capable of handing over a hostage, so he knows a lot.
You won't have a problem. We'll take care of it. You see Josephine's buddy? Yeah. No, he was pretty big.
Velez is lying? His answers match. Why would he lie to get himself killed? The algorithm can't tell me that. It just tells me he's not who we're looking for.
Space ... The final frontier. The last one, because he wants to kill us.
And he's just wearing it. God... The spacesuit's worth it? Gyroscope, magnetic boots and gloves, onboard computer. He can run, jump, update his Facebook feed.
Great gal, actress, a little orange, ...dumped me for an AI in a call center. What killed the station crew? I don't know of any recent deaths. What about the oxygen. Where'd it go?
Oh, listen to her. Still sassy after all these years! Explain. Oxygen is available for personal use only, at market price. It's only available in spacesuits.
Have you seen him? - Yes. Where is he? I'm sorry, he was killed by an animal. Who was he?
- Why is it dark? - The sun's gone down. No, it's the beast. It's circling us, looking for a way in. It's getting stronger.
Monster! Excuse me? Monster! There! - It's close!
And if Jorf, or whatever you call him, is just a friend, why were you wearing date clothes? What? That blue sweater from Our Relationship - Episode 204. Uh, I don't know. It was the only clean one.
That blue sweater from Our Relationship - Episode 204. I don't know. It was the only clean one. "Oh, I don't know. He was the only clean one."
- Super. Super, super, super, super. Josh sends me to the Jessup farm to gather data on Summer's whereabouts the night of Margaret's death. She says she doesn't remember anything, and to recreate her actions, I'm drinking hallucinogenic ayahuasca tea. It is said to bring spiritual awakening as well as powerful diarrhea.
Could you give me a minute, please, I'm having a hard time. Sure. - Can I use the restroom? Yes. It's right out front.
- I'm not going to rely on that. - Come on, mom. Let's say they broke in. We tried to wrestle the gun away. It went off.
And that goes for you, too, as long as there's anything left. Yeah, I found your journal. It's very interesting. Where did you find it? It was under your pillow.
Yeah. I asked me to make your drink. Shall I drop it off? You don't have to apologize, Grace. But if you leave it by the door, I'm sure it won't go to waste.
- Maybe he's sick. Well, maybe. Anyway, I'll come by, and I could bring him some leftover soup. What do you think? Yeah, he's all right for you - just as unreliable, noisy, and gives people nothing but trouble!
Well, maybe. Anyway, I'll come by, and I could take him some leftover soup. What do you think? Yeah, he's all right for you - just as unreliable, noisy, and a troublemaker! Actually, it's not mine.
Did you hear about that sign in the field? - What sign? - Burned into the grass, but no one seems to know what it means. It must be aliens! What does it look like?
- Yeah? What's that noise? - A noise? - One minute. He's beautiful.
What if I have to run again? I did a great job last time. Shh! What's that sound? It's coming from behind the house.
I mean, how long before they... We don't know exactly. I knew America was doing terrible things, but I never thought... about food for people. I know how hard it is to understand it, to see it. But the world... it doesn't work the way most people think it does.
Be thankful I'm wasting my time on you. I have things to do. I've got a lot to do. I have a thriving incubator. It is thriving.
I tried. But there was so much blood. Just be true to yourself, Sebastian, whatever the truth is. Yes, there may be sin inside of you, and that's how you feel about it. It will be forever.
Wait a minute. M: What happened? W: The night I went to the cabin when Robbie was stabbed ... In this reality, there was a red pickup truck following me. I saw the same red pickup truck yesterday. It's Robbie's.
I need to know what I'm working with. I threw it away this morning. Thought it was my last dose. I need to get your file. It's in my car.
Call me back, okay? You know you're aiming for the can, right? Well, then show me. You just have to be one with the gun. It's an extension of you.
I'm sorry, what? I kill people. How? With a drug. It's lethal.
- Not enough. - Not enough for what? Freedom. So you're breaking the law for freedom? The law is wrong, and it will change.
Preliminarily, it's some kind of floating bacteria. It's not airborne, so the quarantine can be lifted. But it's not all good news. This virus, or whatever it was, is very resilient. I mean, it survived both of our decontamination stages.
He used our equipment to create a virus resistant to chlorine and ultraviolet light. Then what doesn't make sense? It's the virus itself. It's a resistant adenovirus serotype 40. It's not lethal.
What's his thing? - I don't know. Maybe he likes lollipops so much he's tired of carrying around six of them. Or maybe he's a giant who was shrunken by a laser and didn't hit the lollipop. - Ooh, and he's still a giant.
Fine, depending on what you mean by "help." I know you have your reasons for not trusting me. My grandfather forged this sword for the High King, who disappeared without even claiming it. Since then, my family has kept it for the truly worthy. It's beautiful, but I don't think it will do much good.
I thought my system was perfect. I made a list of all the qualities I look for in a guy, numbered each one, and if the number exceeds 200..... Can I give you some advice? Burn that list. It's in the cloud, so it's not gonna work.
- Larry, we have news. Yes? I took your cell phone out of evidence. One of the perks of being a cop, you can take whatever you want. I kept it because it reminds me of you and your unlimited cell phone plan.
Drink up! One day you may be king. I wish it with all my heart. But I know how difficult a task it is. It is surely like pulling a stone up a mountain forever and then watching it roll down all the time.
- Yes, it is. - You know, it's, uh. it's not easy to realize. - There's something! Scorsese ran the blood sample from the grid. It's a little tainted, but it led us to Dino Brant.
Easy, tough guy. Look, I'm a cop, and I just want to ask you a couple questions. Then show me your badge. There's nothing on it, man. All right, he's probably in the car.
Technically, it's called a stink hole. Everybody, listen up. We have a situation. Ten minutes ago, a prison van overturned on Nevins Street. It was carrying nine inmates who are now free.
I'll have a triple chai tea latte with light crema and extra cinnamon. Thank you. You're terrible. Bye. Now my little black sugar coffee looks creepy. It was already creepy.
Okay. Katie personally collected epidemiologic data, tracking the possible direction of the Aleutian flu strain. Interviewing people, tracking the spread of the virus. Possible direction? Do you know how it got here?
Do you like it? Oh, yeah! What? There's a spider? Is it on me?
You're not trying. At the ready. The sword is lighter. You feel it. It becomes part of you.
"We have fire!" I suspect that men and wands are meant for much more than that, but we don't know what for yet. I was just thinking about it. The bathrooms make me happy. Is that fan closed? No, it's broken, which turns the place into a steam room, in a way.
But it could work. You know, Boyle, you're a bad influence on me. I've never been a bad influence on anyone before! Should I take my leather coat? It's ankle-length and tight.
You know, Boyle, you're a bad influence on me. I've never been a bad influence on anyone before! Should I take my leather coat? It's ankle-length and tight. No, it's too cool.
We never... What's the matter? See this brick? That's concrete. And it's cracking.
Anything else? Look at that. Finally! Might as well watch the grass grow. He's heading for the black hole.
- Uh, listening. - James Wackler. Yeah, the lady killer. His brain has been marinating in Ravi's blue solution for some time. It's ripe and ready for use.
This is our hiding place. Oh, hey, Liv. Hi, I'm just here to pick up Ravi's key to the storage unit. Uh, yeah, yeah. I think he's here.
Terrell holds his meetings here because it's across the street from the place Shoreline 99 controls. Am I the only one hearing this, Detective Bell, or are you hearing it, too? Hear what? The sound of evidence being destroyed? It's coming from inside the building.
"if I look in the mirror. "I think you know exactly what I'm talking about. Can I ask you something? "Does it bother you that not so long ago you were a slave and now you're defending the laws of your former masters with such vigor? "The law isn't perfect, but it's all we have.
Oh, honey, that's not what I meant. You do a lot of things. So proud, so confident. "Father of the Year" lasted a whole day, which, uh. got on one piece of paper. This day, it was off to such a good start.
Whiskey. The past always follows us around, doesn't it? Past, present, future, it's all a disaster any way you look at it. My second year on duty there was a guy, Peter Scarelli, raped and murdered a 10-year-old girl. We had his DNA, but right before the trial, the lab messed up his sample and he got off the case.
Uh, thank you. Uh, would you mind, uh. put the gun down? Uh, sure. It's not loaded, it's a prop from a student production of The Seagull.
I'll tell them the truth. That it was an accident. Then how do you explain it? You did the crossword puzzle two days ago. It proves intent.
See also. "Google is screaming about it right now. "We're so smart! We're developing an unmanned car." It already exists.
- Nothing to see there. The man's just doing his job. I've never been able to drift properly. I can go into a skid, but I can't keep the car in it. It takes on a life of its own and crashes.
He's hilarious! Oh, thank you. Is there a certain amount of time you have to stay at the exhibit? Not necessarily. Depends on the exhibit and what it's telling you.
I don't understand. Then there's this talentless lowlife who drank like a cobbler on some stupid reality show, despite my son's liver. Then there's this Patricia. She wrote her pornographic short stories through the cornea of my son's eyes. Then there was Kenneth Williams. He continued to smoke despite Elliot's gift of a lung in his chest. He smoked electronic.
So run! Come on! - All right. The autopsy report came back this morning, sir. It confirms that the victim died of massive internal bleeding from a single stab wound to the abdomen.
Dale Reynolds, 35. Threw a party that ended in an accidental overdose. Or not accidental. Bluish skin, bloody frothing at the mouth, all indicative of an overdose, but notice the knot in the tourniquet. It's on the outside of the arm.
- You can't, no. I want to do this. Because you're right. No one knows what a secret like that does to you. You try to live your life, but it sneaks into every corner of it.
This guy won? Well, there's no way a handsome guy like that invented anything better than this. No, he didn't invent anything better, he's an invention. Did you check out our robot? It's not that cool.
That's the guy! Come on. Round one is mine. No. I'd like to hear from the young lady who's been silent throughout the meeting. Well, the reason it's not selling is because it doesn't have good publicity.
I just got scared this morning and drove. I'm on my way back. Can I come to your place? Uh, sure. Sometimes you don't have to finish a movie to know how it ends.
Not really. You might actually understand the nature of my work. What I'm about to show you is not for everyone. Where's the key? Ah, here it is.
Just haven't figured out how to do it yet. Might be easier to move forward instead of backward. Start with his passport. - Really? It'll give you not only the date, but the place of birth.
Martin, can you tell us why we found your prints on the gun that killed Frank Henderson? I told you they'd find out. What's going on? Okay, I can explain. The gun belongs to me, it belonged to my father first, from World War II.
- Colonel Williams. - Uh, sir. Just wanted to see how the guidance system was coming along. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to shrink the prototype down to the required specifications. This cooling solution, it's freezing.
When Richard Game confessed to your murder, he'd been sick for years. With the Jenkins-Fowler virus. И? What? It was highly contagious.
Someone in my organization. Who has access to my offshore account, which was used to fund the recent attacks. 11 people have access to that account. Last night, I called these people in for a confrontation. I remember the rest of it in bits and pieces. The restaurant, what it looked like, but not where.
Because I'm in here twisting my guts and there's still no answer. About the overcooked chicken parmesan? Yeah, yeah, that's progress. Okay. I didn't say it was overcooked.
About the overcooked chicken parmesan? Yeah, yeah, that's progress. Okay. Uh-huh. I didn't say it was overcooked-- I said it was raw.
- No, no, I don't know. - What do you think? We need to know if this trait is inherited. You want to harvest her eggs. That's how he got in here.
That's how he got in here. But he's hurt. We'll find him. No, that won't be necessary. I know where he is.
What have you done to my future? She just wasn't that attracted to you. I'm not talking about Rachel. - Oh, the shadow file. - Oh, is it on that shelf over there?
He never knew his parents. Grew up on a skating rink. Cool backstory. It's from a movie. It's about figure skating, but I adapted it a little bit.
A waste of time? - No, just the opposite. This demon came from the vessel. If you bring him back, you can keep him alive. Why let him trick you into making more crappy deals?
100% match to the bullets from Rebecca Clark's body. Prints or DNA? - Nothing useful. - But maybe you won't need them. I ran the gun through the registry, it's registered to a Thomas Cade.
You know what? I-I'm gonna enjoy it in your honor. You can have the bacon, baby. I have a new cholesterol-lowering plan. If it involves pork, I'm all ears.
I-I'll-I'll enjoy it in your honor. You can have the bacon, baby. I have a new cholesterol-lowering plan. If it involves pork, I'm all ears. No, it doesn't involve pork.
All right. [Cell phone rings] Put Benny under surveillance. Maybe Benny will give us something to connect him to the shots. And the French horn is very complicated. It's much more complicated than a regular horn because it's French.
Hello, Rajesh. How are you doing? Not bad, not bad. Listen, just wanted to warn you, when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.
I have noted the main topics of discussion and who to discuss them with. I call these circles "Personal Zones." Don't google if you don't want to see images of genitalia. This circle includes just me and you. It corresponds to topics we only share with each other: details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
And he talked about a man who was killed during a robbery of a liquor store, and his brother decided to take revenge on those he blamed. I don't know anything about that. I believe you, but the problem is that I do. All the details in this story are from a case from 2012. It made the papers because both the store owner and the surviving robber got jail time for murder.
Does that bother you? Yes. I don't care about subconscious judgments. My brain and I are best friends. It has to tell me everything.
I just think you're the kind of person who likes backup plans. I am. Did you know that I've determined the order in which I'll have to eat all my friends in the apocalypse? You should stop hanging out with your brain like that. It's not good for you.
If I get hungry, I have lentil soup. It's getting harder and harder to pretend. Anyway, Sheldon, we now have to decide whether to run the xenon stream through a cryogenic cooler or a vacuum filter. State the weaknesses and strengths of each option for me. Well, if we run the xenon stream through a cryogenic cooler, it'll cool immediately before it becomes electrically conductive.
I'm gonna go to jail, and you know what happens to people like me, in jail they make me be somebody's tutor. You're not going to jail, but it's fun to think about it. You really can't remember anything? Give me your phone. Why? Well, it's--it might have tracked your route yesterday. Phones can do that?
We should have a fun day with the family. What's so important on your phone? I'm on the daycare website. Stop looking at them. Our preschool is great. It's on campus.
Mr. Ryder, when the Princess of the Crown speaks to you, every word she says is important. That press has got to be here somewhere, Flynn. Once again, I'm Eugene. There he is! And as soon as the tests are ready, he'll print the results on parchment.....
Let's be better than such politicians. Let's not start another Civil War. Some differences are too big to be put aside, Madam President. The post of Vice President. It's yours.
You know how to banish something bad, Earp or not? Lots of fire. Adhesive skin membrane. Traces of an exoskeleton. Whether he was putting on a new one or recently molted remains to be seen.
Her syringe? Yeah. It's not from the pharmacy. It's from the ambulance. my ambulance. You stole it? Look, uh. epinephrine is very expensive right now, and you need it all the time.
Because Michelle runs your life and tells you what to do and you just listen? She gets her way, but I would do anything to get that day back, Detective! Anything. Michelle, she knew about the epi, too, didn't she? Yeah, he's from our E.R.
No, no, no! - There's this weirdness in Waverly. - All the cutlery's gone. This perfect pool of glistening slime.... - It was calling to me.
Yes! That's what I thought. There's some kind of fuzzy pattern. I think I've seen this symbol before. It's on the Purgatory Volunteer Fire Department building at Third and Main.
No. I, uh. Needed something in town. Winona. When the demon got back inside me, it was different. He told me things.
We are criminals who have been banished from our world. We've heard that Aku accepts our kind. With great willingness. Your new home will be at coordinates 6-12-71. It's occupied.
Can you hold my flashlight for me? Are you sick or something? I feel, you know, itchy in my throat. I hope it's not something my kid's gonna catch. You know, they say that whooping cough. they say it's back.
Build them! Give me the code. or I'll execute them one by one. Give me the code. Your plan is wrong. It's based on us being stupid and cowardly.
Is Shepard planning to blow up Washington, D.C.? How? The satellite is supposed to drop the glider at supersonic speed. It can't be tracked, it can't be stopped, but it was only supposed to hit the White House. But now it's going to blow up Shepard's nuclear material, which is probably already somewhere in DC.
It's done. Glider's launched. What? How much do we have-- In 30 minutes, it'll hit the Capitol.
We need to get this van out of town to minimize casualties. We'll direct you to the least populated area. Maybe we can contain the decay products. There's a railroad tunnel that's out of service, just outside Washington. It'll limit the area of contamination so it doesn't get into the atmosphere.
You even returned a pool table that no one plays on. Wait, you liars! What's that beautiful couch doing here? The old couch didn't survive. In the sun, it turned to dust immediately.
Anyway, I could talk about my iron horse all day long. But we have work to do. Rose. Sarge, Scully and Hitchcock are out of control. They got in a fight over gravy, and now it's everywhere.
- Are you stressed? - Oh, yeah? You're kidding me now, right? My psoriasis, it's festering. It's moving through my body.
John, is it dangerous? Are we going to get the monkey virus? Can you smell it? That's the power, that's the smell. It leaves its odor!
It's too easy, even for you. What do you have to be afraid of, Winona? With the Peacekeeper on your side? So this little ritual will show me how to stop the Widows before they find the third seal? Oh, Ms. Earp. It'll show you a lot of things.
I'm so happy for her and Doc. That's your purse. Uh-huh. But that's my DNA test. I thought you said it wasn't here yet.
When you rise from Hell. As a demon. Peacemaker! I know that gun. It's what killed you.
A tail or something. А! I can't control it. I won't leave you. Can you-- Can you walk to the truck? It's right outside.
- I said... - Of course. Got it. The diplomat is silver, heavy. It's right here.
- Uh, sure. Got it. The diplomat is silver, heavy. He's here. I know he's here.
- Jeremy, relax. I'm about to shit my pants. - Not that much. - Diplomat! He belongs to the Earps.
- And the Peacemaker, too. - Okay. (chuckles) Okay? Okay. ! He's yours.
To single moms. You're a superhero. Same thing. Winona. This kid, who is he?
Oops. Look, whoever the father is, what's important is that this kid... There, I said baby. Still weird. He's Earp.
Should I drink your blood? Or do you have pockets full of silver, crosses, garlic and other superstitions? I had roasted garlic the other day. What, you shouldn't have? That's all I had.
Nothing. Louis, what's going on? Okay, Donna. I'm just gonna tell you one thing. Harvey asked me to handle something for him. It's personal. He trusted me.
Do you think Dad's fucking Mom now? I saw Dad naked in the bathroom once. But I didn't see his dick. Did you? Is it big?
She learned French by learning this lullaby. Did you know that this song-- There's an echo box in here. Someone's scanning the data traffic. Track where it's transmitting to.
You were reckless. You wrecked a motorcycle you stole. I didn't steal it. I borrowed it. It's faster and obviously insured.
Career? Hence all the family wealth. Stone used to be very valuable. Was? With her consent, it was sunk at the outbreak of war.
Down with Vortigern! Looks like you found a way to wield the sword. I didn't wield it. Come on. He was controlling me.
I won't remind you what happens if he doesn't show up. I'll start with the boy. Take the girl and go. This poison will reveal what is hidden from you. It will reveal what you don't want to see.
I think I hired her...when she was 17. maybe even 16. Let's decide for ourselves what's right. - How do you see the world? - It's ours.
We have to destroy the stone. What? No stone, no ritual, no Seth. - No curse? - Yes. I know where it is.
I apologize to you and Jason Blood, but your fates are now intertwined. And the demon Etrigan will forever be imprisoned in man. And that was the beginning of my sentence to live with Etrigan forever. I didn't think you'd be so willing to give it to me, and though this stone is weak without its other half, it is far from useless.
And the demon Etrigan would be forever imprisoned in man. And that was the beginning of my sentence to live with Etrigan forever. I didn't think you would give it to me so willingly, and though this stone is weak without its other half, it is far from useless. But it is safe here.
- What's going on? - If this were a computer, I'd say it's frozen. Thank you. Felix Faust must have shielded himself from the location spell. There is another way. But it requires contact with someone I'm not on friendly terms with.
You know, someday I'm gonna have to walk home alone. I'm 14 years old. Not on my watch, honey. This neighborhood isn't what it was 40 years ago. That's right. It's safer and prettier.
I'm not going back to your table. And no coins. I'm not a laundromat. I'm in. I want to rob this bank. It's as good as any other.
I'm in. I want to rob this bank. It's as good as any other. So, where do we start? We get in touch with this guy my ex-brother-in-law's in business with. Why should he help us?
Curriculum that develops creative thinking in children. To give them the belief that.... Yes, they can. There was a time when this port handled thousands of ships from all over the world. Now it can rise again.
The east wing. Or, as I prefer to say, the only wing. Watch your step! Welcome to your new home. It's modest but cozy.
I have a cable. I was so lost, I thought I'd never see you again. Attach it to it. This cable is very thin. Do you think it'll hold?
I'm not gonna let you die. Come on, we can do this. Come on. Use the torch, Kate. It'll help scare off the sharks.
All right. I've got two more. I dropped it. Here, take the flashlight. Where is it?
Don't! Don't do it! Stop! Where's the rock? Where is it?
Uh, welcome. I'm Landsat field research manager Victor Nieves. My colleague Steve Woodward, he's taming the data. We're sailing to a place that all merchant ships have avoided for centuries. As the satellite images show, the island is surrounded by a zone of constant storms, which is why it has gone unnoticed.
Everybody chill out! What? I didn't believe it when they said you were coming. I stayed up all night thinking about how Ganpei and I had dreamed of this moment. And now it has come.
Please say hello to my old friends. Hello? I can hear you. Help me, please. I'm in an airplane, and it's about to crash.
Look what you've done to yourself. All those pathetic complicated emotions. I lost count. Emotional context, Sherlock. It's constantly destroying you.
What? I'll find you. I'm looking for you. Hurry, please, because I don't have long. He's leaning in.
But keep the eye. What for? He'll wake up tomorrow and he won't know where his eye is! It's a table. I told you it's like this.
She and her friends from New York use our spa. Oh, good. (chuckles) How did a skunk get into her room? What? A skunk-- how did it get into her room?
Maybe he'll like it. Damn good coffee, Dougie? - Damn good coffee. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's great.
- Sand Buggy! - No! And that's Beth's, uh. shark repellent? You can touch that. It's useless.
Wow! Here you go, Grandpa. Hey, Batman! Get off my padre! Well, he came in handy.
У... you didn't have one. They put you in the copy room. My desk? It was a folding table. С... with a file under one leg, because the floor, it was, uh.
It's like the first time. Oh, my God! How much can I order? And it's not opiate-based? Every test I've run proves it's artificial.
Picture day. He has cancer. I don't understand. He got it from the Rand chemical plant we live near. It's spreading poison through the air, the ground, all around us.
- That's crazy. - No, it's not. People are dying from it. If synthetic heroin hits the streets, it will affect your students. It'll be on their streets, and everything you've done for them won't matter.
I am Madame Gao. Do you remember the purple tree in the center of K'un-L'un Square? You've been to K'un-L'un. Its shadow falls for miles around. And when it blooms, it smells like cane sugar.
Well, it was the apology that got you into this, which is why it's officially a statement. It's the first step in ACR's plan to save the company's image. But... what about the plant? What about it? It could be a cause of disease.
Oh, and the assistants need to get their dental insurance back, so that should be taken care of too. [Laughs] Damn. Unbelievable. Just unbelievable. Yeah, that image, the snake, you know what that means?
Just stay away from me and Joy. I'm sorry. You're like a cancerous tumor, Danny. I'm going to China. That factory, it's in Anzhou.
At first I thought it was a mistake. I wasn't supposed to be Iron Fist. I was looking for a sign. Then I saw this hawk. And I watched it fly farther and farther down the mountainside, and then I realized.
That's when I saw this hawk. And I watched it fly farther and farther down the mountainside, and then I realized. The way to K'un-L'un is open. I could leave. I looked for a sign... and instead it showed me the way.
I don't like you being here. At all. It's late. So there's an elevator. It goes downstairs.
You're not getting in my head again. Now tell me, what are you gonna do about New York? It's time for it to fall. Elevator. He's coming down.
I was taught on Kun-Lun that there is a lesson in every misfortune. And even when you're in pain, there's a way to rise up and find clarity. Is anything becoming clearer? New York. It's becoming home.
I've planned a sexy arc for four episodes. Now that everyone knows about the cameras, it's more like a reality show and I don't like it at all when people know about the filming. What about the show? We wanted to make my mom famous. It's not funny anymore.
Charlie, this is not what I wanted for Fighting Milk. That's right! We're not diarrhea guys. We never wanted to be. It's not for women!
Stop it! - The deal was one trickle, then my line. I specifically stated in the contract that only one trickle was required. And some kind of wrong collar! He's pissing me off.
- A two-dollar instant lottery ticket. - Yeah. You hired an umpire to determine the owner of a two-dollar ticket? - Now you get it. - Now he gets it. Each of us claims ownership of this ticket, and you tell me who it belongs to.
Get a grip. I decided to show and tell you about the most amazing cat of all time. Not only is his name Fred, but, uh. He only has one eye. You can count it, but I guarantee it's one.
Now can I say what I want to say? Okay. Before it was broken, Justin's zoo was the best creative project ever. Way better than the others. It was awesome.
Ares poisoned the human heart with envy and distrust. He turned them against each other. and war spread across the land. And then the gods created us Amazons... to heal the hearts of men with love and bring peace back to the planet. And for a short time, there was peace. But it didn't last.
What are we gonna do? Not much we can do if that's who I think it is. But we can stop that plane. If we could get a radio, we could call in the air force to shoot it down. No, if it goes down, it'll wipe out everyone in a 50-square-mile radius.
We're gonna have to put him away! Bad news, there's a timer inside. If we land him here, it'll be the same thing. Is the gas flammable, chief? Yeah, if you say it's hydrogen-based.
Where did you get this? I found a skeleton. There's a whole skeleton? How much is it worth? It's priceless.
Wait a minute. Simple solutions might just do the trick. If the Eye of God is picking up false coordinates, they're using a data stream relay. Watch what happens. So it's equipped with a downward randomizer.
No well-bred woman would mess with him. And you have no need to be wary of me. We have the same father. You're like an unopened chest in every way. When I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside.
You would risk your son's life? Zilpha. What did you do? I killed him. James, this gunpowder is not ready for transportation because it's unstable.
Oh, my God, Russ! You put a gun in this car? You idiot! What were you thinking? It was in the box on the seat.
It was in the box on the seat. I didn't know there was a gun in there! He could have shot himself! He could have shot us all! It was under my feet!
That's enough. Okay, here. You know what else I know? You don't like peas. They're awful, aren't they?
We're the fucking U.S. Army. We practically invented everything! And now some motherfucker in Brussels is telling us we can't fly our plane because of a volcano in Greenland. So what do we do? Stay in Paris until it "stops erupting"?
- You've been looking at that "nothing" for a long time. - Okay, I stand corrected. I'm looking at this vastness. The ocean, so mighty and vast. It's full of life and mystery.
I hope he's not in there. Let's split up. Look. The passage isn't above us. It's underneath us.
It was a bad idea. It wasn't a bad idea. It was a terrible idea. I told you where the transformer is. I told you how it works.
Your father is a ruthless con man who always has a monstrous plan to hurt someone. What happens when he gets out of bed? You have a plan? I have a plan. I just don't know how devious it is.
Feel your muscles relaxing. Your arms relax. Your eyelids relax. Imagine you are sitting in front of the television. When you turn on the TV, it will play a memory.
I'd say high. About 100%. If there's a station here, then maybe there's a train. And if there is a train. It leads to the Wild Hunt.
Welcome to the Festival of the Beast. Where masks symbolize an unknown horror. And we commemorate the day I banished that horror from our land. But when the two moons align, the Eternal Beast will return, and it will be worse than ever. He will destroy everything in his path.
Tell me, what kind of knowledge is that? Anna? We know that this Beast will come from the sky. Where not every giant can reach. It will have a heart, it will be able to think and feel, and so it can be killed. Don't you agree?
Worship is a lucrative business. The one with the most followers wins. You want to play? Life is long when you have regrets. A moment can last forever when you know how it must end.
- They don't want us to infect anyone. - Why is it on TV? - It's a cover-up. That's why they invented the fire! They brought it to Spain and it spread.
- Huh? I don't have it. - Speak up, I can't hear you. - I don't have it. Where is it?
We've been doing disgusting things like shopping together. I'm sorry! Comparison shopping. That top looks good on you. It's too revealing.
What is it? Hot sauce, horseradish, cabbage, raw egg, and about six other hangover-fighting ingredients. No, don't smell it. Just drink it. Look, I talked to my mom about house arrest and what it entails. She's agreed not to punish you, but on one condition:
Ex nihilo nihil fit. "Out of nothing comes nothing." I just don't like it when people read my...personal stuff. Every poem you write should be about the personal. It should be frightening and terribly embarrassing.
What? From this notebook? - Don't even touch me. - Get out of my house. - It's not your house. - You think it is?
This steak is awesome. - Dad cooked it? - Mom did. Dad does the grilling. - It's damn good.
That shrink is a real pussy talker. Are we going home? Daughter, can I have a syringe now? Oh, God, yes! Daddy, it's in my purse.
Answer me, asshole. You want a tambourine, asshole? See you later, camel driver! Here's the key to the warehouse. Let me know when it's empty.
This bear was probably infected with something. It's hemorrhaging from a gunshot to the head. It's possible. This bear wasn't hungry. He wasn't even fucking hungry.
- Just gardening. To make it grow and grow. - So, what have you been doing cooped up in there all day? Working on your secret project? - Yeah. It's about to come out.
- Thank you! Remember, you can't sing this song. - I got it. - You can play it, but you can't sing it. - Why can't I go to the musical? - It's not for kids.
- The chef... not bad! - And the chef is even better! Madeleine, more bread? - Yes, please. It's so good.
We have to do something. - But that's not what we're doing, daughter! - What about your musical? - What about my musical? - You said it helped you find your purpose in life, and I understand that.
You know, with peanut butter. Man, they loved that stuff. He was the only one who touched it, the only one who took a bite. His saliva. So when you check it out, you know it's not contaminated.
Turns out it was a guy from Nigeria, he just wanted money. But, uh. I live in a small town. Then you should be on Facebook. Because it's like a small town.
- I'm serious. You locked me in a safe. The office safe? How could you forget that? It was open, you talked me into it, and then you slammed the door shut.
How much for the gun? - What? I want to buy your gun. How much? It's not for sale.
Yes? You fucked up coming here. Fuck you all. I saw your drawing. It's so good.
Anytime. Carrie. Hi. How was your day? Well, it started with someone throwing a coffee mug at me.
Was she in New York? I don't know that either. Can you look in her file? Well, not without attracting attention, sir. It's top secret.
Can I borrow a pencil if you're done? Uh-huh. Does everyone in Northern Virginia have a security clearance? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It comes with a Starbucks card.
I saw them. The banker he's talking about is a Mossad agent. It's all a game. The only game was the treaty itself. It just couldn't be enforced.
Evidence. A real van is sitting in their garage over there. - "A real van?" - It's been swapped out, for another one. - And it's here in the garage? !
Administer the meds. - In the process. When people told me catering was a shitty job, they weren't kidding. Oxygen. Come on, where is it?
Ќo didn't send it because your blue federal access petition was denied 'orosho. Well, now I can send you the clearance ј can't you just hand it to me? "I have a flight to Milwaukee in an hour and a half. You see, it's at the post office.
One of them will grow up and cure the cancer, but only if the other one dies now. You don't have to kill the child yourself, you just have to nod for it to happen. Will you nod? If I nod, how will the baby be killed? Will it die in agony or will it die quickly and painlessly?
I killed her hamster. What? - Yes. When you left for the conference and didn't feed him. I came back an hour before you, and he was dead.
- Yes. When you left for the conference and didn't feed him. I got back an hour before you, and he was dead. I went to the neighbor's trash can and dumped him there. Told you he'd escaped.
Don't move, I said! Oh, my God. You look just like him. The president's in the briefing room. He's on lockdown, but the code is 6969.
What? No. No, it's not me. - Yes, it is. It was in the typewriter at the beach house.
So answer right now what you intend to do. - How? How do we do it? - One of you must stay here as a guarantor of the treaty. You'll send someone to the stash, they'll come back and hand the chest to me.
"To invite people to dine with us is to be responsible for their welfare while they are under your roof." But he was an 18th century philosopher and a foodie.... and these were three children with very little experience in cooking. Despite this, the Baudelaire orphans set to work. This spaghetti maker looks like it's from Thomas Jefferson's time. Does it work?
- And Charles Wayne? - Charles Wayne was my closest friend. - Tell me all about him. - I never knew a braver man. No, he had fear, but he didn't give in to it.
This one. This one's not bad. - How many pages? - Nine. But it's good.
I think I caught an empathic STD. Let them rejoice. Hey, Mr. Gorilla, where's the ball? Where'd the ball go? Oh, it's in your goal.
The house is suspended. The House will be suspended. Madam Speaker, I still have Paul, and I find it hard to believe the President wouldn't have an Opinion on the issue at hand. If the good gentleman from Florida will give some of his time, I assure him he will satisfy his question.
Katie, no. If they come, you tell them everything about where to find me, okay? Vince is a dangerous man, but he's not crazy. As long as you stay out of his way, he has no reason to hurt you and your family. I hope you open that safe and I get my 10 grand, even if it is as impregnable as Al Capone's bunker.

It's related to your legal work. How fast can you get to Bridgeport? This time of day, an hour and a half. Maybe less if you push it. Look, I'm gonna make a killing. But at 4:30 or 5:00, it's gonna turn into a pumpkin.
Oh, God, no. This has to be a mistake. Are you sure it's him? We found this in the dead man's pocket. It was Richard's.
The best moments of the women's tournament in color. Just like live. Maybe, but this is a police station, not a TV store. Fell out of the truck, sir. We wanted to make sure it was working.

He was only Edison at home. This Aston or Ashford, what do we know about him? Perhaps Miss Palfrey was closer to the doctor than his wife wanted. It came to divorce. My source says he was some kind of local celebrity.
Our working theory is that this hibernation may be a defense mechanism. Everyone is on edge, and Hugh certainly blames himself for it, but honestly, it's a relief to me. Calvin has been growing up very fast, and now I've had time to reinforce the precautions with the team. The box needs to be hermetically sealed, as does the lab, regardless of the risk to Calvin. He's just floating.
The spacesuit's getting hot. Like Siberia in the summer. I'm at the transmitter. Beginning localized diagnostics. It's overheating.
Space suit cooler. Commander? Calvin just showed up. He grabbed my spacesuit. It got bigger.
How? Mutate? Take over the world, kill a bunch of students 39 times? You see, your feelings, that hunted look doesn't come out of nowhere. Where does it come from?
Why don't we go get something to eat? Now we're getting somewhere. Look, a thief! I'm a good detective! Dial your number, and if he calls, he'll never get away.
I can't. I have to prepare the words of my vows. Spending time together is very important. Sister Ursula said I should spend more time studying. The problem with TV is that it completely kills the conversation in the room.
The problem with the TV is that it absolutely kills the conversation in the room. Without that bulky device distracting us, we can have more fun with crafts. And in each other's company. Sister Ursula, may I ask where the television has gone? Suffice it to say, it is now where it brings joy.
It was in one of the urns, sir. Thank you, JP. Florence, do you have the number? Who did the phone belong to? It belonged to you.
Then you carried the body on a stretcher to the volcano and left it where you found it that morning. And then you just had to be patient and wait at the observation point, because the last part of your plan required the arrival of Mayor Richards, who could confirm that you were all at the observation point that morning. And when we checked the log book, it turned out that no one had come or gone from the building between Steven's departure and the mayor's arrival because Victoria had left the door open, allowing you to return. A careful and very resourceful plan. And it almost worked.
- probably for, uh. - Who tried to kill you? It started at the airport. Я... It was a red sedan. He started following me.
- No. Sell. A visit for your passport. An American passport is worth its weight in gold here. With a few changes, it could be a ticket to freedom.
Look, I'm the last one to agree with Mona. - Don't start. - She's right. If this client likes your design. No, it's not mine.
- His company. I underestimated him. He's as cunning as I am. I have something to show you, but promise you won't tell anyone. Ali decides if we keep the baby and we tell everyone it's not Dunhill's, it's mine.
Hell doesn't come when you die. It comes when they take away everything you love.
Hey, gotcha! There's always a smart guy. Every time. You know, I don't care who you are, where you come from or what you've done. If your path led you here, this is where it ends.
Hey, M.K., don't get caught. Hello? Anybody here? That's my friend's compass. What's he doing here?
Don't think I'll forget what happened today. And you'll pay. You didn't mention my garden. The garden is part of your lot, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn. It comes with the house, mom.
- Oh, that's great. Can I, uh. - We're almost done. I'll be there in a minute. And sign my lily pond. It's in my garden. Lily pond.
Maybe I can find another way. There is something you can do. Give me a piece of gum. A piece of gum will get us out of jail? It'll start the process.
Okay, I think there's a possibility that Ennalise did it. - Why? - Her cell phone. The one that Oliver cleaned. Because it contains information about all the bad things we've done.
Where have you been? - Running. - 2 hours? You'll feel better when I have abs. You left your phone, it kept ringing.
And you know what? I don't think he's going to. I don't think Howard is going to let him anywhere near Mesa Verde with that tape. Howard knows it will make HHM look bad. If Chuck has a plan for this tape, I don't know what it is.
Not yet, but he will. There's someone I know who can convince him. Clary? I made you a black coffee with lots of sugar. It's not as good as the Jade Wolf, but still.
Provide facilities for a maritime mission. Find a ship on your own. Alec, the ship is under glamor. The locators won't show it. Well, it won't hide from us if we run right into it.
I promise. You look like you need a drink. And get a towel. Just, uh. just your phone. I'd ask what happened to yours, but I can only assume it got wet.
A demon must be fueled by negative emotions. Anger, hatred, rage. Leads the host to create this creepy itch. So we'll keep scanning for venom and heat signatures. Try to find the host before it strikes again.
Are you sure? She's about this tall, pigtails, always, uh. wears a scarf. Where'd you get that scarf? I didn't. I found it, it's mine.
Don't worry. She's with Magnus. Luke and I will be right there. Take the energy core and disable it. Then no matter who touches the sword, it won't activate.
You're stuck here, Mick. That's why I'm here. To guide you. The amulet. Why is it so important?
- Lies, Professor! This virus is tearing Gotham apart. Then there's nothing in this city more valuable than your antidote. We could demand half of Gotham and the city council would hand it to us on a silver platter. So I'm gonna ask you one last time, where is it?
If the virus has allowed Gotham to show its worst side. then the antidote should be a reminder that there is always hope. A chance to remember who we can be rather than who we are. I don't know if Gotham deserves to be saved, but I do know one thing: If anyone can save it, it's you. And in return, I believe he will save you.
So I got it all back. Because I released Black Siren, one of those guards could have died. We almost caught Prometheus. Your plan worked. He was there. No. If it had worked, you would have cuffed him by now.
The prosecutor came to me and, uh. Are you talking about Adrian Chase? That's right. He ordered me to amend the report to say that the Star-Spangled Killer was guilty. That report, and you agreed and signed it, even though you knew it was false. And then you turned it over to the police.
If you don't like it, shoot me. As you wish. This laptop contains 80 million rubles in transfers from Kovar's accounts to accounts Gregor controls. Yes, we know that, to distribute to the Bratva captains. It also contains 40 million rubles in transfers from Kovar that Gregor didn't tell us about.
I came for you. I didn't expect this. It's-- It's not human. Anatoli, when I put this hood on, I told you it helped me control the darkness inside me.
And it worked, by the way. I know what Kovar wants to do. But at what cost? You're a fool if you think a piece of cloth can separate man from monster. Dividing yourself into two people will only make the monster stronger until it's stronger than you.
I don't think so. Check the elevator. Yeah, guys. Curtis is right. According to the elevator's activity logs, it went up, oh, my God, 0.9 seconds. and then just fell in freefall 40 stories.
What do you mean, traumatized? Я... I was heating soup for her. That's all I could do for her. And it was on the stove, and I passed out, drunk. Poor Zoe, trying to grab it, pulled it down, and it burned her hands, really badly...
- How's Chase gonna spread it? It's in the form of an aerosol, so whatever he wants. We need to find out where Chase keeps it and stop him before he sprays it. Cyclotrizan disintegrates very quickly. Which means it leaves a traceable trail.
Looks like Green Arrow is a hero again, whoever he is. Well, the mayor's doing pretty good, too. "Sentinel" reports your approval rating is back up to 70%. What? Has it ever been that high?
The asteroid moves using its own thrust. That's impossible, but that's how it works. Where is it going? We don't know. But it's orbiting the sun.
Do we know why? No. The Mormon generation ship flew to Eros before it started? Fred Johnson said it was an engine check. But given the speed and trajectory of the Novu, it was headed for a collision with Eros.
Well, it looks like some laws of physics have been broken. Maybe God was up to a magic trick. Eros weighs about seven trillion tons? Its temperature has increased by two degrees. Yeah, it's producing, uh.
You named him that yourself. Let me think! Do we see that hovercraft? In the shadow of Eros, no. It's invisible to radar, too.
All right, cowboys and cowgirls. I'm serving up the liquor. Message from the Rocinante. Delay 13 minutes. The ship is accelerating at 15 G's to equalize speed with the target. It will automatically lock missiles onto Eros.
No, me first. Please. Okay. And don't interrupt. I've rehearsed this moment for years, but, uh. now that it's here. I'm confused.
I mean, we'll use my face and my dick. - Okay, and we'll just blur the rest of it. Yeah. And I want to camouflage it, just if we can clip it or blur it or whatever. But the main thing is that we're all going to be naked and my dick, I don't know if it's appropriate enough.
- Lies, Professor! This virus is tearing Gotham apart. Then there's nothing in this city more valuable than your antidote. We could demand half of Gotham and the city council would hand it to us on a silver platter. So I'm gonna ask you one last time, where is it?

And I'm going to start now. So the next time you're alone, you win. Deal? Deal. HR and I just figured out a way to track down Yorkin, and he's, uh. Crazy.
What is it? It's an emergency alert from Joe. He must be on that train. The train won't stop. It won't stop in time.
- What's going on? We're gonna move the train. How do we do that? I'll vibrate it. I'll vibrate it fast enough to get it through the wreckage.
You said you created Savitar? - How? - Look. Four years from now, the future Flash will create a, uh. a temporary doppelganger to fight Savitar. But Savitar will keep this doppelganger alive so he can become Savitar.
It's a vicious circle. There's no beginning, no end. It's an endless vicious circle. Classic chicken and egg story, right? The time doppelganger, he's, uh. he's like a copy of you, right?
- Why? What's the problem? - Uh, okay. It's the gas pedal. It's sucking in a lot of air watts,

It's the Founder's Parade. They bring the bell every year. This is an exact replica. The real one disappeared from the so-called Vickery Bridge in 1992. Anyway, I've spent the last three weeks sending people down this river to look for this bell, and they never found anything.... but I know it exists because it can't be destroyed.
We just need to make more of an effort. - Thank you. - Do you understand me? - I also have a gift for my youngest son. That podcast you started. It touched me.
I was doing some work and I came across this pile. Did you touch it? When I found it, yeah. I thought some client had lost it. It doesn't make any sense that it would be here.
I need to know how to shoot it. Come on. Or you could get eaten by a bear. Is it loaded? It's loaded.
It's enough if her legal guardian gives permission. And in addition to being her husband, I'm also her legal guardian. But this piece of paper is not an official document. It's, uh. it's just a prop. If you look closely, I think you'll see that it's figuratively real.
Damn it! The Baudelaires! The Baudelaires! I brought you a present. It's very spicy.
N-N-No. No, it's, uh. still stolen. My phone. You know, my phone shows me where it is.
- Ma'am. - I see him. I see him. I can give you the address. It's on my fucking phone.
- I see him. I see him. I can give you the address. It's on my fucking phone. - It's on my fucking phone!
What, what? I don't know what the fuck you're showing me. All right. We don't want any trouble. My computer was stolen, and the app shows it's here.
- When is the trial? - It starts tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. - And how long will it last?
- Tomorrow already? - Yeah. How long will it last? - A couple weeks. And when it's over, what happens then?
See what's wrong? I should have checked with Dr. Hamza. Leo, you have neurocysticercosis. A parasitic worm has invaded your brain. It's relatively safe while he's alive, but if he dies, it's serious, so we have to act fast.
But she confuses the past with the present. That's how this disease works. It comes in unpredictable waves. Sometimes the brain is fine. Sometimes it struggles.
No way. Not until I get my daughter back. Even then, I-- The only way to get my daughter back is to give them the laptop intact. Where is it, by the way?
Our story is about a town. A small town. And the people who live there. From the outside, it looks just like many other small towns in the world.
You must. I'm the senior captain of the River Foxes. Is cheerleading still in style? Is being a gay best friend still in vogue? Some people say it's retro, I say it's timeless and iconic.
May I sit down, Jadhead? If you like. - What are you working on? - A novel. It's about that summer and Jason Blossom.
- No, no. I'll do it myself. Follow me.... Jughead. Another fun fact about fear. Sometimes it grows with you.
Congratulations, Mr. Andrews. Looks like you won. I apologize. I'll say this about fear. It never goes away.
Staring out the dirty old window At the cars racing through the city below, I sit alone, wondering why. It's Friday night and everyone's going out. I feel the heat, but it's soothing.
Forget I said anything, okay? Okay. Bye. I changed my mind about Toledo. Can you just put me on the next bus out of town? I don't care where it goes.
This "Danny is a terrorist" thing was my plan B. Never would have used it if it wasn't for that lady in the niqab. You know what? The law should be above everything, like physics. It should be above the media and politicians.

It's traveling to another realm of reality. Each of our subjects described this place with the same words. They drew this. Concentric circles. Scientists and theologians have argued for centuries about what happens to the brain when it starts to work differently.

- Waldorf salad, please. Can I have a tomato tea sandwich? - Uh, sure. - Uh, thank you. What good is an outfit if it doesn't turn a man into a mental patient?
I need 60 hours a week from everyone, daily reports, lunch will be reduced to 30 minutes. In fact, whatever is going on in your life right now, I recommend canceling it. And then, without hesitation, cancel it again to make sure they understand that everything is... canceled, okay? You know, this conversation reminds me of the old days. It reminds me of New York and Harvard and Yale.

Midwife on the phone. Nurse Winifred, Mrs. Marsh is in labor. I can't deny that this situation worries me. And both parents are dwarfs, so there's a pretty good chance the baby will be the same. But it could still be healthy.
You can have him - as soon as he's born. We'll give him everything, Marnie. - It'll be the baby we never had. - It's gonna be a baby that's gonna be yours, Dot. It'll be yours.
Don't be sad, Auntie Wai. I'm not sad, I'm glad. Look how beautiful the garden is, Patrick. There's so much space. There's plenty of room for the children to run around. Yes, it's quite big.
Oh, Reggie. And we let go of their hands. but not their hearts. Out of the need to be needed, but not out of the need to love. We go to a French restaurant. And since it's French, they serve snails, and where there's snails, there's tongs, garlic oil and a bowl of finger rinse.

Jennifer made her first recording on October 4. October 4th? Wait a minute. October 4th. October 4th. That's the day Cyrus Beene won the vice presidential debate. Admiral Ballard had no problem with free college when he attended it.

Deacon. They say you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first fight? И? It was glorious.
My Sarah. Is that him? That's the virus that's got everyone on edge? Yes. It's getting worse and worse.
From what happened before, this time seems different. Someone new is behind all this. Is it a vaccine simulation? The infected are showing different signs this time. I'm trying to suppress the artificial virus because it seems to be the basis of the infection.
On their own, these viruses either have no power or risk activating on their own. But together, they become an effective, controllable bioweapon. Excellent, Professor. No wonder you survived Raccoon City. If the activator is airborne, it's hard to know where it's going and to whom.
I love your bracelet, Anita. Thanks, Maddie. It's secondhand. It's so old-fashioned. Actually, it's not--
But trust me when I say the turning point is near. This job is different from your usual "find and grab" tactics. Our target is a young man named Holden Matthews. A Google search will tell you he's been in a coma for 12 years. But it won't tell you how dangerous he is.
You're a wolf. None of us are... A wolf is a wolf. The wolf is you. It symbolizes your fears.

He has been very interested in juvenile detention issues since his time as governor. And we really appreciate him giving us his time. - Right this way. - Uh, okay. (clears throat) The president's schedule's jammed, but he won't be long.
- He said he was fine. Is that my robe? - No. Yeah. He says it feels like money.
I think I can track him in a couple seconds. - No, no, no! - What happened? The other end tripped an emergency switch in the chip's tracking code. It cut off my access.
I'm me. I'm not gonna risk this firm's reputation without hard evidence of innocence. You're you. You have your own office. And it's down the hall.
I've never seen so many Secret Service agents, not even when I was First Lady. You may not see them, but you'll always hear them. They're like mice in a wall. When you're president, that sound never stops. Later, it becomes the noise you look forward to hearing.
We formed a line. Excuse me! Sergeant! IDENTIFICATION... Then I saw the drone. It was watching us.

The occupation is sending more and more people to the factory. We are nothing more than slave labor for them, and they burn us like firewood. And it's not just a file. Broussard's team found a coded countdown hidden in the Rapa communications. It will end the very day this block is emptied.
"Quietly" refuses to release the docking clamps without Fred Johnson's personal permission. And he won't give it? All right, I'll get right on it. You know, I don't have to let you go. Considering how much time and money I've invested in this ship, it's probably more mine than yours.

Turpentine might work. It's natural, made from pine. But it's pretty toxic. How much would it take to make another batch? I'll just bring in the turpentine, that's all. It's not harmful to pregnant women?

And then he threw up by the swing set. But I wasn't mad at him, you know? He always threw up and he always fell down. I wasn't mad because he was wearing a suit and tie. I don't know where he got it from.
- Very good. Good start to the day. You just need to show me where my desk is. Uh, sure. It's right in that office.
If her husband didn't answer the door himself, his phone could have been used by the killer. Is that possible, Mike? Did Mr. Bloom give up his phone? I don't know yet. I'm checking his signal now, looks like it's on its way from Catalina...Richard could have left it at Catalina, come back and shot him. Your ex hated your husband that much?
"let's stick it in the microwave" and I can't cook anything but scrambled eggs and toast and I need a toaster for that. So last night we gave up and went to a restaurant. What kind of restaurant? There's only one on the other side of the river.
He was trying to hide his height because he knew the bus camera would catch him. Everyone knows that, Mark. And you know what that says about your successful businessman, Richard Bloom? Of all the pay phones in the area, our picky Ricky chose this one because he's thought it through very carefully. This successful businessman doesn't rely on luck, and in my very humble opinion, I think this phone is his big mistake, because it shows us his character.
But we still don't have definitive proof that Paul Bloom is our shooter, even if he was at Chandler's house. Oh, there it is, Paul. Look familiar? Now let's see when you last used the OffKey. Then we'll take your phone to Chandler's house and see if it opens the lock.
- Okay, but you can't walk here. - He hasn't been fed in two days. I'm really worried. - Okay. Where's your baby? - No, no, he's just a baby.
The King does not love me for my ability to bear children. And certainly not for caring for them. You are free. Did you find the killer? Yes. Who is he?
Yeah, a little offshoot of 11. Lisa. Yes? Curry's cell phone trace was in some wilderness where he stopped for five hours and then the signal went dead.
What is that, a gun? Says he has no idea how the gun got there. All right. [Cell phone rings] What do we do? It's not that easy to get it out. It's already passed the sphincter.
One more time. Close your eyes, Ariel. Okay. Do you see your shield? Now describe it for me. It's gold.
So. Do you see your shield? Now describe it for me. It's golden. It surrounds me.
Do you see your shield? Now describe it for me. It's golden. It surrounds me. It protects me from the pain of others.
And then it was over. My wife was gone. When did Rachel die? Last year. Ovarian cancer. He took her so quickly.
No, not him. Why not? Because he shouldn't go. I'll go in his place. I thought this world meant nothing to you, that it wasn't real.
Why not? Because he shouldn't go. I'll go in his place. I thought this world meant nothing to you, that it wasn't real. - It's not real.
Jeffrey Mays hated our freedom and tried to turn our country into... Tarnishing the name of a good man. Isn't anyone sick of this propaganda crap? It's like I've been drinking poison. A little bit every day, and you don't even notice it's killing you.
- Darkhold technology. - Dar-who again? I've seen this mechanism before. It was designed to create elements out of thin air. It looks like it's creating something even more complex.
My plan is to rebuild the world you're used to..... where the Inhumans are hunted. And we would control the rest. And it won't hurt that the two of us are unstoppable. But your plan isn't perfect. It's too clean.
- I'm ready. Good for you, sweetie. I wish everyone was as good at packing as you are. Hey, Mac, I can't find my suitcase. It was here a minute ago.
- You said you never lie! - And that was a lie, too. - And the baby's definitely mine? ! Do you even know? ! - It's yours, Ricky.
There's a picture of me in there. What? -It's not normal. -I'm supposed to be a normal engineer. Open the safe. 11 million dollars won't fit in there. It's too small.
No, thank you. What do you mean? I have a paper due today. - On the Dietrich course? - Yeah. What's it about?
That's right! I remembered. Svetlana. This office doesn't save itself, you know? It's not self-packed because one of us has been working for the last three hours.
Did he? Yes. You see, before sacrificing himself for our sins, our lord gave mankind one last gift - he became a father. For generations, the Grail has protected the entire holy lineage, preparing for only one thing: the end of the world. Only God knows when exactly it will happen, and it is soon.
Also... There's something attached to his rib. Oh, my God! There's a wire. It goes under the skin.
William, if this device is a receiver, how could Gillis hear what we were saying? William, what are you doing? I'm looking for a microphone. There's got to be a microphone in here. Where does it go?
Now don't pay attention to what you hear. What don't you hear? You don't hear the music and the singing and the thousands of people in the streets celebrating St. Ursula's Day. The carnival runs right down this street. It is so loud that it is still ringing in my ears, yet there are no carnival sounds here. The grate was open, but no sound.
- They're all closed. I checked. What about the fire exit? Can you open it from the outside? No, it only opens one way.
My name is Violet Baudelaire, and this is my brother and sister..... Klaus and Sunny, of course. Come on in. - I think the doorbell's broken. - It's disconnected.
If you're implying what I think you're implying, don't you think it's too fast? Even by modern standards? No. I suppose after all we've been through, a kiss would seem rarified. It'll be old-fashioned.
That's the name of Dr. Midnight's killer. - I just don't get it. - Be more specific. The list of misunderstandings could be long. Okay, assuming the Legion took the Spear fragment from there, how did they know it was there?
Can't you see the connection? Poor thing. Anyway, your king is now doing whatever I want him to do, so unless you want him to flood the entire floor with your blood, I guess you'll give up the Spear fragment. My patience is running out. The fragment. Where is it?
- and her defense attorney. - Beer, Professor. Bring six cans. How far are we from the limiter? Looks like it's in the neighborhood.
Cadmus has them locked in cages that are later supposed to kill them. All Lillian has to do is push one button. I can't disable it myself. But there's a magnetic field disruptor in the weapons vault at the DEO. It'll open the cages.
Everything's under control. - Is that why you called me? - Actually, no. I called to get an update on the Daxamite ship. It appears to be in low orbit right now.
Nothing. Got a pen? What are you doing, Mick? I'm writing a screenplay. It's gonna be a bomb.
Emma! Angel, we have class! Where'd he go? To his boyfriend's. Who is he?
I was there. It was easy. Do you know anything about a VCR? I can't plug it in. I know it works.
But we don't have complete information. Of course we do. And we can't rule out that it was closer to..... "Oooooh! It's stuck in the clarinet!
a man's tie is the window to his soul. We just ran a piece on it. Oh, yeah? So, well, what does my tie say about me? It says you're a dedicated civil servant with the bank account to prove it.
- Freeze! Hands in the air! Hands in the air! Step aside. - (Leanne) You stole our gun? - It was hanging from her belt.
Yeah, that's a great idea. And I'll tell everyone else. Because everyone will love that you're banging your coworker's girlfriend. - They'll trust you. - Helen, I didn't come here to fight with you. I came here because-- Yeah, to talk to you about the baby, and to tell you that if it's mine. and I figure there's a good chance of that, I want to be a part of his life.
I asked him to draw a small circle. Maybe at least in this case he'll make an effort. Maybe he'll attract attention with a simple circle. That's the impression I got from that circle, John. It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, determination, passion and honesty. And it reminded me of you.
- Why? What's in those capsules? - I made a mistake. I was very wrong. The settler ship isn't on its way, it's already here.
Yes. - Teaching. But what is ether? What is a substance with such marvelous properties? It turns all physics upside down, but it must exist, otherwise....
I've already tried it 20 times. It's not an anomaly. There must be a new element in the sample. Radioactive. It's hundreds, no. Thousands of times stronger than uranium.
How can she despise the woman who bore her only grandchild? Look at those cheeks. That little guy looks just like Grandpa. Hey, doll, have you seen a tie? I think it's hanging on the bathroom door, son.
Marie. Go see what we found. Don't peek. You thought it was 1,000 times stronger than uranium. This element is a million times stronger, and it's not even in its pure form.
Fat embolism from femoral fractures..... Tachycardia and ventilation problems. Thoughts? We need to deal with the fat now. It's in tiny little pieces.
Just lived with it. Being young, he was much wiser than me. I feel anger. All the time. It's always with me.
I tried to tell you that. You see that? He's got a gun. No. No, no, no. I swear I saw the gun. It was in his hand.
You could have killed me, you crazy bitch! I thought it was-- It's okay. It's okay. It looks like a gun, doesn't it?
It's time to work out. I think I already have. Not until it's done. If it comes out, who do you think the axe will fall on? Who does it always fall on?
Phil Simms. A CIA meeting just as Linda disappeared. Rachel's mystery friend. Yeah, I think we do. The CIA aspect, isn't that a little far-fetched?
Thanks, Dom. Oh, Jason! My dad told me he was here. He said he liked your house. Said he was crazy.
What are you doing here? - Will that do? This car will take you to Chicago. - Take my phone. And make sure it's on.
Stupid face. - (babino) Do you know what he was carrying? - (homeless man) Trash. - (babino) What makes you think he was carrying garbage? - (homeless man) He was carrying a garbage bag.
What else we got? - Yeah. I got something. St. Patrick gave me this phone. It's from Lobos' C.I,
You know, I kind of feel like I'm really in love. I need to get her hooked on my pheromones. We got a meth problem. My finger. It's--
I need to get her hooked on my pheromones. We got a meth problem. My finger. It--it's--it's hurting again.
What happened to you, Suzanne? - I need help! - Okay. We need to get his cells out and smooth them out, or else. But you can't touch the iron because it'll burn your fingers.
- Albert, watch out! Just, uh. Watch where you're going, please. What for? Why look? According to you, this car is a particle, but we didn't see it. And it wouldn't have hit us.
Hitler is insane. Imagine what he'd do with a weapon like that. He'd destroy London, Moscow. Years ago, Fritz Haber convinced me his poison gas would speed up the war. It only made it worse.
However, I want to keep up with the latest news. I guess I'm still living the dream of being a real physicist. Like you. What do you want to know about? I'm most interested in nuclear fission. The magazines say it's going to be a more powerful source of energy than oil.
That's just fucked up. Why the hell would she do that? To kill your friend. I told Moon to calm down, but she was like, "That kid is evil. He can hurt people."
- Yeah, that would be great. - As far as approval. - Yes. The legal committee asked me to send them everything you've written on abortion. Well, I can show them my own abortion if I've got one lying around.
What's this? What do you see? A new body. Another one? The drone. it's stuck.
What you're doing won't bring your family back. Go away. No need to die. There's an engineering bay right below us. If it blows, the ship's dead.
Lumenomancy. I'm a moron. You are. Shut up, I-- I remember. Anyway, the scope, it's in McClane's office.
Excuse me? I added my sacred excrement to the source of all magic. It stinks. I hope you weren't planning on drinking from it. It's hardly drinkable.
Hi. How'd you get into the office? I'm pretty good at this kind of thing. Like disability benefits? It's a little cramped for the two of you, this office.
No, not all of it. All you did was ruin a perfectly good camping van. - No, I didn't! - And your sweater. That's genius! It's all armored.
Yeah, coming down. Roger that, coming down. Oh, my God. I've loaded a high-explosive round. It's also a tracer, and we'll see it fly and converge on the target.
Many months later, I was ready to make a third attempt. An impenetrable fortress. Yes. It's a divine tow truck. I based it on the armored transporter from Aliens. Counting on the fact that if it could protect Sigourney Weaver from those mechanical jaws with teeth, it could protect me from Jeremy Clarkson and James May.
Unfortunately, Jeremy's high-speed U-turn only made matters worse. Go! Go! Slow down! It's falling apart!
You can use wool yarn. And it's, uh. So beautiful, so cozy. How can I explain it? This sweater here would be perfect. - It's homey. - It's nylon.
Its engine mixes fuel with air and then, without any trickery, explodes! Of course, this means that the "GSF" model harms animals, and that is definitely bad. But it does have some positive aspects - listen to the sound it makes! At medium speed, the engine sounds dreary, like the howl of a lonely dog. But if you turn up the revs, it sounds the way an atmospheric five-liter V8 should sound.
Time. Very funny. It wasn't a joke. I've been studying the instantaneous drive for two days now. But I'm no closer to figuring it out. I don't know why it turned on or how to fix it.
That's great. Just what we need. Let's get in there, take it and get out. The signal's too weak to find the engine from orbit. But I've pinpointed it to a small town called Fort Falls, Wisconsin. Uh, hold on.
Oh, that's great. Except, uh. there's a little problem. You brought all this junk with you, and there's no room for a tiny file? I didn't realize it was so important.
Remember how I said that zero is a space bubble, not much bigger than the station? Yes. Well, I know that because I've sent radar beams outward to determine the outer limits of the bubble. And? So it appears to be shrinking now.
And the fact that it seems to be shrinking now. It's collapsing inward. Oh, my God! When we got here, it was over three kilometers in diameter. Now it's less than 2.5. How long before it reaches the outer edges of the station?
That's right. With a tactical nuclear warhead. Looks like it's aimed at the platform. What about the shuttle? It never left.
I thought you all thought it was beautiful. It is. So does a volcanic eruption or a tsunami. There are few things more beautiful than destruction, but that doesn't mean I like it. This fog, are you hoping it'll go away again?
Just like a volcanic eruption or a tsunami. There are few things more beautiful than destruction, but that doesn't mean I like it. This fog, are you hoping it'll go away again? Yes, of course. And it will disappear... once it gets what it came for.
There are few things more beautiful than destruction, but that doesn't mean I like it. This fog, are you hoping it'll go away again? Yes, of course. And it will... as soon as it gets what it came for. What do you think he came for?
A forester I knew many years ago told me about a mother bear who gave birth to three cubs. The foresters monitored the births to make sure they were not threatened by outsiders, but they were shocked when the mother killed the first two cubs herself. They intervened and took the last cub, a boy. Why did she do this? While they were caring for the cub, they learned that he was suffering from a fever and infection.

God loves a trinity. I'm next in line. Larry. When you say that, people who don't understand you think you're not really upset about what happened. No, I'm ruined! This key is German, it's irreplaceable!
Before the regent touched the sword, I slit his throat. Four of his bodyguards burst into the room, and I killed them all. From that day on, fear comes to me before every fight, but I meet it as a friend. It makes you faster, stronger, smarter.
Estrella, do you know what this is? Yes. I told you. We're finding it all over the area. A piece of meteorite, and it lets you walk around in broad daylight.
So how are you gonna get us to Texas on your 43 titty dollars? It's possible there's a stash of cash up your ass. Sweaty, but cash. So you're just gonna close this place up yourself? I got a boat to catch before it leaves for New Orleans.
Taylor Mason, maybe. Some kind of protégé of his. A confidant. Whatever Axe himself is up to, Taylor's always around. I think it's time, long overdue, to change your philanthropic direction and set up a permanent foundation. If it's properly managed, it'll give you a good reputation, like Carnegie, Vanderbilt, make you look good for a long time.
Hey, what do you think of my tie? I designed it myself. It's called "yoloha." It's a combination of "yo" and "aloha." Well, Buzzy, I think it's cool.
And you were filming a story dressed as a homeless woman. Yes, you ate out of the trash. And I'll continue to do all of that in a series of special reports that will go out on our electronic platforms. - They're the future, right? - I've tried my best, but this world is just... It's full of snakes and traps and--
- It's not here. - What? My diary's gone. - Look harder! It should be there!
- Well, uh. - Maybe. I want to take a look at the menu. And I have to say, I'm not sure this crystal is appropriate. I think it's a little elitist.
Yeah. Yeah, mine or yeah, maybe? I don't know. That's the truth. But it could be yours.
I'd show you, but I can't get these pants off. Max, come on. You can't let one bad experience ruin your whole life. Otherwise, I'd never stand on our bath mat again. I don't know why it's always hot.
The last message from my son came to him from the mall. That's where we should go. Why? We must take a stand against those who disrupt the natural order of things. The fog will only leave here when we've redeemed ourselves. It will leave us alone when we live in harmony with each other again.
There are only two ways into town. the train and the main road. Tomek, do you have anything that can help us? Explosives on the tracks. The train will destroy itself. It'll collapse like a broken toy.
- See that window over there? Percy recorded that the killer probably came in through it. - (liv) Why didn't she hear him? - (babino) I don't know. The remote. I wonder what it controls.
Or underestimate mine. You haven't been elected president yet, sir. It won't matter if the party turns its back on you. When Bob Birch builds all your sheep, you'll be begging to be allowed back in. And two years from now, back in Phoenix, you'll look back on that moment over and over again, realizing that it was the beginning of the end.
Check in with your compartment. We'll do a roll call as soon as we can. Do you copy? Do you read me? We're in the rain, it's burning our skin.
Come home alive. I got it. Raven says black rain's coming. She's right. I used to love the rain, now it scares me.
- What color was the festival bracelet? - Blue, right? - Yeah, it was blue. That means she got it in advance. It's for VIPs.
They have a bunker? Their faith was built on surviving the end of the world. Bad news, Abby. Black rain is scarier than we thought. It burns your skin.
Of course you can. Look at it this way. You can get out of this interview by talking about the time a piece of cortex went in your mouth. - It wasn't in my mouth.
No. It was on the news. A therapy cat in a nursing home. Yeah, they say they have that gift. When someone's on death's doorstep, no doubt they'll curl up in a ball on them.
No, no, it's working. Keep going. No, Lyla. There's no blood flowing to the stomach. It's dead.
No problem. What the hell? Does it hurt? No. It's just broken.
What's the big deal about lithium? It's the main component of today's high-capacity batteries. For everything from smartphones to electric cars. Lithium powers things that power everything. It's fast becoming the new oil.
Starting around the time my parents got divorced. But then when Josie and I split up, it was like I hit rock bottom. Because I spent ten years convincing myself that I wouldn't do what my parents did. You know, that my marriage would work out differently. And then, all of a sudden. it turned out the same way.
Kevin! Hello? Oh, my God. That monologue at the end. - Oh, my God, it was amazing!
- This is your moment. - You did it. You got your dream job. Lauren: "Where's my coffee?" Lauren wants coffee before the meeting. Oh, it's in the kitchen where she can make it herself.
I've been going through the traffic camera footage from that night. This is an intersection 400 meters from Tim's house. I didn't see any cabs, but I looked for cars that looked like them. This dark Mercedes E-Class passed in the direction of Tim's house at 23:31. And here it is earlier that evening heading towards Tim's house at 18:36.
Help him, Constable Dasford. For the record, the license plate number is shown to the person being questioned. That's my car. So we have a vehicle crossing this intersection and coming back a couple of hours later. The reason we're interested in this intersection is because it's a couple of hundred meters from where the forensics officer was killed that night.
Real crystal, not like my mom's that passes off glass as crystal. - What kind of robot is that? It's kind of like a robot. It's a robot. It's, uh.
Hey. Hey. What? No, we're not messing with your robot. What? He kissed me, not me kissing him.
No one understands him or wants to act on him. I don't need to read it. We'll shoot it. You should read it. It's great.
I work out as much as I can. I gave birth six months ago. My hips are still a little tight when Cherry makes us jump, I'm a little sweaty, but I'm still here. It's not the training, it's that you think wrestling is stupid. Well, it is stupid.
But-- Not the second time. I knew what I was doing. I was sober, and insecure, and I think I was acting out of a hidden hatred that I didn't even know was there. And then... it came out and, uh. ruined a real friendship. But then I found wrestling, and it saved me.
No longer camping or fishing. Busy working. Forget about work. As soon as I get better, I'll show you the best waterfall in Starwood Rock. It's way out in the middle of nowhere.
- I don't care, I pay for every one. Casey. There's a problem with your equipment request. - What is it? - It's half full.
- Yes, I do. Come on. Get up. - Hurry up. There's a fire. It started in the dressing room.
I can go down and drop to 80 knots. We have to figure out how to get them out. - I wish I had that climbing cat. - Wait, there's a ferry coming in. - Is it gonna make it?
#Primary Problems. What's your point, Ms. Goines? The eyewitness kept a journal, too. I saw him at the Monkey Mansion. It's like a Bible to them, the Testaments, from Old to New and back again.
Well, that's great. Then get to it. Because you were late last time and I had to deal with Roger from TAC-LBC talking about how I run an irresponsible ship. - This ship is not irresponsible. It's leaky and it's sinking fast.
Somebody left him. Probably from this spot. - (cop1) I saw it. - Okay, what's your point? - It was in the trash!
Someone stole the rest of my medicine from my office. - (major) Someone stole-- - (ravi) let's not talk about that yet. I gave you a syringe a couple weeks ago. It's the last one and it's for Liv.
- Bram? - They killed everyone! - Who? - The Rapes. We blew up their ship and they hit the camp, it just vaporized.
Taking pity on the bird, they freed it from its restraints. Shall we begin? A few days later, one snowy night, a girl in white knocked on their door and asked to stay with them to wait out the storm. It snowed on and on. And when it was over, the girl asked to stay with them.
Oh, great. Now we know a million ways to die. Tell us how to survive. How much further to the lighthouse? Oh, so you can talk. It's behind those trees, sweetheart.
I got you. I got you, I got you. And, of course, hugging him. Did you pick the generator? Yeah, it's already in the lab, so we, uh.
I don't know, he said it was urgent. Is this about the deposition? No, actually, it's about a different nightmare scenario. I checked the timer found in the Arkani factory, and it's the most impressive thing we've seen from the BNM, if not other extremists. In fact, it's as good as what the US produces because.... we made it.
We're all done. - Mom! How was the test? - Uh-huh. - Yeah, how'd it go?
I'm gonna check your bandage, okay? I didn't, uh. I didn't, uh. in order. They turned you on and they turned you off, they have charts and conditions.... я... Claire, we're checking your pacemaker. It's working fine.
Grizzly Step is the Russians' viral attack on Vermont's power grid last year. Don't ask me how I know. This code is identical. It was embedded in ITB Energy and will plunge Chicago into darkness in nine hours. And why is it on your computer?
Very rarely. In fact, hasn't your method been banned by the police in Canada and England? I wouldn't say banned. They decided not to use it. Because it led to a large number of false consciousnesses?
Okay, here we go. We recovered a piece of metal. Looks like shrapnel. Okay, it's good, it's good. How big is it?
I'll be on my best behavior. I'll be on my best behavior. I'll be on my best behavior. What about our fee from Ventura Bridge? Is it coming in?
She takes characterizations from general interest websites. For character. - So turn it off. Since you created this bot, turn it off. If you try to tear it down, it'll replicate itself.
For character. - So turn it off. Since you created this bot, disable it. If you try to tear it down, it'll replicate itself. He's pretending to be me.
What happens to the first embryo? Ms. Salano's embryo is used for genetic contribution, and that's it. And it's destroyed? Not destroyed. It's no longer viable.
We've wandered into the far corners of contract law. No, the point is life, Your Honor. Actually, no. An existing embryo is property. The only question is, who owns it?
Good. (clears throat) Anything else, gentlemen? Yes. I have a rebuttal witness. But he'll be really brief.
Do I have to answer, Your Honor? Please. It's not true... He didn't put the story online for political reasons. Fisk thought it was his best story. He thought it would win him an Emmy.
- What about me? What about you? How much money did I give Trump? - I don't know. I didn't evaluate your contribution, it doesn't fit into my speech.
My curiosity is piqued. Mine, too. I love a mystery. Do you know how this list could hurt the firm? Are we sure it will?
Let's find out where my father was before he died. I got it. It's an island. I've seen this island on a lot of maps. He was doing business with Netland.
Maybe they were looking for shelter. Maybe. What about the power source? It's not there, but it's close. With the storm, I can't tell where it is or what it is.
What have you got there? This storm's gonna wipe the paint off. I'm talking about the mission. We're moving toward the power source. It's getting close.
Fresh air. Careful, Master Jedi. It's very deep. I saw a bug in here. But it broke the bridge, so I couldn't get across.
It's perfect. Yeah, I guess that's what Uriel was trying to say. Before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The wreckage is here." I thought it was bullshit, but-- I guess that's why the blade didn't ignite. It wasn't whole.
Guys, this is a music label. The symbol on the phone we found is the logo. And they decided to put out this kind of music willingly? It's a vanity label. It only exists to make this guy's music.
What's the protocol? It's just, uh. It's protocol, okay? Give me a break. I'd like to know what it is.
Oh, my God. Okay. (chuckles) Okay, I think we're ready. Tell me what you see. I see a rod and, uh. it's sticking out of a red-brown substance.
G: How... how will it affect her? G: Seeing you on the news, in jail? W: It's going to haunt her for the rest of her life. W: Frank. W: You have a choice, and I don't know what it is, but please. just figure something out.
There's something going on with the magic. The source is in Fillory. - The flow is jumping. - They're trying to fix it. Maybe it's going away.
- Remote control? - That's something just unbelievable. The lunar module appeared for a second, but it looked like it was about to fall to the surface of the moon. Where the hell is the command module? It's off course.
And my grandfather's happiness, my father's happiness, that's real. I'm sorry to interrupt. But you might want to prepare for a confrontation. The good news is we found the command module. The bad news is, it's heading straight for a cluster of space rocks.
It's hard to explain, but we need to know where the knight is buried. You dragged me off the battlefield to ask me about old myths? It's war out there, you fools! I suppose the view from the trenches is pretty grim. It was the end of the world for me.
How do you punish a mole without publicity? The way you usually do. We'll act first. We'll think later. According to our statistics, a Western ISIS hostage has a 25% chance of coming back alive. What if he's a secret agent?
What are the options? Destroy or don't destroy the camp. So what do we do? We can't destroy the camp if our agent is there. I didn't say he was there.
We use what works. Did your friend Shaana give you a similar bracelet? It's exactly the same. And you don't wear it. Too bad, it's beautiful. It's stolen, like everything else.
- I'm going back. - Good. (sighs) You'd give up everything I'm offering for a hostage? Yes. Then he's not just a hostage.
Your operation needs our drone? In exchange, we'll share our source. A drone in exchange for a source? I think it's worth it. He's capable of handing over a hostage, so he knows a lot.
You won't have a problem. We'll take care of it. You see Josephine's buddy? Yeah. No, he was pretty big.
Velez is lying? His answers match. Why would he lie to get himself killed? The algorithm can't tell me that. It just tells me he's not who we're looking for.
Space ... The final frontier. The last one, because he wants to kill us.
And he's just wearing it. God... The spacesuit's worth it? Gyroscope, magnetic boots and gloves, onboard computer. He can run, jump, update his Facebook feed.
Great gal, actress, a little orange, ...dumped me for an AI in a call center. What killed the station crew? I don't know of any recent deaths. What about the oxygen. Where'd it go?
Oh, listen to her. Still sassy after all these years! Explain. Oxygen is available for personal use only, at market price. It's only available in spacesuits.
Have you seen him? - Yes. Where is he? I'm sorry, he was killed by an animal. Who was he?
- Why is it dark? - The sun's gone down. No, it's the beast. It's circling us, looking for a way in. It's getting stronger.
Monster! Excuse me? Monster! There! - It's close!
And if Jorf, or whatever you call him, is just a friend, why were you wearing date clothes? What? That blue sweater from Our Relationship - Episode 204. Uh, I don't know. It was the only clean one.
That blue sweater from Our Relationship - Episode 204. I don't know. It was the only clean one. "Oh, I don't know. He was the only clean one."
- Super. Super, super, super, super. Josh sends me to the Jessup farm to gather data on Summer's whereabouts the night of Margaret's death. She says she doesn't remember anything, and to recreate her actions, I'm drinking hallucinogenic ayahuasca tea. It is said to bring spiritual awakening as well as powerful diarrhea.
Could you give me a minute, please, I'm having a hard time. Sure. - Can I use the restroom? Yes. It's right out front.
- I'm not going to rely on that. - Come on, mom. Let's say they broke in. We tried to wrestle the gun away. It went off.
And that goes for you, too, as long as there's anything left. Yeah, I found your journal. It's very interesting. Where did you find it? It was under your pillow.
Yeah. I asked me to make your drink. Shall I drop it off? You don't have to apologize, Grace. But if you leave it by the door, I'm sure it won't go to waste.
- Maybe he's sick. Well, maybe. Anyway, I'll come by, and I could bring him some leftover soup. What do you think? Yeah, he's all right for you - just as unreliable, noisy, and gives people nothing but trouble!
Well, maybe. Anyway, I'll come by, and I could take him some leftover soup. What do you think? Yeah, he's all right for you - just as unreliable, noisy, and a troublemaker! Actually, it's not mine.
Did you hear about that sign in the field? - What sign? - Burned into the grass, but no one seems to know what it means. It must be aliens! What does it look like?
- Yeah? What's that noise? - A noise? - One minute. He's beautiful.
What if I have to run again? I did a great job last time. Shh! What's that sound? It's coming from behind the house.
I mean, how long before they... We don't know exactly. I knew America was doing terrible things, but I never thought... about food for people. I know how hard it is to understand it, to see it. But the world... it doesn't work the way most people think it does.
Be thankful I'm wasting my time on you. I have things to do. I've got a lot to do. I have a thriving incubator. It is thriving.
I tried. But there was so much blood. Just be true to yourself, Sebastian, whatever the truth is. Yes, there may be sin inside of you, and that's how you feel about it. It will be forever.
Wait a minute. M: What happened? W: The night I went to the cabin when Robbie was stabbed ... In this reality, there was a red pickup truck following me. I saw the same red pickup truck yesterday. It's Robbie's.
I need to know what I'm working with. I threw it away this morning. Thought it was my last dose. I need to get your file. It's in my car.
Call me back, okay? You know you're aiming for the can, right? Well, then show me. You just have to be one with the gun. It's an extension of you.
I'm sorry, what? I kill people. How? With a drug. It's lethal.
- Not enough. - Not enough for what? Freedom. So you're breaking the law for freedom? The law is wrong, and it will change.
Preliminarily, it's some kind of floating bacteria. It's not airborne, so the quarantine can be lifted. But it's not all good news. This virus, or whatever it was, is very resilient. I mean, it survived both of our decontamination stages.
He used our equipment to create a virus resistant to chlorine and ultraviolet light. Then what doesn't make sense? It's the virus itself. It's a resistant adenovirus serotype 40. It's not lethal.
What's his thing? - I don't know. Maybe he likes lollipops so much he's tired of carrying around six of them. Or maybe he's a giant who was shrunken by a laser and didn't hit the lollipop. - Ooh, and he's still a giant.
Fine, depending on what you mean by "help." I know you have your reasons for not trusting me. My grandfather forged this sword for the High King, who disappeared without even claiming it. Since then, my family has kept it for the truly worthy. It's beautiful, but I don't think it will do much good.
I thought my system was perfect. I made a list of all the qualities I look for in a guy, numbered each one, and if the number exceeds 200..... Can I give you some advice? Burn that list. It's in the cloud, so it's not gonna work.
- Larry, we have news. Yes? I took your cell phone out of evidence. One of the perks of being a cop, you can take whatever you want. I kept it because it reminds me of you and your unlimited cell phone plan.
Drink up! One day you may be king. I wish it with all my heart. But I know how difficult a task it is. It is surely like pulling a stone up a mountain forever and then watching it roll down all the time.
- Yes, it is. - You know, it's, uh. it's not easy to realize. - There's something! Scorsese ran the blood sample from the grid. It's a little tainted, but it led us to Dino Brant.
Easy, tough guy. Look, I'm a cop, and I just want to ask you a couple questions. Then show me your badge. There's nothing on it, man. All right, he's probably in the car.
Technically, it's called a stink hole. Everybody, listen up. We have a situation. Ten minutes ago, a prison van overturned on Nevins Street. It was carrying nine inmates who are now free.
I'll have a triple chai tea latte with light crema and extra cinnamon. Thank you. You're terrible. Bye. Now my little black sugar coffee looks creepy. It was already creepy.
Okay. Katie personally collected epidemiologic data, tracking the possible direction of the Aleutian flu strain. Interviewing people, tracking the spread of the virus. Possible direction? Do you know how it got here?
Do you like it? Oh, yeah! What? There's a spider? Is it on me?
You're not trying. At the ready. The sword is lighter. You feel it. It becomes part of you.
"We have fire!" I suspect that men and wands are meant for much more than that, but we don't know what for yet. I was just thinking about it. The bathrooms make me happy. Is that fan closed? No, it's broken, which turns the place into a steam room, in a way.
But it could work. You know, Boyle, you're a bad influence on me. I've never been a bad influence on anyone before! Should I take my leather coat? It's ankle-length and tight.
You know, Boyle, you're a bad influence on me. I've never been a bad influence on anyone before! Should I take my leather coat? It's ankle-length and tight. No, it's too cool.
We never... What's the matter? See this brick? That's concrete. And it's cracking.
Anything else? Look at that. Finally! Might as well watch the grass grow. He's heading for the black hole.
- Uh, listening. - James Wackler. Yeah, the lady killer. His brain has been marinating in Ravi's blue solution for some time. It's ripe and ready for use.
This is our hiding place. Oh, hey, Liv. Hi, I'm just here to pick up Ravi's key to the storage unit. Uh, yeah, yeah. I think he's here.
Terrell holds his meetings here because it's across the street from the place Shoreline 99 controls. Am I the only one hearing this, Detective Bell, or are you hearing it, too? Hear what? The sound of evidence being destroyed? It's coming from inside the building.
"if I look in the mirror. "I think you know exactly what I'm talking about. Can I ask you something? "Does it bother you that not so long ago you were a slave and now you're defending the laws of your former masters with such vigor? "The law isn't perfect, but it's all we have.
Oh, honey, that's not what I meant. You do a lot of things. So proud, so confident. "Father of the Year" lasted a whole day, which, uh. got on one piece of paper. This day, it was off to such a good start.
Whiskey. The past always follows us around, doesn't it? Past, present, future, it's all a disaster any way you look at it. My second year on duty there was a guy, Peter Scarelli, raped and murdered a 10-year-old girl. We had his DNA, but right before the trial, the lab messed up his sample and he got off the case.
Uh, thank you. Uh, would you mind, uh. put the gun down? Uh, sure. It's not loaded, it's a prop from a student production of The Seagull.
I'll tell them the truth. That it was an accident. Then how do you explain it? You did the crossword puzzle two days ago. It proves intent.
See also. "Google is screaming about it right now. "We're so smart! We're developing an unmanned car." It already exists.
- Nothing to see there. The man's just doing his job. I've never been able to drift properly. I can go into a skid, but I can't keep the car in it. It takes on a life of its own and crashes.
He's hilarious! Oh, thank you. Is there a certain amount of time you have to stay at the exhibit? Not necessarily. Depends on the exhibit and what it's telling you.
I don't understand. Then there's this talentless lowlife who drank like a cobbler on some stupid reality show, despite my son's liver. Then there's this Patricia. She wrote her pornographic short stories through the cornea of my son's eyes. Then there was Kenneth Williams. He continued to smoke despite Elliot's gift of a lung in his chest. He smoked electronic.
So run! Come on! - All right. The autopsy report came back this morning, sir. It confirms that the victim died of massive internal bleeding from a single stab wound to the abdomen.
Dale Reynolds, 35. Threw a party that ended in an accidental overdose. Or not accidental. Bluish skin, bloody frothing at the mouth, all indicative of an overdose, but notice the knot in the tourniquet. It's on the outside of the arm.
- You can't, no. I want to do this. Because you're right. No one knows what a secret like that does to you. You try to live your life, but it sneaks into every corner of it.
This guy won? Well, there's no way a handsome guy like that invented anything better than this. No, he didn't invent anything better, he's an invention. Did you check out our robot? It's not that cool.
That's the guy! Come on. Round one is mine. No. I'd like to hear from the young lady who's been silent throughout the meeting. Well, the reason it's not selling is because it doesn't have good publicity.
I just got scared this morning and drove. I'm on my way back. Can I come to your place? Uh, sure. Sometimes you don't have to finish a movie to know how it ends.
Not really. You might actually understand the nature of my work. What I'm about to show you is not for everyone. Where's the key? Ah, here it is.
Just haven't figured out how to do it yet. Might be easier to move forward instead of backward. Start with his passport. - Really? It'll give you not only the date, but the place of birth.
Martin, can you tell us why we found your prints on the gun that killed Frank Henderson? I told you they'd find out. What's going on? Okay, I can explain. The gun belongs to me, it belonged to my father first, from World War II.
- Colonel Williams. - Uh, sir. Just wanted to see how the guidance system was coming along. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to shrink the prototype down to the required specifications. This cooling solution, it's freezing.
When Richard Game confessed to your murder, he'd been sick for years. With the Jenkins-Fowler virus. И? What? It was highly contagious.
Someone in my organization. Who has access to my offshore account, which was used to fund the recent attacks. 11 people have access to that account. Last night, I called these people in for a confrontation. I remember the rest of it in bits and pieces. The restaurant, what it looked like, but not where.
Because I'm in here twisting my guts and there's still no answer. About the overcooked chicken parmesan? Yeah, yeah, that's progress. Okay. I didn't say it was overcooked.
About the overcooked chicken parmesan? Yeah, yeah, that's progress. Okay. Uh-huh. I didn't say it was overcooked-- I said it was raw.
- No, no, I don't know. - What do you think? We need to know if this trait is inherited. You want to harvest her eggs. That's how he got in here.
That's how he got in here. But he's hurt. We'll find him. No, that won't be necessary. I know where he is.
What have you done to my future? She just wasn't that attracted to you. I'm not talking about Rachel. - Oh, the shadow file. - Oh, is it on that shelf over there?
He never knew his parents. Grew up on a skating rink. Cool backstory. It's from a movie. It's about figure skating, but I adapted it a little bit.
A waste of time? - No, just the opposite. This demon came from the vessel. If you bring him back, you can keep him alive. Why let him trick you into making more crappy deals?
100% match to the bullets from Rebecca Clark's body. Prints or DNA? - Nothing useful. - But maybe you won't need them. I ran the gun through the registry, it's registered to a Thomas Cade.
You know what? I-I'm gonna enjoy it in your honor. You can have the bacon, baby. I have a new cholesterol-lowering plan. If it involves pork, I'm all ears.
I-I'll-I'll enjoy it in your honor. You can have the bacon, baby. I have a new cholesterol-lowering plan. If it involves pork, I'm all ears. No, it doesn't involve pork.
All right. [Cell phone rings] Put Benny under surveillance. Maybe Benny will give us something to connect him to the shots. And the French horn is very complicated. It's much more complicated than a regular horn because it's French.
Hello, Rajesh. How are you doing? Not bad, not bad. Listen, just wanted to warn you, when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.
I have noted the main topics of discussion and who to discuss them with. I call these circles "Personal Zones." Don't google if you don't want to see images of genitalia. This circle includes just me and you. It corresponds to topics we only share with each other: details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
And he talked about a man who was killed during a robbery of a liquor store, and his brother decided to take revenge on those he blamed. I don't know anything about that. I believe you, but the problem is that I do. All the details in this story are from a case from 2012. It made the papers because both the store owner and the surviving robber got jail time for murder.
Does that bother you? Yes. I don't care about subconscious judgments. My brain and I are best friends. It has to tell me everything.
I just think you're the kind of person who likes backup plans. I am. Did you know that I've determined the order in which I'll have to eat all my friends in the apocalypse? You should stop hanging out with your brain like that. It's not good for you.
If I get hungry, I have lentil soup. It's getting harder and harder to pretend. Anyway, Sheldon, we now have to decide whether to run the xenon stream through a cryogenic cooler or a vacuum filter. State the weaknesses and strengths of each option for me. Well, if we run the xenon stream through a cryogenic cooler, it'll cool immediately before it becomes electrically conductive.
I'm gonna go to jail, and you know what happens to people like me, in jail they make me be somebody's tutor. You're not going to jail, but it's fun to think about it. You really can't remember anything? Give me your phone. Why? Well, it's--it might have tracked your route yesterday. Phones can do that?
We should have a fun day with the family. What's so important on your phone? I'm on the daycare website. Stop looking at them. Our preschool is great. It's on campus.
Mr. Ryder, when the Princess of the Crown speaks to you, every word she says is important. That press has got to be here somewhere, Flynn. Once again, I'm Eugene. There he is! And as soon as the tests are ready, he'll print the results on parchment.....
Let's be better than such politicians. Let's not start another Civil War. Some differences are too big to be put aside, Madam President. The post of Vice President. It's yours.
You know how to banish something bad, Earp or not? Lots of fire. Adhesive skin membrane. Traces of an exoskeleton. Whether he was putting on a new one or recently molted remains to be seen.
Her syringe? Yeah. It's not from the pharmacy. It's from the ambulance. my ambulance. You stole it? Look, uh. epinephrine is very expensive right now, and you need it all the time.
Because Michelle runs your life and tells you what to do and you just listen? She gets her way, but I would do anything to get that day back, Detective! Anything. Michelle, she knew about the epi, too, didn't she? Yeah, he's from our E.R.
No, no, no! - There's this weirdness in Waverly. - All the cutlery's gone. This perfect pool of glistening slime.... - It was calling to me.
Yes! That's what I thought. There's some kind of fuzzy pattern. I think I've seen this symbol before. It's on the Purgatory Volunteer Fire Department building at Third and Main.
No. I, uh. Needed something in town. Winona. When the demon got back inside me, it was different. He told me things.
We are criminals who have been banished from our world. We've heard that Aku accepts our kind. With great willingness. Your new home will be at coordinates 6-12-71. It's occupied.
Can you hold my flashlight for me? Are you sick or something? I feel, you know, itchy in my throat. I hope it's not something my kid's gonna catch. You know, they say that whooping cough. they say it's back.
Build them! Give me the code. or I'll execute them one by one. Give me the code. Your plan is wrong. It's based on us being stupid and cowardly.
Is Shepard planning to blow up Washington, D.C.? How? The satellite is supposed to drop the glider at supersonic speed. It can't be tracked, it can't be stopped, but it was only supposed to hit the White House. But now it's going to blow up Shepard's nuclear material, which is probably already somewhere in DC.
It's done. Glider's launched. What? How much do we have-- In 30 minutes, it'll hit the Capitol.
We need to get this van out of town to minimize casualties. We'll direct you to the least populated area. Maybe we can contain the decay products. There's a railroad tunnel that's out of service, just outside Washington. It'll limit the area of contamination so it doesn't get into the atmosphere.
You even returned a pool table that no one plays on. Wait, you liars! What's that beautiful couch doing here? The old couch didn't survive. In the sun, it turned to dust immediately.
Anyway, I could talk about my iron horse all day long. But we have work to do. Rose. Sarge, Scully and Hitchcock are out of control. They got in a fight over gravy, and now it's everywhere.
- Are you stressed? - Oh, yeah? You're kidding me now, right? My psoriasis, it's festering. It's moving through my body.
John, is it dangerous? Are we going to get the monkey virus? Can you smell it? That's the power, that's the smell. It leaves its odor!
It's too easy, even for you. What do you have to be afraid of, Winona? With the Peacekeeper on your side? So this little ritual will show me how to stop the Widows before they find the third seal? Oh, Ms. Earp. It'll show you a lot of things.
I'm so happy for her and Doc. That's your purse. Uh-huh. But that's my DNA test. I thought you said it wasn't here yet.
When you rise from Hell. As a demon. Peacemaker! I know that gun. It's what killed you.
A tail or something. А! I can't control it. I won't leave you. Can you-- Can you walk to the truck? It's right outside.
- I said... - Of course. Got it. The diplomat is silver, heavy. It's right here.
- Uh, sure. Got it. The diplomat is silver, heavy. He's here. I know he's here.
- Jeremy, relax. I'm about to shit my pants. - Not that much. - Diplomat! He belongs to the Earps.
- And the Peacemaker, too. - Okay. (chuckles) Okay? Okay. ! He's yours.
To single moms. You're a superhero. Same thing. Winona. This kid, who is he?
Oops. Look, whoever the father is, what's important is that this kid... There, I said baby. Still weird. He's Earp.
Should I drink your blood? Or do you have pockets full of silver, crosses, garlic and other superstitions? I had roasted garlic the other day. What, you shouldn't have? That's all I had.
Nothing. Louis, what's going on? Okay, Donna. I'm just gonna tell you one thing. Harvey asked me to handle something for him. It's personal. He trusted me.
Do you think Dad's fucking Mom now? I saw Dad naked in the bathroom once. But I didn't see his dick. Did you? Is it big?
Manage it by giving up control? There's no logic in that. Not everything has logic. Not everything has to be. Your intellect has taken you far, but it will take you no farther.
His disciples followed like sheep. They were seduced by false doctrine. And he stole the forbidden ritual? Yes. What was it for?
You're safe. It's all relative. But yes, I am. The cloak of levitation. It came to you.
But yes, I'm in one piece. The cloak of levitation. It came to you. Quite an achievement. He's fickle.
Come on, hurry up! - Hurry up! - It's an express! It's non-stop! It's coming!
Go down the stairs and get him out. Hey, stay where you are! Turn it off! Ghostbusters. It's great that you have a hobby, but I'm telling you, "While it may seem like a cool idea to flood the city with ghosts, we like the world the way it is."
- Well, uh. What did you do, Kevin? A lot of things. Just so you know, I went to the power supply and I pushed all the buttons. Everything got sucked into the portal and it closed.
You're three and a half hours late. Yay! Lunch! And don't worry about the weight. It'll go away after you stop feeding.
Meg, I'm not ready to be alone. I'm not. I don't know how to reboot my router. I don't even know where it is. I don't even know what it's for.
What? Otherwise the urine wouldn't go in there. No, that's not how it works. It's not a polaroid. I'm gonna be the best aunt in the world. I'll give the baby whatever he wants.
Yeah, I know. Who likes art and handiwork? Pass me the scotch, please. Uh, sure. We want the joints to be very tight. Otherwise it won't compress enough.
I don't kill women and children. I do. I was born with the Devil's gift. I hid it most of my life, but, uh. The older I got, the stronger it got.
I had a nightmare with Liam Neeson. Like I kidnapped his daughter and he wasn't going to stand for it. They made a whole trilogy. You start to think maybe he's just a bad father. Cancer isn't what it does to you, it's what it does to your loved ones.
You turned disasters into triumphs with your joyful, irrepressible, infectious lust for life. You've survived almost all of this pregnancy alone, despite crazy moms, oppressed men, and unfaithful boyfriends who don't deserve you. It's just a little bit more. Just a little bit more, my love, and you will see your beautiful baby boy. And if it's not yours?
I think unicorns are sexy, too. This happens to you all the time, doesn't it? Nope. It's just meaningless sex is just-- I'm not interested in him anymore, C.J.
First things first. What the-- What's what! Take my gun, Reactor, we're gonna have to shoot. - Come on, it won't bite.
We're leaving. The casket will be closed, right? At the funeral? We'll deal with all that later. I really want it closed, Bobby.
And when he looked at the president's automobile... Mrs. Kennedy. Go on. I had to get to you, get between you, the President and the shooter. Who was he?
You think you're in control, that you're the puppeteer of the world! And you're ridiculous. And I believed it all. And this parade? Who is it really for?
- Kill him! Dad! He's breathing. Call the paramedics! Is he dead?
It's talking about intergalactic warfare. It concerns the entire universe. And this one? Something about an enemy. It must be destroyed before it reaches us.
- Yes, that's me. - I'm Commissioner Gonzalez, Madrid Judicial Police. My assistant, Inspector Bermejo. Nice house. - It's not mine.
Well, I know who you are, and-- Nadine. Do you want to know what I did this weekend? Uh, sure. - Oh, my God, Shannon, your outfit, it's so cute!
Once they reach the capital, nothing can stop them. It's a two-day gallop to the capital. We can't catch them. The wind is strong now. It will blow from the north all day tomorrow.
I lent it to that kid who got crushed. Now my pants won't hold up. Well, I don't have your belt. Yes, I know, ma'am. It's still there.
I don't even... MB, you're an analyst at the Treasury Department. What did you get yourself into? What did you have to bang a steel thermos against to crumple it? It's just old.
He saw us! That was fun! What's in that suitcase? Wow! It opened!
No! It didn't work. Did Oogway teach you that trick? That's a shame. It only works on mortals.
Oh, look how cute the calanos are. I want one! Oh! Oh, Bailey! I see the truck. It's over there.
Any living relatives? No. My sister died in the earthquake. Mom and dad were killed by a virus. But it didn't kill you, did it?
That's great. Come on. Where's the gun? Where's the gun? Where is it?
You were bleeding on the highway. I brought you home. Where's my gun? I had a gun when you found me. Where is it?
It's the same technology as the detector in the lab. We've improved it. Made it mobile. The idea is that our soldiers should be able to instantly distinguish friend from foe. You look at the enemy through this thing, and it lights up green.
But I'll make it up to you with some very expensive and delicious champagne. Wow! What a gun. By the way, you must try this sauce. It's marvelous.
- Miss this? No way. For you. A hunting horn. From the ram that took down ten gods slower than me. It's beautiful.
Okay. I guess this class is over. Now we're just asking everyone to comply while the authorities investigate the site. Are you saying it's not our object? Is it of Earth origin or not?
How do they communicate with each other? In this question, Louise beat us all to the punch. The first breakthrough came when she realized that there is no correlation between what a heptapod says and what it writes. Unlike all human languages, their language is semasiographic. It conveys meaning without representing sounds.
So, Anna. This is where your story begins. The day they left. Are you okay? Even though I know the whole path and where it leads,
If he can avoid meeting you, humanity will fall in minutes. He must be intercepted. And find a way to the surface. Done. Once the antidote is in the atmosphere, it will kill anyone infected with the T-virus.
I want to get out of the house. So you've never seen a sunrise? No. Did you like it? What color was it?
She does such a great job with the wipe. He's a fun guy. I like him. So, we can go to the Shakespeare festival. It's tonight and tomorrow.
- It's non-negotiable. - ...neighborhood tradition. Bed in the couch. Interesting. It's old, but it's comfortable, so .
I had to hold a conversation with a stranger for 30 minutes..... - Okay. - ...and show them how to be a good hostess. Next week, they'll probably be arranging marriages. Tell you what, I'm gonna design a new special badge for the Dandelions. It's gonna be really big so everyone can see it.
And fugu fish for the lady. - Thank you, Ping. - Fugu? The infamous puffer fish. Improperly cooked, it leads to paralysis or even death.
A dragon? Jack, you called me here for a dragon? I don't know how to explain it, but he's telling the truth. He was here. He's still inside.
I'm almost a teenager. Come on, we're only young once. So, how's it going with your list? I asked, uh. I offered the seller another $20,000 down on the house, but I don't know if he'll budge.
Wow. I come in in the morning and ask, "How's the hedging going? Are you hedging? Have you hedged a lot?" It's very large, so we have patronage.
Jericho's calm. It's okay. My head... I just gave you a shot. It'll take effect in a minute.
I visited my mother in the hospital And... I saw an angel. Si. I was, uh. Even a little nightstand, And gently stroked his face, And then he stopped.
So, crying that the oil companies don't want the land? Who's crying? I don't want their money! They're destroying our town. Like you remember what it used to be like.
- Do you mind if we take a look? - Actually, I do mind. It's private property, you can't go in there. But, uh, okay. If that's what you want. I'll make an exception for you. You know, that coyote I saw, I mean, I heard he was at the other end of the dump, I'm sure.
I missed them, too. They're family. He was looking for his parents. I found the truck. It's not moving.
Dad got the best gift ever. Can these things happen? I think it's up to you, Cody. You have an amazing gift. Who knows what might happen as it grows?
Good, good, that'll help! There's something else the Agency called, the left engine is still running Not possible, I felt it go. It was as it stopped in mid-air.
There's something else Agency called, left engine still running Not possible, I felt it go. It was as it stopped in mid-air. They said there was a chance it was south of idle.
It's my dad, it's an emergency. He's supposed to be on this flight. Okay, everyone's saying the same thing. Golf emergency. He canceled?
It was just a dream. No, it felt real. I know. Your mind is more powerful than anything I know. It can convince itself.
Stop the asteroid? The last two asteroids hit the earth in the same place. And it's about to happen again. We need to go there and find out what's attracting the asteroid. Once we know why it's going there, we'll figure out how to send it somewhere else.
Once we find out why he's going there, we'll figure out how to send him somewhere else. This plan is really stupid. Too bad he doesn't have a face to punch. Let's figure this out. Instead of running away from a deadly asteroid, you want us to run toward it? I know that doesn't sound optimal, but the good news is that it will kill us wherever we go.
It's just, uh. I can't leave. How can I leave? I don't want to leave you. Hey, shaggy, remember the first time we played hockey? You were too scared to go out on the ice because it was slippery.
Good morning, Ms. Crawley! Morning, everybody! I made you some coffee. Yes? Where is it?
I'm so sorry! I just-- No, no, no, no, wait! Has anyone seen my glass eye? It's right here, Ms. Crawley, I have it.
No. There's nothing in the world like flying in your own airplane with a girl waiting for you in New Jersey. Airplanes turn people on in the same way that sporting events do. But what really gets them excited, what they really crave, is to see you dive down, your Stearman folding up like a paper airplane, and the rescuers on the ground pulling you out of the cockpit like a rag doll, fast, before it explodes and bursts into flames.
I thought it was a dream. No! Our ancestors believed Maui was under their hook. Swim to the hook, and you'll find him. But why did he choose me?
Makes sense. You're about eight years old. You don't know how to drive a boat. It's an obvious choice. He chose me for a reason.
You're about eight years old. You don't know how to drive a boat. The choice is obvious. He chose me for a reason. If the ocean is so smart, why didn't it return Te Fiti's heart?
Happy sadness. Shit, I gotta go. Dinner only lasts 30 minutes. How do you like the house you live in? It's nice.
They're still coming. - I'll give it to you next week. - All right. Uh-huh. Yeah, the local air takes some getting used to. It's pretty contaminated with fecal matter.
Demitr? My parents were Bulgarian. When they passed away, he stayed on the farm. I got it. So, uh. I still can't make sense of your story. Well, yeah, it's complicated.
Isn't he going to die? - Come on, don't let them work. - Keep breathing. I'm Inspector Jimmy Perez. There's a lot of trash being dumped on the beach here, and I need to know where it's coming from.
Could you be more specific? Well, he brought me a deer from Aberdeen. It was hit by, uh. by a car. Why do you want the deer? It's badly mangled, isn't it?
My name is Sophie. Well, jump, Sophie. This is where all my dreams come from. Wow. When a dream whistles past, it's so soft that it makes a subtle buzzing sound like music.
It's on the back of your elbow! No, it's not! The other one! Now it's on your leg! The other one! It's on your butt!
It's an evil nightmare. What are you gonna do to him? I'm shutting them down, those nasty little beasts. What does the bad dream say? It says:
While you're here, can you go over there and get the radio? It's over there, from the bag. Can you get it for me, please? Please get me the radio. It's over there.

Water is a guide. Celine. Praise the day...when it's over. Praise the ice... when it's hard. Praise the sword when it kills
Will you play with him for a while? Nice pickup. What's so funny? You're sitting there stroking my dick and talking about my pickup. Well, it's really good.
Let me help you. I'm curious. - What? Well, the blackmail note. When I hold it up to the magnifying glass, the font gets a lot bigger, but when I take it away, it goes right back to small.
Guddu! Mom, I love you so much Guddu, I miss you so much Attention! The train on the second platform is a scrapped train. It's not taking passengers.
It's just so hard not to think about you. Thinking about where you are, my little star. Seo, the key element is the reactor module. That's where I set my trap. It's well-hidden and unstable.
Master switch? Describe it. What are we looking for? What does it look like? The master switch. Where is it?
Hong Kong Wednesday, June 5, 2013. Janine, how are the negotiations with the White House going? I let them know we have a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) court warrant. They wanted to see it, we refused. I pray we do have it.
Why haven't you seen my movie? - Bye. - Let's go see it. - Have a good night. - Come on, it's still on.
Thank you. I think so, too. Why did you just throw iced coffee at me? I picked it up in the hallway. I thought it was hot.
Short kid, long hair. I think they went that way. Hey, Chet? Chet? Emilia's movie, where is it?
Hey, Chet? Chet? Emilia's movie, where is it? The movie is in the projector. Repeat, it's in the projector.
-I have an idea. [Gena] Assuming that Filatov had his cell phone with him and it was turned on, he may have registered in the base stations closest to SIS. -So what? -Knowing the numbers of employees, as well as visitors who were in the building at the time, we can calculate Filatov's phone number by the method of elimination. [Gena] Well. If it's still there.
-Yes. -Thank you, you're free to go. -Open the trunk. -Why? I need you to help me get something. It's empty.
Well? I don't know, maybe I'm imagining things, but the day Katya disappeared, there was a minibus driving around. [What kind of van? I couldn't see the make or color, it was dark. I tried to get closer, but it sped off and drove off.
We have the best seats, anyone would be happy to be here. We saved the city. We should be on the screen, not inside it. Ladies and gentlemen! A year ago, darkness enveloped our city. Suddenly it was in the hands of the notorious criminal Shredder.
Why am I here? Because you and your buddy Stockman found something that belongs to me. A teleportation device. The teleporter was supposed to get me out of prison. It can do so much more than that.
And your help. You'll be fine. You got it. While Jamie inspected the cargo at the harbor, I decided to take a walk. I was preparing myself for a bout of morning sickness, and though the air on the dock was hardly fresh, it was still better than the air near our temporary home.
Stop it. You know that. - Oh, my God. - Can we talk about the helmet? It's really heavy, and it's giving me back pain.
Are you okay? Rebecca? Unbelievable. I don't understand what's wrong with the code. It should be working.
This kind of thing doesn't happen in an apartment. You had nothing to do with it. You used my code. Your code? It's not yours.
I almost succeeded in getting, uh. a positive result. They were almost stable. Eric! Hydrogen! If the samples are dead, it must be neutral.
- I'm looking for my ship. This is Anubis. It's all over the scoreboard. - I already did. It's here.
- "Є бобок. SL€t, get in the car. I can't do your bidding until you open the door. "Shut up. It's not going to die tomorrow, but ƒjo said it's going to get worse and worse as time goes on.
Nice phone. No, no, no, no, no. It's just a picture of a girl on a phone. What? Where'd it go?
even I don't want to talk to myself. - At the end of the day. What? Yeah, that's what I wanted to tell you about, Hank. There's a giant raccoon, and it's eating our food.
This is the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. Let us all here swear allegiance and pledge allegiance to our new state. - Our flag is up. - Our flag is raised. - And it will never be lowered.
Let us all here pledge our allegiance and pledge allegiance to our new nation. - Our flag is up. - Our flag is raised. - And it will never be lowered. - And it shall never be lowered.
- Evacuate the people. - You can't transport the wounded. - We need to get her out of here. - There's an emergency exit. Where does it go?
We couldn't have saved him. And leave him alone? In the cold, shivering and probably in pain? His mother's anesthesia is still in his system. He won't suffer.
And to be left alone? In the cold, shivering and possibly in pain? His mother's anesthesia is still in his system. He won't suffer. But he can't live either.
In the cold, shivering and possibly in pain? His mother's anesthesia is still in his system. He won't suffer. But he can't live either. But he lives now.
When can I see my baby? Ruby. I'm very, uh. I'm very sorry. But your baby was born so hopelessly sick. And there was no way to save him. Did he die?
Step into the hallway. Please come in, Mrs. Dawley. Can you manage, my dear? Tonight if you can, Mr. Dawley. I've heard that a baby shouldn't sleep on its back if it's ill, and it got me thinking, what could make it ill?
Roseanna? He was born. He's not moving. Is the baby breathing? Why isn't it moving?
He promises you the whole world, and you get a little shop on Crisp Street. I mean, he tried, but you can't run a store on good intentions, can you? Doesn't he know that this store is all you have? It's not all I have, Mrs. Cadman. But it's mine.
She did everything she could to feed me, to keep me fed, to keep me clothed. I didn't see how it broke her. But I wish, oh, how I wish she were here so I could hold her, tell her she was good, and strong, and the bravest woman I've ever known. Shame keeps us imprisoned if we let it. And it separates us from those we love and those who love us.
- Good morning! Good morning, Master Turner. You look elegant. New jacket? Yes, though unfortunately it's still purple.
