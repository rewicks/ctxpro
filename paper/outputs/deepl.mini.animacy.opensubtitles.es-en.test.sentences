So I never paid for it.
But the idiot owner won't rent it to me without a co-signer.
- It is no longer there, but I saw it.
I wonder what my life would be like if I had seen it.
So I need it.

You lay a hand on me and it will be the last time you see it.
Because I remember telling them to send me a tape of their audition because I wanted it for their presentation tape, okay?

How did you get it?
The others are negotiating it.
I trust you will do well.
I couldn't take the list, but I borrowed it long enough to punch a few holes.
I have earned it.
And if Langdon didn't do it, then who did?

I have to say that when Olivia disappeared and Kevin decided to self-finance this play, against the girl who wrote it, I said to myself, "Ron, you old dog, you've won three Tony Awards and here you are,

We will leave it.

You know, when a tray breaks, you don't fix it.
I've seen it on TV, with nougat and chocolate and that crunchy wafer.

It's the last one and we need it for Liv. Do you have it with you?
That flatbed truck up front, who's driving it?
When did you receive it?
We finished it earlier.
I came to see who would get it back.
Your presence in her life has made her what she is today.
Marlin, your boss made me an election promise and I intend to make sure he keeps it.
I don't think he gave it to her.
I think he sold it to her.
But I actually paid for it.
We got to the house, and she checked it out, because she's smart.
I opened it, read it and then threw it away.
Anyway, I clearly didn't want it...so I waited for it to go away and dug it up.
If there was a clue, I would have seen it.
I'm not saying the conversation won't be difficult, but if they don't have it...it will be hung up on.

I haven't used it since college, but fine.
They take it all so seriously.
No, he put it.
The fact is, I didn't have the sword and Dad destroyed it shortly thereafter, so....
So if we could just get your brother to stop drinking and show us where he hid it?
I put it in a place where I could keep an eye on it.
I thought that Father destroyed it during my rebellion so that I could not use it against Him.
Father said he destroyed it.
He apparently hid it in plain sight.
Everyone saw it.
So, you're saying he only broke it into two pieces? Azrael's sword...
Of course he gave it to you.
I entrust it... to you, brother.
When you first saw my wound.... you asked if Lucifer had done it.
You go get Mama, she'll listen to you. But, Luci, don't you dare promise her the piece, because I won't give it to her.

And in this one... he answers it for me.

I had never seen it before.
What inner power allows you to give your life to preserve your land and the lives of the families who work it?
And you take it to him.

But how do we keep it here?

Because you don't know if he has it or where to get it.
Our only chance of getting the witness list back is for The Harem to steal it and I have to be there.
The protected witness list, when we get it back, I can put you on it.
She was taken by Emma.
Yes, because London urine is like sparkling water, - you drink it and piss it away as it is. - Something like that, yeah.

But it gave me hope when I needed it most and that is just as important.

"I'll put it in the basement."
It looked so good that I almost shared it with her.
Big Hands sure messed up by pawing my gutters.
But I have fixed it.
I know you think I'm some kind of hero who built a time bomb and planted it on Gavin Belson, to take him down in retaliation for his wrongdoing.
If I had given it to you, you would have left without looking back.
I think someone has taken it.
Or that someone else kept it for you.
I didn't take it!
Did Decker get it in the divorce?
I need you to show it to me.
I won it!

Hey, do you think your dad got pissed off because you took his car or because you took it to be with me?
And if someone finds it...
And I can't ask any of these guys to do that, because they know her and they know her fucking husband and they'll recognize her phone because it looks like it belongs to fucking Liberace.

Look, Aubrey, I'm not saying Zack didn't do it.
Dr. Faulk warned us that someone would meddle in the case and manipulate it.
He said he would discuss it with her.
We talked about it.
And I think they were putting it up there on the seismograph.
And then they would call him in an intermittent mode for three nights to distort the readings on the extremely sensitive devices and that led Stephen to think it was worrisome.
I guess he was using it to test some kind of soil.
And he used it to coerce her into joining the plan.
If it wasn't necessary before the fact, it clearly was after the fact.
And he told me to ask for your autograph... to sell it on the Internet.

I mean, I literally can't get it out of my head.
You still feel it, don't you?
So why does he keep putting it off?
I was one final exam short and A.D. did it for me.
Do you have any idea who sent it or why?

He is saying that the two of them planned it.
I didn't even know it.
That he would not.
I had to protect you, protect our family. I picked up your phone at the store and took it to Andrew Nelson, my friend in the IT department.
You won't find it where you're going and he's not going to get it while you're watching.
I took it off on the way there to keep it safe, because I didn't want it stolen, and when I looked for it on the way back, it was gone.
They offered it to me on the spot!

I don't hate it.
- Yes, I put it in your agenda.
We had already discussed this.

She's pissed because I... didn't refill the car the last time I used it.
- and I took it.
And Oliver took it.
Which of your men did it?
The question is: who sent it to Pike?
This report. And he says he signed it, even though he knew it was false and passed it on to the police.
Well, since I'm the mayor, I'll call it off.
Maybe you can take us to the place where you bought it.
Now, when you look at it, you will think about our time together and the secret you confessed to me.
Others accept it, even enjoy it, like you.
And I really appreciate it.
If he feels it, and Drago feels it, it must be true.
He left it there for us to find.

And who knows what we would become if we didn't have it?
And who knows what we would become if we didn't have it?
Won't it fry it even more?
Cisco, we found it.
I gave him a necklace and he gave it back to me.

I thought I had left him...
- Ida wanted it for you.

And that's okay, because we leave the world better than we found it, you know.
? What if Cass used it on Kelly's baby?
Joshua has tracked it to a nearby house.

We'll take it.
I'll get it back to you later tonight, okay?

He got it from you!
- Look, everyone has it!

There is a link, she explained it to me.
- Who manages it now?
I have had it for a long time.
It was given to me as a gift by Richard.
There is a second bracelet and I know the woman who wears it.
- I will not allow it to do so.
We would have seen him receive a message.
Well, I'm intrigued that he doesn't know the meaning of his last name given that he chose it.

We will put it in your name.

I'll take it to Hennessey and see if he can come up with something.
We will download it here.
I will take it to work to try to open it there.
Because my sister showed it to me.
As soon as I heard it I recognized the similarities.
Occupation found out.
I will take good care of it.
Who else knew Hennessey had it?
That's right, I bought a suit, photocopied it, returned it and used the copy.
Well, I hope you didn't sell it to a clown.
I did not say I paid for it.
We are not sure what causes it.
Well, there were burn marks on the cement where we found him.
Well, what would you call it?
Money is good, Martin, but I don't need it.
I found it under a hedge, near the forest, by the Americans' hut.

If he leaves it, he dies.
I don't want you to let go.

I pulled a man's penis out of his pants and... and looked at it.

An Anton says he has it.
But if we get a clean shot, we will.
Did you take it from the kitchen - and take it straight to the cell?
As for love, if that's what you're looking for, I suggest you look elsewhere.
But, uh... I still don't get it.
Los Miller does not.
We'll find him.
Seriously, I thought I had it.
And I'm afraid that if you don't take it, ...you may die.
I don't know why I asked for it.
But when it arrived, I tried it on, and....
He touched Nick's abdomen and felt it.
Besides, that man would want Dustin to have it.
You can't explain it.
Let's hope Director Mace has it.
I give you the benefit of my experience, and you ignore it.
And I love to make others feel it as it has always been done.
They have great power, but they have not earned it.
I've seen it. I've seen him do it!
- I said don't touch it!

We bought it on Craigslist.
There is real coffee, can you smell it?
Put it on and in your first free case, you will represent yourself after I shove it up your ass.

We put the carcass in the car, in a bag, and put it in the freezer for you to eat.
We don't touch the car, so we leave it there, understood?

I have licked it and it is not caramel.
He then passes it through the tunnels to the Badlands to the black market.

That's great, but how will you get it?
I want to see it with my own eyes.
He would make it and take it to bed.
And then get them a new mommy to walk it.
That's why I took it.

Someone told me that if you have it at home you get gas from the stove and I think that is dangerous.
I don't think so.
The accent in the message, you deciphered it.
Milord me dio.
Sooner or later, the bank will appropriate it.
He never pawned it simply because I took it from him.
He searches for a witness unsupervised, against protocol, doesn't even search him and has time to get to Genghis Connie's before anyone else.
Aisha's ring. Do you have it?
Maybe that's why they call it "in other times".
The question is how much you want it.
- You're doing it for Ian, so....
But it is more than obvious that they don't need it.
I collected it, I gave you half.
I don't have it yet.
I put everything I had on that disc, and then they totally scrapped it.
And I considered it a payment for all the work I did.
Baby, I saw how they do it.
Don't say it, bitch.
Because that's what I smell.
You took Key Flo's money and I need it.
When the fat man came, I would take the boat out to the street and wash it.
He assigned it to me and doesn't want the firm to waste time on it so I'm looking for outside help.
His parents do not have it.
- He took it to sleep, didn't he?
He pays for others to do so.
I mean... half of us build the world, half of us destroy it.
Why didn't you repair it?
You put it in the deck.
We no longer have it.
She says, she was going to ask you to fix it anyway.
Yes, I have seen it from my house.
We call it El Yonk.
- You missed it.
I'm sorry, I'll pay you back soon.
I suggest you burn this document and forget all about it.
- I didn't even know he kept a diary. - Haven't you read it?
How will Clyde handle it if you won't be around by then?
You mean you did it?
But if you have, you know, an albino crocodile, I get it.
And it makes people who wear it beautiful.
You still do.
What do you call it... canguptor?
You know we won't figure it out until you do.
At best Nafan still has it.
And I'll carry it on my back in an old sack or something!
Do you think the world stops when you leave it behind?
And it will continue to do so until your contract with the Sze Yup.
But then, how do you explain it?
I want to help you... I really do, but I've been at this job for 2 weeks and I need it.
I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't think it was worth the risk.
If we put it here... its power will enter the liquids and protect you from the inside.
I miss it so much when I don't hear it.
I played that game at Princeton, and I played it again at Harvard.
I think Bernadette said it, about you finally dating a sister.

Sorry, I was a little busy, I'll send it to you.

He may not always carry it with him, but if he has been, he doesn't seem to have gone beyond the prison in Boston in the last two weeks.
No, I'm sure I left it on my desk when I got back from prison.
Yes, he should have parked it and walked back, so we wouldn't see it here.
I was so enraptured by her, I never would have dreamed that on June 4, 2004, at 3:26 pm, she would grab my heart, throw it into a backpack, throw it into a van and drive off with it.
Do you think they will give it to you?
I will order it tomorrow.
You deserve it.
Why didn't you mention it before?
I used whatever resources I had. And I would have lost everything if I hadn't believed in him.
Maybe I opened it.
Which, of course, became a problem after they broke up, because O.J. knew she needed him all the time.
- find it?
I walked up to him and looked at him.
I did not touch it.
Detective, did you take a glove from the scene at Bundy's and then clean it inside the Bronco?
Didn't you put this in a plastic bag, then put it in your sock?
And then placed it in Mr. Simpson's house, so it could be found?
They'll never get into him! I think we should let him try in court.
And the Defense has turned it into a circus.
When I had my first rape case, what had happened to me, of course, came flying out of whatever rock I had hidden it in and....

We will leave the world better than we found it.
Your power may be growing, but be careful how you use it.
But do you know why I want it?
what if the person who killed him took him?

Didn't you enjoy it?
You don't need it.
When I ask you for the car, you give it to me.
Yes, I've seen it too.
In order to lift the body, I need you to recognize it.
I remember it well.
And trust me, you will remember.
I need it now, Phiona.
Se lo di al de la motocicleta.
If his people think he has it, he will break the coalition and start a war.
She deserved it, Mom.
Suddenly I saw a dog and it was eating it.
My mother stole it from a house she was cleaning in 1901... No, no.
I wouldn't wear it for the world.
I wouldn't wear it for the world.
But I have treated him with respect and the leftover meat will go to the poor.
I put it on.
And now I'm paying for it.
I think I love it.
Why do you need it?
Thomas Wayne cancelled it, along with other strange programs.
Then I will be able to fill it in.
You saw a problem and you solved it.
You stole it.
You think that if you solve it, you will be able to close the door on the past.
He goes crazy when he doesn't get it, so I give it to him.
You pulled it out first, didn't you?
How do we close it?
How did you find out I wanted it?
You have 48 hours to do it or I take your sperm and throw it in the river.
I'll take it!
I liked the hug even if you used it to threaten me.
I assigned it to you this morning.
We need a new plan and we need it now.
I saved it all when I became Paul Sneed.
I thought about it before you did.
They solved it first.
Look, the funeral is about to end, basically, we made it.
- I just sent you a message, have you seen it?
- Have you seen it?
I swung my weight around and pulled it back.
We gave the dog away because you weren't taking care of it.
I passed it on to the CIB.
I need this dog to have some grease on it, so when I eat it the grease will lubricate the throat.
We can't take it anymore. We can't sleep. You've been here for three months.
I told him we were taking him, but not where.
He learned it.
If you have a breakdown and don't repair it, your car's gas mileage is going to drop, and over time, it's going to cost you a lot more.
I delivered it in a suitcase.
When did you send it?
- Yes, I will get it.
No, no, no, no, I'll get it.
When the priest asks for the ring, just give it to me, okay?
- Did you write it or Footit?
and they put it in a car and went to... to the actresses... and the bear escaped.
He still has it.
You have to experience it yourself, it's like being with a woman for the first time.
It's a beautiful moment and they ruined it.
It was given to someone else.
Every day I make Justin a sandwich and the kids tear it up.
We gave them work, and they threw it in our face.
But you said the problem was seventh period and I fixed that.
We will put it further in.
The damn glass didn't break because I let go.
Or give me the name and I'll do it for you.
Yes, I'll bring it to you when it's ready, okay?
My cat is lost. Have you seen it?
Choking is scary because it's so personal, because you have to look them in the eye while you're doing it.
Maybe he has already been killed.
A couple of days out of date is fine, as long as you cook it well.
Big time.
I don't know how many times I've made chicken and potatoes.
Soak it in boiling water three times.
You remove it and then cook it, depending on the size of the octopus, about half an hour, right?
I was told to give it to you in secret. Is it serious?
I was told to give it to you secretly, is it serious?
I'd like you to... well... for someone to have it, but I won't be able to give it to them in person, I'm afraid.
It is unbelievable, you are living a historic moment and you do not even appreciate it.
The other day a soldier, Rafael Rios, passed away, and on his deathbed... I promised him that I would.
Don Salvador took this phone out a few months ago and has not returned it.
You look repellent in that apron and... you've worn it too long.
Where did you get it?
No, I would have savored it.
No, I just lent it to you.
In that case, I don't want it.
You got it.
You know, they embellish an old story and they give it to the natives. And you get it as true.
Maybe I'll buy him one that comes with a joystick, so he can shove it up his fucking ass.
Who authorized it?
They would have turned it off after she calls.
Or someone took it.
They call it a suicide, but they both know it's not.
Who carries it out.
Nash planned the murder of her husband, and she and her accomplices carried it out.
Does it ever succeed?
Retiro lo dicho, Raymond.
We just wanted to see the country before you destroyed it.
Mom brought it to me from Vienna.
Since I had no address of my own, I would send him to his apartment.
- Have you seen it before?
So every time I was offered a paid aspect, I took it.
I sat down and read it through that night.
I gave you a job when you needed one, and now you're screwing me?
We appreciate it, partner.
He would not accept it, if not us.
- If I'm lucky... you'll know soon enough.
Colossus will explain everything.
I never transferred it.
-I do deserve it!
-It means you earned it.
I'll cut off your dick and pour it in my champagne.
Nick wrote it, so you'll like it.
I was reading, and I put my bag down, and he so considerately gave it back to me.
Sergeant Pete will bring him in.
As long as it doesn't kill innocent people, I won't use it anymore.
Uncle George bought it for me.
Look for year-round.
He was found last night at the bus stop.
We appreciate it.
Do you know who leaked it?
The only way the delay will be approved is if you ask for it yourself.
If they read it, which they won't.
I heard about a job posting, so I'm putting it out there.
Did you leave it upstairs?
You gave it to me. What's the problem?
No, he did send it.
- I really appreciate it.
You videotaped us having sex and used it against me.
Because... I didn't write it.
So you did write it.
I wrote it down.
Jamal gave it to us.
- How can you look at it like that, brother?
This crayon, I still don't get it, but it's authentic.
And then we sell it to Asheton.
If we pull it by nightfall, he pays us.
If the police find it, they will lock us up even if we haven't done anything.
He said to put it in the brush little by little.
You will draw up the contract and I will sign it, but we want to be in Marrakesh.

This space is what you've been looking for, and someone will take it if you don't act fast.
Do you remember? He asked me to take care of him.

Give it to her?

Now Jade wants to tweet about it to get picked up by blogs, is that okay?
Gawker even picked it up.
- Would you send it to him?
I mean, he didn't write it.
Please, I'm not for the wild.
I know you go through it because you are afraid.
I can't stand it!
I did not give it to him.
When you feel a knot... you take a deep breath and look at it face to face without fear or judgment.
Instead of doing it through the bank, right, so...we would...we would pay it off quickly...because we're both really good at what we do...and we just want to avoid all the interest...you know, and the bank foreclosures...or whatever, the fate of the...bank foreclosures or whatever.
We would return it, of course!
Then we will not take it.
One day we took him to the park.
Until, in the end, he took it.
It tore him to pieces.
Nadie me lo dio.
Because your case is so bad that no one else will take it.
Where the hell do I hide it?
The morning barge took him away.

People always need it.
I took it in an emergency situation.
- Do you want me to massage it?
- I thought you bought it.
Are you going to give it to your dad?
Yes, but it's hard to describe, if you haven't experienced it.
- Do you know it?
The Versailles of Northwest Arkansas is what I call it.

Mom bought it.
On Sunday mornings, I washed it.
I washed it from top to bottom.
He put it.
It took me a vow to keep you from flying, and I will very well do it!
You can take more time if you need to.
Yes, but when you guys screw it up, then I'll fix it.
Seriously. It's like if you took a huge peach... and a huge wig... and put the wig over the peach, and combed it the same way.
I will.
I can't do it forever, so if there's even the remotest chance of making that impossible fucking dream come true, I'll try.

I'm thinking maybe I left it at home.
I don't think I even brought it, because I want to disconnect.
If you ever had a sweet treat, I did in my kitchen.
Why don't you hold it and move?
I need my supermagic scarf, but Aunt Stephanie took it.
I wasn't touching it, I was cleaning it.
If it doesn't work, I won't pay for it.
Why do you want it so badly?
I don't know what game this is, but we didn't play it today.
He hates it.
I went out, bought a handicapped placard, and put it at the entrance.
"If it's heavy, I don't take it.
I will use it tomorrow.
- Where did you buy it?
So in the end, no one uses it.
So don't touch it.
It is poisonous and deadly so don't touch it.
No one has heard it.
No, Abbie, we started this journey together, and we will finish it together.
People who have it spend it.
People who don't have it like the bills that are spent on other people better.
That's why they leaked it.
I don't need you to see it.
Well, you can call it whatever you want, but I call it "care."
I hope you only sent it to me.
They would have covered it up and no one would have known.
Couldn't you let someone else handle it?
When you get it, give it to Hakeem, and... I'm going to give you ten million dollars.

Carrick has done this kind of thing before, in Ecuador, so it's more than easy to assume he did it here.

What if I said I introduced a little extra into the system before you shut it down for good?
Do you want me to read it to you?
Well, we sell it.
I deserve it.
I give you a gift, and you waste it!
How do I show you that I have it?
Yes, Abel brought it.
And you will leave a note to be sent to Mandy.
Soon you won't remember it anymore.
I didn't understand it, but I felt it inside.
He took the feeling inside him and channeled it into this mission.

One of us will make it.
I don't think she wants him to have it.

When I hear it, it disappears.
You can't see it.

So I drugged him, it calms him down a bit.
Oh, you are using it some.
Because mom gave it to me in first grade.
- I wouldn't call it a fiasco.
Did anyone put it on afterwards?
It's just... You just get it.
And they have forms for everything. You fill it out, it goes to the top, and they make you fill out a new form, just to confirm that it was you who filled out the first form.
I haven't dug it yet. Oh!
And you'll blow it if you don't follow through.

We will have it soon.
When I receive it, I promise you, you will have the biggest, best and brightest dress in the world.

And when you give it to us.
That park was stolen from you and me, and I want it back!
But I don't want it. Don't you understand?
Do you want it?

Yes, but we skip the part about when we talk about when and how we will use it.
I'm just... I'm thinking about it for a moment.
I got it when I turned 25.
Don't rub it in.

And you took it because you were at home.
Your father saw it today... the place where Adam was locked up.

Please, I borrowed it.
Where did you get it?
- Can I borrow it?
