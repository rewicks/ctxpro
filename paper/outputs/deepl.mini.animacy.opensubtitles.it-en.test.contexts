It's a life's work, you know. Of course, Szymon, yes. We can put it in the basement: it's as dry as a dungeon, And no one will find it.
- It's a great coin. - And beautiful. I show it to you. I'll go and get it. Maybe after dinner. I'll get it later.
To begin with--modern civilization is a scam. A sad, useless farce made of lies. You have to have the courage to do it your way. Happiness is hard to find. You certainly won't find it in some stupid contraption.
They are usually more polite, okay? More spacious, they can hold more passengers. But talking about pussy, I think there are pros and cons. I mean, a nice pussy. Although you wouldn't trade it for a Benz.
But I think we'll be able to come down in price a little bit. No, stop. Is that how you bring lobster? I'm sorry, sir. Why don't you bring it back, take the claws off, open it up.
'We need her underwear and nightgowns.' Who said that? Federal marshals. What do they need your underwear for? They're going to sell it, auction it off.
(RUGGITO) But they had not considered the sword. Merlin stole the scepter. So he forged the Great Sword, Excalibur, and destroyed the ancient tower. The sword was then given to the Lady of the Lake, who bound it to the Pendragon lineage.
Even worse, the whole world now knows that I am vulnerable. I'm sorry. Yes... I know you're sorry. Cut out his tongue -- he doesn't have to use it anymore.
So, listen -- my family... well, has a lot of friends, so there is no place you can go that we won't be able to find out. That's why I'm giving you an hour.... You can keep the box. I want you to keep it so I can remind you what happens to people who think they are smarter than me.
Curse. 'That's true enough, Mr. Doyle. If you had humiliated yourself a little more, it wouldn't come back naked. - At least I have my dignity. - Is that what you call it?
I need to take the tank off, though. Wait, what? But is it safe? It's going to be fine. You can hand it to me when I'm done.
Life will be better. The seizure of church property has not yielded as we hoped. Despite the repression, collectivization remains slow. I've already started sending the leaders of the landowners to Siberia, but resistance is strong and widespread. If we don't stop it, we may lose Ukraine.
Do you agree with it? - But I made it for you.... - Oh. Great soup! I love the combination of the gummy bears with the meat. I keep it in my mouth because it's so good, I don't want to swallow it.
You can use whatever you want, as long as you give it back to me. This is Dr. Greiss, known for his famous conflict therapies. Yes yes! Oh, do you want to see my favorite thing? Doctor, your critics have been extremely controversial about this radical of yours, what do you call it?
- Mycroft? He's all right. I guess you have to go. Won't see you for a week? I'll spend it at home.
And when I go in, they just happen to have it. It's pure magic. And when I walk past the Double R, I say to myself. "Oh, I wonder if they have a slice of cherry pie for me." And when I walk in, rest assured, you find it.
I liked it. Very much. I liked it as well. You know, this robe of yours of... I don't know, bravado, that you put on. I know why you put it on.
Another reason to leave this city as soon as possible. We're not going anywhere. Not yet. Danny, the way will not stay open forever. If we lose it, it will be years before we can return.
I've been looking forward to seeing you. - I hear you a little anxious, Danny Rand. - I need some information. Why should I give it to you? Because otherwise I'm going to cut your head off and feed it to the rats.
Go. - It's ready. - Yes, I can see that. The change for the mail? Yes, in fact why don't you... why don't you leave it with me, Wellington, I'll take it on the way.
Have you lost your senses? I'm 25 years old. I do what I want to do. Put it on. There is only one thing I want. But I'm not going to ask for it.
I'll tell you how to do it. Take the air gun for protection. No, thank you. - We're good. - Take the flashlight. But if you want to use it, you have to do it the right way, if you take it from the top, it's not just a flashlight.
- I'm getting messed up. I'm stepping in now. We are raven fanatics, who wanted to take the power and essence of the raven, and we put them into a great milk drink that we invented, - Combat Milk. - I don't know what you're talking about, but I've heard about that stuff, and Cerrone and Felder love it.
Hey. Can you help me with this necklace? - I just can't get it off. - Sure. - Here. - No, I want -- I want you to keep it.
Please tell the court what you see. It's a newspaper article titled "The Two Not So Terrible." And one of them is Mary Eileen Adler. The same name as your daughter, born on the same day as your daughter, with a photograph. In his defense, he would never recognize her....
- No. And what did he do all the time? He loved math. It was his passion. He preferred it to all other things.
PLEASE. -doesn't go with your dress. -not at all. put down your sword, first of all. promise me that you will defend it at the cost of your life.
Therefore... ...I am here to help you. off the record, of course. what is your plan? If there is another weapons factory, we find it and destroy it.
You were a scientist. Among the best in the Russian forces, but you're asking something ridiculous. If I wanted you or Kseniya dead you would have been by now.... - And nothing could stop me. - You need our strength. But you can't get it.
No. No, you're not leaving your studies while you're about to finish them. I have no choice, I have bills to pay, Jacob.... Look, it's going to take her at least six months to get to trial, and we have the equity in the house. Yes. Use the interest on it until we sell it.
"Brace... Do you have any idea where I can find my death sentence?" I may need to prove in court that that land was acquired by contract and not conquest. A court of law? Yeah. Or they will proudly confiscate it.... Declaring it "spoils of war."
- When - Oh, here... I'm... going out, Lucy, I... I see the mailman, I'm going to get the mail. But he's going to bring it in....
I know it's scary, I know. Focus on something. Focus on the dove. Come on... Do you feel it now?
Gear sap. Some of my masks have parts that move. Greasing things... It makes them move. Since you've stopped... I could leave your screams to the forest and the creatures that haunt it.
My father's room. It's mine now. It's beautiful. When I was little, I used to play with his crown. I used to put it on my head.
Snakehips Johnson was playing that night. It went on until five in the morning. I thought the Germans had banned this music. They did. They think it's degenerate. They love it underneath, though.
The case numbers, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Should I discuss this with Standartenf√ºhrer Huth, sir? I'm afraid, when asked, Dr. Huth appeared reluctant to help his Harry. Shall we fill out the statement now? And do it in German, or they will ignore it in Berlin.
I'm curious. - All right, so I was upstairs -- getting "acquainted" with the prettiest girl in class, Jean Deely. Do you realize you're describing yourself as the world's biggest asshole? Conner starts knocking on the bathroom door. So I open it and I see him -- with blood gushing from his mouth, saying, "Your sister bit my tongue off."
Oh, do you know that I miss them? Dots, lines and secret codes. They had ... a certain theatricality. When someone would give you an envelope, expectations would arise. You wondered what on earth was in it, and you opened it very slowly.
Can anyone give me an example? A random one. Clay. Yes, an example would be slang. You start using one word and then everybody uses it.
Okay, girls, let's go! You probably can't imagine what it feels like on the sidelines, Zach, where many of us are. You can't imagine why a piece of paper can be so important. Before we leave, we put out an envelope for anonymous discussion proposals. We will check it every Friday and talk about it.
Oh. There are pictures of people eating poop in there! My job is not to take sides. Or to judge. Do you think when your father asks you for that syringe, - maybe you could ask him...? - He won't ask for it, okay?
The constant threat posed by pirates makes Captain Berringer a necessary, albeit temporary, evil. But I am not willing to accept him meddling in my personal affairs, driven by one scandal to seek more. Which is why I have signed a pact with the Governor granting immunity from any possible punitive measures for my informants guilty of allying with pirates before. Soon it will all be over-if we go along with events. My grandfather was a pirate of a very different sort. As a young man, he deceitfully took possession of a ship, chartered it to privateers, and earned a percentage of their loot, for the inconvenience.
For the time being, we cannot do anything about it. Are you sure? Come on, Billy is no fool. Right now, he will have secured his position by terrorizing or eliminating anyone who might think of challenging him to back me up. He has taken control of the Underhill estate and the army that inhabits it.
You don't like them? It's not that I don't like them. I don't like them, but it's not that.... The old way is still good. We fill out the complaint and send it via teletype.
It means you have to guard my body. Am I not right? Not when you rob a bank. Right now, my body is going to the bank. It's not robbing it.
- Your late wife. - Be good to yourselves. - I'll see you in Wisconsin. - Okay. Good luck, Mad Sweeney. I'll see you at the car. I'll make sure you don't steal it, okay?
- The captain is right. Nobody asked you, bagged. The protomolecule. What are we going to do with it? Easy, we put it in a torpedo and launch it straight into the Sun.
Can you speak louder? Back here we can't hear you. We talked about our children. The ones we lost in the war. His John and... my Andrew. How they both did their best to serve our country and Repel fear. Just as we must. repel it here at home.
He certainly could not expect anything different. As a matter of fact, yes. And I would like to ask you to reconsider. I would advise her to do that. So this is your idea of counseling? Does it matter as much as we define it?
It would be the greatest honor of my career. I know you were worried about having to come here, even temporarily. - Yes, I was. - Can we put those doubts aside? Just tonight I'm going home by train, I have an appointment with the social worker tomorrow morning, they call it a "home visit."
Open the fucking door! The dozens of arrests made are linked to the assassination attempt on the president-which occurred earlier this month. - What the fuck is going on? According to David Wellington, the President's Chief of Staff, the officials arrested belong to a wide variety of branches of government, including the Department of Defense, State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Today, the President is sending a clear message to the American people that our democracy is strong and will not demur and that we will defend it no matter what it takes.
And why should they be yours? Consider me your vascular parachute. I can see why I put the nights on you. All right, what's the plan? We find the bleeder, we fix it, we save Charlie's arm.
Did you go back to Mapleton? No. We are still in Jarden. In our house. Does anyone still call it Miracle?
We don't. - But if we need permission, to defend women like Inez, who is on trial for defending herself, or if we hope to have a decent place instead of this dump, why not try an alliance? - I mean, what are we afraid of? - Wait. Do you support this idea, Jean? I don't understand why we dismiss it out of hand just because they have.... - balls and we don't.
Bin-Khalid's men found us. They killed everyone else. There was a flash drive containing a list of sleeper cells along with all the codes to trigger their attacks. - You mean Grimes has it? - He said he will sell it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.
They will need your contacts. Electronic files, anything that can help them find John. - Henry, I did... - What? It's over, Luis. We're talking about the life of John, your sister's son. I have to think about my life, and I'm not going to spend it in prison.
- It's all true, I was there. I didn't have to pay for a single beer for the whole season. It's unbelievable. You know, I think I still have that ball in my office, autographed by the whole '85 Royals team. I'm going to see if I can find it.
The painting is the same painting. But what we see now is not what people saw hundreds of years ago. It changes the way we see it. The same goes for our hearing. Mozart's music was not heard by the people of his time the way we hear it today.
I have been separated from my friends. I cannot let them fight the Beast alone. Do you want me to go... to Fillory with you? Okay, there might be a solution. A weapon. He says if we find it, we can use it to kill The Beast.
He was panting sadly as I gave him a blowjob." And, suddenly, here he has something to write about. She has a story -- an experience, okay? Something that differentiates her from every other creative writing student who came on a bus from Virginia. Do you see my point about the experience? How much do you want it-and how can it be used?
Well, do you scratch my back? No. Do you know that they are going to close the N and R lines on DeKalb? It reminds me of the time, when I was an assistant in the Department of Transportation, that, and these things are secrets, they closed the B line or, rather, they pretended to close the B line but it was actually active and only the mayor and his homosexual friends were using it.
Just plug it in? That's it? That's it. There's a terminal at the base of the echo tower. He hops over there, takes the box to the tower, connects it, and gets back in time for dinner.
Are you hungry? Yes, thank you. So how does one become a museum curator? When you have to pay the rent. I majored in art history because I love it. I hadn't thought very hard about the career.
- Are you sure? - Because what was there? Drugs? I didn't look! Before you took it, did anyone else have it?
The question is what happened outside the office that prevented him from entering. This is a map of all the bullets that ended up in the body. What do the colors represent? Each color corresponds to one of the five shots -- but it's all still a bit fuzzy. And if you take this image -- and put it on top of a... bird's-eye view of the crime scene and then... draw the area where the pellets hit the ground?
No matter. A dead body--was found lying on the beach in Newfoundland, Canada. An American passport was found in the travel belt. Max used to buy soda... for the children. He would mix it with a little cream, to... make "grandpa's milkshake," as he called it.
We didn't care. It seems that Ron really did you a favor by firing Joey. He did. Ronny was good-hearted, he just got carried away. You have to be careful. The movie industry will eat you alive if you let it.
Maybe even immediately. - Did you have a premonition? - Yes. The kind with screaming and people killing each other. First we have to find Argent. I mean if it's ... some kind of mythological creature so powerful that the only thing that can control it is the Wild Hunt, then that's a big problem.
- I left him five messages, but.... - What is it about? A life story my editor requested. "Local author reunites with long-lost girlfriend." - They would like it for next week.
They both think it was Mary Drake who delivered the message. Do you think so, too? I don't know what to think. I... Mary wrote a letter that makes me cry every time I read it.
Are you proposing a deal? One you won't be able to refuse. Alistair and his line used to detest me because of my strength. Now they detest you. Creatures like them have respect for only one language, and I speak it fluently.
He always speaks with an American accent in movies. Regina and Luke, eight. John and Kathryn, two. Plus, we ripped you guys in Taboo. Okay, I know defeat when I see it.
- I think we are done. I'm not going to discuss... No, I just wanted to ask if the studies, if they are true, or if they prove it. All diets work. Any diet, if people follow it.
Westcliff Hotel. So you didn't see Gemma at all on Tuesday? - No. - I did. I saw the lunchtime boat arrive while you were in the bathroom. Gemma got on and started arguing with the guy driving it.
You're not much of a talker, are you? Here we go. Here. So, the quota is 18 pounds a day. If you don't reach it, these nice people -- they'll whip you.
Presidents don't apologize, you jerk. - You can thank me later. - Mr. President! There are people dying! I teach. Tim knows the story by heart by now, because I repeat it over and over again.
How do you hide a $100 bill from a surgeon? You put it in the patient's medical record. - Oh...okay. - Nice, huh? - Because they never read it.
It doesn't mean they include killing Wes. - Are you sure? - Yes! Because I'll have proof of that shortly. Oliver made a copy of Annalise's phone and is examining it.
That's what I said. Literally. Dre, please. It's Bernice's turn. But I did some research online, and I found that this particular "Givenchy" sweatshirt is from two collections ago. There's no way that boutique had it on sale.
Pregnant women can do anything. Meanwhile. I was realizing that maybe Josh wasn't wrong about paternity leave. I mean, I wasn't home when Junior was born. Have you seen my wand? I can't find it anywhere, and so my spell book is useless.
And did you know. That when they are born, babies look like their fathers? It's Mother Nature's way of keeping fathers involved. I was disappointed because Eustace looks more like my brother Eustace. Eustace! Look, Dre. If fatherhood was so good, why wouldn't everyone take it?
So it's all a bunch of bullshit? - Including the key? - No, the key was real. And it's very important. But, in fact, I never wanted you to find it.
Do you know what profit sharing is? Let's get on with it. Synergy has graced us once again. This one could make a difference. We get it back--and then we take it to the supervisor.
Hey. No, don't! Oh, my God. Where did you get that stuff? I can't tell you, but I'll share it with you if you do something for me.
Okay, and I'm supposed to pick up where he left off? I'm not a scientist, what can I possibly do? All his research is still in the films. Slink said you have to find the right coil so we have the instructions for the cure. Okay, suppose you find it, then what?
A bad part, but ... I don't think it will ever change. Technology certainly hasn't changed things. Guns, machine guns, nuclear bombs. No weapon has ever brought peace. No one knows what the protomolecule wants, or what it does. But they use it anyway.
Yes. But he won't be able to come. Class on Saturday? What kind of class is it? It's LGBT sex education, since they don't teach it in school.
In his neighborhood and forty-eight hours later. I think it was less, he organized a campaign to throw me out. How was I supposed to know it wasn't a meth lab? You are... a force of nature. Sharon... so far there hasn't been a single day... In which I haven't woken up thanking... To have you... Stef, I should have asked for your blessing before I proposed, but... I'm asking you now.
Because he can't read anymore. - What is that? - It's the letter Emma wrote to Jesus. - What are you going to do with it? - Emma didn't want anyone to find it.
- No. - I don't think it would work. - Wait, - you said the hatch is made of titanium, right? - That's right. Muriatic acid would melt it like cheese.
No more than he told you. Does he always have it with him? No, he took it out to help you. From where? Where he keeps it hidden, wrapped in cloth.
Mom, come on, it's not... It's not important. I mean, it should be a private thing. Well, in our family we do it. Simon's father started the tradition, 13 years ago. And we continue it in his memory.
Now, I wouldn't want you to think I'm hallucinating or anything. Okay, fire away. You know the voices I hear? I think this thing is taking over...I don't know...consciousness, some of those...characteristics that make us human. It feeds on it. And it spits it back out by somehow changing ... - its configuration.
The Rocinante and James Holden were never heard from again. And like them also Fred Johnson and the Mars government. So it looks like we should get the information on our own. The mission to inspect the impact site? We have commandeered a civilian survey ship and are equipping it with the best sensors and probes.
Because that's how you live! You never wash yourselves... You fuck in the street, in front of children! I know... If the truth were easy to hear, everyone would say it.
- Fucking imbecile! Fucking imbecile! - Shut up! Do you have anything to say, you fucking Irish cunt? They wave oppression like a flag and call it law.
He would like you to be part of the gathering. Abolitionists. The master used that word. I never understood what it meant, but I knew he didn't like it. And he always used it when he was talking.... About a slave who had gotten into trouble.
- I will hold them back as much as I can. - Will you hold them? - You are coming with us. - I will not come. I prefer not to use violence in other people's homes, but I won't let them use it in mine.
Outflow? The meatus is inflamed. There are obvious symptoms. You have gonorrhea, sir. The boys call it "clap."
Good job, Harvey. It seems Kathryn is the only one who knows the weapon. What's the plan? I'll go in and see what I can find. Do you think he keeps it on the mantelpiece?
- Maybe Lucius took it. - Only you two have the combination, right? - Yes. No. Lee knows it, too.
And is it from the future? Yeah. - And I'm going to build a trap for him? Me? - You. He wants to kill you before I build it.
The others delivered on time, it would not be fair to them. I know, he's right. I understand that, I really do. I really worked so hard on it. On this paper. Please think about it, take a look at it.
When you used to tuck me in as a child. When you took me to school or... When I played baseball all those years. I was alone at the games, I thought I didn't have a father! You lied to me! You stole that part of my childhood and I can never get it back!
I will be the only Time Witch in Locked. In America, in... China... On Mars. I don't even want to hear the name "Xu YiFei" anymore.... - Okay? - You didn't even want that part, remember? - Ida wanted it for you.
Be that as it may, according to this, the bell's measurements match what Dalton St. John wrote. This is what Seline was looking for in 1883. Why would she be interested in our bell? Peter Maxwell was the last person to get his hands on the witches' bell. Until he threw it off a bridge a little over twenty years ago.
- Why. Wickery Bridge is where Elena's parents went off the road. When officers fished the car out, they found something else. The foundation bell. - It was broken, but they repaired it.
But how did you come up with it? - It was because of the parade. - What? On Founder's Day. When they put the bell on a float and a rich guy rings it while two jerks are on either side of him wearing moldy Civil War uniforms?
We got upset and I threw something out the window. Then maybe he should help her look for it. He took the morning off. Anyway, he doesn't want me to have that thing. I honestly don't even know why I want it.
Do you know there is another way? We can counter Sybil. Does it have anything to do with that stupid metal ball? The striker is the last piece of the weapon. And if we use it, maybe we can break its influence on you.
Do you know what I want? I want to fix my brother, get rid of the devil, and I want my future with Elena. But I don't intend to become human while she sleeps for decades. You won't have to take the cure right away. Enzo will take it from Cade, and in the future you can take it from Enzo.
- Did she sneak into our house? - She is the villain. What did you expect? No, no, no. Keep it. - She needs to see you wearing it.
No. No, no, Dean... It's not gonna end like that, okay? Well, you just told me the story of my life. And, I have to be honest, I -- I can sense -- I'm already forgetting it.
You are next in line, Ramiel. Prince Infernal. It's just a name. It doesn't mean anything. Anyway -- the crown is yours if you want it.
I'm sorry, Castiel. No. No. There will be a cure. There is always a cure and we will find it.
In the last month it has gotten worse. Can't you stop him? Why should I still clean up all his messes, even after I kicked him out of the house? I can't live in his pain. I want to use my energy with those who want it. With my daughters and with people like Trish.
There would be no one. I mean, a black man killing another black man is not intriguing enough. What about his conscience? Would it be different if the boy's skin had been a different color? Oh, they deprived me of my conscience a long time ago. Then take it back.
I want that gun. The investigation is still ongoing. So is ours. And the feds are beating the local police. We'll give it to you as soon as we finish the various tests.
Okay, Frankie, that's enough. I'm okay with that. Thank you again for the soup. It was really delicious. You're welcome, even if you don't deserve it.
Well, you've been very busy, and people have been looking forward to seeing you with Lisbeth. Hey, come here. Look -- people want the story to go on. It's -- it's an addiction. And we feed it, whether we like it or not.
I searched far and wide for him, until... Don't get fucking distracted! I'm listening to you. I found it at his sister's house. He attacks me with a field hockey stick, I see this stick and I grab it.
Greetings. - The little bird was mistaken. Someone brought you a cake, Dr. Reid. He is very insistent. Well, tell him I'm operating, and I don't want it.
Given her ties to the community I see no reason to deny her bail, which I therefore set at $2,500. I fucked up. Chuck screwed me over. Again. That recording? He made Ernie hear it, you know?
Can we talk about your illness for a moment? I would like everyone here to be on the same page. Sure. It is sometimes known as "EHS," electromagnetic hypersensitivity. I can describe it as an acute allergy to electromagnetism.
The extraction site is ten kilometers away. With them on our heels, we will never make it on foot. Maybe we won't have to. They will blow up the door. What if we blow it up for them?
I shouldn't be telling you these things. How much is your weekly rate? No one has ever asked me that before. Propose one for me. Tell Kat how much it is, and I'll pay it.
Now you will help us find it. How did my team manage to get into the compound? She... programmed the servers to overheat, opening the conduits. That shut down the network. I want you to get it back up and running.
Wait. I, uh, talked to Scottie. She's okay, but she's running away. She really wouldn't want us to look for her. - Hargrave wants the network up and running. - She wants it turned off.
I know of only two other men who were ready to sacrifice their children. The prophet Abraham -- and the one who ordered that sacrifice. The captain spoke... Of the conspiracy of the slavers. Like me, he despised ... the abolitionists who are unable to take concrete action. That feeling, like dust that does not settle, he felt it too.
Making money--selling other human beings. Raping--other human beings, killing other human beings. These are all acts of war; it has been like this since the dawn of time. We don't call it that, because it is a conspiracy working against us. As the captain says, a conspiracy of slavers -- in a state of war, working in a way that doesn't get the point across. They pass it on from father to son, they exercise it through law, they justify it through religion.
- She entered, - I missed my only chance. - Listen to yourself. This is our one chance, the only chance we have. If we waste it, this story will be over before it even begins.
We came here because you know it's moving in this area. And if there was a map ... of all the shelters on the Underground, that would be a start. Actually ... it does exist. I heard a song once. I was told that... it was by a man ... who shortly before he died wrote it on the wall of his cell.
Have you found anything? Not yet, but they are hiding something. Remember our deal, Polly. If you don't find anything before the dance, it's over. - You're going home. - I have to be able to get into their room. They check it obsessively.
All right. And nothing will ever happen. Unless you give me the green light. Do you have the print? I'll send it to you now.
Go! Center! Got it. They say they are preparing for the coming apocalypse. It looks to me like they are unleashing it.
No, I understand that. I understand it very well what it's like to be alone, even though -- it's not like I have a choice. I don't understand. You don't have to understand my life, Madeleine. I barely understand it myself.
- Because I had no proof! Sometimes ... I see my mother ... even though she is not there. And sometimes I turn into her. I could use a room for a few hours. Marion, you deserve the moon. And I want to be the man to give it to you.
Yeah, yeah. It's just... it was a weird night. Definitely. I'm in your room looking for your Bluetooth speaker, but I can't find it.
No one bothers you. Nobody tells you where to go or what to do. And for forty thousand dollars a semester, you even get a degree. You're kidding. Yeah, they'll e-mail it to you.
Thirty dollars an hour? Does he get more than me? You know what? I think I'll take the pen myself. No, I'll take it - on my way out, because I'm leaving.
I'm going to get to work. Wish me luck. Oh, boy. Where did my shirts go? This laundry business-you wash something and then you have to wash it again and again and again.
All documentation complies with the protocol. At this point I expect an initial disclosure of the evidence. But triangulation of Michael's cell phone signal places him in the vicinity of his grandmother's nursing home, and not where Hana Reznikova was abducted. Good. We all know how it works, there is a chain of evidence that starts with the investigative team, then it goes to the lead investigator, who presents it to the prosecutor.
- Pats, what does the letter say? - I haven't had a chance to read it yet. - Read it now. - I'm trying to sleep. And then if I ignore it, maybe it will fade away.
Children need a place to play, and now that they have demolished the tank, the area is full of grass. And there is a small kiosk where they sell ice cream. I remember Tom saying something about that. Isn't there going to be a grand opening? Well, an inauguration. The mayor is on vacation, so I wouldn't call it big.
Good afternoon, Mr. Spenlow. Reverend. Is this no longer needed now? Well, we got all this stuff for the little guy. And we want him to keep it.
- Where is my cricket bat? - Under the pile of stuff in the hallway? Which one? There's more than one to choose from. - I'll get it for you.
More than two. I fought in Korea, thanks to military service. My father never recovered from the things he saw in battle. He suffered from post-traumatic disorders all his life. War is bad enough when you see it firsthand ... but having to relive it in your head ...
And I decided it's in Missouri. We realize it's a shocking thing. Believe me, I know how hard it is. But we are a family and we are going to do this together. We would rather you see it as an adventure.
This sword was given to me by your father. After putting a wolf instead of a bear on the pommel. But it's still Longclaw. Lord Commander Mormont believed you would never return to Westeros--but you did return--and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to keep it.
Rita, you both deserve better. He fell in love with an illusion. A fake blonde looking for love. There is nothing real about it. Redemption is real if you really want it.
Yes? Well, let's give them a show. Are you ready to fly? First, you are going to fly from this building, so I am going to visit your family. I'm going to lock them in, and I'm going to burn it down from the ground up.
Good to see you, Dad. - How are you doing? - Pretty good, I guess. I got this jacket today. I'm going to take it to my grave.
And it doesn't take me long to realize that ... they're looking at me. According to a radioactivity detector I was carrying a dirty bomb. And was I? I was carrying this. I found it at the farm as a child. Near the pond.
I don't want to sing it. Why not? Scarlett, it's just one song. It wasn't a problem then. We sang it every night on tour and it didn't bother you.
That's right. Yes, I love the music! That means it's out of context for you. - No meaning that sets it apart. - This is not true. You only have to listen to the music to understand what sets it apart.
- I'm listening to my rehearsal. And? It's so strange to hear myself singing a Rayna song. Yeah, I can imagine that. But -- you're singing it to her.
It looks nothing like Amelia Earhart's plane. Well, neither did hers before it was finished. Okay. Hold the wing. - I'm holding it. - Yes, I know you're holding it, but hold it nice and tight. Hold it steady.
You're really thirsty and you walk into a saloon. Full of aggressive-looking guys, pretty scary. And they don't like you. What's going to happen? Then the scarier guy picks up a bottle of Bud, slides it across the counter toward you, and the others look at you.
Oh, I wish, thank you. This is the living room. And this is the kitchen. And over there is the room that I share with my brother. I used to share it with my brother, too.
What's going on? Juliette stole Maddie's song. What song? What do you mean stolen? Stroud had given it to Juliette so that she would pass it on to Maddie, and she didn't.
Sadie asking me to investigate Prosecutor Russo to find the evidence of corruption they are pinning the Brennan case on. Russo is spotless, no scandal. - Oh, no. - What? You know that thing Isaiah does with his right hand when he's very angry? - Yeah. - He's doing it with both hands.
- doesn't match Billy's DNA? - I learned that, yes. - So this was Billy's face? - Yes. Because if we use it as evidence, it has to portray the scratch right and accurately.
It is not... A lie. Mellie and I are a couple. James... We may not be living... The romance that America wants to fantasize about, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the two of us are a match made in heaven. We respect each other, we want the same thing, and we want it with the same intensity.
- Move over. - But he said it's fine. - Is it my robe? - No. Yes, he says it tastes like money to him. Just wash it when you take it off.
My Olivia would have marched through door and made her swallow that request! That's my Olivia! But she is no longer here. So there's me -- in her place. I'm the one -- marching through that door, I'm the one making her swallow that request, I'm the one demanding that she sign it.
And then what? And then we will have it and Cortazar will help us understand it. And the nightmare will begin again. No. If the Belt has the protomolecule, no one will ever use it against us again.
He still had the boots he wore to the cemetery. The chisel that made dental identification impossible. Caddie was there for me, and if he could help me now, he would. So what's the proof? I guess you want me to put it somewhere, be found, transfer all suspicion away from you.
MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE ALWAYS VIGILE These are some of the boys who stood up to Hitler's air offensive. In due time, they will stop it once and for all.
I got a letter just this morning, Ada. I'm sorry, I almost forgot. - I love you, puppy. - I'm not a puppy. Stanislav received it from his grandfather.
All right. Would you like another coffee? Yes. Go easy on the fucking sugar this time. Yeah. The bullet shattered the scapula. They are putting it back together with screws and plates.
- Details. And Ortiz left a bomb in her father-in-law's house. - Perhaps to blow her up. - There were traces of blood on the bomb that could not have come from the gunshot wound. Why leave a bomb to kill your wife and then do things with it that will make us collect it as evidence?
We will close the case very soon. Mike, where are we headed? Inside, inside, watch your head. Ortiz makes bombs out of anything. And he's got plenty of C4 left. If there is a bomb, the dog will find it, I assure you.
It used to be a required course. Yes, but then it was banned. - And for good reasons, as far as I know. - Well, yes-we were in a pretty complicated situation. At the time, I thought it was the right thing to do. But the professor who taught it opposed it -- strongly.
- It's Julian, isn't it? - Go. - Is he the one organizing this march? - No, we don't want to... They wave oppression like a flag and call it law.
I can't even imagine it. That's all I'm going to add. But you love that farm. I loved it when I was 50. But now that I'm 70... I don't care how much I love it.
No! I can't. "For evil to triumph, it is enough for good men to do nothing." My father had framed and hung this quote in our living room. I saw it every day.
In. You know where it is. Why? We thought we could put a bomb on the spaceship. We needed someone to detonate it during the launch.
Oh boy, an Egg McMuffin and fries? I love breakfast at any hour. I eat the whole bag now. Some of it is for me but help yourself. Hey, I'm sorry I blew Bowdoin's trip, but I called them and postponed the presentation, and we'll do it during the Spring Ball.
With all the time and repairs I invested, that ship is more mine than yours. We just saved your life. We're even. We've had our misunderstandings, but if you find the protomolecule on the Ganymede station ... I certainly won't bring it to you.
- I mean, maybe... - Look... I wouldn't be here -- if it wasn't for the wand. So...I think I should be the one to decide when not to use it. There's no risk to you down here, so nothing will happen if you put it away for a while.
- Look, think of it as revenge for Aunt Ada. I guess so. The problem is that the Alpen are attracted to heavy sleepers, which I am not. Well, melatonin is the substance in your brain that makes you sleepy, right? That's why your brain produces it.
Okay. Okay. Make sure you place the cameras so we have a view of the room. - Got it. - And the only way you're going to hear us is this headset, don't put it on until you're in the room.
Eve. - Good morning. - Yes. Good morning. Saying "good morning" makes you more lovely. I sense the dawn of a pure day in your voice, and your hair is more alive than ever, I love it.
But give it a try. We can't hide here forever. It's not going to happen. This thing will find us sooner or later. And when it does, I will kill it.
Perhaps it is a kind of Achilles' heel. Specifically for the Destroyer? No, it's a more generic thing for unbeatable evil types. Dark forces that are present in the universe, like the Destroyer ... that accelerate apocalyptic events. "When the beast appears invincible...and death is the only fate for those who fight it...only the Blood Union Force...can overpower the great evil...and destroy the Destroyer."
- Yes, and I will respond! Expect to hear from my lawyers. - Now get out of the way. - He's not going anywhere, sit down. It's all right. He takes it head-on, but he can't do it, can he?
His reckless assault on a French prison? - Are you serious? - Let's get something to eat. The utter futility of such an action. What does this say about the man who performs it?
How about a simpler one? Are you eight years old? My son is also eight years old. Hey, why don't you come out and show me where your parents' house is? How about you go up front and take a ride in a police car? You can sound the siren and when we find it, you can point it out to me.
How did you get into it? You see, I never had anything against mining, since those are the only jobs. But when they said they were going to blow up Shay Mountain ... I couldn't stand by and watch. I mean, the mountain is part of me. I see it every day, my whole life.
It wasn't for you. It wasn't enough for you and Dad. You know, I thought I was responsible for all the bad luck our family had. God knows we did our part. But after your father died, I thought you were going to be the one who was going to be okay.
Jesus. It makes me itch just thinking about it. What else is here? I don't want to know. That's why I don't open it.
He thought I wasn't going to investigate when, all of a sudden, a legal clinic in Queens starts acting like it's a law firm in Midtown. Well, I did my research. And if we have to go to court, he's the one I'm going to face, and we all know what happened last time. He wouldn't be here if he didn't have anything else to tell me. So you give me a figure and I will take it back to my client.
If he doesn't make it, he doesn't make it. Unfortunately, he does. Then I will ask the court to sit with him. No. - We can ask for a dispensation... You are not qualified to act in court. They won't grant it, and that's not your place.
- Good. No hardcore pornography. We put this rule in because the one before you fried the computer. I can't tell you his name. We call it the Dave Rogers rule.
Happy New Year!!! Please say something. Okay. I don't like you using this song to manipulate my feelings. I didn't ask for them to play it.
I like your work. It is useless and not very functional. Thank you. Yeah, Annie says everything you see in front of you was inspired by that piece. So she wanted me to give it to Sophia as a gift.
Raina. In front of the cells. Be quiet for roll call. Move Teresi or go to the wheelchair. Put a hand on me and you won't see her again.
One of the conditions is that I keep a low profile. They don't want me to testify. Because of Eli. So, this job offer -- is this your severance package, basically? Call it whatever you want, but it's a really good deal.
You people aimed at me-as soon as I stepped in here! You don't believe me! And that... policewoman was just setting a trap for me. - No. - And now she sets it off.
This silver vial was found in your rooms. Can you explain its contents? Of course I can. It is powdered satyrion root, from a rare exotic orchid. At court the ladies call it the "Fountain of Youth."
It's on hiatus at the moment. But I can answer any questions you have. Yes. My wife, Kate, has this necklace and, um. I think it was a gift from her mother. E... Anyway, she used to wear it all the time, but the clasp broke during the accident.
You are in danger. I have so many memories related to snow. The first time I skated on the neighbor's pond.... A month stopped near the French Alps.... But the truth is. This is the first time I've seen it.
- With less pain. - Yes. But their bodies will give out because of that. Aida, it doesn't matter. Reality is just a perception. They perceive it as reality, which makes it real.
And right now, there are already two officers who fall into this category. Jemma Simmons and Daisy Johnson. The Inhuman. She hacked the Facility. They were able to access it without losing their memory and now they want to destroy it.
Margaret Wells! Mrs. Wells took it! I would never have done that! Miss Lacey. You didn't get syphilis here, did you? I don't want it.
An addiction stays forever. When. When I was a little girl, I had a T-shirt with a picture of a ballerina. I loved it, because it had a little crown ... with a crystal and ... a little pink tutu...made of tulle. I... Man, I used to wear it all the time.
But thank you. No, I just came by to bring Elena-my jacket. Here you go. Okay. I'll put it on over the jacket I'm already wearing.
Is there evidence of tampering? - Remote access? - No, sir. We checked it three times. He developed the machine, it makes sense that he knows it better than we do.
Mine tells of an eight-year-old boy from Lone Grove, Oklahoma whose father was killed by a drunk driver. A boy who lost his mother to cancer--to end up on the road. The good news is that where you start ... is only the beginning. Like a movie, your life is a story. No one writes it but you.
Can't you take a cab? What... wait a minute, there's -- there's a man here who wants to talk to you, hold on. Sir, your wife is very drunk. We had to escort her out of the club, so now she's on the street, like garbage. So. come and pick up her garbage, take her home and make love to her.
Um. - Olaf. Olaf. I wonder where he came from? He put us in your custody. I wouldn't really call it custody.
Well, Georgie, it's--. it's been a pleasure. You can deliver this love letter on your own. It is not a love letter. It contains a... strategy for the battle. I wanted to make sure my men received it in case I was killed.
Please. We both know Winslow can't keep his mouth shut. My boyfriend and my best friend. Maybe the president and Alex are right. Supergirl has a responsibility to protect everyone. But all I can think about is that the two people I love are trapped on that ship, and if we destroy it ... then they will be destroyed too, and that ... would break my heart.
But I want to go beyond the numbers, I want to talk about the people--the participants and the counselors who make the program work. You can stop this charade. - When was the last time you didn't drag the office, the police, the court and all of us, down with you? I'm strict, but fair. Give me a good story and I'll write it for you in a moment.
This is a mix of dish detergent, vinegar and water. Nothing to be afraid of. You spray it--and wash it off. Now, once the leaf is clean, you have to check that it's healthy, okay? If it's shriveled, we have to cut it off and put it in this bag.
It's in Miami, at a sponsor's campaign. They had already organized it before they knew we were opening today, so.... It's a shame. The inauguration -- all your work.... What a shame that your husband is going to miss it.
- If I tell you I will work, I will work! - You have to start trusting me. - This is not about trust. Should we trust you? "I have made the decision to pass on this land to the one of my children who needs and loves it most."
The laws of physics! - Are you okay, dad? - Yes. I have a new idea, though. This time, I'm going to throw it at a corner.
Get the hell out of here. There is no discipline in this school. The principal is ready for you. I don't think it's appropriate to ask you the details of why you were... Sent here. I've been in this school career long enough to know that no one follows it unless they have very good reasons that they are desperate to hide.
Can you stand? Marcel, there are five totems, but four children. Okay, so who is the other child? Nice car! Do you mind if I borrow it?
E... I promise you -- I'm going to fix this. Then start by giving this to Marcel. D, I'm sorry. When I lost you the world came crashing down on me, I went through all the stages of grief. I went through the spiral of anger...I took it out on Klaus, on Elijah, and they deserved what they got...but...but now that it's all in the past...and you're gone anyway...the only...the only thing that keeps me in control is a code that I had...when I was a kid.
We have a black guy here. Maybe we send Donovan out there to be our Chris Darden. No, thank you. I'm not a camera guy. We should get a restraining order. There's no way Judge Tapper would sign it.
This is my way of asking you nicely. All right!!! I've never seen it. I've done a guy a favor a couple of times. He comes here--with an envelope or something, I hide it in a church and call another guy and tell him it's there.
Let her be the one to read it to you. Her flight has not yet left. There is no time. Yes, there is. You just need a fast car and someone reckless to drive it.
What? Are you waiting for a consensus? No, not at all. Good. You tell ten people a baby died and they'll all cry. You tell ten people a joke? Four will laugh, four won't, and two won't get it.
What disease is he suffering from? An endless agony of vomiting...and diarrhea...and pain with every single breath. At least, that's what I hope. Governor, I saw her going out at night with my own eyes, alone.... whispering to the moon. If it's witchcraft and we don't suppress it, the king may doubt your government.
I wasn't looking at her-I... I... I wasn't... I wasn't looking at that pussy. What do you mean? - I wasn't looking at her... - What do you mean?
We had captured these two... - Two... two Viet Cong, Vietnamese soldiers. - I'm so sorry. They were prisoners. Fucking Vietnamese. They were just sitting there. And one of them pulls out a cigarette. And he lights it.
I do. Let's go! You have to come with me! But I have the baby. So? We'll leave her with your cousin.
Oh, it's not good at all... Not good at all... But don't worry, your face is down there. And it's beautiful. I know you don't see it now, but you'll see it someday.
He will wash his feet in the blood of the ungodly." I bet your feet suck. There, that's just it-the problem with women in prison. Men understand violence. They respect it.
Yes, but if we know it, we cannot at the same time tell where it is. Does that sound logical to you? - No, sir. - Of course it doesn't. And according to my colleague, the particle even does not exist until we observe it.
I go after corrupt policemen. It looks like we both win, doesn't it? Come on, do we really have to go through this procession again? I hope your lawyer is licensed and can build a defense without that blackmail tape. I wouldn't open it, honey.
No. Give me that shit. No, stop! Wait. Where do you keep it?
Hey, age Havana used to get drunk with my grandfather. Sure, and then he used to fuck your mother. Well, that's part of our heritage, anyway. Deep-sea fishing, I say. We learn it from our fathers, who in turn learned it from their fathers.
I know you did not want my help, but I sent the Spanish guards into Meaux, where they found young Gerard. Come. Tell the Lord Chancellor why you wear the crown. An older boy gave it to me. He said he didn't want it anymore.
You are going to the new little house today, aren't you? They will deliver it to us on our piece of land and we will sleep there tonight.
No. It sucks. I haven't sold a single piece. It's yet another rejection. It's like the universe has stepped in shit and is wiping it on my life.
We are not here to kill you, Clarke. We are here to take your ship, a ship you repaired to save your people, not mine. The spacecraft is a contingency plan. It will contain at most 100 people. Then you won't mind if we take it.
Don't talk nonsense, Bert. They're never completely tied up. Orders from above. Now, like a good man, get over it and back up immediately. You're talking to Vic Hill, this wing and all the little bitches in it are my stuff!
Think. Catholic! Catholic! "Mary, Mary." Surely you have heard this nursery rhyme before. I don't know it.
Love... Love, I'm so sorry. I put the first thing I could find. It should be taken back a little bit on the back. I'll take it back on your back.
The god of goat farming? Do you grow grapes? Wait, is that manure? I bet you love to come here and fuck with mortals because back home in dioland you don't beat around the bush. Be careful what you say, or I'll cut out your tongue and eat it in front of you.
In previous installments... I've been in the school career long enough to know that no one follows it unless they have very good reasons that they long to hide.
You have a very efficient supervisory department. I was hoping you could authorize an internal investigation. It would make it look like a response to my lobbying. And why would I do that? Because in a year or so, when the investigation is completed, my office will validate it.
Scholar. And a practicum with you would be.... Oh, slice this beauty. Thank you. Oh, I love the sound it makes when they slice it.
- Okay, this way. You have to come this way, I can't. - I can't come that way, he's driving! I can't move it! Why don't we take it...
- It's a good idea, really. - No it isn't! - Of course. - It's true, or, listen to this idea. At least listen to me. Why don't you take a cow, turn the inside into hamburgers and steaks, and then, instead of throwing away the skin, you don't use it to line car seats?
My life is a miracle. And sewing little girls' eyes-what kind of miracle would that be? Don't judge faith until you know its origins. - The gods ordained it. - The gods who ran this base used it as a training center to impersonate humans.
I don't even know where else I might have been. Do you still remember how to drink? I suffer and you feel like celebrating. Let's not drink to that. Finally, my welcome home party, although I don't ... I understand why we're having it here, but ...
The people on that ship were your friends. Even they were like family to you, I understand that. But none of them will ever understand what you must now do to save the Ishida Household. Not the way I understand it. If you want, take my life. I offer it to you -- willingly, knowing that what I did was for the good of the Empire.
One second! Have you tried the purple one yet? I don't use purple! I hate the jacket. I love it.
If you want to make up for setting the theater on fire, let's go away. Do this for me and you will have made up for it. How could Will have abandoned us? This stupid fairy tale was his idea! We'll get it done.
I could die like any coward or continue to live to be celebrated and remembered by all. Before the Regent touched his sword, I slit his throat. Four of his guards burst into the room. And I cleaned up. To this day ... before going into battle ... fear comes to visit me. Now, however, I welcome it as a friend.
Where are you, Eddie? You are a renegade. You are the son. What's behind the door? If you don't open it, you can never get rid of it.
He was found in a shipwreck in Scapa Flow Bay. 107 years old. - Here are the things I love about Earth. - You know what? Take it, I'll give it to you. Let's talk about the protomolecule. Sergeant Draper... witnessed a revolutionary technology. There can be no peace if one of us has it ... and the other does not.
It is hard work, a hard life. But it has to be done with love. If you don't do it for the right reasons, it will shorten your life, I think. Not many people want to get up at two in the morning to go to work and toil for ten or 12 hours and then come home. Someone has to light the fire and get the meat out. Someone has to spice it and cut it, put it on the fire, cook it to perfection. All this takes many hours and a lot of talent.
That doesn't mean he wouldn't understand that it's okay to put it up for sale. Right now, things between us are so delicate that I am afraid to take even a small step. Also, if I were to propose selling the house, I would have to explain to her why, and I think it would be better if ... she didn't know every detail. How is the marriage counseling going? Is it as heartbreaking as I remember it?
- Then tell that to Axe. - How not. I'd love to look like a hero and keep Axe from losing any more money. But the last time I tried, he fired me. So you want me to review it.
Across the Hudson River in rebel blue robes? Wondering where their commander slipped off to? He had it coming. I know exactly who-and what-you are. Please, we're just talking about the war here, not making it.
E... What about you? Don't you have a third date? Actually, no. I'm retired, as far as sex is concerned. I took my stocking off the handle and put it on.
Although I don't think you owned anything remotely interesting. I mean, I'll stop by your apartment and take a look, but... What else, what else? Ah! I brought you some heroin. Hoping some kids won't come by and eat it.
So I will write you the note. - Here you go, honey. - I don't want it. I thought that's why you came here. Infact, but I don't want it for a real reason.
In person. Well ... enough to know that he would greatly appreciate your admiration, Master Wells. This metal disk-how does it relate to him? Washington ordered me to deliver a missive to him. When Banneker refused it, I followed him to his workshop.
There is no damn password. No password. Great. Thank you. Just as I was about to take the last glazed donut, Joanna taps me on the shoulder and takes it!
- The guy was attacking her. - And he was also trying to protect Paul - when he threw a bottle at him? - It was probably the same bottle - with which he beat him to death. - No, no, no. I threw it at him because I was nervous about something else and I took it out on him.
Because this law has so many loopholes it looks like a sieve. Mr. President, let's try to figure out how to fix it with Bowman. I read the draft bill and I understand why it was never passed. The point is, if he doesn't support the bill, he will be labeled a hypocrite who used the town meeting for political purposes while being pro-gun. But if he supports it, he will expose himself to possible criticism due to the wrong wording.
So how did the hearing go? Honestly, I don't know. I think I defended myself well. According to Aaron, I did, but -- it's hard to know what they're thinking. - I'm sure you did great.
- Caleb is... No, he did the mission with Champe by the skin of his teeth, and the night we were supposed to kidnap Arnold he was drunk off his ass, not... Simcoe poisoned his mind. As long as you ... treat him like a broken man, he will never recover. Grant him the trust he deserves as a friend--and he will regain it in a flash.
We went to three different diners in search of your perfect egg cream. One had Hershey's syrup instead of Fox's. - The other had no take-out cups. - That sounds like a summary, not a question. My question is, why, after we found the perfect egg cream that passed your final egg cream test, why, William -- why aren't you drinking it?
In addition, the hospital found nothing wrong with Farmer. He was discharged. Which fits with the story that it was voluntary deception. No, no, no, no. No. Look, this is information that you should have known earlier, Chief Inspector Huntley, much, much earlier, and, in my opinion, the reason you didn't know it is because you couldn't wait to charge the suspect,
Do you want to help me? Of course I don't. Then what did you come here for, man? This is a song I wrote after I killed someone. - If I wanted your opinion, I would ask for it.
We must have some memories in common. Of course. You tell some anecdotes about the Prince, Maggie. They told me that... Once, you and your brother Edward caught a fox in the woods and smuggled it into the children's room.
Turn off the machine! Nice try. Did you really think we would use the same word for your cheeky little brother? You will never discover the word to save your brother. You certainly won't find it in time to save Charles.
A blanket, perhaps? No, thank you. Strangely, the more comfortable I get, the less comfortable I feel. I think it's the quiet moments that scare me the most. Women like us, prefer the storm, to the quiet that precedes it.
Someone has entered the Vada property in the master bedroom. All right, I'm there. There's a safe. Do you see it?
There is someone at the door. Okay. I want you to load the rifle. Pick up a cartridge. Holding the tip of the barrel, push it into the charging seat until you hear a click.
- Yeah, good, thank you. - Thanks again, man. - Great, yeah. - Need a hand? - No, I got it.
You really should try Ginny's cheeseburger soup. The ground meat with spices, the... melted cheese... I highly recommend it for the inaugural ball. If you think you can keep the immunity deal by blackmailing the president-elect for having allegedly accepting illegal campaign funds from Alexander Kirk--you are not as smart as everyone says. Marlin, your boss made me an election promise and I'm going to make sure he keeps it.
I worked on my paso doble. - Fred Astaire, be careful! - Bobby has lost almost three pounds. Now, two million people might see the opening, but the only thing Miriam cares about is the dance floor. And my woman and I are going to tear it up.
Why was he digging a hole? He was burying something. A wooden box. It was a little gem of carving. Anyway, he clearly didn't want it, so I waited for him to leave and dug it up.
Maybe you have some secrets too.... Maybe in the end, the law will be there waiting for us, and that's your plan. What does that look like to you? Look, if you don't trust it, that's fine, take your pick. But the thing is, there's dynamite in there and they're going to use it.
Let's go. You helped them steal, seriously injured three security specialists, - one of them ended up in hospice. - Look, I did what I had to do. - I earned the trust of the Farrells. - Do you even know where they hide it?
- What the heck happened to me? I swear, I'll tell you everything, but it's better if I tell you in person. Roman, look in your pocket. Inside is a coin, a very special coin. I gave it to you when we were kids.
It's better now. As long as you don't look at me, everything is fine. Would you like a slice of that pizza? No, thanks. We're not going to eat it anyway.
As long as you don't look at me, it's okay. Would you like a slice of that pizza? No, thanks. We're not going to eat it anyway. But if...you're not going to eat it, why did you order it then?
Oh, no, it's fine. Well, Frank, I'm so sorry about the tube thing. Oh, don't worry about it. The shirt needed a refresh. I haven't washed it since we stopped for pictures at the Smokey-Top.
But-and why would that be? We cannot send her to the stand knowing that she will testify falsely. She can only refer to facts that are true or potentially true. My God--how I love the law! And you people all take it so seriously!
- Ma'am, this is a crime scene. I can fit, I work in an office. - Where is Rutger's weapon? - To be safe, I removed Detective Hiss's weapon, and placed it in my back pocket. According to protocol, I will now pull out the weapon -- make sure it's unloaded, and put it on the table.
We don't want anyone to cause another stabbing rampage, do we? Well, it's not my fault that humans can't handle the divine. By the way, if I hadn't, we wouldn't have found out what the blade really is. And do you really think this is the flaming sword? I thought Father destroyed it during my rebellion, - so that I wouldn't use it against him.
Is it one of those cute mailboxes? No, it's called a hovel, but even people of normal stature can live in it. Grandpa told us to be ingenious and we took his advice. Yeah, so now we're homeowners and we're real adults and we don't have to depend on anyone. - Where are you going to put it?
So could this be another Black Spring? I -- I was six years in prison, for doing some very bad things. So... if that were the case...I would be the first to die. What were you looking at? The gray figure out there -- do you see it?
I love this song. So do I. I find it comforting. My father used to beat my mother. My sister would take me and my brother to her room and put it on -- raising her voice as loud as she could.
From fridge to trash. I'm cashing in a lot of shots today. There's also an awards ceremony at the Embassy Suites hotel. The trophy is a crystal palm tree. We will hang it on a necklace and you will wear it when relatives are there.
We are all that separates our homes from those monsters. If we run away, they will kill everyone. But how will we win? This sword is called Hrunting. It has been enchanted with white magic. So that whoever carries it into battle will be hailed as a hero.
Do you know what it says? No. - Dad? - Yes? I don't want to open it.
I don't even know what I'm looking for. It must have taken a great deal of energy to ban Reynard. So any kind of strange event or... operation. Yes, that's the literal definition of news. We'll understand it when we find it.
Ask yourself a question: what will a Magician need if dark days come? Answer: magic. But you think, if it's gone, it disappears altogether. Not so, if you keep it as a battery.
- What? Oh my God! Why is there gasoline? Well, I'm certainly not paying Greenwich prices. - So you keep it in a juice jug?
Every encounter we have had with the supernatural brings us back to Dreyfuss. The Lincoln Memorial. Dreyfuss Enterprises had a contract to restore the statue before Lincoln's head disappeared. The Dyer House. Dreyfuss applied for permits to reclaim the marshes surrounding it.
That's right, Master Wells. And if this part of the Talisman is in the crypt below street level--maybe we could access it from below. Are you kidding? We barely escaped from the Sphinx out in the open; in the tunnels we'll be vulnerable. Not if we distract her from above. We get her out in the open--and keep her busy long enough for Diana and Crane to reach the crypt.
Their version of the fable emphasized the most feral aspects of the creature. Its ability to take human form. And not only that. It took on the features of someone trusted, someone close. In the case of the Pilgrim Fathers, the father of Mercy Bradford, the dead child. Captain William Bradford. Eventually they got the better of the creature, buried it in an underground chamber, which they sealed with a magic stone.
- You said it burned completely. - It did. Right in front of my eyes. The marrow reduction glazed with mint -- my God, it was really delicious. They make it on a farm where they raise pigs with whey in the Hudson Valley.
The reason Snart and I got along so well was mutual trust. - We were friends. - Have any of you gentlemen ever heard of the Spear of Destiny? The spear could alter reality itself. We broke it into four pieces.
I will never stop fighting. Instead, you will. Kill it. Get rid of her. But I'll take the mask. I will add it -- to my collection.
What was it like? Devonshire was beautiful, sir. God be with you. What binds a man to his land? What strength drives him to give his life to preserve his land and the lives of the families who work it?
No, it's the beast. It's circling around us. It's looking for a way in. It's getting stronger again. Strong enough to feed itself. Every hour of sunshine that feeds it makes the world darker -- and the beast stronger.
If it helps--I have a plan. It feeds on light, but approaches when it hears noises. - What do we do, then? - Simple. We make some noise, luring the beast here, and then we send it back into the portal.
I don't know where he is and I doubt anyone else would know. He does. - Shall we continue the tour? - Yes, sorry, I thought you would take longer. The line at the ladies' room was endless, I decided I'd keep it.
It isn't. You can still get out. I dream of it, the life I had, hoping I can get it back. I can help you. The Witness list, when we get it back, I can put you on it.
It looked like it was put there on purpose. And it's not even old, it's a brand new shoe. Good. Have you seen my keys? I put it on the little wall, in case anyone was looking for it.
- And you put it there? What do you know where it was, - it might be full of dog poop. - It's brand new. That's the thing. Well, even if it's brand new, don't put it on the table. It's bad luck. All right. It's just that... - I didn't want it to be stolen.
They have improved in my opinion. They know more words now, but... the way they say the words, the... The pronunciation? Yes, they are not good at all. It's hard to learn a new language if you don't speak it all the time.
- Unfortunately, there was a certain admiral. Fortunately, he put me back on track. Unfortunately, he assigned the case to Pride. And that's how I got caught. I was even this close to pulling off that sweet scam. You still have a chance. If we pull it off against Garcia.
Nothing we talk about has to get to Katie. All right? You know my wife, you know my daughter. Now it's time for you to get to know me. For example, one of my hobbies is walking in the woods and burying things in holes. Sometimes, I take one thing, break it into pieces. And I bury it in more holes.
Last week he told me he was ending the relationship. I'm ending it this weekend. We're going on a wine tasting trip. And why does everyone insist on calling it an affair? What would you call it?
- Why? What happened to the post? - Don't ask. I'm very excited to explore this thriving location that is the Long Island wine scene, guys. Some are calling it the new Napa.
- Hey! Hello! - Hey! Oh, my God! - What happened to your ankle? - I... I sprained it.
I lost the necklace. Thank you. And you lost it after only one day? I know, I know, I'm so sorry, but we've turned the whole house upside down. If I find it, of course, I will call you.
Thank you. And you lost it after only one day? I know, I know, I'm so sorry, but we've turned the whole house upside down. If I find her, of course, I'll call her. Yeah, I'm not buying it.
Thank you. The U.S. Marshals are coming here to pick up Damian Andrews - It's the best solution. Yes, the Jamaican prison is not the best place for someone like Damian Andrews. - He would run it like a hotel.
We just need his energy. - No. - You are born, great energy; you die, even greater energy. Especially if you are a demigod. That's what we're looking for, people. The energy. Right now, he's just a skin casing that keeps it hidden.
Why you are here. Is there a cure? Yes. A slow cure ... which may cause some discomfort ... for a while. Or a quick fix...whose effect is immediate. The slow cure...will you feel it?
They kidnapped my brother. Okay? And they will kill him if I don't repay the debt. Let me help you, okay? But start by lowering this weapon before I take it and make you swallow it.
It's "Westworld." Oh, wait, Sergeant. I don't have any cameras in that room. Hold on. I'll find it now. Oh, no.
Coming up on the 12 o'clock news, a couple in their 30s decides to get married without the presence of their dog. You won't believe their story. So what have you decided? Do you open the door or do I start killing someone? No, I'm not going to open it.
Let me count the ways. I love you with all the immensity and depth and apex of my soul..." - I'm going to be late for school... All you have to do is put it in Reverend Frank's jacket. When he finds it, he will know it is from Miss Abigail, and it will fill his heart with joy.
Not so, in fact. This one is one of a kind. Legend has it that it was created over a thousand years ago by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian to join the Jedi Order. After his death, the Jedi kept the sword in their temple. And there it remained until members of the Vizsla house broke in and liberated it.
And was it ... positive? No. It was really bad. I made this saddle with your sister. And now I'm going to put it on your back.
Yes. Schmidt, look, this is garbage. Do I need to remind you about your petition to have Enya participate in the Super Bowl halftime? You're misunderstanding my petition, okay? I wanted her to participate as a player during the final quarter. Schmidt, I bet I could compose a fake EDM song and you couldn't tell it from a real one.
I can't open it, there is the emergency protocol active. You have to use the combination lock. You set it to 3614. You'll have to guide me. I can't see it from here. You see it, don't you?
Stop talking about it. I love it. Where did she learn how to do hair? In. some salons, where I come from. You understand the language then, you just don't speak it very well.
No? Because you wanted to...you wanted to.... To paint the house, sure! To paint the house, that's right. Even though most of the house is already painted. We wanted our best friends to finish it.
I am sorry, President Dalton. The breaking of this engagement is just yet another in a long line of betrayals. I see no end to this conflict until the CSE is extinguished. When I was ten years old, my father was killed by the Colombian government. He was shot, in front of my sister and me. For telling the truth about state-sponsored corruption. Since that moment, I have dedicated my whole life to this cause and I will never abandon it.
- Oh, hey, listen to this weird story. I got a call from the CIA. They want me to go there for an ex post facto re-interrogation regarding Black Dog Station. Well, I've been in the CIA for 20 years, and I've never heard of an... - ex post facto re-interrogation. - When they wanted to close down an operation, they called it a "washout."
- He painted graffiti. Fremont Jones, known as Free. The graffiti artist, right? I know his work. He's brilliant. Well, right now he doesn't have much hope. We used DARPA foam to stop the internal bleeding, but when we remove it to operate, he will bleed out.
So she is more familiar to me. She could certainly become my dream woman. And Finch messed it up this marriage Well, maybe I can fix it if I or things don't get out of control again. Well, if Finch got locked into my old life, let him have it.
She could certainly become my dream woman. And Finch has messed it up this marriage Well, maybe I can fix it if I or things don't get out of control again. Well, if Finch is stuck in my old life, let him have it. I might pity him, but I think he probably deserves it.
We are the Librarians, we work for the Library. No, we don't, we are plumbers. Yes, we prevent magic from flowing into the world. It could be very dangerous in the wrong hands. Of course, I would never keep it a secret from you, my angel.
- Half. - almonds, half soy? - No. Half milk, half whole milk. Oh, I'm sorry. We don't have cream anymore. Nobody wants it, because it's really unhealthy.
I haven't seen this baseball glove ... - for 30 years. - It makes you remember a lot of things, doesn't it? - Yes. - You'll have so many memories in this house. - Yes, I will. - Just so you know, when they buy this house, they're going to tear it down.
- Had dyed our lips red. - Yes, it has so much sugar that we had to get you down to run on the side of the road. - I can't believe they have it! - Holy crap, it's gone. Well, I'll find it for you somewhere.
Hi, honey. Hi, Jessica. The teeth I borrowed were from her private collection. She spent years looking for teeth of powerful historical figures to create the perfect mouth. She calls it "The Mouth of Freedom."
What are you guys doing? Have we always had a dishwasher? - And why have we never used it? - Because we don't believe in the dishwasher. It was there when we arrived, but we will never use it.
Okay, all right! We are not poor. I lied. Why would you say we're in trouble when we're not? Because I wanted us to buy this house but I don't want us to enjoy it.
Although the pineapple cake looks good. It doesn't. Tart is superior because it's full of nutritious fruit. It is the healthiest dessert. In fact, the tart is so good, the cake can't hold it.
If you don't have a better idea. What is this? The best day of my life! Can you believe it? We are now the proud owners of our very own flat-film camera! And just to be clear, it's mine, but I'm leaving it out so we can all use it.
"It snowed today. "We snuggled in the reading corner with our beautiful baby and listened to classical music." I had a reading corner? Did I listen to classical music? You know, I've always loved classical music, but my "father" calls it dental music.
Bleach, Gibbs. Chemical tests confirm that both the bulwark and lifeline were cleaned with bleach, which is odd, since the Navy forbids using bleach on the ship's exposed decks,-because - It's too corrosive. Yes. Someone would only use it if...
I'm not an invalid. Okay. And this thing, I kept it idling all day. It doesn't bake. And if I turn it up that's what happens.
This I'm doing is drifting, it's undeniable. Oh, yes, yes! I connected the steering with my foot. It's a whole new feeling. You don't react to a drift. You deliberately cause it, and you keep it on the exact spot.
I can't keep it. I wouldn't know what to do with it and.... What would it mean? It would mean -- that we loved each other for a while. How's -- how's your shoulder? They say -- I'll only feel it in cold weather.
Do you know that's the only piece we're going to use? Yes. I can pick my own catch phrases. Yeah, that's better. Once he knew the fame and all that goes with it, I think he didn't want it anymore.
I can pick them, the catch phrases. Yes, that's better. Once he knew the fame and all that goes with it, I think he didn't want her anymore. He didn't want it.
I remember. this interview with Tony Visconti. The interviewer asked both of them what David's relationship was with jazz, or something like that. Tony replied that he thought that influence had always been present in David's music, but it had been in the shadows, whereas now it had come out into the open. Of course, when the song was released, there was all kinds of comments. Some people hated it so much, some people loved it, while others didn't know what to think.
You are the author of the magnificent Don Quixote de La Mancha. You know, it took only three months to finish the first edition. Congratulations, I am convinced that your chronicle will be unparalleled. I am not convinced. I think Lope would write it closer to the queen's taste.
You know, I did it for the first time when I was 8 years old. Dorset Bank. Smurf made me go to the guard to show him my RoboCop action figure. And when he smiled, I threw sand in his eyes. Smurf took the gun, gave it to me.
- Really? Was it an RS? An SS? A Z/28? All I know is that it was red. I want to find something connected to that car to give to Sam so he'll remember it forever.
- it's clear to her that it doesn't make sense. - Negative. Negative. That's right, it makes negative sense. Glad she agrees. Ma'am, the high compression battery requires a special MHE before we divert it to APOE.
And if he loses he gets 25 years to life in prison? Do you remember anything else - about how you got the wound? - I'm trying to, but I don't remember. And I'm not going to take the offer. I know what the stakes are, but I won't take it.
I'm listening. We have some money. A lot of it. And we'll spend it on anything that will make our lives easier, including... Filling the right wallets in Caracas. I was waiting to hear what your goal was. Even if I had that information, I wouldn't share it with two men representing a company that doesn't exist.
You need to tell me where it is. So that you can report it to him? No way! You'll find out when we get there. Not if Thrawn destroys her first.
What are you doing here? The same thing you are doing here. You betrayed us all. Rhysy. So we steal the car for you, we get caught by the cops, you steal it from here and keep the four million for yourself.
I'm helping him get a job here. And that makes Leonard angry! No, it doesn't. Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it.
He would move heaven and earth to make you feel better. That's his job, isn't it? Making sure you're happy, no matter what? You're doing the face. Dad calls it the far face.
We could cross the river, by boat. Sometimes I wonder if I am afraid to be happy. I'm not sure I deserve it. Happiness is a gift.... Hard to conquer. I say he deserves it.
But of when. In a nutshell, entering into a relationship with someone much younger and much less mature? It's a detriment. We are still missing two jurors: Margaret and Kenny. Have you made any progress with Susan's pregnancy? The vitamins are the only indicator I'm I found and they put her in the third month.
You watch the news and we're all so divided. Everybody yelling and pointing fingers; there's so much pettiness out there. You stop looking for it. And who's looking for it?
Yeah. Yeah. We think he shot him, killing him. In a warehouse they owned, Watson wrote to me while she was there. The police have been looking for her for hours, but no murder weapon. If we don't find it, the jury might actually believe the story that goes around about a "black guy" who shot and ran.
He is so ... he is not able to do anything by himself." So my mother ... asked some friends ... to keep an eye on him. And among them was Astrid. I called Astrid and told her, "Astrid, could you take some soup to Warren? Go to him and help him, because ... on his own he won't manage."
That's right. You make money with people who hate you. It's like me making money with blackberries. And think about it. When a fan buys a jersey, he keeps it forever. But when a protester buys a jersey, he burns it and buys another one the next week. Wait.
- Reddington. - Elizabeth, where are you? Asa Hightower, the Pharmacist, is in custody and we found his lab. Have you identified the toxin? The lab is working on it, they will find it.
The killer goes to Tendu's room, tries to enter. He is slowed down by the security latch on the door. Scuff marks suggest that it was yanked violently and then unbolted. Only by that time Tendu had escaped. So the guy finds himself empty-handed, but he is not ready to give up, so he finds the guy's bat and takes it back to Owen Tuchman's room.
That's why we are a great team. Fuck you. If I end up in jail, you will too. Put the gun down. You're not going to use it.
- At least he was finally honest! - Okay. If you want honesty-open your ears wide because you're going to get it. I can't play the guitar. I can't stand it.
- If Gordon didn't do it. Whoever did it knew how to cover his tracks. Like someone in the Navy or Law Enforcement.... But we checked the documents of the two victims and nothing came up. Nothing to confirm what Gordon says about Janet Ortega's mysterious beau? Nothing besides the necklace with the purple stone, however.... The victim was wearing it just before she was killed, as Gordon said.
Nothing to confirm what Gordon says about Janet Ortega's mysterious beau? Nothing besides the purple stone necklace, however.... The victim was wearing it just before she was killed, as Gordon said. This is security camera footage from the Decatur station on that night 20 years ago. But. She was not wearing it after she was killed, just as Gordon said.
Thank you. Did Alvez say why he wanted us? No. The same DNA was on the outside of the water bottle at Joey Fletcher's crime scene, but not in the water itself. So he doesn't drink it.
Hey, that's my detail, what's yours? It's that damn water. Why does the unsub bring a water bottle to the crime scene? Well, according to our profile, he's sadistic. That's when we thought he was drinking it in front of them.
The Justice Department won't wait more than four days. That's the maximum you have to give me something concrete. Preparations for the sand mandala are going well. I don't understand. These monks will spend all week painstakingly arranging colored sand in a precise pattern and then.... Boom, they sweep it away.
You were really very... Untraditional. Selfish, probably negligent. No doubt negligent. Extraordinary. Planetary, I would say. Yeah, like a big black hole only capable of sucking up all the light -- and sending it into another...
- Okay, that's bullshit. We deserve to know the truth. - Do you want the truth? - Yes. And we're not leaving until you tell us.
Gold 2 is unconscious. Zeb, take her to the infirmary, then get to the guns. What about her ship? We need all the firepower we can get. - Do you have someone who can pilot it?
Yes, they do. Yes, they do! - Yes, they do. Yes, they did. - That's why I was given the mission. - No one else wanted it.
Why didn't he take his body? Because of all the pain and sadness he absorbed. What happens in life is engraved in our flesh. What will happen to his body? When we are finished, they will take this chest and bury it.
MrsShadow Story One The Binder What is this stuff? Ah, wow, all the junk in your old room. Is your dad turning it into the Tiki Bar he's always dreamed of?
And sometimes Howard puts on a striped shirt ... And we play "Where's Wolowitz." Here instead are us camped out in line for the Avengers panel. Boy, you guys sure sleep on the sidewalk. Yeah. It's very cold, but Raj discovered that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it warms you up.
And do you think they will believe you? You'd sell your ass on the sidewalk if I hadn't taught you common sense. You still doing cocaine, bitch? That's what rich people do. You are the ones who supply it to us.
Take the flask, put on the gown, and follow me. All clear. They're all at the ceremony. See, this light is there for a reason, so the crazy people don't open this door while the turbine's on. So... stand back while I open it.
- or La Brea Tar Pits? - I'd like to see the Hollywood sign. Oh, yes, it's nice. But check to make sure it's there. They take it down twice a week to clean it.
- We have to take you to the hospital. - Can you just answer me? Red... - And blue, right? - Yes. I think there's pressure on my language center and I have to figure out what's causing it.
I have to. Do you know why they never found Susanna's scarf? - It burned in the fire. I saw it two days ago. - The prosecutor's daughter was waving it.... - Mother. - Out the window like a toy.
With no one around. Good, Michelle. It narrows the field. We'll check places in the search area. We make a list, divide it between NCIS and FBI.
- What are you doing in my family cathedral? Didn't anyone tell you? It has become our family cathedral now. By Your Majesty's decision. The Capulets have been working on that church for generations. And now the Montagues will finish it.
Wouldn't that be the straw that broke the camel's back? The spark that has will bring war and raze our city to the ground. We have to find it. They cannot stay here. It is my duty to find it. I am the one and only prince. Hollow out the statue's head and fill it with colored oil, poke a small hole over the eyes, et voila....
Reason with him a little bit. What's the point, doctor? We know very well that he will not change his opinion. Samara and I will take Enterprise to a safe distance. Then we will enter the crack and close it.
Hey, hey, hey. All this anger and negativity stresses Riley out. Here. I'll hold it while you take a sip. You want to know what's really stressing me out? The fact that it's really cold here. Danny, could you grab my blue blanket? And if you can't find it, keep looking.
We lost some planes in the mission, but the War Department wanted it to be a total success. Nine bombers left and nine returned to base. The public was used to a sterilized, Hollywood version of the war. It's your first flight. Don't try to win the war alone. With John Wayne on screen, the war was secondary to the heroes fighting it.
"We don't need them anymore." Not only from a practical point of view, but also from a human point of view. After three days without any signs of Japan's failure, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. I invite, now, the representatives of the Japanese Empire, the Japanese government... SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ALLIED FORCES ...and Imperial Headquarters to sign the act of surrender at the points indicated. We pray that peace will be restored to the world and that Our Lord will preserve it forever.
I found it for you. The tunnel is under the tunnel on the left. Yikes. You weren't lying. The coke comes from Mexico through the tunnel and the trucks take it to Dallas.
Because I need to get my accordion from the elevator. I guess you're not going to go, so I have to go. No, I'll take it. Hey, don't feel like you have to, Todd. Look, I said I'll get it and I'll get it!
Are you okay? Are you hurt? Do you need help? I broke the bicycle! It was my birthday present and I broke it! They couldn't afford it, but they knew how much I wanted it.
Or you can stay here... And bond with us. I'm not going anywhere. And I will... I won't leave you. I had a feeling you would be here. I had a feeling you would find me. You followed me. Journalism is dead in America, but where I come from, if you want a story you go after it.
And although this is a holiday, I can't help but think of all the people who have yet to be afraid of.... And so, I promise that my love for you will be so great that it will give us the strength to never stop fighting for what is right. And then, I promise that every morning, when I wake up, hours and hours before you, and see your dirty ice cream cup in the sink, all crusty.... I will get angry... But then I'll rinse it off and put it in the dishwasher.
Ken, I'm glad you recognize your need to improve in that area. Carry on. See, that was fun. Thank you guys. I don't want Pat to think I'm not 100% committed to medicine, because I take it very seriously.
As partners. Partners. I want a percentage of the gross profits. No way. Zukor gave it to Mary Pickford in 1916.
See, this is the problem with your faction. You think truth is important to everyone, but we live in a post-truth world. Nobody wants boring facts. They want a good story. And the better the story, the more confidence they have in the person telling it.
I don't understand why I have to pay to see you here and then go out. I like the music. Is that what they call it?
- The machines can let us find Krilov. The EEG machine he stole from her is state-of-the-art. It receives updates from a main server. So it is part of a wireless network. Which we can use to track the machine, and also Krilov, when he turns it on.
- The fingerprints are not in the system. The killer took the wallet from the purse, but skipped the side pocket. The public transportation card. It was in a convenient place. He used it all the time.
They are, and so is Anna. But she also knows that if the treatment stops working, The extreme measures won't help. Look, we're not raising the white flag. It's in the worst case scenario. - You said she had a fever. - That's true, but we're treating her.
Now what are the people saying to you? They are saying, "protect us.... A: Clay How are you? "Make us feel safe." So. how do I solve this problem? I have a proposal... And I will tell it to you Cecilia, first, here and now.
Let us begin this emergency meeting of the school committee regarding the breakdown of Principal Shepherd. I know that many of our students have felt "traumatized" by the events of this week, and we take these concerns very seriously. Lois, I don't want the gum anymore. - I don't want it.
* I'm a very bubbly guy * It will be an exciting experience * Really! Really!!! # Now I don't want the gum anymore. I don't want it.
Coal only burns at a thousand degrees celsius, but if we create a twenty-thousand-volt lightning bolt, sending it onto the sand pit. It will create a glass barrier in the coal seam, preventing the flames from reaching the deposit. Okay, but how do you create it, lightning? Sand is an insulator. We wet it with saline solution to make it an electrical conductor.
I'll humor you. If, attached to this journal, you find a small skeleton dressed as an elf, you know why. After the incident at dinner, tensions rose. But some never lost hope. To be able to reach Allie, that bottle would have to cross the currents of the Antarctic Circle, get swept into the Benguela, get stuck in the South Equatorial Current, switch to the North Equatorial Current, find itself in the Gulf Stream, and hope that some fisherman in Florida would find it and hand it over.
The faults of the privileged athlete swept under the rug by those who think they are helping him. I am sure Mr. Fontino's family will enjoy the blood money as soon as Houston Spivey is selected. The lab says the blood in Fontino's trunk matches that of the victim. And he knew the murder weapon. He knew it but was unable to produce it, right?
Double espresso, right? Thank you. What is Pride doing here? - I'm moving your car, sir. - Leave it there.
I'm going to kill myself." You can do that. Just once. But you can do it. It's curious that even when life sucks, we prefer it to nothing.
Don't ask me this stuff." I don't know who Achilles' Mother is. If you know, don't shout it out. "It's Campampetes." Nobody cares. She had a question about Achilles, quite interesting. I will tell you.
We have the whole of Knowhere under control. The zombies are not just destroying everything. They are building a kind of weapon. A weapon for the Believers. And they want to take it to Xandar!
Francesca-have you ever seen this weapon? Don't answer that, Miss Doyle. What the hell is this? The murder weapon. Francesca, do you recognize it?
Because he did not want me to feel special on any day. When I was nine, he allowed me to throw my first party ...and ...it took me weeks to organize it. I sent out all the invitations. And she cancelled it the day before, without telling me anything.
Practically nothing, but -- maybe you can get something out of it. Thank you. Yes. I recognize the letter. I wrote it. I wouldn't call it a letter.
You won't believe what happened to me." - Did you get the tongs? - From where? What have you been doing all week? I took some clothes from Iman's cell before they cleared it out.
Get out of the car, please. - Get out of the car now. - Wait, no, no, officer. This is all my fault, all right? My father died and we were driving to Odessa to make arrangements and I just wasn't able to drive and she-. She very kindly offered to drive even though she had been working all night, so. if you have to give somebody a ticket, give it to me, please.
The biology of this hybrid is absurd. Look at the size of the ear canal. It is strikingly similar to that of marsupials using echolocation. Abe was on the right track with that hybrid frequency. They use it to communicate.
- It's still called. Sorry. She... She disappeared. A few days ago. She ran away. She's had a hard life. And yes, I take it personally.
I'm kind of like. Robin Hood. I steal from the rich -- and sell to the highest bidder. Dude, you need to see that movie again. In fact, I said "a little bit." Now... Black Badge wants it.
- No, someone who he thinks has nothing to do with us, like -- an undercover officer to go there as an elite athlete looking for help. It's going to take a good undercover cop to do that. Okay. He's going to Eddie's, isn't he? - It looks like he is. - Okay, I think he's keeping it elsewhere.
- Okay, just shut up, all right? The only time you should have opened your mouth was the only time in the last six months that you kept it shut. In case you missed it, and for an analyst there's absolutely no excuse, we're in a race here. Against the clock, a manslaughter trial, and Maxine Reynolds. You buy those drugs, present them to the court, free Nate, and we're back to square one.
He said no. - I said we need a foundation. - What about the drug Tyler was taking? - Is CNAC still trying to find it? - I think so, and if they find it, they will deliver it,
In fact, man, can you do us a favor? - Yeah. - Hey, Thommo, throw the keys. Listen, Shannon has to run some errands for me, okay? If you go with him and get Thommo's car, that's where they stopped him yesterday, and then bring it back to his house?
Where did Holly Winshaw get it from? I had sexual relations with Amber. And if Amber kept a condom ... this Winshaw, who is very clever, very sharp and smart ... always knows everything ... who knows what she did? Why would Holly fabricate evidence against her? They had gone into business together. They had decided to set up this business-they were running it well.
Here you go. - Thank you. - Eyes wide open. Nice song. Yeah, they play it in nightclubs.
But no. Warning. Pirates. Hey, where's the cabin? Barracuda wants us to take it apart.
They do it a couple of times. Then they get up close and do a close-up shot where there is only... You only see three of the characters. And when they come out of that scene, we have the whole room in mind because we've seen it before. But actually, when they are shooting it, the rest of the room is not there.
You see, I care about how detainees are treated. So, you will tell the court exactly what you just told us. Did you hear what I said to you? I found myself alone against everyone. This is about my career. I'm -- I'm not going to jeopardize it with an official statement.
Okay. Please turn around again. I need to see your hands, put them here. Can you raise your head? Let me see your neck. Take off your shirt and give it to the officer.
I'm not sure. We just... Just got there. I remember this orange carpet. And that song... Frankie... They used to put it on all the time.
What was it? That's our treasure! Stay away from it. You will be cursed. I remove the curse from me and send it back to you.
- Dad, I'm just saying. Because I know how hard it is to keep a long-lasting relationship alive. Trust me, I've been there twice. Even more than that, I guess. In fact, Mike and I are... Moving the relationship, keeping it alive.
Come on, into the bathroom. This is the common space. Suitable for resting. As you can see, I planned it for a long stay. The aquaponic system purifies the air and renews it.
Over there. There is a small beach. We made it! Come on Tatty-give her a name. I hereby name it, "Walker Island." And I declare it ours.
- And me buying an island. - You don't really buy an island. - No? - No. I know a guy who knows Warren Buffett's bridge partner. I'll offer him some shares in my company in exchange for Warren Buffett's cell phone number, then I'll look up Warren Buffett with my app, access millions of dollars in venture capital, buy my island and populate it with porn stars.
I'm not sure of myself. If they ask me "paper or plastic," I say, "Which is easier for you," you know? Yes, your modesty doesn't fool me. I will give you a choice. You can use your unique position for evil, killing the president, starting a war, bringing the country to its knees -- or you can use it for good.
I would rather you avoid. - I do now. - Please don't. Let me go ! Not until you take off my straitjacket and put it on yourself.
Something will come to me. Here, eat your dinner. I don't like this stuff, Shay. - Well, you have to eat it. - But I don't want it.
I don't like this stuff, Shay. - Well, you have to eat it. - But I don't want it. - Alice, please. - I don't want it!
‚ô™ Can work for repression ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Tear down the wall, bring down governments ‚ô™ ‚ô™ How can you refuse? ‚ô™ Come the hour of fury anger can be strength ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Do you know you can use it?
But I won the meeting. Everybody saw it. - Can they take the belt away from me? - They, they can. They will take it away from you if you don't defend it.
We saw your island across the sea and thought, 'What could they be doing? ' But there is no other place but here. Yes, there is, and that's where we come from. We call it the Island of Pigs.
An island was spotted a few miles away. That's impossible. We are who knows where in the Philippine Sea. You don't know where we are. We will find a current, and we will ride it to the island.
I didn't touch him. I didn't touch him, the old man. I didn't even... The man wanted revenge. And he got it.
- See you later, Mr. Paul. - See you later. Go sit down, baby. Well, then, I'll go on. As I told you, the cow is a ruminant, which means it ruminates. So she eats the grass one time, but without chewing it, and then she brings it up from her stomach and chews it calmly.
I never leave home without it. I just got a new one yesterday. They are magical. Essentially, the secret of my career lies in this box. Almost everyone can use it, but no one knows it.
What about Vanderbilt? Everything I have I have sweated for. Not like them, by connections and bribes to politicians. If I want the land, you know what I do. I take it.
Before me it was just old men waiting their turn to miss the ball. Barry. Can we open a window? It stinks in here. I can open a door Alex, so you can use it to get out.
It never ends, even the elevator boy wants something from you on the way to the room. The maid wants something in the hotel. Nothing sexual, they want your time and energy and it's like politicians, you're on the floor 24 hours a day. John was the first to get fed up, he was agitated and frustrated with what was being written, especially from 1965 onward. Richard Lester said a song was needed. John started it and by the time I got to him he had written a good part of it. And he told me it was kind of autobiographical.
I'm David Larraine. Yeah, I got your number, you piece of shit, and listen, you know that thing you were looking for at my house? Well, you know what? I've got it. If you want it, I need you to meet me at the southwest corner of Blake and Van Nuys on the 6th morning, 3:00.
You are leaving. The sword cannot be kept here. Where are you taking it? I don't want to give you the burden of this information. Too many people would be looking for it.
Right now he is riding to come to you and take the sword. Go. I must have the sword with me. You know. - You will be killed if you take it.
Are you okay? Hi. Hi. Were you sleeping in my room? Yes, it was my room. That's what Dad called it. 'Cory's room.'
He still has that thing tied to the tree. He was out here swinging the bat.... I was just coming home. He swung the bat and it fell. Apparently, as he swung it, he had a smile on his face -- and then, it just fell.
Continued. - He used to sing me the Molahonkey song. - The what? Molahonkey's song! I thought everybody knew it.
In fact, no. There's something pinching my neck. It's a label. Do we have scissors in the bag? I don't know, Clark. Believe it or not, it's rare that I make it.
I had to chat with a stranger for half an hour.... That's fine-and prove to be welcoming. I think they're having weddings next week. You know what? I'm going to create a new special pin for the Dandelions. It will be really big, so everyone will notice it.
I was jealous because of the incident in the steam room. It's a crazy thing. It's something I could do. Once, in high school, a girl hit on my boyfriend. I cut off her ponytail in her sleep and wore it to school for a month.
These people depend on us! First of all, it is always summer here. We live in the desert. And second, that promise is still valid. And 100 percent valid, and I will keep it, in an hour.
London? But it's a very bad surprise. You know I hate London. Besides, you promised that we would -- always celebrate Christmas here in New York. You see, honey, life doesn't always turn out the way -- the way we want it to.
The machines keep his body alive, but he is gone. Do you see those diodes? They release a microdischarge to the frontal lobe. Even though the brain is clinically dead, the discharge activates the neurons one last time--and allows us to rebuild the neural network. And then you transfer it to the other person's head?
It is the same woman from the hospital. We can't stay here and we can't trust the consulate. Flatterers in the excrement. This is not correct. If there is a plague, how many governments would want it?
Well, you are more lucid. Yes, I am. What is your middle name? Well, I am. Zobrist is dead, but if the plague is real -- this map is a trace he left for somebody to find.
How do we help you? During Justinian's plague ... 5,000 people died every day on the streets of Istanbul. The border between east and west, another entrance. That's why he chose it. If the envelope is intact, we can contain it ... but if someone breaks it before we arrive ... within seven days at most ... 95 percent of the world's population will be infected.
After the visitors, the FBI came, and after the FBI some guys in dark suits. - So you want to give me to them? - To give them the project. And what are they going to do with it? When a scientist proposes a theory, he exposes it to the world, and people can do what they want with it.
- We are a family, Mr. Paczynski. Apparently your gene pool needs disinfectant. The feds are coming. You should have taken the money. This chick offers you the goose that lays the golden egg, and you want to cook it.
And, like them, we had a dream. Could we have created real and genuine magic? I guess one of you realized the dream, but not her. Right? That is what he would have you believe. My idea was a perfect blend of elegance and technology, but Owen wanted it for himself, so he humiliated me by divulging my private files to the board of directors, convincing them I was a lunatic.
You trust your parents blindly. You let them take care of everything and you wait in the car. And-open your eyes, wake up. Go. Excuse me, these people are following me. Then we have to infiltrate the lab and take the card to the market right away, where I'll deliver it to the Eye so we can go home.
"It's not important how you hit, what's important is how you can withstand the blows and have the strength to get back up." That's from Rocky. Yes, but when you said it, it made me think of life. Even though he was referring to boxing. No, he meant it metaphorically in the movie, so...
There was. - There is. - Now. Yes. So you're missing it.
We are almost there. The power is there, we are waiting for the Internet connection. Come on, come on! Technology. It's only good when imbeciles don't use it.
Well, he was a bad kisser. He used to do this weird thing with his tongue. - Wait. - Yeah. What was he doing? Something like that? Or sometimes he'd put it there and move it around quickly, like.
Where did you learn this song, Dad? From my parents. And they learned it from their parents. And so on and so forth. And one day you too will sing it to your children.
I know the kind of Mutants you are looking for. And I know where to find them. This is my first time in America. I am looking forward to learning about your culture. You certainly won't know it here.
Yurei. Different from ghosts. The forest uses them to deceive you. Do you know why you should not leave the path? Because if you get lost, and you have sadness in your heart, they will use it against you.
I occupied the place between Heinrich Heine and Spinoza. Bahia Province, Brazil January 1941 ...quite different depending on the region. They can last for 20 years, but here they usually last 5 years. Sugar cane can last 5 years. We cut it right above the ground, from the stem.
Yeah. All right, now... Let's get going. I'll be right back. Take your coin and put it in through the bottom of the bottle.
Slam that coin into the bottom of the bottle. - Wonderful. Great. Let's do it again from the beginning, and fix it on the run. You're going to take your coin and stick it in this...
He knows, all right? The only time I had used 'other people's defense' was for a bar fight where my client intervened between two arguing, and shot one's head off. I lost. It's hard for a jury to understand how intent to kill can arise based on another's behavior. They always see it as two against one.
There are pieces of cars and people everywhere, in trees. So I run down to help, putting people in cabs, wherever they would take it. I grab a guy, and his leg comes off. It separates from his body. I put it in the car with him, then off with another and then another.
I will chastise you! Do you want to be chastised? Chastised? Listen, that stuff doesn't give the power to create life-it's a magnet for death. And if you don't put it away, bad things will come after it.
You have a scholarship to a local college. And even though we can't afford the dorm, you have to keep me as your new roommate. Actually, I have -- I have a good idea about that. What if we set up Mike's room, and you sign up on Airbnb or something? Maybe it's time that we finally -- review his stuff and maybe give it to charity.
All right. Thank you. A lighthouse? I love it. Thank you. Well, a very wise person once said -- and this was today, earlier, he said the lighthouse represents the thing you want most. So whatever it is, I hope you get it.
I felt the real anger It was like it was done to me again and ... I thought if I could. If I could, I'd want to go to her house and I'd want to go and.... find her sitting at the kitchen table, I'd want to take her long blond hair with my hand, And I'd want to pull her head back I'd pull her head right back And then I'd throw it on the floor,
Why did Mellizo get the hard drive before us? I don't know, but we have something. It's from years ago. Early in his political career. The first office, won in the election. Valencia, in '95. She didn't get an absolute majority. With everyone against, she needed an abstention to get elected. And she got it.
I am so ashamed. I don't have the right. I have no right... Can you imagine what life will be like in 2,000 years? Let's see if we make it a little better this time.
Enjoy your pen. Go ahead, you son of a bitch! Mr. Abrams, put that gun down! You didn't think I'd be able to do it, did you? Put it down and step away from the weapon.
Yes, well. I would need to purchase an auger. Wait... Wait... How are you going to pay for it? Well, my people will contact you and we'll arrange it, that's right.
I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a defeated man resigned to take refuge in his work. I made myself indispensable -- and in the process, I was laying the groundwork for my revenge. We call it the "Black Death."
None of this is her fault, Kate. The witch can go to anyone, but she goes takes advantage of the weak. She takes advantage of their fears, because once you believe, she keeps coming. Believe, that's how she finds you. Like a signal, a light that draws her.
Beginning today, we will obstruct this decree. Let the real battle begin. It's not about the Constitution. It's that those who have more want to keep what they have, at the expense of those who have nothing,-and feel good about it, too. - Yes, but the way he puts it down, wrapping himself in the American flag, is convincing.
He's like any other politician, he does what it takes to get elected. But I think he really cares about civil rights. We have a chance, Bob. A real chance. The best one in hundreds of years, and I'm not throw it away.
She was a little bit of a joker. A little bit. Seriously? Okay. So who's going to get it?
Where is Grim? Thank you. I know where he is. He's out there rotting. There's some filth in those woods and Cousin Henry is spreading it.
Nothing pays, but you can drink what you drink at the bar. What is the last song on the set list? The song is called Nora. Good. When I hear it, I'll know you're almost done.
It carries a lot of blood fast. Dr. Marks-the patient is in a precarious state. Are you sure an incision is medically necessary? You need circulation. I'm giving it to you.
Yes, it's good. What do you have? Nothing. Dear God, I thank you for everything I have. I am immensely happy with my life and everything about it.
If he needs help with the children ... Or if you simply need some time alone ... I would be happy to take care of them. Thank you, I appreciate it very much. But let's look at each other,this is the first time we've met and we're standing here swapping sob stories. You know what? I'm going to bake a cake ... And I'm going to bring it to you guys.
- What's wrong with him? He doesn't want to play. Can you let him out? - Open the door, please! - Did they really lock us in? Open the door before I break it down!
It is his upside-down way of making the Earth pay. What if he is telling the truth? Do you believe him? I believe we need a full investigation of the fusion engines in question. And you will see it late tonight at the intelligence meeting.
- Why did you do that? Sorry, Frank. We thought you were some wanker who bought the mountain. I'm the wanker who bought the mountain. - What? - I'm turning it into a members-only resort for billionaires who want to bang their trophy sluts in private.
- Useless to keep it if you don't use it. - I use it. - She needs maintenance. - I take care of it. - You can't do it yourself.
- His real name is Wylis. And he was able to speak and fight.... And then... What's wrong? The Three-Eyed Raven says a war is about to start. And are we going to fight it in there?
And don't tell Sister Monica Joan. Are you sure you can share them, Fred? It wouldn't hurt her to gain weight, unlike me. Married life is great, but the waistline is a little less so. I find her in great shape.
You were very rude! Poor Delia was trying to help you. I know. If I had a bad day like yours, I think I would be touchy, too. Taste Violet's jam before Sister Monica Joan sees her.
It's like a bird's nest. Look. Hot water whenever you need it. Room for a refrigerator. She doesn't even have to take down the trash, just throw it down the chute.
- Kenneth Parker smokes, he's younger than me. - You're playing with fire. - If I catch you with a cigarette again.... - What are you going to do? - Are you going to light it for me?
See, I'm nothing but an incurable romantic. It's a wonderful idea. But on one condition. Which is? If you promise to bring the box of sweets and fill it with sherbet lollipops.
Take them to the kitchen. We will eat them at the end of the meeting. - 1957: In the United States, the pill was initially approved as a treatment for menstrual disorders. - 100 PERCENT EFFECTIVE. But hundreds of thousands of American women now take it as a contraceptive.
Every time she sees one at the recreation center she rushes to it! Why spend so much, when she is overjoyed with a basket of sticks and pinecones? Just in time for bacon! Where is your scarf? It's my school scarf, I wear it during school days. Today is Saturday.
-Inside. I'll think about it. - I'll be here all night. -Perfect. I have a gun in my locker, and I think I'll use it.
No. I'm staying with you. You can find me downstairs. I have to break up with him before I leave Libya. Why do you leave me at the D while you have a party? About this ambassador thing, I don't buy it.
Hey. It's okay. I'll see you soon. You trust me, don't you? Because I'm entrusting you with the future of the entire human race. I would like to show you how you will save it.
This thing is bad for Israel, for America, for Jews, for everybody. It's bad for everybody, that's why I want to help. How can you help? It's a political war 10,000 kilometers away. Eshel's rivals found this story ridiculous and will use it to sink him.
Are you sure you don't want to spend the night here? Drinking some fine brandy...and a couple of choice young girls, in the cellar...I ask Abner to strum something on the violin...and we sit around the fire...telling some old stories. eh? No. We'd better get back before the sun goes down All right, as you wish But I'd gladly accept that bottle of brandy, if you can give it to me.
I mean -- it's not like I'm going to get elected, here -- and then look like an idiot. Oh, shit. Well, children, today we have a very special treat. One of the older students has written an original children's fairy tale, and now he's going to read it to you. Come on in, Eric.
I always try to put my best foot forward. And that's how I get into trouble. Once... You'll like this one. There was this lady, and her grandmother used to make these German apple pancakes. She wanted that recipe but she couldn't find it, so I go, there's a site called 'Storm Front' and it's like a neo-Nazi site.
Isn't that right, partner? I don't know. Hey, Walt, you want a beer? - You got any beer? - Yeah, I keep it stashed in a little fridge in the garage.
- Do you think this is difficult? - Well, the new owners, you know how it is. The new owners don't intend to keep the sawmill at all, Jack, and you know that as well as I fucking do. Who's going to buy a sawmill that's been running at a loss for five years, huh? They're going to turn it into a fucking farm for tourists, for UFO hunters, or? or a goddamn art gallery that will make paper from coconut palms from the fucking Amazon or some other bullshit!
Traditions die hard in America. It makes me very sad. What needs to happen for them to understand the situation? And so your solution would be to limit violence to video games? Well, we would never contain it, but we can direct it.
- Hey. Nina got a good picture of the shooter's face from the footage. - Yes? - Yes. Are the officers showing it in the neighborhood?
It's all right. I don't mind waiting for you. Would you get me a sausage and onion pizza? Really? Okay. I'll bring it to you in a bag, the kind that keeps it nice and hot.
But only if you eat breakfast. - Dorsa? - Yes? Have you seen my videotape? - No. - It was here, but now I can't find it.
Curly, Charlie. In the kitchen, five minutes. Actually on the train they told us we would find cocaine. Jeremiah, John, in the kitchen, come on. I swear to God those cavalry pricks are looking for it.
I have been around the world. I've seen more things than all of you put together. And across the sea -- there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros at least as much as we do. A person with a huge army, three huge dragons -- and no husband. I will build the fleet. I will loiter there...and I will deliver it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my huge bird.
I see. Three lords... enter a tavern. A Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order beer, but when the manager brings it each of them finds a fly in their mug. The Lannister, indignant, shrugs off the mug and asks for another. The Martell removes the fly and swallows it.
- You will be under observation. - Obviously! ECK. This room was mine. - Should I give it back to you?
This room was mine. - Should I give it back to you? - That would be fair. - It's my room now, though. - Shall we play for it?
- What happened? - A ravine. He fucked up. - At the mills? - No, a clandestine thing, new. A much bigger race, they call it Italian Race.
- Do you know why you don't improve? - Because we don't have the money for race simulations and targeted testing? - We don't understand each other. You're improving control and grip, but you're afraid of anticipation. You have to anticipate the corner when you don't see it yet.
- You can't even stand up. - I've never been this good. - I'm a splinter! - Should I give you a car? What if you break it?
Thank you, Scrabble. To know that Kubo has someone to watch over him when I'm gone.... That would be a nice ending to my story. Your story will never end. It will be told by him and the people he tells it to.
To know that Kubo has someone to watch over him when I'm gone.... That would be a nice ending to my story. Your story will never end. It will be told by him and by the people he will tell it to. And by the people to whom they will tell it.
That would be a good ending to my story. Your story will never end. It will be told by him and by the people to whom he will tell it. And by the people to whom they will tell it. And by the people those people will tell it to and the people those people will tell it to.
What is this melody? A long time ago... I could swear my grandmother used to sing it to me. Before I was sold. There was a man on the plantation, he played an old African guitar, he.... - I think he used to play it too.
This song is mine. Nobody here can have it. All right. All right. I'll wait for you to share it with me.
Night, where are you going? To take a walk. - Are you the mother or the sister? - For you, neither. And I know a hyena when I see one.
What did you do? Oh, come on, Sandy. I could totally get over those losers. I'll believe it when I see it. I got it! # ‚ô™ What's playing on the radio? * Why do I start swaying back and forth? # ‚ô™I've never heard that song before‚ô™ ‚ô™But if I never hear it again‚ô™
- Again, come on. Round two. Look at that fucking face, John. Look at that expression. Now he's feeling it.
Okay. My necklace. The one you gave me on our first anniversary. It's on the nightstand. Would you get it for me, please, honey?
It's the same. In any case, it's better than my slut mother's goulash, isn't it? Where are the kids? Ring the bell again. I doubt they'll hear it.
That's right. I'm on your tail, you shifty little bastard. Gina, come on, he can socialize on the Internet in the van too. Okay, cool, I just need to tie my shoe real quick. I'm lacing it up.
The point is, "The envious will always be there. Ignore them." Taylor Swift, she is always right. I am so sensitive to bullies because I had one in my family. My father. He was a cruel man who hated his own life and took it out on me.
Sorry. Dev. our future, everything, depends on this sale. But the company is over. I mean, there's nothing left. And even if I can make this thing work, the Germans will tear it apart when they realize there's nothing there.
It's an electronic cigarette, Pa. Katherine Heigl uses it. Smoking kills, folks. Where's the pipe, Jackie Lynn? I was holding it, and a hawk grabbed it.
We have to work together. We need to talk to Wadsworth's widow. I know I-I shouldn't have slept with Evelyn, but to be clear, we hadn't established any ground rules for the break. Oh, God, I can't stand the tactic of silence. My father used it all the time.
The view. Still no signal, huh? Do you remember that guy Ryan? The one I did the short films for that went to Sundance? He sent me a script he's working on and he really wanted me to show it to the producer of the film I shot last June.
It was -- it was better that way. No, do not be afraid. I here, in the presence of Emilia, guarantee your place. Be assured. If I make a promise to a friend, I keep it to the last.
Lovers say, "He's a very special octopus because he can play "any instrument on earth better than anyone." The bear says, "Bullshit!" So, he goes behind the bar, and he picks up the guitar that's back there. And the octopus -- he looks at it and plays it better than anyone who has ever played it before.
- Yes, thank you. Gregory, listen to me. We need you to deliver by Tuesday. Tell your friends on the Moldova that they need you to leave in the morning. Maybe this room is as you remember it, sir--even though the bathrooms have been remodeled.
Also, there is Roper's secret study in the bedroom. But no one can enter there. You can though, because you are special? No, neither am I. He calls it "The Fortress." There is only one key -- and he keeps it hidden.

Let me show you something. - Dammit. SATAN LIVES - We could build a fence. - No. No, they would easily climb over it.

What do I know! You're the geek, as long as it's cheap. Come on, get moving. I see you got your old car back. Yeah, the kidney people didn't want it.
I feel a little bit like -- like Carnac. Do you remember Johnny Carson doing Carnac? That he used to give the answers before the questions. Like -- that Ed gives him the envelope, right? Johnny puts it on his forehead -- and then gives him the answer. Something like. "Leave everything to the beaver."
But I think I can work it out. When my eyes don't hurt, I mean. What the... what the hell is this? It's music, you idiot. I know music when I see it.
That's all. I mean, look at us. We're just air conditioners. I mean, after all, all we do is roam the planet, breathing, - conditioning the air. - Right. I make it warm, that makes it cold.
If you want to leave this place -- you have my consent. Although, somehow -- I don't think you have any intention of leaving. No, I don't. And I think you know I'm not going to allow you to call a vote to determine...how many are willing to follow you, risking letting you sap my strength...taking away an influential minority. No, I don't expect you to do that. So we have a fleet and two men competing for it.
I am afraid ... that we have made a terrible mistake. I understand what you see in them... Silver and Flint. But -- but their relationship is so unstable -- and we have placed our lives in their hands. Those men ... have elevated their positions, because ... they are unparalleled when it comes to bending the world to their will. They create a narrative...and use it to bend the minds and hearts of men.

This is Harris, tell me. No, no, no, no, yes, I understand. Yes. Yes. He said no. And even if they wanted hostage pizza, and they don't, the hostage takers wouldn't eat it because they know we would put soporifics in it.
I didn't... knew if you were coming, and we couldn't get your room fixed up. - I told you I was coming. - Actually, no. I haven't heard from you in weeks. Sorry, honey, we use your room as kind of a storage room. That's fine.
We have special permission. - They all say that. - We just need the room for a few minutes to conduct research. Yes, they all say that. I've never seen a patient get so much attention, especially one like him who doesn't deserve it at all.
And the story got out of hand. I was supposed to -- I was supposed to die from a stray arrow -- and not from a sword stroke. No one ... will mount me on horseback. And I will not win the battle after my death. I will win it for you.
Did the real Cid die because of you? Yes. Twenty years ahead of schedule. And the story got out of hand. And I will not win the battle after my death. I will win it for you.

This flu killed fifty million people in one year. Five times as many as World War I. But it happened in. 1918. - Almost a century has passed. - And the population has lost immunity. If we bring it back here, it will happen like in America, when the conquistadors brought smallpox to the New World, and millions of natives died.
With Dr. Vargas will talk later. How were they able to stop the pandemic? Unfortunately, we were not able to stop it. It simply disappeared after a year. I couldn't even stop them from calling it "Spanish."
How were they able to stop the pandemic? Unfortunately, we were not able to stop it. It simply disappeared after a year. I couldn't even stop them from calling it "Spanish." I read that they called it that because only Spain did not censor the news.
Colorado. I hope you enjoy the accommodation. I'm so sorry to hear that. This is the bedroom. You probably call it... "Boudoir."

It's boring. Father said we can do whatever we like. Father used to say. only boring people get bored. So did mine. I, on the other hand, thought that only boring people ... don't feel boredom, so they don't conceive of it in others.
- Marty, please, please! Just two minutes. - Two minutes! - Okay, but I smell desperation. Yes, I smell it now, too.

But for Arnold that was not enough. He didn't care about--a semblance of intellect or mental faculties. He wanted it to be real. He wanted to create ... consciousness. He imagined it as a pyramid.
Who said that? I don't understand. The sahib, Mr. Charlie. I just can't keep it. I don't want it.
So. Back this way. - It's heavy. - Yeah. Do you mind if we put it down for a minute?

I'm really tired ... of always having to hide, of moving from place to place. I've lived in the shadow of the noose for so long -- I'm used to it. But these poor people. You preach rebellion. Is it rebellion -- to fight against injustice wherever you encounter it?
- It is under control. - They killed a man. - No, they didn't. That's not what the authorities say. They will be looking for them. And who will take care of the people in the Zone if they shut it down?

His sociopathic son punched a boy in the throat. The boy did not report it for fear of reprisal. That boy has a torn windpipe and won't be able to sing at nationals. So I don't give a damn where the violence came from and why. - I don't want it in my school.
He is angry and lost. To find him, she would have to teach herself again, but along the way she decided she had had enough of learning. It is too painful to keep learning. Well, I think we all face the same despair, Mrs. Winchell. We each handle it in our own way.
The mother died very young. Father was an actor. In the 1950s he ended up on McCarthy's blacklist and could no longer find work. He must have died an alcoholic. Jesus Christ, every time you tell this story you make it blacker and blacker.

- Excuse me? - Now, you're going to put the sample in that briefcase, and then you're going to give it to me. Ms. Frost, you don't know what this stuff is capable of. On the contrary, I'm the only one who knows what it's capable of. Now give it to me.

And here I thought magic was about breaking rules. Like defeating the laws of nature, etc. E... Those people... My God, they had poles up their asses. I don't take it that seriously.
I don't think it will last much longer. It would be better to do it now. I have arranged many plans Mr. Hawkes. This one is very peculiar. I don't see why the law can't help us while we're breaking it.
- I'm talking about your retirement party. That was fun. I still have a few years left, Marty. What, I swear to God, I found this old lamp and every time I rub it, and a genie pops out and grants me any wish I want.
It's Snot Rocket! And Barrycuda the Amoeba. No one expected such a thing. Full Package, there's only one thing still keeping you alive -- that pretty face! And that belt. But I'm going to rip it off you.
The purpose of my visit was achieved in a better way without having made too much fuss. May I ask what was the purpose? To assess whether or not Mansion House was adequate to receive the first lady. E? Singora Lincoln is not afraid of real life, Dr. Summers, she welcomes you.
I can and I will. Get him the fuck out of my sight. Loyalty is everything to me. I deserve it and I demand it. Now -- let's get to work. Yo, Tommy, that shit with Chuleta, man, I hear it from everybody.
- No! I never back down from a fight. That's not how you change things, Christophe. You both know well... that the enemy never offers victory. - You have to take it!
- Did you find anything? - Negative, Kojak, we're still looking. Get moving, Charlie. We have to find the formula. We'll find it, we'll give it to these Nazis, and the nightmare will be over.
I'm trying to find a solution. Max? Shit. He's right about not giving up the formula. But it doesn't matter if we don't find it.
Yes, I think so. Sorgo. Hey, give me a hand with this. Let's turn it upside down. I don't think we can do it.
No, it would have killed both of us and my daughter as well. That would have been my punishment. He has a gun. What? He keeps it in our bedroom as a threat.
- Yes, indeed. Your mother died of alcoholism after... your father was expelled -- for stealing a drug to save your life. You've been through a lot, it's undeniable. And what do you do...with this second chance, given to you by your father, who paid for it with his own life? He wastes it -- by setting fire to the arresting officer's quarters.
My work is done. I just place this in the director's booth. So-what do you know about this conference? I know that it's small, secret, and only a few nations are attending. They call it "a symposium on alien contagion."
However, however, they must be given credit. They know how to set up a story. How do we find Simon? He will be in the most secure room in the building. Trust me, we will know it when we see it.
That's something I've always liked about you. You know what? I was going to let Howie and Russell beat the crap out of you, but for old times' sake I'm going to let you leave in one piece. You want to know something funny? I didn't even know I had that map. But as soon as I heard you were looking for it, I made sure to find it and secure it.
I wish I could invent a machine that would erase his memory from my brain. You know, some people say sativa is a memory-erasing machine. I know it's funny, Gar, but I'm not in the mood right now. Hey, free beer to everyone who helps us carry the rest of the stuff. Why the fuck should we work for free beer when these hipster assholes are paying us for treating them like shit?
What you say. Do I think the car is wonderful? Sure. Did the community pray for it? For sure. Do my friends expect me to drive it because I posted it on Facebook and tagged them? Janice Sheffield I never would have guessed it Pierre Cardin Edwards You look great!
So I'm going to build a cedar chest for my sweaters. Are you going to build a cedar chest? That's right. You. - You're going to build it?
I understand that you are angry. Why don't you go home? You take a couple of days, like a week. You've suffered a loss. If you knew my father, - you wouldn't call it a loss.
The witness is a Mr. Gregory, collecting bets. He was making his rounds and saw on the sidewalk a woman who looked like Ingrid to him. A car stopped and she got in. Did he happen to get the license plate? Strange is checking it now.
What he could bring. Why on earth would anyone want to keep a tiger here? How could he afford to feed it in the first place? I don't think he did. I think he was keeping it for someone who could afford it.
I believe in the redemptive power of sleep. It sweeps away molecular waste in our brains. Molecular waste? Jesus. What if it's the good stuff that gets swept away instead? It has to be found first.
If Jay escaped. Would you go after him? No. We don't act for personal reasons. It's the law. And these fugitives are violating it.
Since our mother died. Would you be... so kind as to... Play something for us? Sure, I'd love to. This song reminds me of my childhood friend Mary. We used to play it together all the time.
Paul. why are we still losing pieces from the heat shield? We're working with the prototype capsule, Al. - It's a third of the size. - I understand that, so... do we need to turn the million-dollar fan down, Karl? - Do we turn it off?
It happened with Shepard, it happened with Grissom. But it can't happen with Glenn. Now, the Atlas rocket... can push us into orbit. It goes up, takes the capsule into an elliptical orbit. Gravity holds it back, but it goes so fast it keeps missing Earth.
And I take off your shirt very slowly. No, no, no, it's a blouse. - I unbutton it very slowly... - No, no, no, rip it off. - I take it off, I took it off.

Amen. Amen. Amen. I was thinking that we could go back to our old house. The owner told me it is available if we want it.
Schrodinger's cat. I see that I have left you open-mouthed in my artistic gifts. Schrodinger put his cat in a box with poisoned food. Now, until he opens the box, the cat is, theoretically, both alive and dead. But when he opens it, he will say, "Hello, Felix" or. "Goodbye, Sylvester."
Probably not. It's going to be okay. I know you probably won't believe this, but Theo is looking for the same thing. The last Chimera, you say? He doesn't call it that.
It's going to be okay. I know you probably won't believe this, but Theo is looking for the same thing. The last Chimera, you say? He doesn't call it that. Then what does he call it?
But it was stolen. And how did it get there at school? I have no idea. I mean-that car was a piece of junk even back then. Imagine who would ever want it now.
We felt differently when he put us at the door. - Girls. - For five years. And each officer in our police precinct took the case not only seriously, but personally.

We believe we know what the murder weapon was, and we will find it.
But he told us what he might have in mind. How do you bring down a ci... - Oh, no. - What? I was thinking what would happen if he used the electronic bomb to knock out the Internet. If he used it in the right way -- to overload the power grid, shut down hospital machinery, cause water main failures... it could -- it could claim victims all over the city.
When the ancient Homo Magi forged these idols, they made them in the image of those whose power they wanted to channel, so attention to detail is critical. There is one missing piece. The Ribalvei stone. They must have hidden it elsewhere. Find it. Or Genesis will not be what you and your daughter have to fear.
- I was trying to understand, as Felic... - Yeah. Okay. We're busy. HIVE caused the Havenrock explosion.

And it is dated a week before our wedding! There was a time when the president of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas fan club got a lot of mail. I don't know what to do, Bonnie. Why would Peter write a letter to another woman before our wedding? - Why don't you open it and read it?
And fixed over time. And there the sedatives kick in. You don't believe in ghosts, do you? No. Doc, you have to open your mind... Before someone opens it for you.

- Okay. Good. I would also like to ask you if you still have the clothes you were wearing that night. Okay. - I think so. If you haven't washed them yet, put them in a paper bag and tape it shut.
Is Brett Ratner's career on the patio? How cold! I'll tell you what: you sign my permission and I'll lend you my pressure washer. Do you think it's powerful enough? Let's just say ... the Statue of Liberty uses it to shower ... which she rarely does, because she's French.
You have to immerse yourself in the past, Sarah. Completely. Find out what was going on in your parents' lives 30 years ago. Find out what was buried in that house. No one ... after lighting a lamp, puts it in a cellar ... so that those who enter can say they saw the light.
You do not believe in God, but that should not agitate you. Even if you are the pope. There is still another way that will enable you to find the people and things you seek, even if you don't see it now. Because the only things you see before you now are your doubts, and darkness. Show me this other way. Please. If I point it out to you, the adventure ends.
Father, you missionaries do not seem to know Japan. You, honorable Inquisitor, do not seem to know Christianity. Some consider your religion a curse. I do not. I see it differently, but still dangerous.

But that's a problem of old vampires, isn't it? They don't mind modernity, unlike your friend here who majored in computer science and also wrote an article on the Dark Web.

Is this what you want? Do you realize that becoming like him will only increase your already great suffering? Lucien cannot save you from yourself. Just as Tristan could not, and neither could I. For that matter. You've spent centuries trying to cure your madness, yet you haven't even come close. Curb that wicked tongue or I will tear it from your wicked skull.
- What if I were a weight? I've been training, I can punch a lot, but a real fight? Cami, that's the whole point of being afraid. If you have to do the thing that scares you, then all that fear is useless. You either turn it into anger or you leave it at the door.
Thank you. Humans ... think of evolution only in terms of progress and technological advancement. This last act will represent the catalytic event that will trigger a new era here on Earth. It will be comparable to the meteorite that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and the beginning of the Great Ice Age. I am honored, sir -- in my own small way. Once we land, you will take the briefcase and place it exactly where I showed you.
- That's great. - Great? Is it your GI Joe black humor, like, "Ha ha, we're all going to die"? It means your information is reliable. If the Red Berets are manning the station, it means they are using it for something.

The wish that when my time comes I may swell my chest with strength and for the sake of dear old Scotland..." All right, you little monsters! You have awakened the shame of Scotland. Willie, you know you can't play that torturing trumpet to the children. Then I'll just use it for smoking.
Bravo, you should be a psychologist. Yes, all right. I'm just saying that sometimes you should listen to others. Now I'm listening to you. Take a few minutes, fiddle with the ladder, do whatever you want, then bring it back and get your money back.
- I am. In this country, you can become whatever you want. And now, go for it! I want you to look at the tip of the pen. Only with your eyes, follow it.
But I think this new treatment will succeed in changing things. It will make her come back to us. Will I catch Mom's disease, too? No. Only women get it.
But like hell! Either that or you'll wear orange for the rest of your days. In orange, mom. Without accessories. You've had 30 years to make that call, and we both know you won't make it.
Some good people have been lost along the way. And, perhaps worse, some good people simply lost their way. Tough day. I realized that no one has lost or sacrificed more than you. And I think you don't get much sympathy because you don't ask for it.

There are much bigger pawns in play. - You're out of your mind. - You know what it is, what it can do. Stick. You got attached to that thing, Stick. If you don't want to kill it, I will.
Okay, here's the plan. Get Frank talking. Connect the dots between the colonel and the neurologist. You don't have to prove Frank's version is true. We just have to convince the jury that he believes it and relives it every day.
Don't worry. I'll answer for you. Detective. A visit -- totally unexpected. You said the door is always open -- and I'm walking through it.
There is nothing to go into. What is it today, Mrs. Whitaker? Pork leg and potatoes, Mr. Clark. Nothing more miraculous than pork. Tell Mr. Graham the room is still his if he wants it.
- I'm not here to argue. - Gary, okay, you don't... I just have a question for you. I apologize for the zoo thing. Oh, is that what we call it now?
Big surprise. And our district attorney was in a dastardly hurry, so instead of first-degree murder following a crime, he offered Emile 12 years if he would name Daniel as the shooter. To corroborate his testimony, he asked our important new witness to hand over the gun. Emile told us where it was. And you never found it.
It's because it's me -- the sign, Daniel. What about this church? This church is part of it, too. The Bloods, the Diablos-they all depend on me. I cut the drugs and get them to both gangs.
FRANCINE: "Two UZI serial number searches. And one could solve these murders." One of the searches is mine -- when we found the weapon in the church. Yes, I can see that Mike. But before you found the weapon, Francine, you identified it from the shell casings.
No. I couldn't let what had happened to Sherry happen to me. No. But Tamika's baby was... You have to know something. I didn't think she was carrying the baby in the car at that time. When I realized I gave her the wrong heroin, I had to take it back.
- Really? - Why? My feet were cold and then, you lent Tess your shirt. I point out, J.T. gave me this shirt. Actually it's my shirt, but J.T. wears it all the time.
To promote its construction, the government makes the railroad companies an unprecedented offer--millions of acres of free land. For every mile of rail route built, Congress would give the rail company land on both sides of the route. The land concessions provided by Congress are really the deal of the century. 70 million acres are given to railroad companies. An area larger than the entire state of Texas. The companies,after taking the land they got for free, sell it to settlers, making a massive advertising campaign promoting the West as an uninhabited paradise.
It sounds like a call to arms to me. A definite signal from the Master, clear? A passage in the Lumen refers to "the silent voice of the Master." Interesting, if irrelevant. Not if we isolate it.
I will live longer than you! I will dance on your grave! - Open it, please. - Well, I don't have the... Open it or I'll blow your brains out!
Still nothing. Another 20 blocks to go. Where are we going? To the old water tunnel. So this silver powder-how do we spread it?
The accusations against you, everyone doubting you and saying you were crazy.... It will all disappear. You will be a hero. You said you have proof? We can use it. I will make it usable in court, whatever it is.
Do you know what's sick, Otto? What you've done. What I let you do, that's sick. I did everything for you. But now you no longer speak to me in our language, but you teach it to him, why?
I have Otto at 90 seconds from the emergency exit. Alexa. Where's the emergency exit? Door 7, at the end of this corridor. Always turn left and you'll find it.
But the yellow one. Not this one-with seeds. Who puts the seeds in the mustard? Those are mustard seeds, that's what mustard is made from. No, mustard is yellow. You know, if you go to The Ball Park, you put it on the hot-dog and it's yellow.
- I have to go. No. - Do you need help? Why don't you let me help you with what you're working on? Listen, thanks for the help with the realtor but I have to go now. So, do you think he'll take it?
Indeed. Supply and demand. Do you mean supply and demand? No, they always taught it wrong. You know, demand comes first, and whoever meets it profits.
Maybe it's cheese! There is no room for more cheese. - There is always room for cheese. - I'll write it on your tombstone. Don't make a wig out of that stuff, because I won't wear it.
Look, I brought her to you because I swore to her that she could trust you. I can't do this alone. Pru, this is serious. What about the house? Do you think they will find it?
For each of those videos, I can show you a hundred people working together. - So you claim it's safe inside? Sure, it's safe if people follow the rules. Zone 6 is my responsibility. I know it like the back of my hand.
- You always have to report the real news. Leo, the fact that they are trying to stop you means you are doing the right thing. They lied about bioterrorism, they lied about the number of bodies, they are definitely lying when they say everything is fine. You don't have to reveal the location. As soon as you write that it exists, the cops will find it, they will remove it, but at least the whole story will be known.
I drew up the map, I said here is north, here is south. Here is a mountain and a river, this is a tree.... It made sense in that mess. A mountain is a mountain. Even if he calls it a tree.
Hey, guys. There, that's how the rumors start. It's not - what it sounds like. - Is it? Because it sounds like you've got a blow-up doll and you're dressing her up like Amy.
They were on sale, so. Excuse me. I talked to Mrs. Arden. The job offer still stands. - Good. - And I will accept it.
Now. Are we done with the pleasantries? Okay. You see that guy out there smoking a cigarette? That's how it works, you bring him the stuff and he tastes it.
Hey, Suzy? Suzy? Suzy? - Hi, is this your cheese pizza? - Yeah, just leave it on the table, thanks.
Take this stuff and get out of here. Yo, G, you can't beat up customers. We got a business to run. - Don't you want your share? - Of course I want it!
Fucking take it easy. I haven't driven since I was eight years old. Well, it sounds like he heard right. That family just rescinded their offer on your house. So can we buy it?
Well, what can you do about tomorrow? Those stale cupcakes. I can redo them with blue and pink in the morning. How do you remake a cupcake? You poke holes in the bottom, scoop out the filling with a small spoon, fill a syringe with fresh cream, stick it in the hole, squeeze.
Let it out. Take advantage of the pain, Joss. Come on. Tell me you're not buying all this stuff for the house. Where do we put it?
I got the IRS off my back. Didn't I tell you to trust me? - Cheers! - Wow, Jonathan... I-I'm really happy for you that the investigation is over. I really am, but -- the Food Network offered me a second season of my series and I'm going to shoot it.
Yes, I... Called to apologize for the other phone call. I should have been there for him. Did his father own a gun? Yes. He gave it to Greg when he... He became a policeman.
Did your father own a gun? Yes. He gave it to Greg when he... He became a policeman. The old man was proud. And where did Greg keep it?
I don't know who she is. She has my voice and a space between her teeth. This is all I know about her. Our voices generate an image. Our words make her move.
You don't even know his last name, you don't know anything about him. I'm sorry. So that's another Kosti. She is buried in the cemetery on the valley. Kosti always visits her grave and keeps it beautiful.
- That would be a mistake. - Not having her testify would be worse. Now that she is doped up on painkillers and hallucinating as well? You have no other choice. Get the judge to accept her.
It's intolerable. I'm perfectly fine. - You can't stand! - I'm perfectly fine! If I need medical assistance, I will ask for it.
But then again, you are on vacation. An exotic vacation. - I'm told it's the fashion of the moment. - Yes, it is. Why don't you finish it for tonight?
I've never felt so much energy. - It was good, wasn't it? - It felt ... dangerous. You treat magic like a drug.... because those who taught it to you act like drug dealers. They buy it and sell it and fight and screw each other for it.
But you have to be a monster to defeat Hitler. - Did Jock give you my box? - Yes, sir. What's in it? - Do you want me to open it?
Have they seen the news? Yes, and they are terrified. After all, who isn't? But ... they have tough skin. They are doing better than some of their friends.
They told him, "We like that Rudy did it," "and, if you help him," "maybe we'll arrest you too and charge you with complicity." These things don't happen in Hackney or Tottenham or Brixton. Do we have to march again? Should we retrace the same paths, singing "We shall overcome"? And give a list of our names to men who will not read it?
Who is this? This is special agent Hannah Wyland. I'm in charge now, not Alex anymore. - Oh, my God. - I hope you like my voice as much as you like his, because you're going to hear it for a while.... At your arrest, during the trial, when I'm testifying in court, and then one day....
They were evil people. And they still remain evil people. Sorkaktani demanded that my sister, Oghul Qaimish. Swear allegiance to the house of Tolui. She refused. And for that they stripped her naked and dipped her in boiling oil.... And then they removed her skin with a knife.... And they tore it from her bones.
Seven stars. Therefore, the murders will form a Big Dipper to trace the constellation. Yes-it could be. The Aztecs had a ceremony concerning the Belt of Orion, which they called "Tinder." I don't know why they called it that, but when Orion's Belt rose on the horizon they would sacrifice a man on top of a pyramid.
We will come after you in Zero Dark Thirty style, okay? Okay. I mean, like. - do you want to use me as a shield? - You wanted the gun... As soon as you see him, you point the gun at him, okay? You hold it on him -- and we hand him the money.
- Chinatown. The Triad. Vincent, you can't give them that gun. I can't allow a Triad member to be exonerated. Obviously I have to give it to him if we're going to make this work. Unless we trade it, meaning we keep the real one.
Shoulder-length blond hair, thin. In the file is a picture of her. Shaf and I asked for it from HR at the department store where she works. We have a copy. Would you like me to email it to you?
You know what, Lydia? You're not so different from Valentine. But at least he had the guts to tell the Hidden people to their faces that he wanted them dead. You? You hide behind the law. I don't hide behind it, I just follow it.
Thank you, my friend. You're welcome. - I'll see you tomorrow. Do you have the Cup? Help me break the power of the Rune of Punishment and I will bring it to you.
Why risk the wrath of the Khan's army so close to Kurultai? What wrath? Our army is trapped in southern China. If we want to take on Kaidu, it will be weeks before we can redirect him to the east. And by then. News of the raids will have reached every village and tribal leader before it can be stopped.
Don't be so modest. If I hadn't tried to stop the bleeding with the scarf, Robyn would have bled to death. Speaking of the scarf, where did you get it from? Robyn was wearing it.
It seems that. My sister likes her new life. And I will never give her reason to think otherwise. Not that she values my approval. But she would like it instead. That's why I want her, too.
Eloise and Gerard had an on-again, off-again relationship, and they were both employees of CRAFT, so they kept the secret. Eloise tried to end it for good, but Gerard became obsessive. The fact that he was mentally unstable did not help. When he realized that the woman in his life was dead, the closest thing to her was his digitized mind. He stole it, with five others, making believe that Eloise had sold them to LaGazza.
Saphenous vein. It is quite thick, and can do without it. Prepare another surgical tray, put it over the patient's pelvis. I don't want to spoil the excitement, but--excuse me? I'll dilate the vein, cut it into pieces and sew them together to get a wider one.
I give you my word. Or. You give me your left ball. - What? - If you don't deliver... I'll cut off your left ball... And I feed it to my dogs.
Not Trina. Well, come on, give me a hand. Please. The window won't even open completely. They fix it like this so that no one falls out.
Well, I didn't know that but I still want to ... Fuck you, Fiona. What? The song from F. Isn't that from your ex? My nephew watches it on YouTube.
And we turn now to the situation in Shady Glen. The authorities are calling it collective insanity, and we're going there to bring you the whole story on the 11 o'clock news. Hey. You're Ruben, right? What's with all the lemonade? Mom makes it every night.
You will not be surprised to learn that. China has secretly copied Russian technology, as well as ours, to develop its own space program. Okay, so in order to save the astronauts, the Secretary has to strike a deal with two of the world's proudest nations, one of which is currently at war with us? When will the Soyuz be launched? Fourteen hours from now. Either repair the station's vital systems or abandon it.
Is she alive? Oh, yes. And when you broke her, Henry, you sent her straight down here to the Underworld, since she had not fulfilled her purpose. She embodies unfinished business. And now you're going to find her back here -- with my help.
What should I do? How do I stop it? - How do I get it down? - So... take this and click on this bar. And then I'll bring it down, like this.
He recorded it from the radio. Shipping Forecas√Æ, it aired late in the evening. It's called "Sailing." - Do you like this music? - Yes. Molly loved it.
Thank you. Okay, I just talked to the administrator. Hey, if the intruder forced the window with a crowbar when he came in, would he leave the window open or closed then? - That's a rhetorical question. - My guess is he would leave it open.
Hospitals are overflowing, with citizens breathing in the poisonous sulfur dioxide. Sometimes there is sunshine. Too much sun and they call it a drought. Then there is rain. Too much rain and they call it a deluge and find a way to blame us for everything.
I know. What are the odds, right? One in two million, actually. Sharon. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a rare generic disease that causes fibrous tissue in the body, ligaments and muscles to turn into bone. I'm so relieved you know it.
Thank you. Good, good, I have a shirt to throw away. I'll throw it to the loudest person in the loudest section.
The situation does not require control. The only way to find the bastards who killed Liz is to stoop to their level. Tom, that's enough. Stay with your daughter. We have a good lead, and we're following it.
It had been years since a man had gone to such lengths to get my attention. Who hired you to kidnap Elizabeth Keen? Howard would be delighted to see you. At parties he still tells about the night you were attacked in Kuala Lampur. Every time I hear it, there are five more machetes you fought against.
Anything you can do to make it not succeed--that would be greatly appreciated. Can we get that stuff out of our house? What happened? The courier didn't want it, that's what happened. And I don't want it in my house,
Do you know Jonas Fischer from URP? Unfortunately, yes. I met him when the WITSEC list was leaked, why? He's here to hunt down a mole. So, unfortunately, - nobody goes away until he finds it.
Nature has its "center of interest" that attracts greater attention. We watch it as it moves from one point of interest to another. When we look at Van Gogh's landscapes, we see the same divisions repeated. How should we look at nature to see--how was it painted by Van Gogh? And was he looking at it with a normal, natural, physiological eye?
- Last month's money is there. - Enjoy. If anyone disagrees with this statement, "Strzeminski spreads turmoil in the school, undercuts the authority of other faculty, and promotes pure formalism, at a time when art should spur society into action," please raise your hand. None. In that case, I propose a motion to condemn Professor Strzeminski, and put it to a vote.
We got the wrong person. Check everything. Blood, footprints, other tracks. Rosie, you can't examine the crime scene about you. If the killer dropped a lock of hair, I want it.
I will keep my life off the show. I come from a terrible -- separation. It was already in the air for a long time. There have been a lot of discussions between me and her about this. But recently we had THE discussion.... It's not recent, but I remember it like it was yesterday.
What do you mean? Look at how you hold your bag. So what? You hold it so tightly that your knuckles are white. And what would happen if you dropped it -- now, on the dirty floor?
Look at how you hold your bag. So? You hold it so tightly that your knuckles are white. And what would happen if you dropped it -- now, on the dirty floor? I would pick it up and move on.
- They try to drive us crazy to go away. - Well, it's working. I want to leave, Matt. Now. If they want the house so bad, let them have it.
Your daughter's killer is on the other side of the border. The student who started the riot said her son was on their side. This speech was written by her. This war was planned by her. And I will win it for her.
Does this place have an airstrip? The mining company built it in the 1980s before decommissioning. That's when the pirates appeared. The island is a safe haven in case the waters get too rough for them. But they don't use it so often that the government does anything about it.
- How can I help? Okay, stand back. It's a pressure switch, activated by a hand grenade. It's like a grenade. When the handle went down, the safety went out.... Triggering the bomb. Now I'm the only thing keeping it from exploding.
Let's go. First a bomb threat, then a forced evacuation. I always knew you were behind it. - Put the gun down, Ryan. - Yeah, I'll put it down if you tell me what you're doing to my computer.
If it is an accomplice, he somehow wants to participate in the murder. It is a strange dichotomy, typical of an unsub taking his first steps as a murderer. First steps. Like saying the murderer is a boy. No, I think he's had this fantasy for a while, but only now is he materializing it.
Our technicians think those fumes contaminated Alice and Kira's food and clothes. That's why Kira and her friend Oscar are sick. We don't know it was a meth lab. We bought the house to restore it, but we fell behind in payments. The bank will take it in a couple of months.
No, there is not enough space. - They are too worn, if we touch them.... - Wax. Kerosene. It's neutral, stable. We melt it, paint it, drip it on, let it solidify and then lift the exhibits.
It is still at Brightborn. It survives by metabolism that it draws from the host epithelium. A synthetic ATP chain. Nature for you is just a place full of spare parts, right? I think of it more as a palette.
It's all right... I'll be fine without a new kitchen. You have to understand me... Just because I don't like things to change doesn't mean you're not important to me. I never thought I would be happy. But you built this life for us and... I love it for what it is.
Ah, and you were challenged. Repeat. If there is a problem in the community, we nip it in the bud before it has a chance to grow. - I don't follow you. - When we try to avoid conflict ... anger arises, but if we deal with it head-on right away, we leave the anger there in the pit.
Ned, what are you doing here? I'm staying here. Ned knows what a tragedy is. - How many times have you played this song? - At Denim Turtle's they love it.
We faced the Halloween hooligans, - the black mold, the termites.... - That's right! And in the end, we don't even get our expense money back! We were supposed to earn something with this house.... And if we rent it out... We will succeed.
- That's right! And in the end, we don't even recover our expense money! We were supposed to earn something with this house.... And if we rent it out... We will succeed. - If we rent it out?
Jenna. Here it is. On paper? You wrote it with a feather by candlelight? Why don't you fax it to me while you're at it?
- No, drive. - Get that shit out. You're running out of time. - I'm not going to throw up anything! - You're not going to make it.
There was nothing important. How did Guero manage to steal from Epiphanius? How did he manage to do it? I know from the details I have that they had an infiltrator among the feds. They would take back the seized coke and resell it.
It is impossible to trace back to you. Why? One of Epiphanius' men, one of the dangerous ones, came here today to talk about my business. I'm afraid they're going to dig deeper, to try to figure out - what I'm going to use that company for. - And what are you going to use it for?
My name is Vanessa. Okay. Vanessa. Well, we're low on water, so.... it's better to shower in two. You know, we close it while we soap up.
Power: you can love it, you can hate it, you can want it, you can have it. No matter what you think about it, power is the gasoline that keeps this complex machinery going that we all keep moving forward, and that gasoline has only one component.... It's what the bigwigs in Washington like to call "the American way." See you next week. And remember: love your freedom.... Or you will lose it.
I forgive her! Just a crazy girl. Are you saying Bobo hides revenants in the trailer park? If you want to win this war, let's do it my way. When were you going to tell me that you're getting it on with Doc Holliday's ghost?
They must be moving. That's why the vision keeps changing. Just keep trying. Hey, did you turn off the Magnetar? No, you don't play with that thing. Whatever it did, if we touch it, if we try to move it....
- From the beginning. - Okay. It's my dad's recipe. It looks like a special pizza. My mother used to make it every year for her birthday.
- What? - Yes, all this stuff is stolen, Shawn, - you can't use it in court as evidence. - Fuck the courts! Why don't we send it to the press?
Now I understand why my brother likes you. - James? - When you see old Dave, tell him there's a new sheriff in town. The Author's power is much greater than an old bearded man would have you believe. When you broke the pen, you sent it right here to the Underworld. And you will find it down here and send me back to the world of the living.
- Mom. And my Blockbuster Original series has kept me very busy. I still don't understand how it can work, like, at all. But it does work! We shoot the whole season and they put it on six DVDs.
Get me Dan and Amy now. - The Chinese are ready. - Oh, he never knocks. Minna, I have a situation I need to take care of.... Selina, need I remind you how sensitive the Chinese are to punctuality? Then why is my wanton soup always cold when they deliver it?
- Definitely. I was there as well. - Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, because the plan has always been based entirely on a freemium model, like Dropbox? You know, offer the platform to users for free and, once you get a large enough user base, sell premium services to businesses. If we offer it for free now and only later sell it, what good are we now?
Once it has enough data in the system, it will be able to recognize long-range patterns and even learn. It will be able to optimize our algorithm on its own, increasing our already superior speed and efficiency. Get it? Cool, right? But it won't be able to do that if we eliminate it.
Wait. Are you wearing a gold chain? Oh, yeah. Yes, I've had it for a while. I put it on from time to time.
Do you think I would poison a good soup? Who would do such a thing? Here, I am not the murderer. I see the way you look at me. If I didn't know better, I'd say what's in your eyes is hate -- but I'm old enough to know fear when I see it.
And it works as well, honey. - Okay. - My mother told me that it works. Okay, you have to pour the hot water into the teapot, all right? GARY WALSH Special assistant and personal assistant to President Meyer And then you throw it away, okay?
It's a box. So if you need an animal, let's make a box turtle. How does that sound to you? Is this all just a game to you? You know what? I don't give a damn what this box looks like. If it were up to me, I wouldn't make it at all.
If it were up to me, I wouldn't do it at all. Here, look. This is a black rectangle. Do it like this. Is that okay? Because we're going to take it and put it in a hole in a basement full of servers, where no one will see it except a sad man with a ponytail named John.
She lives in a small apartment in the Valley. I could see her through the window and observed her in all her...normalcy. There is something very intimate about watching someone be themselves. But it wasn't a good intimacy, like when you see your mother crying. It was a negative intimacy, like when your father writes a poem about Lena Horne's nipples, makes you read it aloud so he can hear if it flows.
Okay, so. I did a quick assessment of your assets and liabilities. Jared, don't look at me like that. Tell me the truth directly. All right. Your house has gained value since you bought it, but if you sold it now for what it's worth according to Zillow and Redfin...
You try too hard. The joke is funny. Trust the joke. - That went well. - Now let's hear you throw it out there.
No, let's go to the one on Forest Avenue. It's farther away from that jacket. Claude, you take care of everything until we get back. Jared, can I borrow your jacket? I feel like you want to do something ironic with it ... but I'm okay with that because ... as bad as this jacket looks to you ... once you put it on ... it will change everything.
You broke into my office. With all due respect, sir, you broke into my mind. If anything, I built your mind, Bernard. I have every right to wander through your rooms, chambers and halls and modify them if I choose to do so, or even destroy them. After all this time I ... know you almost as well as I know my own.
I had the ski mask, flashlight and all. Fools. There is no way this is Dustin Diamond's friend. And where can we find these Doppelgangers? They teach at our old school, you call it Harvard, but everybody knows it as Miami University of Ohio of Massachusetts.
How do you feel about this election? - Who will you vote for, Mr. Mayor? - Do you think you will win? You had a good campaign, Mr. Mayor. They're buying it big time.
That's why I'm calculating the exact time and place for the balloon to go straight into the Mediterranean. Where the Navy SEALs will pick it up and take it to safety. Now, if your calculations are wrong, you could send a weapon of mass destruction to a neighboring regime that is not on Washington's Christmas list. - Trust me, leave that to me. - In case you fail, I want a photographic record of this technology, because if we lose it I want proof of what Rahal was trying to build.
Good, but how do we knock them out without being noticed? We walk like the Egyptians. Okay. The ancient Egyptians created mortar with water, sand and lime. The sand will be on the other side of the basement wall, and we already know the pump room will have water pipes. We will fill it and turn the whole room into a big block of stone.
This hydrological cycle is easier to explain if we think of it as the climate. When we name things, we rob them of their magic. It is this beautiful, choreographed cycle of life. If we were on the moon and looked at the Earth at any given time of day, we would see a blue planet. The ocean retains solar heat energy and turns it into a solar engine.
The beginning of a whole new chapter. Thank you. A new beginning, no doubt. I wanted to thank you for joining me tonight to celebrate the beginning of our new story. I call it. "Journey into the Night."
Oh, - Okay. I need to show you something. This is a letter I wrote to Josh on the last day of camp. I was going to give it to him and then he ... You know, he left me. So I was going to email it, but I didn't.
Jackson Brooks? Look, I don't have time to explain, okay? Look, I need my bag. It's in the shed behind my house, in the corner closet. You're going to get it... And you're going to bring it to me yourself.
Finding a safe place to disappear. I spent months moving my Emperor from hiding place to hiding place, and you still found us. You would be a fool to think that those Mongol soldiers will be the last to stand in your way. Our protection is your best choice. If you want it, you will have to do your part.
The map I was telling you about -- for the treasure, the missile depot, or whatever I was thinking about. I wasn't thinking anything. The map is for Dany. Do you remember Dany? A customer of Dany's wants it.
I would keep that one. - It's a cherry. - Good. You know what? Take your stupid dishwasher and your folder full of lies and go back to the appliance world, okay? You can't return the models that were on display, I'll leave it in the driveway.
I would never joke about a mask like this. But what is it? Some kind of magic? Something like that. What does it say? It says that you'll pay me half of what you earn, as long as you wear it, and that when you're done--you'll have to give it back to me.
Thank you. You know we don't drink, right? Yes, of course, I do. That's for me. Open it now.
Why do you think? For Roscoe. They're going to spend a lot of time together, I have to figure out how to get along with her. See how you follow the straight and narrow. Yeah, but I don't want to look like a Sherpa while following it.
But she kept digging. She made me start over again. I had to make her find peace. I had to. And now you will find her.
Do as I do. Hello, ma'am. My name is Rebecca Bunch, attorney at law, and these are my colleagues. - Hello. - Tell me, did they turn off your hot water? - Yes, but they say they're going to restore it.
And how are you going to lift them up if they can't see it? People look at the monarchy as something bigger than themselves. An inspiration. A higher ideal. If you let it into their homes, you allow them to watch it while they eat.
Bon voyage. A small community of whites, surrounded by primitive Africans, raised in a young and prosperous Nation with the bright promise of great future prosperity. - Hurry up! - Yes, sir! Let us honor the man of extraordinary foresight who foresaw the greatness of this once civilized land. I wish perpetual prosperity and success to all who inhabit it.
One is about your poems and you know very well what it is. Please. Please make copies of it. You know I know your poetry is great. And someday you'll just have to decide to let the world read it.
Oh my God. There's a woman who has a gun. Where is my husband? Who is your husband? Put her down.
It is imperative to warn people and I would like to visit Father Consolmango again-he knows something. - He was uncooperative before. - Father Consolmango has been a pillar of this community for over 30 years. Senor Garrett, you have to understand the organs that are involved. If I make this request to the archdiocese, they will deny it.
It also makes Sara's shirt smell like a dumpster fire. Don't be smart. Why isn't she waving the sage? Come on, wave the sage. The spirits said I was waving it right.
Alternative idea: you could move to Maine. Stephen King lives there, it sounds very nice. I think he's pulling over. If nothing else, we don't have to go back and forth to find the place. Let me take pictures of your face so the doctors can reconstruct it.
Let's hope so! Am I dead? Because Shannon looks like an angel. Thank you for the robe, Grandma. I'll wear it until you're better.
- More... - Will you sing me the song of the flying donkey? - Again.....! But why are you so obsessed with this song, why? My daddy used to sing it to me, but he went off to war.
Preliminary tests indicate that poison from another mushroom had been injected into the mushrooms he used. You two wrote three books together: two analyses of the biochemical effects of psilocybin, and a textbook on the effects of hallucinogens. Then you had a difference of opinion. I wouldn't call it that.
We were together for almost a year, I would never hurt her. So you are no longer together. When we started dating, she was fun. She liked to take hallucinogenic mushrooms, do acid and ecstasy. We chemists have the best stuff because we make it ourselves.
With folk art. Specifically, chainsaw sculpture. A chainsaw is used to skillfully transform whole tree trunks into bears or... eagles. The whole thing is rather kitschy and extremely noisy. I exhumed the chainsaw from the garage and was oiling it when the fire broke out.
Having the party in our territory is not a bad idea. - Yeah. - Much safer for the sisters, Mack. I guess that's true. And we won't call it a party.
The list. Where did he keep this list, Riggs? Jack said it was on the laptop. A laptop like this? Salib tortures and kills Riggs for the list, then destroys it.
I won't miss you. This pathological liar's brain will get me into trouble. - I can feel it. - Not with me. I'll know the truth when I hear it.
I get it, I get it. But listen, a deposition is not like aerospace engineering. There's a way to deal with it, you know? There are five simple rules. When they ask you a question and you don't understand it, ask them to repeat it.
Do you know what this is? It's an issue for November 6. Just put the box back away. Don't destroy it, don't move it, don't talk about it. Just... Let you leave it there, on November 6 we'll come and pick it up and take care of it.
The hope is. that all the problems of the past will suddenly disappear. Two, four, six, eight: no integration is our motto! Two, four, six, eight: no integration is our motto! I will no longer be held back by this WALTERMOSLEY NATIVE WATTS preconception attached to my skin and hair. Basically, I can find work here-because the city is constantly growing. And I can buy something and no one will ever take it away from me just because I'm black.
This is ridiculous. Can you guys represent me? We should talk about our compensation. If... If I paid you with a percentage of the song? If you get it back.
- I was not judging you. - We saved your life. - Okay, there might be a solution. A weapon. It seems that if we found it, we could use it to kill the Beast.
Yes. Excellent. Who else has the combination? Just me and the inspector. I would like it too, in case of.... emergency.
We had to count them together, in the presence of all of them. I don't care about this cheap politics. You can do it in the morning. They can't take the bag to the cell, they will cheat. You don't keep it either.
I don't care about this cheap politics. You can do it in the morning. They can't take the bag to the cell, they will cheat. You don't keep it either. I'll put it in the surveillance room so you can go back to the cell.
We have until seven o'clock tonight. In the province of Nuoro? In Sardinia? "Aj√≤," Fanelli! I'm doing great here, Fanelli! My colleagues have arranged a treatment for me so that if there is something to be done, even a photocopy, they say I am not capable and my colleague has to do it.
And a jacuzzi in the game room. Oh, my God. Dad, you have to take this house. Mom will never let us go to a jacuzzi. - She calls it the devil's soup.
I'll be right there! Apparently, there is no one interesting among the sophomores. Are there any options in your clique? So "clique" is catching on? Is someone calling it a "K-c clique"?
I am not here to determine whether it is right or wrong, Bob. My investigations leave me in no doubt, as to the true nature of Jacob Marley. And I can only imagine how distressing it is to try to provide for your family during Christmas. Crushed by the weight of a loan--that you could not afford to repay. No one could blame a man for losing his way, burdened by such a burden. When my Emily was expecting Martha ... we tried to buy a house of our own, but we did not have enough money. So ... she ... put her mother's garnet necklace in my hand. She was with me when I pawned it.
Who wins? - Me. - Well done. The tank is very small. I haven't used it in a long time.
Divine? Not so much. But a thirsty throat, yes. Very, very hungry. Where do you want it?
Whatever it was-it wasn't human. Where's my cell phone? I'm calling for backup. I'll call the whole damn army if I have to. We're going to find that thing and kill it....
Go. Tonic. Something for the head, sir? Yes. This will make her satr better.
So, she would come in here holding only a pan of lasagna? No, she would bring them in with a shopping bag. Full of things for DIY. Look, she had a pass. Yes, but still, you would make her go through the metal detector, right?
We have an appointment with Jess Cagle. FROM REDMOND: Call me right now. Hey, what's going on? I sent the manuscript to a producer friend of mine at Paramount and he thinks it would be perfect for Scott Rudin. When are you going to send me the offer? Liza is sending it to you right now.
She's happy, by the way. Come on, how could she not be, see how cool she is? Just talking about this substance alone, do you think you would take her back or...? I don't feel like myself, I kind of feel like I don't.... I don't... I don't think I would take it again, and I don't think I need to be that overexcited.
99% pure. You will never find - better cocaine. - Really? - Yes, actually... - Where do you get it from?
- Where do you get it from? - Directly from the DEA. - Do they give you the best cocaine? Yes, if you want it pure, you have to do that. But you are taking cocaine away from everyone who wants it....
But you are taking cocaine away from everyone who wants it ... - To give it to the rats. - Better to give it to the rats. - That's such bullshit. - Actually, we are not the ones giving it. - It's the rats who take it.
- In truth, we are not the ones giving it. - It's the rats who take it. Okay. There's a little button they push -- and they get the drug. If they don't want it ... - just don't press it.
I mean, going to a part of the world where you've never been, I think it's the same feeling. That's why I want to try ayahuasca, because it would be wonderful to have a highly spiritual experience. Although some people will shit themselves and throw up, and if that happens to me while I'm recovering, it would not be ideal. - But I'm going to do it. - Some people see it as a religion.
- Would you take a drug tested on fish? Okay, you're deflecting. So, I took a small vial of cocaine, and I did.... Horrible taste. People put it up their ass.
To find out should not be impossible. And why should I strive for Andr√©, when he has not lifted a finger for me? Because if you don't, the deal will blow up right there and then. - If we put up too much resistance, Arnold. - Why grant him that position, before he has earned it in any way?
- Really? - Yes, because I'm the good-for-nothing and ... Victoria is the accomplished one and she will take ... care of the house better than I would. No she won't. She'll sell it before my corpse is cold. Well, wait a minute, if you know that then why are you leaving it to her?
- To do what? - Well, I don't know! Fishing, water skiing, going around in a boat. I guess that would be quite nice. Especially if you buy it before I go to London.
I have to go. But I love both of you. Well, that went great! Is this shirt too over the top? I'm trying it on for the Frenemy Frenzy.
Well, you clearly know about agriculture. So, you will also know how late you are. The sugarcane stalks should have been buried more than a month ago. Yes, but land is still land. We won't give it away so easily.
On second thought, I don't like your father very much. Hera-our "friends" have bags full of detonators. Enough to blow up this aircraft carrier. We abort the mission, don't we? No, we finish it.
We have been captured. Cham, we don't have time for this. Imperial reinforcements are coming. Destroy this ship and the Empire will send another one. But if we take it, we can use it against them.
It's free and you get points for every purchase. Then we return everything and keep the points. With those points you can take trips. That's great, few people have figured out the trick. What if the stuff gets ruined and we have to keep it?
I see a mirror. It's cold! - Can you see the camera? - Honey, can you see the make and model of the camera? No, no, I can't see it, it's too dark.
In fact, we would risk more than losing the money invested in this house. But we can find another place! Dinner's almost ready, I'll check outside. Sir, open the door, FBI. Sir, if you don't open the door, we should break it down.
One point for Brooklyn College. - I have to inform Mullins. - Wait a minute. - There must be an explanation. - He will provide it to Mullins.
Yeah, yeah, I told him to buy it on the Internet, but I didn't say. Come on man, you can't fire me like that! Yeah... Yeah, I'll bring the shirt back tomorrow. Yeah, I'll wash it first.
- Okay. The trachea is damaged. I can't see the vocal cords. - Do you need a hand? - No, I can manage.
Max, I know that sounds abrupt. Elliot? Max, in my practice I develop the band-aid ripping technique. You can read about it in my book someday, if I ever finish it, but this is a problem between me and my psychologist. At the moment he is not talking to me because of a stain on the couch. And I would be furious about this if I didn't understand it so well!
But he didn't keep up. All right, I love you, Ma. WERZBOWSKI 32 TELEMARKETER You didn't accept my LinkedIn request. Okay, I'll... I'll send it back to you later.
What the hell is going on? Get lost. Yikes. Are you on Tinder? Folks, this company has brought nothing but pain and suffering to our community, so I'm shutting it down.
I answer from here, like now. No, no, no, no, no. You have to open the door. If you don't, I'll have to break it down. All right, I'll break it down in three, two, one....
- I am overjoyed about this opportunity. - So am I. Clean the bones and fix them. I can do it. I've finished the facial reconstruction, and I'm checking it against the Lynwood student database.
Not anymore. We have closed. If you want this space, you have to talk to the building manager. Fourth floor. Rosalyn's death stops Hull's project, and these guys get it over with?
When we came across this oak tree, there was mistletoe around the branches. The sign of a sacred place. So we set up camp and built the effigy. For protection, not for human sacrifice. If it will keep us away from evil, we will burn it to thank the gods.
In short. It's pretty expensive. I bet you can apply for a scholarship. And a letter of recommendation from a DJ in business can only help you. - Who says I'm going to write him a letter? - You're going to write it. If you know what's best for you.
Five years later, cupcakes alone did not make it. Sad, but true. Sure, they're sweet, delicious and chic...but what if we added...? alcohol? Which is sweet, delicious and expensive? We keep the cupcake window, but we also turn it into a bar. Those are two great things put together!
We are going to open a bakery bar. All right, give me the shovel. To cut the cake? No. Well, then I won't give it to you.
This one? No, it was a seahorse. - A seahorse. - Yeah. I was looking for it just the other day.
Robert used to sing this song to the kids... all the time. Yes, I know. Danny told me that. That's why I learned it. And Danny used to sing it to Nolan when he was little.
I didn't think I would get to see his concert before he died. But he is coming here to Korea. Just wait and see. I will search online and find the score of his arrangements. Then I will convince him to sign it and keep it forever.
What are you doing? It's never been opened. Have you ever looked for a secret stash of alcohol? No, of course not. You won't find it in the cupboard.
Did you see anyone? No. Then, let's go. Show me the inside. The millstone. As a child, I saw it as an altar, where a high priest might have performed a sacrifice.
Fourteen hours later, a Taliban sniper shot my husband, hitting him in the neck. He severed the carotid artery, and killed him instantly. I did not blame the sniper. I didn't even blame the government, or the energy companies. I blamed myself. I had an opinion, and I kept it to myself.
Creating Cyber Command means using the same technology to attack. When you have hacked an enemy network, you leave hidden access to that network. And we have tens of thousands of computers and networks outside the United States that we can access. You can use them to monitor what goes through that network, and you can use them to propagate malware. If you can spy on a network, you can also manipulate it.
I had this idea that somehow my great knowledge of Nick Cave and Radiohead and a smattering of Stravinsky would automatically make me excel. So, I will never forget the day I realized that the composition course required knowing how to compose. But I did it. I composed the melody, added the harmonies, drew those bass and violin keys.... I wrote those semibreves and minims, the semiquavers, the rests, and ... although you will never witness a public performance of my composition, because of that experience ... I can see the music when I hear it.
I sat down ... and it came out on its own. In an avalanche. It's as if this story had been in my brain for years taking up space. - Like the words to "My Sharona." - That's right. It was there waiting for me to put it on paper.
No! God, no. No, no, no, no, no. So it's a no? I'm sorry, but no. Well, since neither you nor I want it, - I've decided to sell it to whoever wants it.
Hi, is she up yet? - She's not answering her cell phone. - I haven't seen her this morning. At nine o'clock we have to get a pedicure. If you want, I'll do it for half the money.
I have to go. Jaya. This is not a negotiation. Excuse me? The American team that defused the bomb... Will load it into one of our helicopters... And bring it back to the Pasha base inside the Pakistani border.
Then why do you blame Gloria's Weapons? The weapon that killed my daughter ... had been purchased in that store. - He sold it to a front man. - What do you mean by "front man"? A person who buys a gun... and then sells it to another person who could not have bought it.
Titanium dioxide is a white pigment, found in many products. Like a spray hair dye, blonde to be exact. Yes, I thought of that too. Most of it dissolved in the water, but there are still traces of it on the scalp. Those who are used to using this bad dye would be more adept at applying it, they wouldn't get it on their scalp.
It is a unique blade, but I bet you didn't know that. - You're lying. - I'm not. And here it is. Okay, great. We'll deliver it together.
- Great. Well, all she needed was a new control panel. - Nothing else. - Oh, that's great. Thank you. You're welcome. If you ever want to get rid of that old boiler, give us a call, we'll take it.
Good idea -- but no, this is the plan.... Eat his donut. - The donut? - Yes, if he's saving it, like warranty, He's keeping it in reserve or something, it makes him feel safe.
It can be that of a chef. He can create anything with fresh ingredients. Let's prepare Maggi's chicken tikka. First, we capture the flavor from here. We take the meat, arrange it on the skewer, and then stick it in here.
It's never easy to leave a king, Bill. Phil was paid a lot to hug a lot of people and get them to accept the old way. Well, the old way is gone. I'm looking for the new way. And we will find it.
I don't know. - Jake. - Sorry to bother you, Jen. You left Dufresne's file in the office. - Okay, I'll take it.
She was here... - When we took everything from her. She was here. - Just humanize it. Territoriality is not just a human trait. Yeah, well, we got her back.
But frankly, it would have been very difficult to tell, because, as I said, he was in a strong state of intoxication. Did you know at the time that Mr. Aguirre was a lead detective with the Monroe County Police Department? I didn't handle the situation well. I was young, I was a freshman. I admit that. And if that same situation were to occur today, I would handle it differently.
- Yes. - Do you know it now? Now I know it. Thank you. And you know. He denies that even "We Fooled No One" ... is about me, but ... I'm the one who wears the golden cross and never takes it off, so ... Yeah.
It's a long story... What's in the crypt? Something that can't get out. You'll have to go into a little more detail. First swear to me that you will never open it.
Abby, let me explain what's going to happen so you can make the most of your ten minutes. The band will tell you there's no need for makeup, but really Tom needs it. And Rick will try this pose. We call it The Dick. All the photographers hate it.
All right. Okay, look at this, Gabriel. You see that valve in front here? That thing that looks like a mouth? That's right, it doesn't close properly. So I cut away the damaged part and take it out of the field.
Yes, I'm fine. Brody? The answers you're looking for... I've seen many grieving people chase the same thing. And they chase it... All the way down the rabbit hole.
Who are you? Okay, all this is...creepy, so I'm leaving. Somebody help me! Ivanka Trump is trying to kill me! And then I slipped off my shoe, threw it in her face and ran away.
God save her. - And you are? - It's better you don't know. There is a mechanical clock in the corridor leading to the great hall. Hide your gun there, I will take it when the time is right.
- Did you take his son? - Shut up. You'll get your son back when you hand over the money. That was our agreement. The money is in the shuttle, and the shuttle is sealed. And I will not open it -- until I see my son again.
I will adjourn to see if the unusual circumstance tested for bail exists and give my decision this afternoon. The court is adjourned. I'm working on that Dutch face morphology. It pays the commission, so it will come to you. We will get it much faster now than just a DNA match.
Do you always dress this way for work? - How? - This is a formal questioning. It looks just like my gun. I usually keep it in the nightstand.
They made a fortune from Elliot's work. But Breen was bought out by a pharmaceutical company in 2008. Elliot was left with nowhere to go, and the the economy collapsed. I've heard this story before. - And we will hear it again.
Really? You are a good person, because when I say bad things you just smile. You're nice. So much... Kind. Because you do things for people and I don't. Sometimes, I need a fork and you get it for me.
Do you see how I'm doing? What is it? It's my grandmother's famous soup from Italy. Oh, I already gave him my famous soup, from a can. I could make it with my own hands. They wouldn't eat it.
- No. That never happened. It's just not like me. Because you do things for people and I don't. Sometimes, I need a fork and you get it for me.
The Crystal of Olympus appears in the hands of the Author. What it is. The crystal to which my grandfather bound the magic of Storybrooke. Wait, I don't understand, you said magic is bad. So why are we taking it out of Storybrooke?
- Maura. - Sorry, Frankie. All of the cases of spontaneous spontaneous combustion that were examined showed an external source that was initially missed. We need to figure out what it was in this case. Self-burning and am I missing it?
All cases of spontaneous spontaneous combustion examined showed an external source, which was initially missed. We need to figure out which one it was in this case. Self-burning and am I missing it? Maura says it's technically not possible, but ... it could be the first time she's wrong, right? Maura's first time wrong and I'm missing it?
You know, if you come back here, I can help you with TJ. I'm not going to smother you. I don't know, Ma. I'm just suggesting it. I mean, it's your decision and I'll respect it.
I need 89,000 more. I'll take cash or checks. What about the coke? If you sell it, you can make 90 thousand. Yes, if I went to sell it, but that thing doesn't interest me.
Jane. So what am I supposed to do with all this cake? Do I feed it to the crew? Put it in the freezer. I'll take it home and eat it on the days I skip my diet.
- Yes, me too. - I don't want water. - Open the bottle and drink it. I'm not thirsty. Shall I open it for you like when you were little?
I don't understand. This is a bit of a special mediation. Special? Why? Because you're going to do it with us.
Both of them want the orange. What would you do to resolve the conflict without either of you losing out? - Is there only one orange? - Just one. I would cut it in two and give one half to each.
So he taught you to be an observer. Why should he be sorry? Because now I love the details. Well, his leg -- yes, everybody sees it. I saw the way he covered it with a blanket so that it looked normal to me.
Come on, I'm dying to know, what did he get in return? Yes, DiNozzo, I'm coming. Status report. Agent West recovered the camera from the rebels. Some kid found it in the building, took it home to play with before West found it.
Put it down. He killed the MI6 agent, and Belarus wants him. Walt, this stuff is toxic. One gram can kill ten million people. Okay. As long as we don't ingest it, we're safe.
- I'm sick and tired of Harry! - No, you're not. Yes, you fucking are. - Oh, mother! - Well, if you can't say the c-word when you're mad at my age, when can you say it?
But the research team is already working on it. Yes, a search team with a single boat, Cam. And they're wandering randomly in the Anacostia looking for a head. It's like throwing darts into the wind. - They're not going to find it.
Here. Drink it. This time drink it all, and you too will be free -- from my control. I have given you back your freedom. I don't want it.
REVEALED THE KINGDOM OF TERROR OF LEMAN STREET Jesus, Reid. Horace Buckley, they know everything. Oh, Mathilda. No, no, no. Mathilda. She wouldn't open up and... attacked the suspect, Mr. Buckley. Mr. Reid took Mr. Buckley's head in his hands and... I can think of no better words to describe it, slammed it against a wooden pillar.
This is a bad infection. But it can be cured. - A healthy mother for a healthy child. - Yes. Nurse Franklin, could you come in for a moment? I would need to incise your hand, then you can bandage it.
And after they try it? They don't try it, they are too afraid. So we're not going to make a load of it? Hey, Grumio, you can't win a beauty contest if no one looks at your face. I don't think I'd win it anyway.
You are right. Somebody stole it from us. Somebody knows what we did tonight. Hey, I just left Alison's house with Elliott's bag. Should we burn it or throw it in a bin outside of town?
I can heat up your friend's stew. The song you used to hum -- my mother used to sing it to me as a lullaby. The little sparrow. Your mother and I used to fall asleep to that tune. Your grandmother used to sing it to us.
- Paige. Hi. She was making a big deal about letting me in. What are you doing here so early? Is everything okay? Yes, just that the deadline to turn in the paperwork for the job is today. - I didn't want you to miss it.
Hey, Tuck -- did Riley and I have something going on, do you think? Really? Can't we center a conversation around me? It's like Danny wants to pretend that nothing ever happened between me and Riley. Well I mean -- I get it. It's like when I gave my cousin my bike and he never let me use it.
Brock, come on. Well, there was this, uh, song that my nanny used to sing to me when I was little. She used to sing it to me when she put me to bed and it always calmed me down and helped me fall asleep. Okay, what song was it? Chanel and I will sing it to you.
You sign it -- Mr. President. Passive radar is clean, sir. No sign of the Chinese. How is the atmosphere below deck? Considering the circumstances -- I'd call it a slow simmer.
Good choice. - And what's your excuse? - That I like to drink at lunch. So, the official offer to buy SwapMeet will be today? Yes, John Bosworth will deliver it this afternoon.
I thought she was happier, I'm happy. Very. I'm just a little surprised at how completely it went off script. I thought there would just be handshakes and pleasantries. When you get a glimpse of an opportunity, you take it.
Get all your things. Starting tomorrow, let's work at my place. Why did you do that? If you can find those who give you more than 350 you should take it. When you see an opportunity, you take it.
Arrow - Season 5 Episode 1 - "Legacy" Synchro: vavva_, Maureen, Jorgia, Lanisi, Violet, Vali., Fawed Revision: Fawed Subspedia. The mayor will make his official statement on the anti-crime initiative at the ceremony honoring Black Canary, but... But he can say a few words now. The IAC is an important step toward reducing crime in the city. But I won't evaluate it without some important reforms.
Really embarrassing. I know Sara told her father that she was leaving to protect the story. Why? Why does the story need protection? Because the idiots who were protecting it.
I just needed to talk to someone. We are gathered here -- to pray for Emma Al Fayeed. After that, we will go to the family cemetery to return the bodies of Jamal Al Fayeed and Rami Said to God. In the name of God, forgiving, merciful ... to Him belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and He takes it away.
What, he spoke to his soul. But, alas, the conversation was brief. For although Jane loved watching salsa, it turned out that she hated salsa dancing. She really hated it.
I'm fine. - Thank you. - Good. So the deadline -- that's the deadline. Either it makes it-or it doesn't.
Good move... Trying to take control over the investigation. After all, you might not be an idiot. Unless you decide to spy on me, as Wallace asked, probably in exchange for an important position in his political future. Every good politician plays that card. My father used it constantly.
- Move! - No! I brought it back to you. You're right, a weapon is evidence. I don't want them to find it at my place.
In a big, scary house. They had put paintings -- on every wall possible. My brother said that at night the paintings came to life and went around the house. There was only one room I liked; Grandma called it the blue room.
So if we can somehow cool the air feeding the funnel, specifically the downdraft on the back side by 9 degrees, then we can go from tornado to tropical storm. Sorry, omnipotence complex, how exactly do you plan to cool the air in Vietnam? Dry ice. Remember the CO2 network for factory infrastructure? Yes, but how do we turn CO2 into dry ice? Easy. At the orphanage I used to fire the fire extinguisher inside the pillowcase, seal it, and the CO2 turned into dry ice in seconds, then you can use it to get back at the mean girls.
I was afraid Craig would bleed out. I had to make up my mind. I decided. You two are going to go back to that car. You're going to empty it, wash it, break it into 10 pieces, and then throw it in the fucking ocean.
- Of the car? - Yes. 1963 Chevelle. It was my first car. A real clunker. Seriously. But I'll never sell it.
No justice, no peace! No justice... We are in front of the courthouse where the crowd awaits sentencing for Steven Benedict, the 45-year-old white man on trial for shooting an African-American six months ago. This man is not a street hero! He is an alley racist! We want justice and we want it now!
Kill them. Your posture is completely wrong. I had ordered Ichiro to destroy that sword after his son died. Very well. I will personally destroy it.
Machine alarms continue to fail. Machine alarms, transformers, what's the connection? Yes, we're getting there, guys. We'll make it, we just have to keep trying. Maybe someone is taking the power out of the transformers and using it to power the monster.
Thinking about what? I think I know where Prometheus is. - I'll call the others. - No. I created this situation. I will deal with it on my own.
So, excuse me, but I have to go -- to give my lecture. - Thank you. - Thank you. Dad, what are you thinking about? Lars found the lamp and, of course, rubbed it. So he became the master of the genie, right? But if no one else has rubbed the lamp since then and I -- found it.... I would become the new master of the genie.
With a syringe you inject the accelerant into the bulb, screw it back in, and when the light is turned on... Boom. A plant employee turns on the switches every morning at six o'clock and the alarm went off after less than ten minutes. I have seen this tactic before. Gangs in prison use it to take out rivals.
Call him now -- or I will send you back to him in pieces. My father is not afraid of you--and neither am I. Then you are two fools. Guys, there's a blood trail. If we follow it, we'll find them.
- You're welcome. I will leave you some space. Just let me take it away. - Do you need a hand? - No, I can manage.
So far it's rudimentary. You can tell if a person is thinking "right, left, yes, no" by detecting the electrical signals in their brain. But someone like Collins will advance that science by making it so sensitive that a neurological graft will be able to read the electrical impulses of those around them, even if that person doesn't have electrodes attached. - Mind reading? - If Collins combines our research, imagine the invasion of privacy, the security issues-if he had that technology? - Or if he sold it to someone.
But someone like Collins will advance that science by making it so sensitive that a neurological graft will be able to read the electrical impulses of someone close to them, even if that person does not have electrodes attached. - Mind reading? - If Collins combines our research, imagine the invasion of privacy, the security issues-if he had that technology? - Or if he sold it to somebody. Or if he put it online for free, because he's crazy.
- Walter, it's destroyed! - Bring the cable up to me. - All right, I'm on my way. It's Collins. If you call to ask for my research, I know you don't want it and you didn't hurt Toby.
Whatever I can do to help. This armor is worth 80 million. Whoever stole it must be waiting for payment. Or they will want to use it. I think we should think they will use it.
Savastano's. Some have lost a brother, some their father -- to Gennaro and his boys. But that's history anyway, it's over. Those who held us as slaves are hiding in some asshole! Or he's attached to some machine that keeps him alive, and they never have to come back. Salvatore Conte and I made you a promise, and we keep it.
Thermoelectric generators, fueled by the flames of hell. Check it out, guys, check it out. Billionaire entrepreneur committed to "saving the world" with his water reuse project, how not. Castle, by all accounts, Victor Crowne has helped millions of needy people by providing them with clean water. Or is he using it to infect us?
Ardyn Izunia, chancellor of Niflheim at your humble service. And I come to you on this very auspicious day to offer you peace arrangements. Peace? As you have no doubt guessed our recent maneuver was not a strategic retreat. I would call it a gesture of imperial goodwill.
If I have accepted you being with my brother, you can get used to me and Sam. You're right. You're right, sorry. Here you go. You're keeping Emma for me tonight. Since I spent all day pitching the tent, I'll use it now.
- Sure, Booms. I was getting to that. So, you have to stand by your door for roll call. You can keep the door open or closed, it's up to you. Yes, but almost all of them keep it open, dear.
- Yeah, well, he can't. I brought you something. To cover your head. Thank you. I'll tie it for you.
Sure Hey, where's your wedding ring? I don't know, I had it when I got here. - You didn't put it in your locker? - No, I never take it off.
He didn't take his eyes off her. Oh, I meant... I meant at the blanket. Yeah. Well... I'll make sure she gets it before she goes to sleep.
I'll bring it to you during the lunch hour. I don't have a lunch hour, okay? I'm sorry. First item on the agenda -- the furniture. Apparently this stuff belongs to the real estate company -- and they're taking it back.
Yeah, so... Listen, I... I don't think I'm really ready to smoke pot. All right. The thing is, we don't smoke it....
If this continues to spread, hundreds of thousands of people will starve to death. And you think an animal is causing this "glass"? Well, it's not plant-based. And since your work links mutated animals to environmental events.... If there is a connection, we will find it.
This is the aquifer under your property. It supplies water to all the farms in the county. My guess is that the snakes are leaking their toxic glass directly into your farm's water supply. What about the drinking water? The county gets it from the river, so at least we don't have to worry about contamination.
Two strands of genetic information, elegantly woven together. This-this is what Jackson's DNA looks like. The mutation caused a third strand to develop. A triple helix? And this structure is not only possessed by Jackson, but also by vultures, ants, the sloth,
I'm sorry I left the party. If I'm not back by midnight, my mom gets worried. Hey, Elliot. I'm loading the beta version of my app onto a flash drive. As soon as it's done, you need to bring it to headquarters....
How are you doing? - Good. Please record Saturday's cricket match for me? Saturday is the soccer match! - Don't you see it there?
I used to do this even as a child. I would place my mother's clothes on her bed creating the shape of her body, imagining that she was there. It excited me. When I was a little older, at 12 or 13, I would get women's underwear whenever I could. I would use it to masturbate.
"Long ago, when wishes always came true, there was a king whose daughters were all beautiful. But the youngest was so beautiful that the sun himself, who had certainly seen many, marveled whenever it shone on her face. Near the king's castle was a great dark forest, and in this forest, under an old linden tree, was a spring. In the hottest hours, the princess used to go into the forest, to sit on the edge of the cool spring. To pass the time, she would pick up a golden ball, throw it in the air and pick it up again.
I'm going to go and update the mother. How did it go? How's Jenny? She is still in surgery, but everything is fine. We have located the source of the effusion and Dr. Russo is closing it.
He is throwing his life to the wind for you. This is not about my ascent to power. Unlike you, I have already achieved power, I have achieved excellence. It's about Jake finally stepping up, - accepting his excellence. - He doesn't want it.
About what? The person who hired her to plant that bomb. You talk to us, and I'll talk to the prosecutor to make a deal. A tempting offer. If I happen to be prosecuted in this nation, I will consider it.
Do you want to give up? Do you want to give up the plane team? No. No. We started this together. And we're going to finish it together.
God, I hate that shirt. - It looks like a living candy. - It looks like a cheese dip. It's like going out with a glass of orange soda. Once, while wearing it, a beggar gave him money.
- Set me free! Al! Would you help me? She has superhuman strength! Get her! I'm leaving her with you.
Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Are you all right? Those guys hurt my back. There's a bag up there. Can you get it for me?
Doing the same things over and over again expecting different results. Yes, yes, exactly. Camping is crazy. Oh my God, I'm exhausted. If you don't finish your breakfast, I want it.
- Yes, of course you do. - No, you own 25 percent and Clark Computers owns 10 percent for the purchase of the mainframe. And Clark Computers, so I, they don't like the idea of bypassing Cameron and forcing the listing through. This is... This is -- this is just a horrible representation. Donna, if you make this move -- I guarantee she will take it as a declaration of war.
Family is more than blood. Look. Look. It's about honor. It's about reputation. And I defend it the same way you feed a snake. With sacrifice.
It sounds a little confusing It sounds, doesn't it? Let me speak clearly, in case you didn't understand what your role is in all this. You are going to tell us how she got here. You are going to give us the name of the person who is bringing her to the Island.
And I thought about everything. But the thing that haunted me the most ... was knowing what my parents would go through if I never came back. War is not only about those who go off to fight. It's also about the families who stay home. And we all face it together.
Oh, shit. Oh, you little darling. Your mommy's gone but you still have us. - Has Mike been in contact with this cow? - He was milking her today.
And you are a crazy plant, so somewhere inside you there is a crazy gene. Even though I can't see it, I can feel it, I know it's there. I called it a "ghost gene." Isn't that a little too melodramatic? When you make your scientific discovery, you will call it whatever you like.
- Huh? - No, I say, with my scarf? I don't understand how you can be so mean in such a circumstance. The cashmere scarf! - So, you make the invoice in my name and then send it to me.
Sit down, you must never get up. This is Oliver Twist, it is a beautiful book. It's the story of a little boy who ... Well, whatever. Do you see that door? You must never open it. Never!
- I made you another cake. A banana, caramel, cherry, blueberry and cream cake. - With vanilla frosting and some raisins on top. No, I'm fine like that. - Don't you want it?
And it's worth a lot. How much is it worth? Wait. Bruce, don't. If I buy it, you get paid. But we can still return it, and those guys won't come after us again.
Family is a sore point for me. Believe me, I know how it feels, man. Where's the box, Pete? Somewhere in the storage room. My son was looking for it a while back.
You're not going to need it. There were ... traces of nonhuman DNA on Boris. Swine, to be exact. A unique breed crossed for its delicious meat. And there's only one place that sells it.
* It's got a lot of class, but we're not a good match. # It's starting over, goodbye, don't let it show. # Now that it's all over, # it's been a pleasure. # We need something to make this song legendary. So one doesn't forget it.
Mm-mm, no. You will not leave this house with that tie again. Why? Why? What's wrong with it? Nothing's wrong with it, but you've been wearing it for three days.
Do you want me to help you sneak a 900-kilogram bomb? Not the bomb, just some of the explosive material contained inside. Avoiding them will be easy. You're kidding. Tomorrow the Japanese will take it out.
Aren't you going to take your jacket? Don't you need it? No. It's not evidence. I don't want it.
He simply put everything in a box and left. Do you think he destroyed it? The box? Not Helen. I'm sure she still keeps it somewhere to take it out only when she wants to punish herself.
Thank you. FYI, your best ideas brought you to this bar, richer than a few hours ago, by $100,000. I'm going to buy that bottle. Don't buy it. If you really want it, we can steal it.
Is all this really necessary? The last time we didn't incinerate a prototype, we found it for sale in Shanghai the following spring. Quote two, Dr. Morrow. He brings me a cake, then asks me to get the recipe from it,-and now he won't let me cut it?
- Yes! - It was enough to change the switch. - He made a fire pit in the back. - I just dug a hole - What? - with bricks around it. - The Secret Service won't let us use it.
- I didn't do it, I swear. - Oh, sure. Tutankhamen, give me back my damn card. I don't know where it is. I haven't seen it since I gave it to...
For killing all those people inside the Safe Zone. What do you mean by that? He was the secretary for Urban Development. He instituted the quarantine. Only he broke it.
- Did you really say that? - Yes, I had to. Good. Do you know the song Paper Boi? Yes, Paper Boi by Paper Boi, I've heard it. Good stuff, on the street they love it.
Bess. Who feels terribly guilty about her son's failure. You can relieve her of that burden. Do you think you can? Brandon Peters did not kill Alyssa Yang. People know the truth when they hear it.
He stood still on the hill for a while. As soon as she left, he followed her. The village cop is convinced that she is a communist. And is she? Do you think you could recognize the car if you saw it again?
In doing so, they introduced us to a world completely different from our own. As amazing as these images are, they are all true. With the help of new cameras, du including one designed especially for this film, we can show this extraordinary phenomenon as never seen before. Bioluminescence hides many mysteries. We know that fireflies use it to attract the opposite sex.
The cold blue light, produced in the tail of each larva, is the bait. Other insects emerging from the egg and popping up in the cave instinctively fly to the sky. But this is not a starry sky. It is a death trap. Bioluminescence is clearly a powerful tool for life forms that possess it.
Okay, ginger cookies. Let's see... Yes, okay. You can go. I'll have it behind the door as soon as I close it, right?
Yes. TMX¬© You've been getting 5 thousand a month for 3 years, guaglio'! Why do you think I always gave it to you, this money, huh? I have to be the first to know how much others are offering. This race has to be mine. And I can't lose it because of some bullshit of yours!
Nothing suggests that he will not have a full recovery. Nothing suggests that he will have it. Dr. Latham. I notice that like every doctor who teaches here you have your own methods. But I think if I had an opinion, you would want to hear it.
I have to tidy up all these notes before today's meeting on finances. I'm looking forward to April, though. No, no. It's not a talk, it's work. I have a work note for you. Well, what area should I put it in?
[Laughter and howling] Bear with me, bear with- - I accept! - [LAUGHING] The fact is, though, that various supercar manufacturers have taken Polar-bear-friendly technology from a Prius, and now they are using it to create naked, raw speed .
We can't get by like this, though. He's right, I'm already jumping through hoops to pay you in my square. And what can I do? I haven't c apitated. And if this is a democratic alliance, we all have to buy the stuff together at the same price. But instead now we get it from you, who buy it for less. So you make twice as much money:
With us and with your squares? ! And it's not like you have to buy it from me. I am not Savastano. Buy it wherever you want. That is, if you can find it cheaper, however, the point is another.
We bypass the middleman. We can rent her to the miners. When they're done, we'll sell her organs to the reapers, her limbs to the meat traders, and I want whatever's left over. I will use her skin to make me a jacket. I will stuff her head and hang it in plain sight on the wall.
I know, I know. These, uh, stupid hands. Oh, Jesus. Did you ask the doctor if he can get you some weed? Yes. But he said he can't prescribe it for me, because it's only for people who have cancer.
Aren't we all? You know in the alternate reality it was the destruction of Eos 7 that started the war. And you think the same thing will happen here? We think Ferrous smuggled a bomb on board. Three and Six are looking for it now.
Demons are just ... metaphors. Do you think I don't know that? Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is for me -- to sit here and make myself look like a crazy person? But I'm telling you ... something is going on. There is a presence -- and I feel it.
They're just doing their job. Okay, well, I'll play a little Portal and wait for you to respond. Get the crystals out of the garage and split them up. One week at home suspended. And you won't spend it in front of the computer.
We're just, uh, putting a band-aid on a wound caused by a hatchet. What's going on with you? What do you mean? When we met, you were all sunshine and bubble bath. We found a cure once and we'll find it again.
They work as fast as they can. How are you, I feel like -- there's a dam inside me, ready to break at any moment -- but there's nothing I can do to stop it. Mitch, your father, the pastors -- they're working on a solution. I don't know, Abe--even if they find it, there's no guarantee that the serum will work.
I just want to... If I can do just... one thing, one... important thing... for her before I die.... Maybe -- maybe the last thing I do will be to save her life. You did the right thing in New Brunswick. I need you to do it again.
No, no, I was trying to save you. And I'm trying even now. The airship is in danger. There is a bomb. And we're looking for it.
- If necessary, we will call you. - Wait. - If we will serve you? - Nothing has changed. Flynn is still out there and has the mother capsule and you are still our best chance. When he uses it again, we will call you.
He thinks it's a joke. I'm sure you don't think it's a joke. Look, I know all the scenarios. You don't make money from music. Only one in a million makes it.
But now they are here. What's wrong? Everything. Not a fucking thing is right. Take a good look at this house, because it might be the last time you see it.
My friend Amber's mother took us into town for holiday shopping and we were in this crappy little store when I saw that crystal brooch. I had to get it for my mom. I really thought it would make her happy. The part she's not telling that lady is that the brooch was $16 and I didn't have enough money. So when no one was looking, I put it in my pocket.
Well, who should I leave them with? I don't have any children. But I do have a bank account full of money and a new sixty-five-inch television! I'm going to make popcorn. Where should we put it?
I've spent a lifetime here. It's a place of historical interest, you know? Built in the 1880s for an inventor named Zackariah Webb. But he disappeared and the estate began to fall apart. In the 1970s it was squatted. But Patrick bought it back from the government in the mid-1990s, before his wife's story.
Hi. I couldn't find the jacket, that's why -- it took me so long. I was telling Dirk now: year 1978, at the height of the energy crisis, alright? Edgar Spring, Patrick's father, created his own power grid. 5 kilometer radius, he called it Springsborough.
Don't worry. I'll be right there. I have a theory. I have a theory that I don't like at all but it's ... the only theory that's floating around in my head right now. So... I'll explain it to you and... if you understand it, if you can follow it from beginning to end, you have to tell me, you have to confirm whether I got it right or not, because -- right now, I feel like I don't have all the wheels in place...
It was funny. Should I tweet it? Back to the game. How do you hold the racket? Do I hold it like this? - Or like this?
- Okay, that's enough. - Yes, that's enough for me too. But wait, you can't leave. The game is not even in the last half. We'll hear it on the radio in the car.... Or somewhere else.
He would buy gum and put it on. I literally dragged him into the polishing room, and I said, "Show me your tongue," which sounds kind of.... And he said, "No, why should I show you the tongue?" And I said, "Show me the tongue." He showed it to me and I thought, "Jesus Christ... you need to see a doctor.
The idea is that the product represents a territory, the union between people and the land.... If it can be done with food, it's a good idea. And that is what we aspire to. Agave plants mature in 12 to 15 years. At that point you cut the plant, process it and bring it back here to turn it into mezcal.
Salsa evolves, as if it were a living thing. I was in Mexico City and the preparation had been going on for 453 days. There were probably a hundred ingredients. It is a very complex sauce. Much more than any French salsa. He serves it in a dish, in a perfect circle.
So we fell into the pool and woke up here. I remember now. We must have teleported. That's why our memories are fuzzy. Tyson, give me the goggles. If there's a door here, we'll find it eventually, okay?
I heard you can get chlamydia in your eyes. - I don't want to... - Oh, I understand. I don't want to have chlamydia in my mouth. Tell me if you get it. So we don't spread it.
E... I will help you try. Wow, I swear I won't let you down! Hello. I collected all the smelliest garbage I could find. Do you still want me to throw it away at Antonio's house?
My sister would freak out. So would Molly's family. I went to her warehouse, looking for the necklace, but her brother showed up and - he took it. - Better him than the cops. Maybe I should let the cops find it instead.
It's good. Grace, before I met you-no one had ever noticed my art. No one had ever made me feel important. I love you, love. And I will do everything I can to make you trust me again. I've prepared a surprise for you -- but you can only see it if you come to the exhibition tomorrow.
Put your weapons on the floor. We are leaving. You can have anything you want. We just want the tetracycline. - We will share it with you.
# Mr Big Stuff? # You're never gonna get my love... ## Oh, nice here. - You set it up nice. My mother had a lamp like this. Eh, yeah. Too bad the dog ran into the house and finally destroyed it.
- What? Oh my God, it's the land! - No, I don't see any land. - It's right there! - No, I don't see it.
I know the caves. Are you in? You and me. Okay. Keep the mask. No, no, there's no ash here and I could die if I kept it.
I'm so sorry. What does it look like? No ash. The wind must have carried it north. So the farm is not destroyed? Do we get it back?
And this is where leadership must go against all odds. "Yes we can, we will succeed, we must succeed." I know what many of you think about this battle, this war. I do not want the war. I do not desire it, but we need it.
Indeed. The roast is perfect. - Can I bring anything? - No, just your person. I'll see you at 7. See you then. Mutually guaranteed destruction, that's what McNarmara calls it.
Dana has news about the KCA bones. I'm going to go to the lab. Great. I'll be right there. - Excuse me. - Okay, how about I write her a letter and you decide if she gets it or not.
All right, what do we do now? I'm going to... I'm going to freshen up. - Is your phone working? - No. I have a gun if you want it.
Sounds nice. Do you miss the farm? I think about it, I guess. My dreams. And Brianna loved it.
It will make you feel better, Josh. Take it. Take it. Take it, honey. Now you're going to take it, you're going to swallow it, and you're going to be fine.
I have an emergency stockpile there. We have to go there now. Let's go. Quantrell told us that you run an operation and you call it.... "alamo"? Yes, I didn't choose the name but I can't change it. I had been organizing it for years.
I should just go to Moe's and drink on it. You'll never hear the name Julia again. Hi, it's Julia. I just wanted to introduce myself and tell you what a wonderful husband you have. I also have a nice bicycle, but I keep it tied up.
Oh, okay then. In what sense is there a legal problem with my hatch? And -- while you're explaining that, please take two steps back. The old hatch was perfectly legal, it had been condoned during the Reagan era. But since you're renovating it, it has to conform to modern standards.
Because I just had more sweets. Hello, Mr. Smithers. I see you haven't given up. Enjoy the cake. As long as you don't eat it in front of a notary, you're okay.
√à... √®... Is red, but not... too red. He's right! Why don't you stay and discuss sewing patterns with tea? I'd like to. And I'll take the cake to my house and share it with the other elders. - Classic.
- I love Adele. - I do. She's great. All right, there's this thing. I call it the Alpha Adele Night at the Arena.
Well, it's not really about us. No, it's about Micki. - Is it? - Yeah. But, I mean, like any song, everybody interprets it in their own way.
It's a bill -- which the previous government tried to get through parliament. It proposes to place all our intelligence services, border services, port police, airport security, and maybe even prisons, all under one command. One big circus tent. Exactly. It died with the defeat in the elections, but now, the same clowns are resurrecting it.
Well, I thought I had lost this necklace.... and then I saw it around the neck of JP's new wife. Yeah, that bastard stole it from me to give to another woman. Can you believe it? I was at the Blind Tiger earlier and I saw them, so...I took it back.
I was at the Blind Tiger earlier and I saw them, so ... I took it back. You stole it straight from his wife's neck. No, that I didn't steal it. It's mine. I just took it back.
I am Madison Gray. How can I help you? I don't know. I haven't been on a board for at least ten years. You made a promise, I expect you to keep it.
We. We do. How much is a beer now? A nickel, I think. Triple that price. When something goes against the law, everybody will pay more for it.
You have less than half an hour. After that, the virus will be too far advanced to be reversed. There must be another way. Remember-it's just a machine. If some other part of the ship was facing a critical malfunction, you would knock it out without hesitation.
Dead and full of craters. It may be NO LIFE ON MARS PHOTOS OF MARINER 4 SHOW DESOLATED PLANET that life is more unique than many people believed. That was a tremendous disappointment to a lot of people who thought there was something, anything, there. But we have not abandoned the idea that there is life. There is almost a religious belief that by continuing to search we will eventually find it, and it is based on faith and not knowledge, in the same way that religion is based on faith and not knowledge.
Oh, God. Wait. Did he say what bank is it? Mutual Bank. Why? Just getting my Ivy League brain working. Nobody says they've found the perfect bank unless they rob it....
In this tense moment... Howell and his men are trying to put fear into you -- to manipulate the electorate. You, sir, are an unelected bureaucrat. And this ... is a prime example of abuse of government, okay? I say if people want water, let them drink it.
And I suppose if I asked you who paid, you would answer the same. If I find out that you lied, next time -- you'll go to solitary confinement. And it won't just be for one night. - What? - I was thinking about when this jerk finds out that his suspension proposal is going to blow. William, I will blow it, but I need you to sign this first.
Your Honor, I am only asking that Mr. Sutter hand over to us.... Something you have no right to ask for. I have the right to make sure that his client is operating within the law. And on what basis do you claim that he is not? Your Honor, if you beat the home run record and are accused of having a rigged bat, you turn it in to prove otherwise.
Oh, you're getting fast. Don't tell me, sing to me! You little rascal! Could I ever tell you a story without working on a song again? I'll play it by ear.
Follow it as much as possible without getting caught. That's the first rule... never get caught. If we lose him... we will come back tomorrow and start following him again from where we lost him. Then we will take the map and plot our route. In no time, we will know where he lives, his movements, we will have the recipe--and you will follow it.
If the Coast Guard stops them, they drop their backpacks, come back later, push the button, and "boom," there they go again. Then from Canada they head here-south of Mackinaw City, Michigan. They stop to restock at Rowley Bay - and then down to Chicago. - Where Scoot supplies the drugs to Red and many other dealers who sell them to kids.
Can I have it? No. Did you get the sculpture? - No. - If I sell it, I get 10%. Is that okay?
Unh! I think the strength of the couple has lost its spark. Who's next? Pearl, I don't remember asking you to bring me a spear. You won't like the way I'm going to give it to you.
Don't act surprised, Rose Quartz! - You shattered a diamond! - Whoa! Ooh, I'm going to get you! I'll get your gem and bring it back!
I swear by God. - Open. - What? My boys need teeth. Either open your mouth or I'll open it for you.
- It ends up at Stanford or Berkeley. - Yes, I know. But will it make you happy? I mean, look at tio. With all those degrees he bought this car, but he never enjoys it.
He would not tell me the contents of the box. He instructed me to wait for delivery instructions. I had to retrieve it. Torres had many warehouses, many offices. It took me a week to find out where he kept it.
Chinese characters. They stand for, "Receive the Mandate of Heaven and with it longevity and prosperity." Assuming then that he had the genuine article, Rey was right. The green stone was worth a fortune. In fact, the Chinese emperor traded it for 15 cities.
Here it is. It is very important to me. And now it belongs to me. Not anymore. I'm going to take it -- and you're not going to object, because -- that's how our deal works.
- Hypervigilance? - Saw a sniper on the overpass. - Mines in the trash? - Yes. Roadside garbage is the worst. Why don't they throw it out?
Shouldn't you be out trying to put Snoopy down? The purge got a little out of hand. I got rid of my entire wardrobe, including underwear. I'm currently wearing one of Edgar's swimsuits. Jimmy, I've been thinking about your list, and I think it would be good for you to show it to me.
Sorry, I hid it from Eva, but there's no way they could have seen it, it was hidden very well. I promise I will fix it. Answer. I promise I will fix everything. Isak! Hey, he woke up. With his good raising. Look! We're in the devil's lair, as I call it.
- It smells good, honey. - I like the bracelet. Two! What happened to your shirt? I'm putting it in the wash tonight.
If only I were 30 years younger. I'll just take a minute from you. I'll time you. Are you investigating the Quiller investigation? No, I'm not familiar with it.
I still don't know how you convinced Ganz to rent us his boat. I agreed to be his infiltrator at Cornell. - Oh, shit. - Never mind, I told him I only deal in weed. I don't see it as selling illegal substances,
- Unfortunately, she is not authorized to know more. Sir, every moment that passes without finding Nassar is a moment when the people will question your suitability for this role. And I believe it is at this moment that you offer me your full support. Your childlike sincerity is your best quality, sir. I hope you don't lose it.
I hope this will end soon. But where did it end? Order... Salad with rabbit. He can't handle serving something without hair in it. 2 Broke Girls
Hello, Monroe. Tell me, Red, what do you notice about this Sheba head? That it's in somebody else's set. No. It's in somebody else's finished set, whereas your Sheba head is not a real head yet, and that's why I'm sending you back to the factory.
- But then they... - Celia, stop it. I can't make that movie. I can't even say the word "Nazi" in a movie anymore. But don't you understand? You would never say it.
What are you referring to? Monroe. He just hired me. What are you talking about? I threw a story at him, and he wants me to produce it.
Although one time in college I smoked in the company, but I didn't comply with the "two puffs and passes" rule and got kicked out. Well, maybe I can give you something to eat. - To eat? - We cook weed in desserts so you don't have to smoke it. We put it in all our desserts.
Although the person I miss most of all is... Mr. Jack Walser. He was the administrator of the apartment building where I lived, before the Lord called me to Himself. He had divided the tenants into two categories. The "natives" and the "nomads." And ... one day, Jack rang our door at ten o'clock in the morning, convinced that Lucy and I were at school, but that day we were in bed, both with fever, happy to be sheltered at home. Through the door to the room I saw my mother offering him a cup of coffee, and I saw Jack drinking it standing up, because he didn't want to wet the chair with his clothes all soaked.
- It's funny, we've traced license plates, phone calls, but we've never traced blood. It's surprisingly easy when you know what animal it came from. What are you talking about? Doug suffered from a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It has been eating away at his brain for the past 9 months, you may know it as mad cow disease.
Look, we can't cancel the mission. FBI REFUGE - 8 MILES FROM THE WILLIAMSBURG FARM, VA just because you found a bug in Alex's room. Yes, it's from the CIA. No -- I can't locate it. But for all we know, it could be Owen Hall's, - on behalf of the faction. - We don't call it a faction anymore, sir.
I want to win for my dishes, not because I pity you. Bamboo shoots have the same texture as mushrooms. Thank you, Antonia. Hey, there's a box of wreaths. Why don't you hand it to me so I can put it in the pile that goes outside.
Come to think of it, it was Bill Maher. 2 Broke Girls Hey, look! It's Squallington Bear! This raincoat shields me from the downpour but not from these insults. I need to check the drains. If you find my love life over there, will you bring it back?
This channel will remain open day and night when you want to see Agnes. Hi, honey! Why don't you want to trace the call? Don't you think he hasn't thought of that? As soon as he knows we are tracing it he will end it. - He will take her away.
- But you're not, okay? Oh, that look. Every mother has one. Doris is imagining choking Oliver, with her bare hands. Now she's remembering there's such a thing as jail, so she puts the anger back in and saves it for everyone who mistakes her for Japanese.
Please don't tell him, I will do anything. I swear. Aloha? Okay, listen to me carefully. You're going to make the pot disappear from your house, all of it this time, then you're going to put it in a safe with the combination, and then you're going to send me a picture of the safe.
Are those sweatpants? - No. Oh! Yes. Yes, they are. I drank a hot chocolate this morning and spilled it on me.
Where is he now? - In a nursing home. - In a nursing home? Yes, I told her I wanted to leave her and she freaked out, just like that, for no reason. And I'll tell you, I don't even know why they call it a nursing home.
What the heck is going on? Ah, Santa, sorry, I didn't know it was your car. Here, now that you know, crumple up the ticket. Now eat it! Now we'll go to your house, wait for you to expel it, and then you'll eat it again.
A lifelong runner, he started with go-carts. He would go pro after discharge. Could it have been a mechanical defect? No, no, no. We built the car with our own hands. We checked it from top to bottom every time we used it.
Make way! Weller, Jane, are you okay? Yeah, we're good. We got a suspect down. Disarm the bomb before the others set it off.
Keep looking for him. We must find him before Elizabeth does or we will have another death on our conscience. FBI! Drop the gun! Put it down.
Drop the gun! Put it down. She is completely surrounded. You have no other options. Put it down.
- Hey, Jack. You got a minute? - Yes, Lee. Hi, I just took the kitchen over to the Lawson house. - Some ladies are cleaning it up.
Do you remember the brooch I sold? My father gave it to my mother because he loved it. She treasured it because it was a gift from him. When she died do you know what he did with it? He gave it to Regina because he loved her too.
- Right. Okay, I'm going to go now. Right now, it could be who knows where. Hot sauce is a valuable commodity, Linda. You can put it anywhere.
In fact, you know what? You're just wearing it today. - There you go, done. - Pa, come on. You know he'll take it off once he gets to school.
You know he will take it off once he gets to school. Oh, no, no, no. Don't do that, Alangulon. No, um, that thing is enchanted, okay? If you take it off, you turn into stone.
Well, I guess we both need to reconcile. Hey, you're doing the reconciliation dance! Oh, I wouldn't say that. No, that's... the dance of perpetual virginity. But you do it like God, son!
So? Even the bank accounts? Yes. And so, with the help of Larsen, his computer genius? could draw from those accounts as easily as withdrawing from an ATM. And don't come and tell me that that money was used to fund NSA investigations, because a lie like that no one is buying it.
Father's watch is missing. It is a Piaget. His black leather jacket is not here either. He loved it. He never lent it to me.
Where does he work? In the hearts of actors like Sandra Bullock, Tom Cruise, and James Franco. All of them have used this technique to deepen their emotions. I'll say a phrase, like "you're an alcoholic." And you will repeat it, but to the first person.
- No. - How are your red blood cells? - Erythrocytes are exploding. - Schistocytes. - We know she has hemolytic anemia, but we don't know what is causing it.
Why don't we send the story to Mr. King? Maybe he could publish it. I'd love to, but... It's just a first draft. If he's going to read it, it has to be perfect. You keep working on it, we'll keep it a secret until then.
Just because I know you're not a fake person, so logically -- you've been lying, so ... there is something that worries you and... that worries me. My father was a good man, but my mom -- she had problems. When she... left him ... he was devastated. She was the love of his life. So, on Halloween, he would buy...a huge bag of anonymous treats from the Everything store for 1 Euro...he would leave it in the bin and turn off all the lights in the house, so...no one would think we were home.
Your doctor confirms that he died of poisoning. Are we sure the explosive was his? - We are now. - A surveillance camera on the base shows him assembling a bomb in his car. The bomb squad is sending it to Abby.
Send the clip. Here it is. It's two hundred years old and it's built with beautiful Cotswold stone. I want to make it absolutely clear that this is really Jeremy Clarkson's house. It really is, I swear it on my children's lives. It is Jeremy's house, he bought it when he fell in love with the view.
What smoke? That pile of smoke in front of us, high above. I can't see it. My allergic rhinitis is terrible. No, you can't see it because you're trying to look at it from a cow's asshole.
Transcript: aerodanski, Birtieddu, deveryen, strazz, am90, EliGiaquy, Deedeehs. Revision: anto* THE GRAND TOUR 1X07 Hello and welcome to the Grand Tour special, which begins with this: the Volkswagen Beetle. It's a car we really hate, because only Nazis and hippies like it, and we are neither. However, if you remove the body and replace it with something more eye-catching, something like this, you will end up with a dune buggy, and that is brilliant.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What about that room? - Oh, that's the red room. - The red room? That's what the doctors call it.
That was it. And the wanderer was so happy, he wanted to repay me. You know, he didn't have much to give me. So he started looking in the bag and he pulled out this very shirt. He told me-that this was a magic shirt. He told me that when you wear it, your enemies see you exactly one and only the way you want to look.
All right. I'm taking a little trip to get to know Coach Bud Erens better. It might help us understand why Marchand went AWOL. The history of salsa has always been very intriguing. Did you know. Ever since the first man who mixed ketchup with mayonnaise, added spices and called it "secret."
I'm taking a little trip to get to know coach Bud Erens better. It might help us understand why Marchand went AWOL. The history of salsa has always been very intriguing. Did you know. Ever since the first man who mixed ketchup with mayonnaise, added spices and called it "secret." - Actually, they call it pink sauce.
Yes. Never been better. I took your sister's advice and I'm working extra shifts. All shifts, actually. I haven't left the store since. I slept in the hot tub before Barry sold it.
I love these people. I don't have the courage to pardon them. We have all seen someone we loved transformed. Grace is better. That's why they call it that.
- Noted. - Maybe Dr. DeLuca... - I beg your pardon? - This artery will allow this woman to survive. I'm not going to put her in the hands of a first-year intern who hasn't even extracted a tonsil.
Scissors. What? Why. Complete interruption of the hepatic circulation. We will completely stop the liver vasculature, look for the source of the bleeding, and repair it.
I was going to sneak the license plate without anyone noticing, but then I thought it would be much more fun to make you watch. Now enjoy the moment when I steal the license plate of destiny. Ah, are you trying to pick the lock, El Capit√°n? It will take at least three minutes. Before then I will have hidden this plate where you will never find it.
We don't keep drugs in the study. If I wanted narcotics, doctor, I would call the guy with the briefcase like everybody does. I'm looking for Dr. Adrian Shaw. We have direct units to the Rayburn clinic. Who owns her?
And in spite of all that digging, dust and death, we didn't find a single soul, And I felt I had let them down. Firefighters don't let people down. A huge hole was created, inside me. Hope is hard to find, when you shut it out of your mind.
What a shame. Mike and I were thinking how nice it would be to have you for dinner this year. That's really nice, but we've already made a commitment. Axl is going to make a salad. As in you're going to make a salad, bring it over, and then come back later?
Rags, sitting there, talking to his imaginary friend. Someone-or something. His name was Captain Howdy. Damn the game. Dealing with that kind of force.... Anyway, he loved it.
Parachutes, actually. The police found three more base-jumping parachutes in the shed in your backyard. All of them had been tampered with. Who could have gotten into the shed? Bennett always left it open.
- Nothing yet. Would you like to take a closer look? Sure. Do you really think the suspect left the murder weapon downstairs? Twenty bucks says we find it in some bushes on the road.
Winning the war is more important than any soldier. I was not on duty that night, but I saw a guy in the car outside the victim's house that morning. Black, with short hair. - Did you get the license plate? - Yes, I wrote it down.
Gustus -- he was always saving me. Reid, did you catch scarlet fever as a child? - I did. - So did I, and so did Caitlin. Once you catch it, you can't catch it a second time.
There is no such thing as Mrs. Batman. Have you seen the Batcave? Only a woman could have fixed it up like that. Look, this Thanksgiving feast is really challenging. When I used to plan it, it took weeks of preparation.
- A romantic encounter? - No. - No? - No. Did he give you the necklace? If you are not romantic, why are you wearing it?
If it is with the Cause, I hope it is dead. I don't understand them. - They are a bunch of pricks. - They are ungrateful. The Offshore offers salvation to anyone and they despise it.
Besides, I'm not drinking alone anymore, am I? Apparently, no. Well, I just have one last question. Are you going to finish that steak? You bet I'm going to finish it.
Yeah, they couldn't have finished it before the virus spread. In the meantime, what they have completed is freaking splendid. That's right, I still can't believe there's a working toilet, guys. It's going to be a gray water system. A cistern collects rainwater and feeds it into the pipes.
He didn't want anyone to find out about his special recipe. Yes. You mean you made that dish yourself? Last night. He usually made a pan of it after closing. He kept it in the refrigerator.
And a shoe print. It is faint but quite clean. Find out who it belongs to. There's a security camera, but it's pointed at the crate. The body is out of its reach, but I'm sure if we look at it we'll find something in the footage.
- Oh, my God. Really? That's fantastic. With what invention? He calls it the Warm Legs Quilt.
- Typical of a cheap purchase. - Oliver, - it's not that bad. - Honestly, without making a big deal out of it, seriously -- it's the worst thing that can happen to somebody. Okay, you know what? I bought the f**king shirt by now, so you're going to wear it.
One of the things you learn on the farm is that death--it's part of life. Tell Joe what happened to that goat, and death will be part of your own life. You know what? Children can deal with a lot more than you think. And every moment, from birth to its end, is magically beautiful in its own way. So do we stick the goat in the dustbin or throw it over the fence?
Wait, if he goes to live there permanently ... Leonard could keep his things in Sheldon's room. - That would solve everything. - That's a great idea! Maybe I could turn it into an arcade.
Nick, have you met Jordan yet? He plays golf and he is an "A.S.S.O," as young people will say in the future. Yes, hello. Nice Scottish hat. I'll drink your sciacquadita if you don't want it.
Keep the track clear and prepare... Ice cream. The ground is approaching too fast, Grandpa. Which is good. That's where you want to be, right? Hey, let's make sure the belt is tight, but not too tight, so you can loosen it in case we catch fire.
You do. I got a promotion today. It's everything I've always dreamed of. E'... It's great. But all the time the bishop was offering it to me, the only thing I thought...
For a beetle no bigger than a thumbnail, it's like us climbing a dune twice as high as Everest. But even more impressive is what it does next. Standing perfectly still, facing into the wind, the beetle does a handstand. Mist begins to condense on its body. Microscopic bumps on its elytra direct water on furrows that carry it toward its mouth.
Oh, no... no, it's not... It's okay, it's... It's my fault. I was probably so drunk on Halloween that I forgot to write my name. The song also says. "Make a list, and check it off for good."
So, I went through Captain Green's computer. He has an account with a ridesharing service called HomeStretch. But there's no record of a request for a ride on the night of the murder. Well, someone picked him up. Yes, it appears that his account was infected with a worm that intercepts the request and then sends it to a third party.
I -- I kissed her for the first time, under that tree. Oh, God. It must have been wonderful. Well, I knelt down and took the little box in my hand. Only ... I opened it the wrong way.
- Ah, yes, that southern funk song. - That's right. Did that song have any special meaning? Yes, Allison. They used to sing it on Thanksgiving, pay attention.
Sorry, I didn't hear a word. That stain on his pants looks exactly like Bryan Cranston - That's who he is. - Oh, that's right. - Yeah, I've been staring at it for an hour.
It's not a radical position -- and I think a man of his intelligence has an interesting view on that. What's your point? Let me do the interview. One hour. You can say whatever you want -- and we'll air it during "LHL," which is broadcast in 130 countries.
- Which one of you threw down the gun? - Me. Stretch gave it to me weeks ago. He said if I was going to shoot SBKs, I should be armed. So I took it to Whitlock, told him I didn't want it.
From Corona General Hospital in Queens. Thank you very much. Sometimes I wonder what hobbies other people's roommates have. For a while I shared a house in London with a game urine collector. He used it as bait to hunt and trap animals.
So why doesn't he tell us the truth? We will all agree that he has suffered enough. It was a silver Lexus. It had pulled out of a parking lot and stopped at a stoplight, and inside were a man and a girl. I opened the door on the driver's side and shouted at them to get out, but the guy yanked it shut.
He doesn't want to... - All right. Send her in. Damona. The Christmas dinner is going to happen. Ken and I will plan it.
Meaning? It will only work once. So use it with extreme caution. - You will not get a second chance. - Understood. Cassandra, what about you? I have an idea, but you'll hate it.
He's on his way here right now. Wow. You actually did that. Yeah. And the hard part is yet to come. That's it... You're going to make it.
I have experienced the thrill of flight. Now on to the real challenge. To freedom! Build that hot air balloon using the same specifications and materials as the original. Here is the actual balloon. And the best part is that I am in line with those who made it.
A little bit of both. It was crazy in the sense that the idea was to put a pigeon in a missile ... ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGIST ...so that he would guide it against a ship. Putting a pigeon in a bomb is certainly crazy, if not immoral. But in theory, it could have worked. One pigeon catches the ball as it comes at him and pushes it toward the other.
- Is this a real thing? - Ever heard of her? But I can spot a dud. So the Dale was the most talked about car of its era. If it was so successful, why don't we know about it?
You've certainly seen a lot of printers. REPAIRER Have you ever seen a rage attack? Yes, certainly. They come in and destroy the printer by kicking it. Then they grab it and crash it to the ground.
But a great predator is lurking. His mortal enemy. Armed with a sticky net, she pulls it close. Stunned and trapped, the creature is helpless. It will take it back to its lair. And he will throw her into the dustbin.
- Can I hear it from here? - Yes. Yes, I can hear it. It is a sine wave. By combining tones with a keyboard, the Telharmonium synthesized music and played it through the telephone.
Driving the original Torpedo was a job for two, but I doubt anyone will want to take this ride with me, so I will go it alone. First, however, I will build a foam model. That way I can find the right shape. That's what they did in 1902: they planed. When we get the right shape, we'll build it out of steel.
Tom was sitting with his leg raised like this. In Arab culture, soles are never to be shown. It is not allowed. When they tried to get him to lower it, Tommy held it with his hand. Finally he lowered it.
Maybe we should try it." The answer was, "But no!" But eventually we tried. And, amazingly, it worked. It's a simple mechanism. There is a spring, and if you lift it, the cuffs open like magic.
* Don't go looking * Waterfalls * Be faithful to the rivers * Be faithful * And the lakes you're at. * You loved that song, I hated it.
Am I not enough for you? Or do you have another woman in your life? Or do you just not like me? I see the sword. I pull out the sword. right? Then I will pull it out and show you that I am your bride!
Is it because of the sword? Ahjussi. I can grasp the sword. Just a moment. Just wait a moment. I will pull it out for you.
- It wasn't a ghost? - No. Just a sleeping microphone operator with a very large microphone. Say the phrase. I'm not saying it.
Now, they want us to flee by leaving our villages. We cannot do that. Never. This land is ours. Our ancestors lived on it, cared for it and left it to us.
I'm not a great writer. I'm not Hawthorne. But from the first time I heard it, this story haunts me. It consumes me. I fear that if I didn't write it, I should never write again.
But from the first time I heard it, this story haunts me. It consumes me. I fear that if I didn't write it, I would never have to write again. What else? I'm afraid that if I did write it, it might not be as good as it should be.
Captain Pollard's conscience was clear. But the investigation was a farce. Pollard went back to sea, looking for the whale. He never found it.
There is everything you need, as long as you are not afraid of heights. Where does the water come from? It sucks it up from the depths of the earth. It's called Aqua Cola and it says it owns it. And because he owns it, he also owns us.
Count me in, okay? First of all, the project. We figure out what's wrong and fix it. After that, we build and send the organic matter over there. But more importantly, we'll bring it back.
But he is not as strong as all of us together. Listen, this place gave him the powers, but it also gave them to us. It's who we are now. Maybe it's what we are meant to be. We opened this door, now we're going to close it.
Oops. Wrong door. Couldn't I take the Nissan? No, no. Sorry, Dad, I thought we were going to the airport. Boys, when your father makes a promise, he keeps it.
So you are the new one. We've actually met before. A long time ago. You see that cornerstone? I saw it being laid when this place was nothing more than a cornfield.
No, even you, no. I heard you don't even notice it before it happens, okay? He just stands there all quiet, and then.... Bam! He cuts your head off and puts it in a bag attached to his belt.
If it makes you laugh, you will have to go out with me one last time before you leave. If, on the other hand, it doesn't make you laugh, I will know that we are incompatible - and I will put a stop to it. - It will be a hilarious joke. It is the funniest in human history. But it's very subtle, sophisticated, you probably won't get it.
Really enchanting. Lucifer. The future stepmother was a woman of strong feelings and refined tastes. And she too had known suffering. But she bore it beautifully.
Oh, girls-you are so witty. Who is that for? Has someone been forgotten? It's my seat. It seems too much to expect you to make breakfast -- to serve it and sit with us.
I know how many I have lost. We will do as Glass says. End of speech. We have to leave the boat. If the Arikara follow us, they will find it downstream.
Cafiedo, help me, the baby is bleeding! I thought it was pee, but it's blood! Help me, I couldn't stand her bleeding to death in my arms. I construct death in the cinema. I don't provoke it or create it.
It is not an easy thing to live with you. - You know, you were right about that word. - What word? The word: "Like." You said my friends use it all the time.
His father was forcing Ned to play baseball. He wanted to turn him into another Chaz Jr. And so Ned finds himself in the outfield, bottom left, last inning, last game. I'm pitching and I throw a very weak ball. The kid beats the hell out of it.
- I didn't mean to. Sorry. - What class, the kid. - He's not going to get better, so... - I get it. I take a key, stick it in my mouth, turn and lock it.
Kill it! You're welcome, Katniss. You never disappoint. Well... Plutarch gave me a letter for you. - I don't want it.
Happy birthday, honey. I'm sorry I was late. You forgot, didn't you? It's okay. I didn't even want it.
- No, no, no, no. Mom's paintings. Let's... Let's have an exhibition. We call it "The Hidden Art of Camille Fang" and promote it as a memorial. So Caleb will come out of hiding.
- Hello, love. Do you have room in the car for my bicycle? If I used it to go to classes, it would save a lot on parking. That's a very good idea. One way or another, I'll get it in there.
Were you the one shooting in the garden? Are you crazy? It's so dangerous! They started again, those bastards. - The electric fence is useless? - They ate it!
I was 9 years old and found a bullet among Mom's stuff. I swallowed it. Maybe it's still inside me. Dad followed me today, as he did when Mom died. I felt I had to do something important, I wanted to show him I was going to Mom's grave, but I couldn't find it.
He will give us credit. Go ahead, Chris, read more. 'And there in Aberdeen, he was almost killed in the freedom riots, "equality and fraternity."' Equality should start at home. Yes, he aimed for scholarship -- and got it.
Yes, at the inn, cleaning, cooking.... I think you've never done that, looking at your hands. All right, can we go? What about your bag? Do you expect me to carry it around for you?
It's no use, Plankton. Krabs knows all your plans. He got into my hard drive to look for the secret formula. I don't have it. We'll find it, though.
- Kevin, Kevin, Kevin! So let's see -- how should we do this? Oh, see this little trinket? Whoever takes it off my hands gets the job.
- Not chicken or veal? - I don't eat meat. Really? You look like the type who eats meat as soon as he can. If there was blood flowing, I won't eat it.
Patience is needed. You see the full picture. I do not see the full picture. I only see a small part. And I look at it and regard it-every day.
Better? It's just that I keep the house in a little different way, that's all.... It's my house. Will can you do me a favor and go get some wood? You know where we keep it.
I'm fine. We are all fine. Did it work? Where is the car? If it worked, it won't be there until we bring it back tomorrow.
And here it is... Here it is. - There you go. - Turn it off. You used to love this song. We used to sing it to you every night before....
That's an awful lot of absorbent cotton for such a small mop. I have now finished the bathroom and never wrung it out. I ask you one thing: would you use this mop after cleaning the bathroom next to the toilets, with all those germs, and then take it to the kitchen, where your family eats? I take the mop head off, put it in the washing machine, and it comes out clean, good as new.
One team will line up on the field to play defense, while the other team will take turns hitting the ball with a bat. What will you call this game? It's obvious. Smanazza The Bat. Your goal, pitcher, is to get the ball past me twice without me hitting it.
The coin hit him in the mouth and knocked out a tooth! What a jerk! Mom. In any case, I still have a bottle left. I'll take it. We'll drink to the horrible woman and her monster of a son.
Death. Well, or maybe the imperfection of human relationships, the imperfection of -- others, of yourself. What happens if you get this third star? - Oh, no. Not 'if', 'when'. - Okay, when you get it.
Jimmy and Conrad have climbed it 4 or 5 times, Jimmy even skied to the summit. But Meru is the anti-Everest. No one will carry your stuff. If you need it, you have to carry it on your back.
Now, there are two ways it could have ended. Talking it over with Chris to the point of exhaustion now seemed ... far-fetched. But fate stepped in once again and helped me. There's the bell! But no one hears it.
You turned down our proposal, I'm not going to go back on it, but I got you here today.... The school called me to tell me you want to withdraw Katie. That's a mistake! This is the best girls' school in the country! I can't afford it.
Is there anything in the trunk? Nothing special. It must be meat. Ricardo is never wrong. If there is meat he will find it.
- Yes. Oh, my God! You think everything is like Terminator! Because everything is like the Terminator! They cut off Arnold's hand in the past, find it, reverse the mechanism of that thing, and boom!
Man's history is defined by war. And war, by the man who fights it.
Yes. You were always a homunculus, Antoine. A second-hand thinker, at best. This ... desperation ... suits you. The key to it all -- it's in your mind, and now you're going to give it to me.
If you don't discuss constructively, what does Mom do to you? She destroys video games. Andrew? And the game console. She burns it while we watch.
Quiet. The World Cup is your chance to redeem yourselves. You will never win if you don't find your sound again. You have completely lost your harmony. So, in the next two days you will do everything together until you find it again.
You are too good for me, I don't want to hurt you. Don't. Now, the eagle eye up there will notice the funny uniform I'm wearing today. But the issue is disrespect for the uniform. You don't wear it to shop or to go to the pub, even if you think you can.
- He killed our parents. - They themselves are responsible - for their demise. - What are you saying? The box was in their house. They were the ones who hid it.
"I can't believe you said that, you fucking idiot." Everyone hears that voice. Do you really mean it? Sure. Most just ignore it.
Laugh, damn it." Everyone laughed but me. I wrote a poem. I wrote a poem for the girl I took to the prom. My brothers found it and put it on the bulletin board, like it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen.
Shit. I don't understand. You see that briefcase? It's full of dough. Someone wants us to take it.
- There were unresolved issues, I think. And to see you, "dummy!" Why else would I come back, huh? We're having a parade in Manhattan next month to commemorate the riots. We'll go all the way downtown, all the way to Central Park -- and they'll call it the "Homosexual Liberation March."
General Yu-baek ordered me to kill you, sir. I am the assassin. Go ahead and try. Are you going to kill me? The sword-I will turn it against him.
Wait a minute! Wait here. Hong-yi! Sul-rang's sword... I haven't seen it in years.
But it's a riddle! Have you ever fought for something without being sure you could win? It is the story of my life. I want it to be mine, too. Just for clarity, if your father takes us all the way to Lord Alcaman's throne and if there is a crown, I will take it to King Zakkour in Al-Moraad.
You think propaganda is a totalitarian thing, very sad, speakers, crowds chanting and all that, and we think of Hitler. We always think it's a foreign thing, but it's actually one of the most American things there is. It's as American as apple pie. Well, advertising works because smart advertisers,at the very least are trying to link the consumption of his product to a message that suggests that your needs will be met by consuming that thing. He wants you to think that you will look wonderful with that thing. But then you put it on and think that:
- We can't. Hands in the air! I want to see the hands. All right? We have been informed that there is an injured child. Is that so? Tell them there's a bomb in the car and you're going to detonate it.
As proof that we were here. It's because of the open door. What? It can't be Stanza if the door is open. Do you want me to close it?
Ring Laudner Jr., Albert Maltz, etc. We can do that. I find the writer and I will work with him. He will give the script to me. If it goes well, I will give it to you.
Others? Two thousand dollars is appealing to a certain breed of undesirables. And you, what breed are you? Local tribes call this forest "the place of the tree-spirits." Hunters call it the Silver Ghost.
I think I certainly would have recognized him. I don't see any reason why anybody would have, Who knew what he looked like. Seattle police's own reports indicate that Officer Lavendowski found Kurt Cobain's wallet on the floor. He opened it and removed his driver's license, and placed it on top of Cobain's wallet to take a picture as evidence
But I have to stop before I catch it. Just keep running. When you turn right, trust that the ball will be yours. What, you want me to catch it for you?
- I can't, I'm sorry. I came to thank you for inviting me, but I have other plans. That's too bad. Well, Jim is here. Jim, why don't you leave the dinner and warm it up when you come back later?
And even now, you haven't brought her a flower in ten years. And then that letter! Do you think Mother didn't read it? You're wrong. She found it and read it, and then I found it too.
This ethos was embraced by the chief creators and sellers of Silk Road, know what the hell you put in your body, and it echoes throughout the entire community. There are people I didn't sell to, just because I could tell that--obviously--not mature enough to handle using drugs, they didn't know enough about them. It was like a "read before you use." You... think about it, you come back to me, and I'll sell you something. but I'm not going to deflower you and kill you, potentially. Particularly the heroin, I was very careful who I sold it to because-it wasn't cut.
And this goes from the large corporation, to the individual. Even to those who argue that information should not be encrypted. Certainly this allows confrontation for law enforcement, but it makes it easy for cybercriminals to attack. It makes sense to say that criminals are in the first bracket along with all kinds of paranoid people about these new services. But that doesn't mean they are the only ones using these services. I know a large portion of journalists who communicate regularly with Tor. But you know, for people who ... are against this technology that they see as dangerous, the fact that criminals are using it, it's a great way to demonize it.
What happened to you, boy? What do you mean? You must have been a good boy. Done properly. How did you end up so bad? I was 14 ... in my best friend's basement in Maryland, he and I hid a bottle of Sambuca and finished it between us.
I make men feel good about themselves. You see, everyone here has served a captain who uses violence to achieve a purpose.... To terrorize, to show off. When men see that, they can recognize the lie. They know that captain is, somewhere in his soul, horrified by his own actions. And the lie infects anyone who sees it.
I envy you quite a bit. I remember what it was like the first time I met him. There is a feeling that springs up in the presence of a... Real great man. It is something quite indescribable. I imagine you are experiencing it right now.
You have to trust us. Why? You do not trust. There is the map to the kingdom. We protect it at the cost of our lives.
Well, she died before I got the job, but -- I hope she would be proud of me. Would she have supported your accusations to? to medical marijuana centers, for example? Well, Nigel, my mother taught me to fight for justice, to protect those who are vulnerable. The law is the best way to do that. The U.S. Attorney's Office prosecutes those who break it, we don't decide the laws.
Very Oprah. On guard, it's vomitous stuff. I'm a vessel. This stuff comes to me from the universe. I spread it around.
I'm not the one he has to get along with. Don't give it to him until he allows you to touch him. How did you become an expert? Do you have credentials, or... Are you going to eat this meat or give it to your dog?
The color of the bruise doesn't tell me anything, but this conversation tells me that you are anxious. April, you will have to deal with the possibility that you may relapse for the rest of your life. You need to learn to control your anxiety. How? Some use antidepressants, others use medical marijuana. Some solve it with exercise, yoga, meditation.
- They will seek. - Their creator. - Docile. And the desert... Will become... a sweet garden. Now I'm going to say a word to you, and I'd like you to repeat it.
For no amount of money is it worth reliving it all. I don't. Slow down! Why are you still here? All right, I'll tell you something and then I'll stop.
- Excuse me? - Your bag, miss. - But I'm -- I'm just going in. - It's practice. Well, then--then I'm going to leave it in the car.
This operation is very stressful for animals, so it must be performed very carefully. After surgery, the wound can be sutured or left open. Open wounds heal much faster, but there is a greater risk of infection. The operation takes only 20 minutes, but afterwards it must be supervised by a veterinarian.... Not everyone applies anesthesia; some guinea pigs cannot tolerate it, and may even die after the surgery.
No problem, I have penicillin. - All right? - Yeah. Listen, do me a favor: leave the door open for the dogs. They walk around the rooms at night, and if the door is closed, they'll nibble their way in.
- Are you following me? Technically, yes. I'm also very fascinated by the Fairy Godmother's wand. Which is another reason why I'm looking forward to the coronation. Maybe we can sit together and discuss her qualities. Are you saying they're going to use it during the coronation?
Did you try the compass? Where did I put it? It doesn't work. It must be the volcanic rock. The iron deposits confuse it.
- I can control it. - Just tell them the truth. - I can control it! I won't... I won't use it again.
We will not serve Szorlok. Yes you will. Both in life and in death. As your sister did. Necromancer, you will retrieve the stone and deliver it to me.
Advance. There's nothing there. How is there nothing, Stace? The image is everything. I want you to find it.
He breaks his balls about everything. If you want to make yourself useful, you can go get me a coffee. - Aren't you drinking it already? - Hey, man. See the garbage? Why don't you pick it up and throw it in the dumpster in the garage?
- Would you like to be 20 years old? - No, absolutely not. No, I would like to ... If I had a pill that would take me back 25 years, - I wouldn't take it.
You should have seen May last night, you know. She said ... she was surrounded ... by death. And all I heard was, "No s√©ance." - Do you think she would agree to that? - Absolutely not. Reason why, we're going to do it right now.
- A letter? - Clown. When I thought they were going to hang me, yes. Thank you. You needed Letters Molloy to write it for you.
By telling you what you want to hear hoping to get some reward? But I have shown you that I want nothing in return. Last time -- you said you felt the presence of my children. Yes. Do you feel it now?
I will take your request to the governor. In private? Sure. He may reject it. More than likely he will reject it.
Do you think that a) the driver of the cab who brought you is an eccentric millionaire Who is driving his cab for fun? No. I don't think so Or what do you think, It's actually b) some son of a bitch drug dealer Who's a little too high on the merchandise Then why don't we keep it?
The killer cut her implants off. Michael Kelly ate his fingernails until he tore them off. And the killer cut off his fingers. Emily Erickson's murder a pattern, too. The Internet is the place where you can create illusions. Make people see only what you want them to see. But when reality didn't match what the killer saw on Flirtual, he punished them. He wants perfection, he's looking for it.
Well, take care of it. Great, I'll see... what I can find in town. No, you know how these things go. You've got the story of the night. When we get it out, I want you to take care of it from here.
Schools of thought that believe it is better to acknowledge one's fears and externalize them. If you keep them inside, - they can turn into something else. - Into bad dreams, for example? Yes, into nightmares. They call it "repression."
Alan, are you coming? Alan. They can't even tighten a screw on the Gemini capsule without asking Gus first. Two of flowers. At Cape everyone calls it "Gus-mobile."
What if you don't find it? What if you don't find anything? All actions have ramifications, which means that all actions leave evidence. And we will find that evidence, simply because it exists. And we will not stop looking until we find it.
At night. I saw a white thing wandering around. A white thing? Yes, it was running fast through the factory at night. I could only see it.
I will take them today. God does not ask if we accept this life. It is not chosen. Life is imposed on us. The only choice is how we live it.
Just having a look. What do you want? I'm here to meet my Spanish cousin. Be careful not to rest your elbows on the table, I just had it polished. If you see a fly, swat it with the fly swatter.
They are following me. Where do you want us to meet? Destroy the recording. Destroy the... But... If someone is following you, then destroy it.
Why do such a thing? Suicide? No. The gun is in his left hand. Earlier, in his room, he was holding it with his right.
Of course. He had the gun in his hand. Don't you think it could have been something else? An accident? Unless he was using it to scratch his head?
They look so... Sloppy. They are the Ten Little Soldiers. You know, the ones in the poem. I know it by heart. As a child, my nanny used to recite it to me.
The Owens are lucky to have her. I will definitely pass that on to them. Thank you, ma'am. Where is your school located? I doubt you know it; it's not very well known.
It's like home cooking. Like baking a cake. Only it's much better than any cake you've ever had. There, that's an old press, really old. And now we bake it.
- Did anyone recognize her? - Forget the gun? There's a Fenian sitting there with a damn gun! - Don't blaspheme! - Give it to me.
You must be joking. Why would a dying man joke? Do you want to give me the axe or not? Yours is a crazy concession. I don't think you will use it against me.
- Wait a minute! I'm not done yet! I certainly hope so. You wrote a really hot scene, Lennox. And they're playing it very faithfully.
That creep is Randall Toth and he is organizing a group exhibition of artists who have dealt with depression. And that's why he wants to use your mother's work. Great, so now everyone can know what happened. - It's just an exhibition, Leah. - You know Mom wouldn't see it that way.
- Can it help you? - I could use an extra towel. - Okay. And this is going to sound like a silly question, considering the state of the carpets in our room, but do you have a computer room here? Sure, we have a computer room. You'll find it just past the door on your left, right next to the Hammam Spa.
- Yes. Can you hold this for me? Liquid oxygen and a stain remover containing ammonia. This stuff is five times more powerful than a stick of dynamite. How do we activate it?
- He has an ancient family name... Doors that are closed for us could be opened for him. What incentives could we offer him? His destitution, at the moment, must be severe. Do you intend to buy his friendship? I would prefer that he grant it willingly.
I don't feel safe to go out. There is anger in the air. Do you know what your problem is? You telegraph fear. Militants feel it about you.
They have little food and the situation is escalating. There are many gangs and the law is rarely enforced. Be sure to stay away from the wall. You will notice a row of buildings along the wall that they call the "Line of Death." If you cross it, you will die.
- Did you see that? - Yes. You were really hot. "Make that six." This pool is even better than I remembered it.
Yes, it's shit. Jesus. What happened to the picture? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I have bad news and you were going to hear about it sooner or later, so I might as well tell you.
Yes, I think we should talk about that again. You're worried about the cost, aren't you? Well, don't be. On the fee I've been ruthless. They will lower it further.
Well, that's clearly the one to bring in the money. And by the way, don't you think it's a little strange that this is the first time you've mentioned it? Because there was nothing to talk about. It was just an idea. Well, now there's to talk about. It pisses me off that I suddenly have the nerve to claim that we created it together.
You may not know it now, but it's out there. Waiting to be found. Longing to be found. It's almost always easy. So simple as to be stupid. And when you find her. well ... there is no such feeling in the world.
It's your turn, Einstein, the saddest thing ever. Well... there was a scientist who lived 300 years ago who wanted to find out how much the earth weighed. He theorized a series of measurements that could be taken with pendulums, weights and counterweights. He spent years building an ingenious contraption and then died. He knew exactly how to find the answer, but he never knew it.
Mom, I gave you the report card. We lost the report card. Your father will be angry. - Search well! - It's not there, I can't find it.
We can help you if you let us go. You might even try to take the ship back if I let you go. We have a common interest in saving Flint, but don't get any ideas. This ship now belongs to my people. It was part of the deal. We took it and we intend to keep it.
For the first time since I arrived ... there is no Guthrie in Nassau. One gets so used to the state of things-then it is easy to forget that they are only transient. Specks of dust hang in the air until a strong gust comes along and rearranges everything. That strong gust has arrived on these shores. Men feel it.
A few months ago, my life made no sense to me. I felt no joy, no pleasure. I would have been fine if that little game of Russian roulette had come to an end. But since I planned and implemented the elimination of Judge Spangler, life took a new turn. I understood why people loved life and saw it as a joyful thing.
Make that two beers. More than two, less than ten. Just get out of here now! To pass the exam I have to know how to jump a wooden fence. Have you ever seen a wooden fence in India, much less a civil servant jumping it on a horse?
I wish I had something for this eye! The house does not grant wishes. It helps people in need. It was built as a shelter. No one expected a serial killer to find it.
- Thank you. - For a foreigner. Are you familiar with the personalities of pre-Renaissance Florence? I think not. If Dr. Fell had in his hands, in his non-Italian hands, an annotation of Dante Alighieri himself-would he recognize it?
- Only men? - Every hour. It's getting really messy. So you lead both, the teacher and the student, to the.... electric chair? Well, we don't call it that, but yes, if you follow me to the next room, please?
If you had read the manual, you would know. Call up the spirits, you wear it, and the last spirit that possessed you is called up. We record everything with that camera and record your progress. If you can take it off yourself the spirit caller while you are possessed, then you have completed rehabilitation. If I have to take it off for you, then therapy continues.
- And you're calling me an E. coli? - I'm exposing your blood to another bacterium. This is preliminary research. If we want to find a cure, we have to see how the disease defends itself. The more you expose it to different environments, the better you know it.
He will always remember the night he enjoyed at the restaurant, it will be his legend. But there is nothing real about it, it is a bluff. Emotions are always real, the rest is line at the post office. - Dr. Powerful? - Yes? I have a beautiful farm. If you would like to see it for some bucolic scenes.
Nothing is left for me, this trade doesn't make as much as it used to. - You can sell this car. - To whom? Everything is traceable. In a month the owner comes back from the Caribbean, reports it, and they see where it is right away. I'll have to return it.
What is that little black thing underneath? It looks like a micro-camera. This is a micro-camera. Now I understand how they got in. This one captures the door, and as they break it in, the surveillance gets the image of the door intact.
- But are you okay? - We've mutinied. The job of an actor is strange. I here.... It mixes with life and confuses it.
They are really good. The same as when you were a child. The song you were humming yesterday.... It reminds me of something. I used to sing it to you when you were afraid.
From leaves to paste to powder--they were producing 10,000 kilograms a week. At $50,000 a kilo-that's $5 billion a year. These people were serious. Pablo's cousin Gustavo was bringing in chemicals from Germany to liquefy the cocaine. They would add it to spirits ... to coffee ... and so just for fun ... they put it back into Coca Cola.
What are the options, since we don't have any? We hide her until the dust settles. Then we give her... - Immunity for testifying. - And you grant us immunity? We get thrown in jail if we get caught with this woman. Well, next time your wife brings home a human grenade, why don't you pass it on?
Look, I think Dre and I are much more evolved than that. Please. Don't you remember why you fell in love with him in the first place? Give me the mustard. - I'm using it.
Oh, there's pizza here. Do you want it? You want my slice? I'm good,but thanks. Okay, well,you can save it for later then.
Come here. it's the first time for me - What is it? - It's really relaxing It's just a recipe, my grandmother eats it for breakfast.
- Honestly, that's not ours. - Yes, and then who would leave the grass in the wall? Who would leave grass in the wall? A weed genius! And he would leave it there indefinitely, in case of emergency.
Why is it like that? Why is it not as easy for me as it is for you? Pain is the same for everyone. It's morphine. I don't want it.
Listen, can you stretch that repair backpack for me? Yeah, yeah, sure. Hey, look -- we got a huge problem out there, man. Before -- when Dennis said, "We had a great idea with this plan," that wasn't entirely accurate because it was actually my idea, and I think the use of the word "we" is really confusing because... like, how does a group of people have an idea at the same time? What, do they all say it at the same time?
A couple of guys had had too much to drink and were looking for trouble, okay? That's not what you told Karen. Why are you lying to me? I'm not. You know, I know bullshit when I hear it, Stan.
Did you go the extra mile, as they say? What had Charlie found? He wouldn't tell me. I had no choice but to sign your exile letter. I don't make the law, I just enforce it.
About the nuns. Why? I was raised in faith. Do you have faith? - Are you offering it to me?
When the devil knocks on your door, he doesn't have... dumb hooves. He is gorgeous...and offers you what your heart desires with whispers. Like a siren...luring you...to his ruinous shore. And what do you do...when that siren sings? You save your soul...or give it to her.
I was sent there -- Christmas '53. There, I was already back home. Have a seat. No, I already have a place. One thing's for sure: they can keep it for me, Korea.
I would pull everything up. First of all these little girls here. Everybody wants to go back to the way they were. Right? I had a pedicure once. The girl who did it for me told me I had hairy fingers.
I hid it here years ago. - Wait. - Yeah, no, no key. Just a piece of paper, a movie ticket and four teeth. "If you're looking for Ron's key, I moved it and you'll never find it.
Besides, who's going to miss a lousy club? Why don't you ask the people gathered right now outside your building? - What do we want? - Breakfast! When do we want it?
I will say this Brody. Thanks for coming down, hope you are enjoying your stay. Definitely. I particularly like the golden shower. I know the shower is golden, honey, but I don't think they call it that.
What is that stuff! I don't wear that paper stuff on me! That's my favorite color, I wear it. There is only one paper uniform in the size of a pregnant woman. I suggest you get it... Before one of those fat girls sleeping with you takes it to contain her belly.
Well, but if you tell me the bad things like that. Yes, look I know you've got eyes Angie. And it's good for you to know that the only butterfly I'm interested in is my own, and the only things that fit in there are dicks, and tampons. And sometimes a few other things, but only guys can put it in. Clear. You call it a butterfly, though. you know, it's really hard to resist.
That one reminds me of Daya's favorite anecdote. Meaning? You're screwing her and you don't know the story of her quinceanera? She told that story to everyone. Aleida got drunk, she tripped and fell on the birthday cake. Her dress caught fire because of the candles -- but you have to hear how Daya tells it.
I said I don't want to panic everybody, I ... And why should we panic if the jail doesn't close? People can panic for a variety of reasons. For sharks, for school shootings... for bee extinction.... They call it "depopulation syndrome." And they say it's the fault of... this Monsanto pesticide.
Hey! - Is that our wheelbarrow? - It's from the prison. I can use it, too. You can use it, but then you have to return it.
Come here, come here. Cut. Listen, all right? You can't have this patrol car. It's our car. We found it and we're not giving it to you, okay?
You name it, we do it. Weaving baskets at the craft museum. Well, you said it. There's another one. I wish the black cherry pancake sauce was on the top shelf because it starts with "A," but I won't put it there.... because I don't want you to break your little legs while you're intent on making me breakfast.
It's about-it's about the fucking mint cookies. All right? And the reason I'm so good at it is because I take it seriously. Now, watch -- and learn. Listen. According to the Master, guys, we're not getting enough vitamin D, so these stickers capture the sun's energy and transmit it directly to our bodies, okay?
Strange, exalted and disgusting. If you are satisfied with this name. In marketing jargon, we call him "The Good Belushi." If I had a magic wand, I would make sure Greendale never had to grow up. I would probably also use it to cancel the Magic Wand course I noticed in the educational offerings. Same thing for Video Recorder Repair, a course named "Ladders," and "When is it permissible to shake a baby?"
Do you remember that guy? You hired him to clean the floors, remember? A boy named Michael stole a credit card. Could this be it? He said he found it by accident, but never returned it.
Hey, Sam. Ah, if it isn't Dr. Warren. I need to talk to you. What has he done to his face? The mobsters from the north and south got it again.
Back from where? As far south as possible. You are my queen. The prince likes not to be disturbed. Get out of my way, or I'll take this long ax and shove it up your...
Thank you. - Thank you, your majesty. Thank you. Take your head away. Allow me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind.
Of course. Twice I almost sold the house. It was empty the whole time we lived at Mark's. For four years, right? Nadia didn't want me to sell it.
What should I do... - Kate? - I think he would want the operation. Look, with all due respect... I don't think Doc would want it.
Oh, look. It's the amazing Maggie. This is really a dream. And you know, I was taught that this is a team effort and to always thank my coach first. So, this gold medal, I owe it to you, Hope Greggory.
Yes! We have the combination! Just to say...there are no refunds if you finish early! Are you sure you don't want to go home? When the suitcase comes back, they will send it to us.
- You're welcome. Thank you for coming. - You're welcome. - That's nice of you. I rediscovered cabbage. I found that if you chop it up. Add salt, pepper and butter, it's delicious.
Thank you for coming. - You're welcome. - That's nice of you. I rediscovered cabbage. I found that if you chop it up. Add salt, pepper and butter, it's delicious. You just cook it for five minutes, boil it well -- five minutes straight, then serve it, because if it's on the stove for too long.... It starts to stink.
- You're welcome. - That's nice of you. I rediscovered cabbage. I've found that if you chop it up. Add salt, pepper and butter, it's delicious. You just cook it for five minutes, boil it well -- five minutes straight, then serve it, because if it's on the stove for too long.... It starts to stink. You boil it... Good and fast, with the lid on.
I'd like to, but it costs too much to get people to develop. You can always build your own darkroom, learn how to develop. Well, there's not -- a lot of space where I live, so.... Well, anyway... it's the Hasselblad that gives that blur you see in the picture. They call it "bokeh."
He was not that stupid. I don't think he would have taken a pierced milk jug. I think whoever or whatever cut the children also made the milk jug lose. Well, we can imagine many things, but the fact is one. In his diary, the man boasted how many times he assembled the bomb and tested it, and each time it worked just the way he wanted it to. Except this time.
Sam, this is my second call to you. I hope you hear the message soon. I'll be in touch. All right, Sylvia. Look, if you don't open the door right now, I'm going to break it down.
Yes, a person named Marta, but she is no longer in the program. Why not, it was too much for her. - What should I do when I am in her memories? - We think--that yesterday's bomb was an accident--and it exploded in her apartment while she was making it.
- What? - Take it off. - The necklace? - Take it off. Take it off, I don't want you to wear it.
Come on. Yes... You'll see it all go away. In the meantime, I'm taking Peggy Blomquist back to Minnesota. And if anyone has any grievances for me--after the week I've had--they can keep them to themselves.
Why do you keep looking out the window, Will? Do you like the snow? You know, for some people, snow generates ... definite feelings. Some people love it.
- But the army is still looking for him. - No one is looking for him. The few soldiers in the valley were taking MacQuarrie to Beauly to the sheriff. This letter is to ask the garrison at Fort Williams for help. And if they don't receive it.
But what about social security? The subsidies and welfarism? We don't want to present a new face and then shoot ourselves in the foot. Then let's not pretend to unite the party. Let's really unite the party through this legislation. Republicans will never pass it.
If she stays on track, nothing will be precluded. - Big assignments, her own team, etc. - I wouldn't be here if I had a choice. But she does have a choice. She can make the most of this second chance if she wants it. You have to show us that you want it.
Francine Tenaka. If you don't know who Teneka is, there's no reason for you to know who Brad Petite is, or that he's ambitious or good. This job offer comes either from you or from the president. And I'm telling you it doesn't. Well, I'm going to turn it down anyway.
And so is our nation. When I invited the president here, I hoped to find ... An ally. But the demands President Petrov made confirmed to me that peace is not his priority. Peace should not be bought. Peace should be the only reward. And we will get it, with. Or without him.
But this is ridiculous! How can anyone believe this farce? We have received thousands of emails accusing us of scamming. Social media has gone crazy! Everyone is already calling it the Big Lie.
The creditors are bleeding us dry. He was so obsessed with his freaking inheritance that we were going broke. He was losing his fortune, not yours. - He built it. - And he was squandering it.
- Strength. - 30 seconds to countdown. The National Guard is here. Position yourself in front of the shuttle. Don't let any sharks hit it.
Actually, we had a little problem. - What problem? - You have a fever. It's not high, it's 38. - What does that mean? - Well, that we need to figure out what's causing it so the surgical team can decide how to proceed.
As long as possible. I can still taste you. Hey do you happen to have an aspirin? I went a little overboard on Jeger last night. Yeah, I'll get it for you.
Are you coming? I would love to come, but I'm out of money. Do you also address your parents this way? Do you have weed? Maybe we'll get it there.
- Derrick, what can you do? - I can fall on the floor. Okay, great, you get fouls. Harvard, what can you offer? Uncontainable rage. And now these panties in the butt. - Are feeding it.
Hitting a dwarf with the handle? Wait Jimmy, come back here. I have to check if there's sand in your vagina. Did you see that door? It was closed before a rookie kicked it down.
No. How do you know her name is Silvia? - Will you promise not to take me for a fool? - Come on. Put the bike down here. - No, I'll keep it with me.
- Oh, strange. Look at this chair. - I know. At least I think it's a chair, and what is this? I don't know. Anyway in your place I wouldn't touch it.
Is there a god? Out. You didn't answer the question. There is... a... If you talk about it any more we'll rip your tongue out and make you swallow it.
You have the same interest as I have in finding a cure. If you help me, maybe I can help you because of what I will learn. I will work as fast as I can, and you can bury her in a few days. You will not cut off her face? I will protect her at the cost of my life.
So Sal, the shrimp guy, wants to buy Jake's boat? Yes. I heard him say he was thinking about a real estate investment. So I suggested the boat to him, and he said he's in. And better yet, George, he said he wants to rent it to you like A.B. did.
What is it? Why didn't you throw it away? I thought it might come in handy. I certainly didn't think I would use it like this. After taking it out of the hotel... it looks like he kept it for himself.
Say no more! His mother is at the reception. I think she wants to report him missing. He was out looking for drugs. He would use the car while I was at the gym, because afterwards I would go drinking with the girls and come home in a cab. He would always put it back right where and how I left it, except for the smell of weed in the passenger compartment.
You didn't know that? No, I-I knew she grew up by the sea, and her father was a fisherman, but she kept names and places to herself. She was protecting you. This is it, the shell. I've held it close to my heart ever since, thinking of her every day.
One moment, sir. Do you disagree with the laws of this country? I can't help thinking that, in this case, justice would have been better served by leniency. Fortunately for justice ... this Court interprets the law better - than you do. - So the law is savage. And you interpret it without benevolence!
Five. Jesus, John. What is it? Five? He's selling a lie and people are buying it.
Why don't you come with me and Sam to the farm tonight? To sip Pinot... - Watching the owls as they hunt.... - Actually, I can't. Jimmy and I have a surprise party planned for Nate, but it's not a surprise because we do it every year.
We need to strengthen the spring. - We? - Well, you, you and whatever it is that you use instead of your brain. Start by making a spring twice as long. Better bring it here so I can check it.
I made a little bit of a mess. 400,000 dollars. I can't fucking believe it! Hello? Hey, do me a favor. Take your 400,000 offer, stick it in one of your driverless cars, and drive it down a mountain, because our app is not on the market.
Not better or worse, just different. You're just a know-it-all. Only if you assume-that a business degree leads to being a know-it-all instead of an educated person. A lot of educated people are pretty stupid, and a lot of stupid people like to argue for no good reason, on a beautiful day like this. Let's not ruin it.
We should not kill people we are trying to save. Leave your effects in the container. - We are here to see... - Leave your effects in the container. Take off your belt and leave it in the container.
At work it was... I don't know. At work it's a mess. I got you a slice of pecan pie from Braum's. It's in the fridge. Thanks. Do you mind if I have it another time?
- A hearing does not automatically bring... - But he could get out of jail. - Yes or no? - Even if they grant bail, - I don't think they will set it that low....
Ah, you read my mail now? You can't even see it. Of course I can. Then read it. I'll read it later.
Guys, I can guarantee that a milf drives this thing. It's certain. Really, what is it that you know, that she has done 90,000 kilometers. I think she was driving it now instead her daughter is driving it.
- I was already leaving. - After I told you to leave. No, no, no. I was thinking about it long before you said anything. Is that my shirt? I can give it back to you.
Two, the one at the dam and the one at the mine, are already getting into position. The third, in the mountain, is releasing the Terran prisoners right now. As the fourth team, our job is to keep the enemy's eyes away from them for as long as possible. To do this, we will position ourselves here, at the main gate, with the whole army. The Mountain Men believe that the door cannot be opened from the outside, so they leave it unguarded.
They told me you haven't eaten for two days. How bad is it? We both know you're not here to bring me dinner. It is serious. They are attacking our electricity source. I sent a team out to the dam -- but there's an army outside our front door -- and they're drilling it.
From what? It seems strange that places like this are so close to the city. - Places like this? - Yes, in the sense, places where tranquility is not just a legend. Come anytime, my folks never use it.
You, Moose, you are the healthy one. Do you agree with him? Wings of Titania, lead my eyes up there, I command you.... This is madness. You want me to get you the most dangerous weapon on the face of the earth for Dean Winchester, the man who freaks out every time he touches it!
He built an empire, starting from a shoe shine box. And then, only later, he brought in your father as well. But, I know the story. No, you don't. Because if you knew it, you would know that you are only a small part of it.
You are the scientist, it shows that I am not. They didn't give you any notice? Do they ever do that when they fire? What about the adoption of Peter? They won't grant it to us if you are unemployed.
I have nothing against you. Esther made this deal a long time ago. It is very unfortunate that she involved you too. You talk as if you don't have a choice, but this is only your doing. When I give my word, I keep it, and I expect others to do the same.
- It's really fascinating, - but how do we find Simmons? - Light bulb on, literally. I mean, I mean, metaphorically. Before Simmons beat me, I hit him with my compressed beam of light, and he thanked me for recharging it. He absorbs energy and turns it into beams that he uses as a weapon.
What happened. The behavior is defensive. He relaxed when he realized there was no more danger. Or when he thought no one was watching him. I don't think he's faking it. I have a theory, but I have to test it before making a diagnosis.
Pierce knows where he is but won't tell me. Joanne, if I don't find this guy, something very bad is going to happen. You're a resourceful guy, Walter. I'm sure you'll come up with something. I just came by to pick up a few things and show you where I was forced to hide the pot before the girls found it.
Well, I wouldn't say it exactly hurts. Well, this has nothing to do with Billy. I understand that my nomination is shipwrecked. It's not shipwrecked, it's an uphill road. An uphill road, but you'll see we'll get through it.
I have a feeling that I am to blame. - I don't understand. Is Bo a shifter now? - Not really. The cat you gave her is an "aitvaras." It brings luck to its owner, but steals it from those who don't like it.
With all due respect, I-I really have no idea. Phil. sometimes when you sew a quilt, you just don't have the right scraps. And no matter how much effort you put into it -- in the end it comes out a quilt like this. - I agree: it's ugly. - And you put so much effort into it--and you kid yourself that it's beautiful--and you proudly display it in the entryway, on your couch.
She is with a new friend. An important friend. Why is this new friend so important, Minx? Something terrible is going to happen. Before the crash ... I felt something enter my mind. Like someone was opening it to rummage through my memories.
You were great in the goal area! Yes, I love sports. You're going to take my virginity tonight. All right... The prom crown was so tacky -- I hardly wear it anymore.
Open the gate. Maybe in L.A. the tough-guy attitude works, but down here in the desert, the music ... is a little different. Ms. Waters, kindly. Eugene said you have a court order. Can I see it, Detective?
If you were my woman, you should never have done that. Cookie, wait. I'll send you a song. I think it's perfect for your son. Gee, I think you'll really remember it.
- Break it to him. - Up. - We have the weapon, let him go. - Wait, wait. I don't want it. All right? I don't want it.
- Up. - We have the weapon, let him go. - Wait, wait. I don't want it. All right? I don't want it. I don't feel comfortable with it. Who wants it?
Why do you think I would accept? I am selling my beloved property for you. I scratch your back, and you ... - you whip mine. - Adrian, it's... bad enough that our house is "with crime," I'm also not going to let you turn it into a sex prison.
There, I can't explain that. You asked Waits for proof ... and he gave it to you. A smoking gun. I'm not buying it. I don't know what game he's playing, but I'm not buying it.
He was wounded by the Boers. He was shot in the face. He never does the right thing. He owns this house. Right now his father is just renting it.
Just the two of you? Sometimes. Close enough to give her a letter without anyone seeing you? Close enough for that. Wait here, then, while I write it.
How good is this grass? It is a miracle. A miracle for medical use. I can confirm. An old love of mine was sick and used it for pain.
It is a miracle. A miracle for medical use. I can confirm. An old love of mine was sick and used it for pain. Here, we used it together.
Her parents are going to kill her! - And now--excuse me? - What? What? You know, the spelling bee. You know I watch it every year.
- Can't you bring more here? - Not with sealed subtility. Then we have to find the stash that William left here. William left a stash? Mara was looking for it, but she never found it.
Don't tell me you both drank it without realizing it! Mabel! Really, sometimes I despair! I didn't do anything to encourage him. Lytton, a cake if you don't eat it is simply not a cake.
Hood. Where are you going? You can't... You can't just pick up and leave. I'm holding on to it this time!
Do you have a minute to talk? The Stingray. I loved that bike. It had a three-speed transmission on the frame. He never let me use it.
- You will need time to recover from surgery. This dose of cortisone should make you feel better. So. When were you diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy? I saw the brain atrophy on your CT scan. My-my pediatrician discovered it when I was 5 years old.
I will never see her walk. I will never be able to hear her speak. I will never see her get married. Sure you will. An ambulance is coming, Dougie, I can hear it.
Everyone knows her. She's from Boston. You don't mess around with Boston. There was a bully at my place, too. I used to take his little head and stick it in the toilet.
No. I don't want the wave. - Come on! Take it! - Stop it! I don't want it!
Hartley Rathaway is the prodigal son. And he's back. Hartley Rathaway possesses one of the best scientific minds I have ever encountered. Connections to Rathaway Industries? His grandfather founded the company, his father expanded it, and Hartley was to inherit the throne.
Where do you shift your erotic charge? - Get out of the way. - Where is your sexual frustration? - Shut up. - Where do you put it?
- Where is your sexual frustration? - Shut up. - Where do you put it? - You made me impotent. - Where do you put it?
I love you very much. I love you. I consider this land the heart of England. Yes. When I see it, I regret more than at any other time not having a child.
I torment myself and those around me. I would... I would crawl over broken glass.... As long as I could avoid failure. In anything. I inherited this disease from my father. I'm afraid he's passing it on to my son.
But at first I was blind.... Lost in the world. These gifts are rooted deep within us. Now I can go anywhere to find our people. Well, what was the benefit of finding me? Even if I had a benefit, I don't know it.
People would hit the cyst with a pounding book, such as a Bible or a manual. What the hell? ! Hey. - So how do you think he's going to take it?
A celebration, if you will. Your resistance to Powers' registration landed yourself in the Well. - I was a political prisoner. - So will you register? Just because one is opposed to a law does not mean one can ignore it.
And now. Stark is public enemy number one. Well, we're not setting him up though. We have the evidence. Yes, but you don't know the whole story. Some people know it -- but they're keeping it to themselves.
The soldiers who entered my camp in Okinawa. The soldiers I killed. They had come to surrender. I realized this when it was too late. I buried ... the flag ... before anyone else saw it.
Good, great. A whiny baby during the movie? Don't listen to him, my dear. Dexter, don't leave the trash lying around! Don't! Someone else will pick it up.
I like it. - Because you have taste. - I love the music. But not that loud. What the hell good is it if you can't hear it?
Okay, Nurse Joy will take care of you. We'll get you out as soon as we can. - Hi, buddy. - I have a bandage. Do you want to put it on?
You are really cursed. But if it means I can finally get rid of you, then so be it. Goodbye, Mercenary. Time has stood still. The door to Olympus is not a door as we know it, it's a door in the speed of time.
Oscar. What's up Felix? I'm kind of busy-oh, hi Ashley. Oscar, I was just hearing about your new relationship. Oh, well, I wouldn't call it a relationship.
It applies only to the Russians-not to the peacekeepers. Without anything to eat, they will be forced to leave. What are your intentions? Do you want to shoot down the refueling planes? We hope they will not confront us with that choice. They will not respect it.
Well, if you had gone somewhere fancy, it wouldn't have been as impressive, would it? You have a flair for theatrical things. I can say the same about you, suddenly coming to my house. This is not your house, you are occupying an area you should not occupy. I don't think my people see it that way.
The man who hit me here and here ... stabbed me when the rifle jammed. I pulled out the dagger and slit his throat. I know, you told this dozens of times to the press. But I never said that after I slit his throat, I didn't stop. We tied his head to a donkey who brought it back to his village.
I've been waiting for it. YEAR 2017 Where is the cure? Give us the cure! Why are you hiding it?
Always stay connected to Mr. Cole's detector. Mr. Ramse. The core can no longer cope with our energy demands. Between that and the effect of dislocation on Mr. Cole's physiology,-we are losing the time chain. - What if we lose it?
I'm very sorry. Our relationship was -- complicated. He was very proud of you. He wrote me this letter. I thought you wanted it.
But look! He knows where everything is. So how are you doing with the application? Not very well. The university got back to me and they won't accept it because I missed the deadline.
No, listen, there is a way to find it. Just before we left -- they were developing a mobile containment system. They called it "The Great Flame"--an ultraviolet so powerful that it would burn up everything if the wrong virus got out. What do I need to know that for? The specialized equipment--if you find it. you will find the room of the night.
Thank you. Are you okay? It looks like I'm holding a big weight in you. Sometimes I'm not sure why I wear a mask with you. Well, maybe someday you'll take it off?
And that's the reason -- that's why I need you to read and ... record everything. And that's the reason I had stopped taking cases. Until this one here. Are you... treating yourself? With injections that keep it under control.
Did he pour the liquor? I -- I don't remember. I was a little worried. So Carson and Ren have a secret relationship. I wouldn't call it a relationship, but -- whatever it was, it wasn't that secret.
That's the thing, man. It's a craft beer. A lady beer, believe me. - Shouldn't it say "Schlitz" on it? - No, this is better than real beer. My dad brews it in the basement bathtub.
Are you talking about the jersey? I'm going to the Phillies game with Dad afterwards, so I shined it up as a joke to drive him crazy. I mean, I would never wear it to a game. Unless you think maybe I could put it on. You know, you shouldn't just put it on at the game. I would put it on at school.
THE JOHNSON FAMILY GIVEN THE WORLD: JAZZ SYNDICATES SMS BREAK DANCE For nothing. They took a failing grade. But the point is, there is a story to tell. The story of us. Of our family, of our culture. Over time, the details of the story may change, But the most important thing is. That we tell it.
You made me feel like I was the other woman instead of your wife. I thought we were going to be one family, not two separate ones. Oh, you mean her? She's this close to being deported. Yeah, I mean, the whole situation seems crazy, but we'll work it out.
So, if Wells is as fast as you are, what does he need a time machine for? Apparently he lost his speed when he killed my mother. Sometimes it comes back to him, but only briefly. He can't control it completely. So I was right about the wheelchair, he used it to recharge.
I dare not ask. It's all right. She's all right. I have to get her shirt, okay? Help me. I'll take it off, put it in the bag and give it back to you later, okay?
Because he's dead, and we think you killed him. What? That's crazy! She argued with Tino when he wouldn't return Mrs. Sanchez's gold watch. She hit him in the head with something. We don't have the weapon yet, but we will find it.
- At worst he is testing you. - Jesus Christ, but I have to go. Oh, the more I think about it, the more the idea appeals to me. This is the state of blue grass, and half of it isn't cultivated! The weed was very high. "The drug Christmas tree," the elders called it.
- Then I should read it. - You should. My copy is in the barn, in the old house. We set up a kind of theater there. Come with me, we'll go get it.
I don't know--but it's not so strange that programmers are kept in the dark. - That's how secret companies work. - So do terrorist cells. It was a bioinformatics company that created climate change models. We would write a few lines of code and then pass it on to someone else.
It's a little early for deathbed speeches. "Ramu Sood" you will shout, scattering my ashes. I will throw you in the garbage if you continue in this tone. And I'd root for you, Mr. Ian, but Kavitha wouldn't approve, she was very superstitious. Shut your mouth, or shall I shut it for you?
What are you doing out here? Hi, honey. So you made it after all. They're singing my song. It's my song. And they're singing it.
He never said why. He knows a lot, huh? Knowing them is my job. I know that Jack was denied compensation because he stole the ambulance. Then they recovered it.
- She never wears a T-shirt. She's hot. I was waiting for the metro L. And he said, "That's a nice jacket. You want to give it to me, don't you?"
I don't want it! I don't want any of it! You are a spoiled child! People are starving and you complain about wearing a damn wig! You're not the one who has to wear it all the time!
Yes or no, it's a simple question. I will not reveal my deepest feelings. In other words, in her eyes Hoess was not a criminal. I did not say that she ordered the march. I know that the head of the Security Police ordered it. I said that she initiated it.
No, that's not possible, because at the time of the march ... - I was in Berlin. - All right, all right. "No" is more than enough. Now look at page 62 of your statement. Please read it aloud.
Great, so he is leaving the country. Now we'll have even less time to connect him to the shooting. I know Milt is suspended, but the FBI has a really cool vector program. He called it "Six Degrees of Edgar Hoover." If there is a connection between the victim and the shooter, he will find it. Okay, I like that.
Is the FBI there? Put them through. Kyle. Ryan Hardy. I love your house, man. Too bad you'll never see it again.
Please, you have to listen to me. No. There's a girl with Lucrezia. Sophia. You must find the page and protect her from those who seek her.
It is called "The Dead Man's Hand." Just take one, okay? Memorize it and put it back in the deck. And your card is. Not here. You don't see it, do you?
We write about the new agriculture. You know, it's not Time or Newsweek. An interview with you might introduce me. Well, I'll -- I'll offer you a deal. How about I... I'll give you the interview -- if we do it over dinner.
They were out of tune and did not sing in harmony. One even picked his nose! No one was directing them. Why didn't you sing with them? Because I'm a baritone, since my voice has changed. Excuse me, Mrs. Turner? Mrs. Willens, wasn't that a lovely service? And the church was immaculate, really keeping it very clean.
They were very nice. Yeah, Mitch is a nice guy. Maybe I shouldn't stay here long. Can I give you a hand? No, I can manage.
Marcus. you know I really like Mr. Chris, and ... I just wish you would make a little effort to bond with him outside of school. By the way -- I've decided that Mr. Chris is not right for you. And that things need to go back to the way they were before. Mom, our relationship--it's like a soap bubble. If you touch it, you burst it.
Why? This ostentation, this tantrum. It's not anger, is it? It's fear. Fear? Of what? Of the fact that we were not wrong about his stash of dirty money and that in time we will find it.
That's what I've always liked about you. I appreciate that. You know, this -- this whole thing is a little weird for me, okay? I didn't think it would come to this. Yeah, but you handle it great.
Well, if nothing else with this one I was able to stop him. - Give me the gun. - No. It's mine. You can't go around with a loaded gun! I get that it's part of the character, but I'm keeping this one.
Yeah. Does the wig bother you? A little itchy. - I'll get used to it. - Why don't you take it off?
Posted. I took some ecstasy tonight. Can you believe it? It's really crazy. I have another pill if you want it.
Hey, Bee... I have to ask you... What if we don't find anything? We can't give up so quickly. I just wanted to say. It's not like Leo left the first envelope where he wanted you or someone else to find it.
How, well, he started coming here a month ago.... By himself. He always did the same thing... He would order a coke, hold it there for a while, then leave a big tip.
Say hello to my little friend. Did you get all the equipment from the set of "Star Trek"? Department of Computer Crimes and Security, united in a task force. - Finished the facial mapping? - Sending it to you now.
Please. Dad, please. Say something. Why did you put the flashlight back in my truck? The detective was looking for it; she wouldn't leave you alone.
No... No! Oh, yes. In all your time here you could have built worlds. You could have redefined life and the way we live it.
Do you think Brezhnev's death could have an impact on the Soviet war in Afghanistan? I am unable to predict the future. However, the whole Politburo is behind this terrible war. I saw it on the news. Here they call it a "missing person."
- You did a good job. - Thank you. Here's your credit card. Treat it with kid gloves, I scrambled it a little bit. Why don't you keep it?
Keep your credit card. Treat it with kid gloves, I scrambled it a little bit. Why don't you keep it? - Really? - Yes, I want you to keep it.
They don't know how to live each day in the light of the truth. I am not saying that these men have not received the Holy Spirit, but I am asking and challenging this: what happens after they have received the Spirit and how can our traditions instruct them so that they cannot turn away from the Spirit? If they have truly received the Spirit, then why do they forsake the truth and the law? They don't abandon it.
In previous episodes of Allegiance. Turn your son into a spy. An SVR agent said he was about to launch an operation that would bring America to its knees. They call it "Black Dagger."
My father... He has only ever been... A Markridge man. I love you, dad. I miss you. That's the reason we're all here today, isn't it? Not to praise... But to capitalize. Through continued improvements in bioengineering, through government contracts, through strategic partnerships and a renewed push in the pharmaceutical business, we will realize my father's vision for Markridge... And we will exceed it.
Can I help you? My name is Carrie Mathison, I am from the During Foundation. We funded the construction of your gymnasium. You have to come back one more time to see it. The men are using it.
We really need it. It will give the Powers a reason to fall in line. It's a bombshell, Christian. And she doesn't discriminate. It's as good as the people who set it off.
I don't think it's hideous just because it's my mom. What do you think of my orchid? Just beautiful things. It's a beautiful orchid. My psychiatrist makes me keep it so I learn to trust myself.
Oh, yeah? What did you think of me? Normo-cool. I like your face though, to be clear. I'm enjoying it.
- No, not that kind of team. Like Milo and Otis! All it takes is one pill, right? - Indeed! - So we go to the doctor, I get the medicine, but I don't take it.
I called you to tell you where we are, so if something goes wrong you can call the police. Or maybe you could call them now. Your mother doesn't want to send him to jail. Josh, your father brought a cricket bat. True, but I won't use it!
Thank you. It's Scottish. Oh, I see. We treat each other well here. I don't drink, I keep it for guests.
Jess asked me to empty Tom's room. She can't. Hey, do you still have Jess's house key? We should get it back. I don't know where Nat keeps it, but I'll take a look.
Now, they can't do that if... I offer them an alternative theory of crime. Okay, what's the theory? You slept with Jess once. Nobody talks about it... Then, six years later, Christy finds out about it.
Mother, why did you close the door? It might confuse you. Hide! I closed the door because I'm...looking for my robe, honey. Wait until I find it.
No, not really. Becky is getting married in her grandmother's dress. - Isn't that lovely? - No, she probably just wants to save money. I love it when they cut the cake, and they all smear it on each other's faces.
People go to the hospital every day and never come out. And they have been known to have... They have super infections and there are flesh-eating bacteria. Sir, you have flesh-eating worms in your leg now. Yeah, but it's good for the wound. It cleans it out.
- Don't blame it on me. - You gave the order. - There are three federal agents -- and at least 40 innocent hostages in that facility. Including the detainees, a hundred lives will be lost. I don't agree with this action, but I understand it.
You have a good resume. Have you... Printed it yourself? Yes, just press... "Ctrl P." My greatest weakness is that I often lose my purse. But my greatest strength is that I always find it again.
Damascus steel. Forged in ancient Persia, but the secrets of its creation have been lost for centuries. It is believed to have magical properties. - A Da Vinci who believes in magic? - Only those who do not understand it call it magic.
Oh, you didn't have to. I found them in the shed. I asked Ava if they were all there, but she wasn't in the mood for a word. Well, it's a long way from here to Lexington, so maybe I'll get her in the mood again. And what if Ava offers you the money that's missing in exchange for her freedom?
- What are you going to do about it? - You can't do that! How long have you known about this, mayor? I was informed 30 minutes before the broadcast. This is the first time I've heard about it.
Okay. Okay. On one condition. Don't bring your gun. If Chuck sees it, he'll shoot first and I won't get caught in the crossfire.
Did you cut off her finger and steal the ring? What do you think? What are you looking for? The combination to the safe. You'll never find it.
Anyway, I love the beard you're growing. - Oh, yeah? - Very sexy. Thanks, I just tried something new. But when you meet my parents you'd better cut it off, they'll hate it.
I love you. I'LL SEE YOU IN BOSTON TONIGHT! MINDY Women can't dance and aren't funny, I should be Dr. P's best man! Hi--I haven't received your confirmation for the wedding yet. Yeah, I can't make it, man.
- How are you doing? - Eric. - Lee. - Lee. - It's Lee. And you're going to take this rose now, and you're going to give it to the man - Who got you pregnant.
- I'll be right back. - Okay. Look at you, being selfless. To think you're the same punk kid who got a credit card made out in my name in eighth grade. Come on, I was just using it for emergencies.
He is talking about it to the wrong person. All I know is that the prosecutor likes the idea of having a reputable doctor on the stand. I'll see you in court tomorrow. I didn't call yesterday because my husband got the notice to appear -- after you're done. Yes, and if I fill out that extension you won't see it until after the hearing.
I came to see if you need help. You're a really good friend. And, yes, I do need help. I did the laundry and my laundry is on the bed. Can you fold it for me?
Stand there with an apple on your head. Come on, go, go, go! Take the twine, pass it underneath, stretch it tightly, and here -- here, you can tie a knot in it. The knot has to be tight, like this. Then, you take an arrow, you put it on the point of the string, you stretch it tight....
At one point in his diary, Kurt says he first tried heroin in 1987, when he lived with you. He never told me. He kept me in the dark, because I would talk him out of it. In fact, I used to make fun of some people in Seattle who used it, saying they were stupid. They told me he used it when we were dating, but in my presence he never used it.
- Do you like apples? I prefer ice cream. But yes. I like apples. Well, it's yours. From me. Are you going to eat it, or put it under your pillow?
She had a cut on her face, Manolis. I treated her. He must have hit her with the ring. She has a scar, if you look closely. She... She covers it very well.
I should have listened to you years ago. Good for you, man. During the Revolutionary War the Americans held you British, outside Red Hook, right here. There was a fortress that covered most of the Red Hook peninsula. They called it "Fort Defiance."
It helps me to concentrate. You know, given recent events -- I think it's okay if you take a break. A whole night, maybe. What do you mean? You wear the same shirt as yesterday and cover it with a cardigan from the travel bag.
You never know what you might find, in the landfill. Someone threw out - a Herman Miller chair, today. - No kidding! - Yes!!! - It's unbelievable. I took that chair and I'm going to refurbish it, and when I'm done, you're not allowed to use it.
But one certainty I do have. Ava is gone. And if I'm wrong, Arlo's house is all yours. And if you're right? Ah, I'll give it to you anyway. Who do you want to get it?
Since we are talking about corruption. What you saw on the street, it would be better for everyone if the Company didn't find out about the weapons. Well, lucky for you, unless there is a Mandate involved, I don't give a damn about you, the Company and your doomed resistance. So will you keep your mouth shut? If you fill it with enough beer for me.
- Do you know what you did? - I got you a few floors and some luck. The security doors are unlocked. - D'av... - I couldn't tell you what I had planned. The charge can't be detected, but if they reconnect it to me.... I will say I acted alone.
With beer? So do you have any idea where he is, or...? If I knew where he was, I'd be with him, wouldn't I? What? Walt's saddle is on the fence, whereas he usually puts it in the barn.
Or someone who recently got out of prison? - Something like that? - We have... We just broke up a motorcycle gang that killed a superintendent. Good. Have your lab send you the documentation right away, and we'll go through it.
Asking my parents for money. No, they think I am a successful artist. Art! Selling my art! It's brilliant, but no one understands it.
- The game is starting. - I think it's a good idea to let it go around. - I'll put it on pause. - Thank you. - And we can watch it later.
A time machine. Don't you want to ask why? I think I know. No, you don't. You think I would use it to go back to a few days ago....
Yes, Richard. But Mathis said she didn't have her purse when she got in the car. I think -- I know what happened. As Ana was leaving the opera house, she realized that they were going to kidnap her. So before she got into the limo, she threw her purse away outside the opera house, where I will find it and solve my case!
You make them sound like monsters, but they are actually good people. Well, they are! My parents are horrible people. - You're dramatizing. - Oh yes. That's what they say when they take your soul, rip it out of your chest and shove it in your mouth.
And you can't make me not cry. You are a bunch of bullies, and I apologize as I want to. And by the way, I'm not sorry at all! It's my giant hand, and I love it! We're not going to sell it!
Carol, I'm not nervous. It's just. What they're doing is unacceptable. They know we know it means they are having sex. And they keep putting that song on day after day after day. Well, if it's a problem, why don't you solve it?
The same cover for which Julianna Keaton lost her life. Wait, how is Keaton connected to this? She was the one who produced the drugs. - Right? - And she was distributing it. That's why we arrested her.
Now answer me: is this your color? Yes. Good. Your voice -- you will perceive it together with his....
But right now there is a greater power watching us-and He wants you to stop the evil that has darkened this city. How? Tell me who has the book. It is our only hope. Tell me and I will get your soul to God before the vile forces of Evil take it.
Yes? "In the meantime, we will expose our most secret--" "We shall meanwhile reveal our darkest purpose." - "Give me that map." - Don't tell me, don't... tell me, I know! I will ask you for it if I need it!
Kimmy Schmidt, Carla Tuesday, WDUR. I see you as the Paul McCartney of mole women. What do you think? - Is there a back exit? - Well, there used to be, but all the prisoners used it for escape, so we got rid of it.
- Copy. Ravit? Ravit? What are you doing here? Are you looking for the cure? I'll give it to you!
He caused a head-on collision with another car, injuring the couple in the front seat and somehow sparing the six-year-old in the back seat. All of which you know well-if your friend has read you the report. I don't need to read it. I know every ... painful detail. And as for Wynn's blood. Aconitine can only be found if you look for it.
Stuff that rocks, girl. You know what I mean? I put some cannonballs in there too, so the song will really explode! This lyric will make the song commercial. More people will listen to it and we'll grab them for the rest of the album.
Come on, I'll take you to the city. Remember when you tried to kill me? What? You pointed a gun at me. - I guess I was pointing it at your father.
You know, when Laramie becomes Union Pacific's new rail hub, the land purchased today will be worth... Ten times their price tomorrow. Mrs. Palmer. What a pleasant and unexpected surprise. I hope you are not attached to that shirt, my friend, because you will lose it soon.
Focus, New York. We have a property contract to complete. I found you near the hotel. You have an infection. We need to lower your temperature while you fight it.
It's not the worst job I've had. The schedule is okay. Is this -- a weight-loss spell? I guess it wouldn't hurt me if I just. Before I steal your soul and lock it forever in a bottle, what's your formula for turning things into gold?
The first exercise, after all the readings and stuff, is something called "OT TR 0," where you basically sit like this, with your eyes closed, three feet away from someone else who is doing the same, and, basically, you compare yourself to them. You know? E... In Scientology jargon, I exteriorize. They call it "exteriorization."
John Travolta was a young actor, in his very first film. He was a troubled young man and was looking for help. A fellow actress gave him some information about Scientology. She gave him a copy of Dianetics and he was hooked. He attended auditions and whatever part it was, he got it.
They put on the damn music. He said, "We're going to play on Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen." And the emphasis was on the verse, "Nothing really matters anymore." Your mindset now is this, it's where you live, it's who you are. He would put the music on, stop it, and everybody would grab a chair.
- Oh... personal appearance. Affairs of the heart. Entertainment. That sort of thing. I'll write one column a week, and I'll call it....
Doctor, I only came because Tracy asked me to come and see you. - Spencer, don't panic. - I'm not, I never do. - Is the MRI really necessary? - Just as a precaution. Besides, we won't know if the MRI is necessary until you do it.
I need that key! Key? What? You said it's a key, what does it open? Give it back to me and I'll find out. And when you give it back to me -- use this disposable phone.
He asked me questions that I myself am afraid to ask. Well, there is always a place for you here. Thank you. Don't stop right now. Where is my key, Tonkin? He promised to give it back to me.
So, you would have realized that I am no longer your little brother who is in a two-room apartment or behind a desk. Okay, that's nice. What about the chair? It ruins the style for me. Can you bring it down?
You know what? Go sit in his chair, and tell him you're not leaving until he gives you the list. I'll take care of it. I'm going to wait for the list to come, in my chair. I'm going to wait for the list to come, in my chair. This is my chair, and I will defend it to the death.
It does not mean that it is less true. Rizzoli. Isles. Do you want to borrow my jacket? If you wear it and do that, it makes you feel great, like you can do anything.
At the time, my mother was just a child. But she never forgot what happened in Salem. And she made sure that I could never forget it either. The Puritans believed that they were surrounded by magic. Even those who used it for good, like Kent's coven, had to hide their identity.
I have friends at the Halton police precinct looking for her. She was looking for Castor. I don't... I don't like that. Okay, I'll go through everything one more time -- criminal databases, military files, known connections. Listen, if there's a lead -- I'll find it.
Come in. Go ahead and take a look-oh, we have.... My mother's new line for men. They have a hint of mint. It's her original recipe, but maybe. - We'll change it to musk.
- He is regaining his strength. He works on his arguments to do it again. It's like he has a grip on him, I tell you. Let's blow up that Espheni devilry, - before he hurts anyone else. - For now, neither Ben nor anyone else can use it.
He is a parachutist. - Henry, don't forget the poem! - And how could I? - You must have told me ten times! - Henry. I'll never read it aloud anyway.
Go to bed. Tessa? Did you see Henry's letter? I could have sworn I left it on the nightstand. And now I'm putting it back--on the nightstand.
Glad to hear them say that. Well, since they have spoken publicly about our treatment I think it's safe to say that they are our patients, although I can't divulge the details. Okay, so in general -- what is the significance of their case? So ... let's take as an example a real monkey, ripped from its natural habitat, that's a good way to understand what happened to the Neelys. Because if you take that monkey ... and injure it as only we humans know how to injure, it will turn into something different. At that point our task is to pick up that shattered identity and try to put it back together again.
It's like putting my hand on his desk and then sticking a finger in my mouth without thinking, - which always happens... - What are you doing? Stop. I was trying to show her that there is diarrhea on her desk, - and I just put it in my mouth.
I got it. 4 of the same seed. What is a full house? The death penalty is undoubtedly popular. 32 out of 50 states practice it.
4 of the same seed. What is a full house? The death penalty is undoubtedly popular. 32 out of 50 states practice it. 62% of Americans want it.
Maybe he is taking a walk to clear his head. Maybe, but he never drinks this early. Rosalie, what's going on here? Your house has never been so messy. Teddy keeps it tidy, like Harry.
We need to find this guy. Whoever took the car apart left the tools behind. I think they will probably come back for more parts. You know what? Just leave it here as is. Duke, I want 24-hour surveillance on her.
- It's not here. - We just have to keep looking. The page was here two hours ago. It couldn't have wandered off on its own. Unless someone took it away.
You gave him the fake page made by Emma. What a smart kid. Where's the real one? Ah, good work. Mary Margaret and I will take this one.
Yes. Who are you? I'm a girl with a wonderful story. Well, I'm all ears. I'm sorry, but if you want to hear it, you'll have to get me out of here first.
That's great. How did you do it? I have my own means. What about the key? My mother doesn't let it out of her sight for a second.
And I would say it affects you, too. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to play your game. I know better than to trust you. I have a wife and a child. We need this house and we're going to keep it!
I can help you. I don't need your help. My life is great, thank you very much. I have a beautiful daughter and a husband who loves me. The last thing I want is for you to come into my life and screw it up again.
And now I need you to believe it too. You're right. Emma. Hope is a very powerful thing. And that's why I'm going to rip it out of you and your horrible son.
You cover your flank well, my lord, you are almost as fast as I am. A compliment I do not bestow lightly. We are alone, Ka. Dispense with the formalities. If I have to remind you again -- I will ask for your head. Vizier Ay will ask for it himself, if he knows about these excursions.
It is your vulnerability that gives you strength. Not enough. At the pyramids, you told me that you want to be remembered as a great Pharaoh. Greatness, must not only be seen in the eyes of your people, but also in the eyes of your enemies. From an enemy who will not see it.
Too late... the girls devoured him. Just like Milly in your book mauled that stuttering pool attendant. He wasn't stuttering-he was just nervous because his aunt-in-law wanted to try the "corkscrew technique." Where I come from, we call that technique the "corkscrew turn."
Yes, but it could be better. You know what you're doing, right? This is like my Super Bowl guacamole story all over again. I can't hear -- that story -- one more time. Well, you will hear it!
But I think it was really my mom's anger that kept her going. The energy, the creativity ... and the passion of those days was what kept her going. Andrew is remarkably cold and detached from the whole thing. When he wrote "Mississippi Goddam," I thought it was something new and I liked it, you know? They released it on a 45 and I knew it was going to influence a lot of people.
I knew we were lost. I always felt hunted. Regardless of what I was doing or how sad I felt. I felt that in the country I could not live my life. I knew I had to leave or I had to leave Andy or I had to do something. So I took off my wedding ring, put it on the table ... and left the country.
- Mike Walsh, nice to meet you. Yeah. Congratulations on the house. - It was a bargain. - I knew somebody was going to snap it up.
It's not a small thing. It doesn't feel like a full-time job. Look. Nobody knows what the future holds, but if you're optimistic, it means anything is possible. The last time I knew what I had to do with my life was the summer I bought the beach house.... I was fixing it up a little bit at a time.
What will happen if Ana's parents decide to keep the child? What happens? - I went back to see our grandparents. - Why? - She asked them to take the baby. - The moms want her.
There are people who have always been plundering your country's resources. Someone has to offer a better alternative. That someone could be you. Ruslan, there's a final move you don't see yet. But you do see it, don't you, Agent Burke?
But what Mr. Mahoney needs right now is to rest. Spencer? Spencer, slow down. There was blood--everywhere, okay? I threw the bag away, but what if someone finds it and takes it to the police?
It cannot be found. Of course it can. He has a weakness. If you look for the Doctor, first look for his friends. Will I get her back after school?
I will be able to send you some interesting fabrics from Tanzania. I know you have a weakness for fabrics. I'll make the school stand up. - I'll get them out of this mess, and.... - Then there'll be another great opportunity, and you'll take it.
I thought Sackett had taken all his devices to Valley Forge. But they didn't all fit on the wagon, including -- the way into New York Harbor. - My God, this is... - Yes. Davey Bushnell's underwater machine. - He calls it The Turtle.
Remind them of victory. And the sacrifices that victory entails. I can fight. Let me prove it to you. And I assure you that my glory will not destitute yours. In fact it will make it stronger.
I also fixed the fence. What? What did you do? It was broken. Yeah! Steve broke it with his face when he was three years old.
Kono once told me that a friend of yours works at Leonard's Bakery. Is that true? Zak. He's practically one of ohana. Why? They make a macadamia nut malasada that Kono loves. I'd like to give him a box, but the thing is, they only make it once a year.
Did you ask to see me, Father? I owe you a pound. An honorable man always pays his debts. One way or another. Please give it to the poor of the parish.
Yes... This is not... Absolutely possible. Oh, God. I can't make that decision. I won't. Let me make it, mom.
I saw the wicked -- condemned to eternal death. To damnation. I have seen my own fate. God is a compassionate judge. There is always redemption--for those who truly seek it.
The forecast says it will rain tonight. Why don't you take this? Let me at least protect you from the rain. A careless offer to make to a thief. Well, I know I'll have it back as soon as I see her again.
He resisted arrest, assaulted us. That's aggravated injury, sir. Okay. Ask IT to capture the best image. We will attack it all over the city.
No, you don't tell me anything at all. What's the matter with you? I just know that if another person puts the microphone in my face, I don't know what the fuck I'm going to say. But the ice sculpture is all carved up. - Don't you want it now?
Are we sure we have taken out all the food and crumbs? Why are you all looking at us? - We eat them all, the crumbs. - Yeah, we are the solution. Well, there is no ant on my desk. Because I disinfect it every day.
I'm just trying to figure out how it got to the registry. Have you been able to confer with each other in the meantime? Your Honor, the state believes that by letting it go, we would get the message across that an adult can slap a child. And the bat was on the ground. My God, it wasn't on the ground. He was swinging it in the air, it was dangerous.
There is one thing we say when someone dies. We say it to the patient's family.
Come on, we have to enjoy this car while we can. - Press the accelerator. - All right. I'll take it as far as the maximum age of those I could go. 40. And I'll take it up to the maximum age of my--. 80!
As you can see, the victim also suffered from severe scoliosis. This is something that is usually treated by a doctor. We also have external injuries. Yes, he seems to have been through a lot. And this is the worst part. Judging by the scar, it looks like he sewed it on himself.
Heaven was many things, but, without a doubt, it was the greatest family reunion ever. A holy awe invaded me, and I moved forward. I didn't know what lay ahead, but I felt that with each step, it became more and more wonderful. Then I heard the music. I can only describe it as a holy rustling of wings.
Well, of the first moments of consciousness, I remember two things. The first is that I was singing. - I don't sing. What a friend we have in Jesus. The second was Dick had gotten into the car with me, and his hand was gripping mine and holding it tight.
You wouldn't. What would you do? Third floor, south wing, last room on the right. Thank you. They started this war on a lie and they keep it on lies.
Would it be safer to storm the headquarters? - Security is relative. - The building is vulnerable. The Gestapo just moved in and it's not as protected as it soon will be. Now, the SS has confiscated Balik's weapons research and is taking it, by courier, to their physics team in Berlin.
How do you hack a password? You have to study it, you have to understand what's important. Right, so it's the same thing here. He wouldn't just pick a phrase at random. He would take it from a source that means something to him.
Do you think it is murder or an accident? Or neither? We should wait for the coroner's report. Shall we check his house? If we're lucky, one of these keys will open it.
We sang this song as if it was ours alone, and instead every city in America put their mouths on it. Even. Des Moines. Former Mayor Mole Man should have written this song! I didn't write it. I bought it from a man who was selling it to almost every city in America.
Yeah, but no one who can understand what is really going on, which is what we have to do if we want to be together. And go home! What? You don't like my houseboat? Well, I have a lot of good memories here, but it's not where we live. Besides, I thought you were selling it.
Also I thought you were selling it. I put it up for sale... I haven't had a chance to keep up with it. If you haven't noticed, I've been busy. Aren't you keeping it secret just in case we don't work?
Yes, it was actually funny. It rocked. Never lose that part of you. Especially in a marriage. - The flash drive? - We'll take it to DHS, see if they can identify any of the suspects.
I have also been hurt. So I understand you. I'm not going anywhere. I recognized the necklace right away. Lucy used to wear it all the time, and...
Yeah? And tell me, what are your ears on the street, Mimi? Don't bother your pretty little extensions with these worries, okay? No, what I'd really like to know is, why do you want to dismiss Lucious? He's lost his mind, and I need to get my company back before he destroys it, or destroys my family.
I kept everything. Do you know that my Facebook page still exists? They wrote beautiful things about me. Yeah. Every -- every once in a while I would look at it.
Are you afraid of the dark? You know what I used to do when I was afraid? I used to hum -- a little song in my head. You should try that. Pick a song--and then hum it in your head--until you fall asleep--okay?
It means we both put our experiences and our quirks into this union, and it's our duty to respect each other's quirks.... Among mine, there's my family. And mine? Well... How about the fact... That you keep losing your faith. And that I keep finding it around the house, and that I keep returning it to you without ever asking. Why do you keep taking it off?
Remember, detective... you came to me. It's official. Theo Galavan will be the mayor of Gotham. A crowd of people has gathered outside, enthusiasm is through the roof, and, shortly, we will be speaking with many of the supporters who have donated their time and efforts to support... What do you have against the front door? Nothing. It's the monkey that opens it -- what I can do without.
Have you had a fizzy drink? I'm not sure that's the worst thing in the world. It was the worst thing in the world. Worse than a fruity Riesling wine. No, I am not exaggerating. Anyway, I cleverly threw the crown in a basket--wait a minute--so you don't arouse suspicion and then retrieve it.
The Ministry of Time. Follow me. Be careful not to slip; the fall is impressive. Spanish officials from different eras work here with the mission of preventing history from changing. Our officials travel to the era in which a time alteration was produced. And they correct it.
She appears to be his mistress. Dolores de Villamejor, an aristocrat who lived in the Indies. - The Indies? That would be. - America. She has a room at her disposal throughout the year, whether she occupies it or not.
I'll be good, man. I'll be good. Because every time I feel tempted, I just look into my wife's eyes, and she sings to me. You know that old song, "Erie canal"? I don't know what's in that song, but every time I hear it, I don't have the urge to snort coke anymore.
Don't you understand? Everything was fine before we got involved. He was on the next flight to Africa. Well, better to end up in Africa than to end up bankrupt. Well, actually bankruptcy is nothing as serious as everyone paints it.
Maybe, you are wondering, "But where does this want to go?" Maybe, it cost me a little bit to say this, but I want to go to a place where everybody can become aware.... I could have stolen your greyhound, I could have, but I don't. Because you see. still, maybe, you haven't seen the light. When one 'consumes,' for example, that light is not seen:
Maybe, it cost me a little bit to say it, but I want to go to a place where everybody can get consciousness.... I could have stolen your greyhound, I could have, but I don't. Because you see. still, maybe, you haven't seen the light. When one 'consumes,' for example, that light does not see it: I see it and one day I will come up to you and say hello.
But more importantly, it is my introduction as the congressman's girlfriend. I had no idea I could be so happy. Okay, well, keep that feeling in mind -- and never let it go. Never. You're like a little greeting card, huh? We need to get that folder back before the congressman sees it.
And then -- I want to offer you a chance to show that you are still an effective team. I have a job for you. It's a Traugott research facility. According to our intelligence, they're about to make a big breakthrough. And you want us to steal it.
In previous episodes of Dark Matter It's a Traugott research facility. According to our intelligence, they're about to make a big breakthrough. And you want us to steal it.
Dad-why would you do that? This is really embarrassing. I started the Paleolithic diet, because I'm single again. And I wanted to lose a few pounds. But as a teacher, I can't spend my salary on meat. And that cell has chicken, hamburgers, ribs. Whole calves hanging on hooks. So I made sure nothing went to waste. I will give it back.
All right, I'm leaving. This is why I never leave Manhattan. Hey, do you need to get into the girls' apartment? I have a key. I have to find it in my big purse.
Alonso. What are you doing here? Did you think I was going to let you die? He's crazy. The door is so far away, we'll never make it.
I will start immediately. As long as I am not prevented from talking to people, including Dante, Mr. John Clarkson's butler. I want you to know that I did not decide not to let you talk to Dante. Accuse me if you want, but please understand that there must be no inkling that your story is influenced by black people in London. - That could be very damaging. - If I give you my story -- and I will give it to you complete, it will be in my terms, and my terms only.
Did we slaughter ourselves by crossing the ocean, to be eaten by some Africans? No one is forced to go. If Mr. Shackspear does not trust this offer, then he may as well stay here. But we need 1,000 people. The abolitionists who entrusted me with this mission will not fund it unless we can establish a substantial free Negro community in Sierra Leone.
Come on, Madrid is full of spies. Juan and Luis? They are safe. Leave at once for Montserrat. You must destroy that door before the Nazis find it.
Is there such a thing as a Frank Miller? He wrote Batman. But Jesus Christ. You see, that's why we live in a bubble now. Me, Tom and Jules. I have this nice happy family and I don't want them to screw it up for me.
Don't belittle yourself. It's phenomenal. It's called Cashmere Burka and it's all about Gwen's life. Well, I guess you already have other commitments. No, the opposite, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Well, you know, he's the commissioner now, so he might be busy. Hey, where's your medal? You should be wearing it. I'm not going to wear it. No, no, come on. My God, if I had a medal, I would never take it off.
They're kind of assholes, aren't they? - Yeah? - Absolutely. Okay, now enter the command sequence string. Okay, well, now, once you -- you've entered it.
Long Island City. It's not near his house. This spot is horchata. Specifically, Salvadoran horchata. Morro seeds betray it.
Then they sell it. Do they sell the debt? To whom? Why buy an outstanding receipt? Because you can get it at an exceptional discount.
Why so serious? We're just having a little fun. Let's get out of this mausoleum and find some appropriate women. You're too demanding. My friend doesn't know ripe fruit when he sees it.
I would like to rent a photocopier. Okay. For three months. Okay. - Maybe for 6 months. - Yeah, why not? If you want it for the whole time, for a year or for...
The Russians positioned a sniper on a main road in Kabul. But Amin's convoy was too fast and the sniper failed. They tried again. This time they poisoned a can of Pepsi intended for Amin in the presidential palace. But his nephew drank it instead-and died.
The cure. The cure for vampirism. I knew you were planning to go get it yourself-you had marked the whole route, kilometer by kilometer. Why are you giving it to me? Because my mother is surprisingly happy as a vampire and because I'm fully confident that we're going to get Caroline back to normal, the old-fashioned way--but mostly because I knew you wanted it for Elena.
The cure for vampirism. I knew you were planning to go get it yourself-you had marked out the whole route, kilometer by kilometer. Why are you giving it to me? Because my mother is surprisingly happy as a vampire, and because I'm fully confident that we're going to get Caroline back to normal, the old-fashioned way--but mostly because I knew you wanted her for Elena. What if I didn't want her for her now?
Could you hurry up and rock? I love your school! If my readings are correct, the realm of Asgard is joining ours. I have the same readings, Falcon. But I'm more concerned about who is using the space gem and where they are using it from.
A mystical creature that feeds on electricity. As to how these two got here, I have no idea. If we don't stop them, they will send Earth back to the Stone Age. There is no such thing as magic, Thor. I'm not buying it.
It's Mitch. I'm somewhere else right now. You see? He's not here at the moment. That walkie-talkie probably has a tape in it where you recorded Mitch's voice before and now you're just playing it back.
You know I'm not talking about that. Harvey took a risk with Daniel, and you were not on his side. Donna, I've been on Harvey's side since the first day I met him. For your information, when I found out what Daniel was doing. I made him guarantee that a promotion was on the line. - And you let him give it to the wrong man.
Two weeks ago, after you left the party with the twins, Scandinavian women arrived at the house.... This way, to the left. They were Danish, Swedish.... I was coming up behind them. Days later, I take them to Dad's boat, who lends it to me, because I work with him,
On page 15 you have a joke. The one about the giraffe? Screw you. I like it. If you don't want it, I'll take it.
Cut the crap. There are two ways to deal with it: the easy way or the hard way. The easy way. Will you give me the bottle or will I take it?
Thanks to the large-scale radio broadcast... we hope to have given a good portion of the public enough time ... to get to the port. Before you disembark, you will be given a booster shot to supplement the vaccine you already have in your system. Within an hour, the injection will make you full-fledged carriers...for the contagious cure. How long will it last? You will be contagious from five to eight days, and during that time, it is critical that you pass it on to as many people as you can. The latter will have five to eight days in turn to do the same--and so on.
Give me everything you have. This is the last one. There should be thousands here by now, boss. Jeffrey thinks it had a low turnout in Vicksburg. After today, the Americans who show up to greet the ship will want to sink it.
Tom. All the poorest shepherds ... all the country boys ... sleeping on a bale of hay ... even greasy-haired office workers manage to find love ... but I don't. Well, if you're looking for love, Sam, this is certainly not where you'll find it. Here at least I find comfort. Doc -- there's a bottle of whiskey under the bed, could you get it for me, please?
And it is now ... my duty ... to present to you this sword ... symbol of my last charge. I brought it with little pretension, in defense of my country. If danger returns, I will take it back. And I will answer the call with my blood -- and with my life. VERACUZ, MEXICO So if they want my head -- let them have it.
So instead of being the evil plastic bottle manufacturers, Nestle becomes the voice of environmentalism. "We just want you to have clean water, but there isn't any here," he says. "So we look for it, "we find it and bring it to your supermarket."
- No, thank you. - Did you read it? - No. - Does he have it on the iPad? - No. Then how come he doesn't want it?
- I wanted to... - He gave it to us-my father. I know, but... I remember you nursing Matthew there. What if I took it on weekends?
I'm sorry, did you say crush? Did they tell you what's going to happen in there? My wife tried, but I covered my ears with the pillow. It lasts five minutes. They put her breasts on a glass plate, position it, and then another plate rests on top.
- I didn't make a freaking difference. - Yes, you did. - And you did it with this car. - Oh, come on, what are you doing with it? I'm giving it back to you.
You're right. - So, shall we have a drink? - Yes! It's crazy. Whenever I recommend something to Annie, she ignores me, but then Kay recommends the exact same thing and she does it immediately.
She's doing well. Good, that's it, keep pushing. - How much longer? - It's going well. - Take a deep breath. - Doctor, the frequency has dropped from 160 to 120. Keep an eye on it.
Now this aspect of things is taken care of by me. - Do you have a problem with that? Have it your way. That's my camera. How about if I take the film out, expose it to the light -- and then give it back to you?
Come on. - He just bought it, the phone. - And I can check it -- under the terms of your probation. If you have any doubts... about the legality of this, I can call your probation officer ... and go over the details. Nice day, huh? Once you approach me with the envelope, I'll take it and leave.
All right. So did this Dwight Brisco guy say he took antidepressants here? He also said that Hector is still alive -- so I don't know how reliable he is. Well, you're taking this research pretty seriously. Of course I'm taking it seriously.
And don't miss the bus. Sorry, Kyle. Wait, what do we do about the car? Taylor, it's just a dent, we can get it fixed. When? I don't want mom and dad to see it.
So, in the mid-90s, I'm in Las Vegas. I'm high on meth and broke. And this -- this led me to do the stupidest thing in my life. I'm staying at this hotel and there's this huge jewelry show. Stands and counters with like, thousands and thousands of dollars worth of gold, silver and diamonds. And at the end of every day, they pack up all their stuff and take it to their rooms.
Intrigues. - What? - Yes, sinister intrigues! I bet the royal palace is crawling with them. So instead of trying to sabotage the mission--don't sabotage it!
Well, we'll find out -- when she's about to be found guilty and I offer her a deal. What happens now? What happens is we'll go there tomorrow and you'll plead not guilty. But I am. Donna, intentional fraud is a bullshit charge and she's just using it to scare you.
- He won't, so what difference does it make? The difference is that if you pull out, Wolf will pull out. From his point of view, I will never be out of it and he will never back out. You don't know that, and it's Donna's life. And I certainly don't entrust it to you.
It's all my fault. I always thought I would write a book that would allow people to see sports differently, like... "The Art of Winning" or "Seabiscuit: an American Legend" And instead I'm writing a book about a guy who has two talents... Catching baseballs and not catching chlamydia. I didn't mean to coo at you. I really thought I was being helpful. It's funny, you deny reality for so long that you can't see the sad truth about yourself until someone throws it in your face.
Let's turn then to the engine. Just like the McLaren and Porsche, the LaFerrari is a hybrid, it has a gasoline engine and an electric engine that transmit motion to the wheels, but unlike the other two, which can run on the electric motor alone, as on the Toyota Prius, Ferrari does not allow it, because, as they say, "We are not interested in electric cars." Instead, the combination of electric motor and batteries is similar to the Kinetic Energy Recovery System in F1 cars. Simply put, it recovers energy that is normally wasted, such as during braking, and stores it for when it is needed.
It's not noon yet, so I chose a sparkling Chablis. Come on. I don't think I should drink coffee. My stomach makes the same noise as a washing machine with one shoe in it. I told you not to eat sushi from that gas station! I thought I was playing it safe, the guy who runs it is Japanese!
And, I don't know, I felt like I was going crazy. The mood swings. I wanted it all to end. And the pill regulates all that and lets me concentrate -- on writing. But you've been back for months. - Why are you still taking it?
What? - Shit. Card. - Where are you going? - I forgot it in the morgue. - Ivan, I'll get it for you tomorrow.
- I hope it's a girl, I want a little sister. Well, let's not open it up like it's a gas bill. - Don't you want to know? - People are doing this new thing... The Gender Reveal Party. You send the sealed envelope to the bakery and they make the cake, pink or blue, and cover it with white frosting and when you cut it during the party... Everyone finds out the sex of the baby together.
It is actually Caroline who writes about her affair with Clay. It's all a lie. Here, Clay was with me on New Year's Eve, not with her. And here, he hates blackberry jam. He wouldn't eat it on anything.
Majesty... do you wish the body to be taken to St. Paul's? We will bury it in Peterborough. It will be less expensive. She sent me a letter. I don't want it.
They have to be perfectly aligned in order to channel the energy from that room, down the hallway to that room there. - Understand? - Yes. That's the plan. We take the thermal discharge from a direct solar jet and bounce it back to that door directly into the storm so that it warms the cold air and breaks the cycle.
Wait, how did you manage to... wait, what? - Did you ally yourself with him? - I had to find you and warn you that Ray is not just taking items from the Library. E'... It's the Library. I was sure I was going to say he's destroying it.
You don't pay the price, but you don't feel anything either. Your eternal life is a numbing hunt. This is why I hate you all so much. You have feelings and yet you just watch. You take mortality for granted, so you don't deserve it.
Oh, I think I'm getting sick. I've been polishing the sink all afternoon and I can't feel my fingers. Did you use that illegal Chinese cleaning powder again? It's not illegal in China. And it didn't kill the children who made it.
In the name of sportsmanship, you can go first. Your first mistake. Once I start... The cellist strikes! I did it, so I'm keeping it.
Michael. - Who is this now? - My lawyer. I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this country, every deer shot by a hunter is the property of that hunter no matter how far he goes or who intercepts him before he dies. It's called Brad's law. We can't stop her from performing surgery, but at this point, she's doing it on a deer fillet.
I used to listen to the birds. After dinner I would delete unnecessary files on my computer.... And then I would go to sleep. I would, uh, try not to dream. And every morning, as soon as I woke up, I would write a letter to my wife and son. And then I would put the letter in an envelope -- and put it in the library.
- Oh, it's not what you think, Terry. I just -- I just handle it. All right. All right. That's fair enough. So... Who do you handle it for?
Be careful with money. I'm doing as you said. I'm putting half of it in the bank in my mother's name. What about the other half? Where no one can find it.
Whatever happens... You are not responsible for it. - Geez! - Are you okay? What's going on? Could you sit on my suitcase while I close it?
- For her artwork. She was my first client. - The only client. - Yes, so far. Jasper taught her embalming, and she interpreted it in her own way.
They want to know everyone's business, always. The bomb I just dropped on them, there is no way not to get a reaction. - What will that reaction be like? - I don't know yet. We will know when we see it then.
But that won't be enough. Your problem is that you still choose people like him. That's the wrong reason. Beauty fades, it grows old. With you it's already happening. Your perfect face is boring me more and more, every second I look at it.
When you try to recover from a wearisome disease that destroys you and everything you love, then yes you can have a brownie. So what happens then? It's just. Okay, it's a little strange but -- when we were married, how, would you describe our... sexual relationship? How would I describe it to you or how would I describe it to my friends?
We had to continually instill in Bob the concept to transpire. "You were afraid of him. You feared what he might do, and you knew that if you didn't get hold of the gun, something would happen to you." That was the line of defense. We held the gun like this, he pushed it like this, after which we fell.
case alone to teach me a lesson, you don't need it, okay? How did you find me? I -- I passed my pencil over your notebook. And I decided to give it a try at the. St. Louis Suicide House. - So you knew her?
Yeah. - Yeah. Good deduction. It's a two-seat sports coupe, and they say, quote-unquote, that it's -- wait till I find the right phrase.... "clearly a Bentley." But, if you look at it side by side, I think you'll all agree that it's clearly
Call me when it makes more sense. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the whole time travel thing. There is still...one problem. If Mr. Garrick's claim is true, somewhere in Central City there is a break that we need to find and close once and for all. Yes, but how do we find it?
- Apparently it is based on his ex-wife. - Only the cake - she didn't run away overnight. - No. No. Look, I'm hungry and I want a cake, but it would be a sex crime to eat this thing. Okay, maybe I can cut it when no one is looking.
Meaning? Jeanette? - I lost my purse. - How? Some men followed me and took it.
A car was stolen the morning of their disappearance. Ten minutes from our house. Are you coming? - It's a sie-year-old car theft. Even if we find it, the chances of it leading to anything are slim.
What are you complaining about? You made it. I did? I told you it would work. If you can't defeat the machine, you destroy it.
- Nothing. We continue to enjoy this joyous circumstance and that's it. You ungrateful bastard. After all I've done for you, can't you put in a good word for me in that crappy club? Oh, believe me, Mom, if I could find a good word, I would put it in.
The battery is gone. Never mind. Oh, man, this song. We were listening to this song when we were driving the anti-mine vehicle in Iraq. They were playing it when we hit an IED and the floor blew up.
Do you intend to go out for a walk tonight? Yes, father. If you feel ... restless for any reason ... come home right away. Yes, father. The key was not ours, so of course Father turned it over to the police.
The transcript has not been completed. But for that you should not blame Mr. Higgins as much as yourself, Mr. Wood, and your employer, Mr. Bray. Is it a problem to put the transcript in the public domain? You will have your transcript. The question is, why do you want it?
And, as a result, exonerate your son. George is innocent-and I intend to prove it. Let's go back into the house. What does that mean? Why did they take my doll and return it so many years later?
This is the drawing based on Jesse's description. All we need now is a name. There are no marks on the weapon that killed Ken, the gun has been wiped clean, and the only prints on the shell casings are Ken's. Was Ken killed with his own gun? So, either Ken's killer disarmed him, or? - He knew where Ken kept it.
Don't you want to do it? I won't wear a tie anymore. quickly. We are inside the Company. - I won't wear it.
Quickly. We are inside the company. - I'm not going to wear it. - Wear it. - I will not wear it.
I'm going to make a call of my own. I'm calling your supervisor. Okay, but you still have to get out of your car, ma'am. I won't. I don't think you want to be in there when they pick you up.
Amen. We were... Michael would like to say a few words. My mother tells a story. Many of you probably already know it.
He is still working for me, for the next... Hours at least, right? Yes. Until five o'clock. So there's this invisible submarine, a super weapon.... Which is just sitting there, - and they're showing it to us?
Uncover her back. Tear her robe as well, if necessary, et hold her tightly. Please have mercy! This robe was given to me as a gift. Let me take it off gently, there is no need at all to ruin it!
Then you didn't encourage me to take risks, which is why I told Sue that I would do it differently. I mean, I didn't understand - that I was clipping your wings. - I'm not saying that! We have a table for six for the Heck party. I wouldn't really call it a party.
It was mom humor. To get through the day. I was joking again! Of course I have the axe. So are we going to chop it?
With the doors it imports from Peru. - I mean, like inside the doors? - No, no, that's too obvious. He takes the liquid cocaine sulfate--and sprays it on the doors, like a lacquer. Then finally, they take the cheese grater, scrape it off, soak it in acid, and turn it into cocaine hydrochloride.
It's not about Kai anymore! The people who would be freed are a million times stronger than him and us; not to mention how much fun they would have with Elena, who will be human again! My mother has the cure, Bonnie. What are you talking about? If I don't bring it to her, she will destroy it.
Bonnie's mom or Caroline. I've already tried to give her away. All right, so I'm sure there's a long list of vampires who would give anything -- to get a second chance. You're going to take the cure, Elena. Well, I don't want it, Damon.
All right, so I'm sure there's a long list of vampires who would give anything -- to get a second chance. You'll get the cure, Elena. Well, I don't want it, Damon. I don't want to live without you, either. You'll take the cure, Elena, - and I'll take it with you.
I left it in plain sight for you to find, since Damon would never offer it to you. Why were you keeping it hidden from me? I am hopelessly in love with you, and I don't want to lose you. I don't want to live without you either. You will take the cure, Elena, and I will take it with you.
Did you mean it when you said you would take the treatment? Or were you just afraid that -- would you lose me? Honestly, a little bit of both. Yeah. All right -- here's what I'm afraid of: I'm afraid that if you take it -- you'll lose something else you love, being a vampire. We won't be happy if you resent me,
In previous episodes of THE VAMPIRE DIARIES The cure for vampirism. You will take the cure, Elena, and I will take it with you.
Where on earth are you? Bonnie and Matt have disappeared and now you and Damon? What is wrong with you people? ! It's a wedding. This is supposed to be Jo's magical night and you are ruining it.
Lorenzo. She is our family. Do you think she will be safe here? If word gets out that there is a cure in her body, every vampire, who wants to be a human being, will come and break down that door. Bonnie will close it with a spell.
I refuse to give up. My reign will not end, without first fighting! - Does Mary's life mean nothing to you? - It can mean a great opportunity. Therefore, I would never put it in your hands.
I wondered that too, until I realized that every single attempt to destroy the Dome was from the outside. What if ... the only way to bring it down is by doing it from the inside? Wait until I find the page... Sam, with the right frequency and amplitude, it is possible for the Dome to shatter, like an opera singer, who can break a glass with his voice. - Let me find it...
* I can't deny it * * I often tell lies * * The world is all mine but I share it with you * * I'll stay on this star and ride it as fast as I can.
Carol! Carol! Oh, my God! Get your hand off my sister! Before I break it, get out!
Very well. How soon can you spread the new version of the cure to the whole world? As I said before ... as soon as we can dock in a densely populated area ... anyone who carries the contagious version will be able to spread the cure ... through close contact. A handshake...or a hug. If we each pass the cure on to two people, and they in turn pass it on to two other people...we will have started a chain reaction...that not even Ramsey will be able to stop.
They have gone beyond just texting between phones. This is an immense network. The submarine is running out of weapons and has already missed us twice. Now it relies on civilians for help. So we go into the network and shut it down.
The submarine is running out of weapons and has already missed us twice. Now it relies on civilians for help. So we enter the net and close it. No, commander. We take over the net and use it to spread our message.
- What, I was just sitting here and all of a sudden it fell down -- because of the wind. - Okay, no problem. I'll take care of it. - No, no, no, no. Tandy knocked the lamp down and Tandy picks it up.
So now you're going to give up fashion design and become what? A hero? I'm not going to give up my art. The truth is. That jerk I pierced with a pencil.... He was right. My work lacked identity because I didn't have it.
Good. So about the cake. If you could help me out, it's kind of heavy. Don't leave it lying around, Jim. I wouldn't want Katie to accidentally see it.
Judicial proceedings have been suspended, giving way to military courts. It is impossible for you to have a fair trial. - I have rights! - No, Rhonda, you don't have any rights at all. The prosecution will seek the death penalty for you. And the worst thing is that they will probably get it.
On October 28, 1929...the U.S. stock market collapses... losing billions of dollars, in a single day. It is the worst economic disaster the nation has ever seen. Nine thousand banks fail...and one in four Americans are out of work. But while people see the Great Depression as a time of despair.... Luciano sees it as a new opportunity.
- That leads to the fall of the car. If the bird flies away. Walter dies. Guys, the car starts to sway.... Lower and lower. Copy. We know the situation and we're working it out.
Scholars call it an "augural cup." You have to get this cup. It looks more like a chalice, really. It will be strictly guarded, but you absolutely have to get it, by all means possible. Because once you do. You'll have to fill her up... With your cum,
You need to get this cup. It looks more like a chalice, really. It's going to be strictly guarded, but you absolutely have to get it, by all means possible. Because once you do. You're going to have to fill her up... With your cum, And then you have to swallow it.
A Miracle. Jarden. What. The town is called Jarden. Miracle is the national park.... Which surrounds it and protects it from those who want to destroy its outstanding properties.
There are the mummified remains of the only priest who found this town 200 years ago. It's sacred, no one has ever touched it. Very clever, you hid it in a box that no one would ever touch. But then, where the hell is this box? During the Day of the Dead, it is carried in a procession. As part of the celebration, and then they take it to the cemetery.
Why, only Ukrainians drink i' Horilka? No one has been making those valves since World War II. This is a Soviet bunker. We have always loved our history. But I don't want you to repeat it.
Have they offered you tea yet? Apparently, you hired Juliana Crain. That's right, she says well. She is the sister of a well-known subversive. Thank you for the information-I will seriously evaluate her.
Thank you. The gun is the most valuable piece. A Colt .44 caliber from 1860. It was issued to the Union Army. The blue uniforms used it -- at the Second Battle of Bull Run.
I'm going to dance. Hey, hey, so what color is my new car? Why don't you talk to him? - Convince him to let you have your car back. - Or maybe. I find the guy and point a gun at him. Or a bow until he gives it back to me.
Very well, then. If the good doctor doesn't want to do it, I'll be more than happy to take his place. Ladies -- and gentlemen. If you will indulge me for a moment, I have a question to ask Miss Hale and... I put it in the presence of God and all the nobles of Salem.
There is a housewares store in the mall where Gretchen can buy a toothbrush and other things that adults have. - Can you help me shop? - Hell no. I'll look for literary inspiration. I'm not finding it here. So maybe I'll find it among the mass of diabetic American shoppers.
I'll buy it back, of course. No, for goodness sake! I deeply detest that lamp. Adam's great-aunt gave it to us when we got married. I tried for years to get rid of it, but Adam said we couldn't, in the event that she came to visit us and expected to see it. I will replace it with a different one then.
Before, I couldn't even think about it -- without feeling pissed off or depressed. My perspective has changed. You can still do the transplant. You can go back to your normal life. I don't want it.
# Until I smile # at you # I'll never laugh again... # Ruth Lowe was a Canadian woman whose husband was killed. He was killed right at the beginning of the war. She wrote that song and brought it to me personally, in New York.
In the immediate aftermath of the war, there was imprinted in the American psyche this enormous feeling of unease. CRITICAL TERRY TEACHOUT'S VOICE What was going to happen now? Would we have been able to maintain that peace achieved in 1945? Or would the roof have collapsed on our heads again, but even harder? Anxiety is easily traced in the abstract expression of painting; it is also found in Bebop, A type of Jazz with a particularly intense style. But American commercial music has responded to this anxiety with the musical equivalent of junk food.
I really don't think she lets people go. - The control she has over the neighborhood... - Listen... I'm not a saint, all right? But to hurt Triva? I want to have my community uplifted.... Either with someone like Marco coming out, or with someone like Triva growing it from within.
He had to marry the girl he met while selling booze jellies in tight shorts at the Husky Hole. Don't make this one of "your things," okay? Are we done? Because I want to go back and watch the babysitter show. I bet when no one sees her, she yells and scolds those poor little girls.
Capri? I think Catalina is more in our budget. I like Catalina. Me too, as long as you're there. Are you sure we can afford it?
Something I assume he has done before. Are you saying he put the sweatshirt there? Of course he did. That's what he always does. He wanted me to find it.
We are on their blacklists. Our pictures are everywhere. I don't think my picture is on any.... - blacklist. - No. Not until this morning, Malik. Okay. If you can get a gun in there -- with Allah's help -- I will use it.
Hey, Josh, it's laundry day. A little hint... By hint I mean: take off that shirt, smelling your stink is torture! Sorry, Yolanda. I'm not taking it off.
It's mine. Locked up. Nothing and no one. I gave him that scarf. He left it there for us to find.
- Did you issue the report? - With photos of both of them. Report credit cards as well. We are also checking for credit card theft along the route. Okay, when you confirm the new license plate, we'll issue it.
It's closed. Nothing. No body. I gave her that scarf. She left it for us to find.
The "Presentation Cup"... if this article is authentic... - it can be found here. - Wait, are you passionate about field hockey? I am passionate about the possibility of the cup being stolen, Watson. It travels under the constant supervision of its custodians, so the chances of it being stolen are extremely rare. If it is the real cup, I will return it to the National Hockey League -- in a hurry.
Deodorant? Bicarbonate? - Powdered drinks? - No. They injected themselves with a syringe, overjoyed to see me.
You do realize that baselessly accusing prison staff carries serious consequences, don't you? Is there anything else? The LSD in the system caused the psychosis, but she is calm now, so I think she is ready to leave the psychiatric unit. I appreciate her opinion. In other words, she ignores it.
Hathorne, take it from me, this goes far beyond our rivalry over Anne Hale. I'm not here -- as a man, but as a praetor, to do my duty. Then let me stay. As a praetor, you have a duty to protect this town. I will prove that the witches have spread the plague and will use it to condemn us to Hell.
- Why didn't you talk to the board? - Because I can't prove it. Ferguson made sure that Jodie Spiteri -- is not a reliable witness. So we have to wait for him to make the next move? If I found evidence and presented it to the council -- would you support me? Absolutely, yes.
You never brought any of the other guys. I do. Maybe I should. We have a gun in the house. I know I keep it in the safe, but -- it's not a bad thing -- teaching them to be careful with guns, especially if they're curious.
Do you want to know about Alice or not? You do. Then write about me, okay? Agree to tell my side of the story, or you get nothing. And if you give me your word, you better keep it, okay?
How do you know Scheibe? Do you play? No. No, somebody I knew-he played it a lot. Okay, you want the gun, Charlie? I'll give it to you.
- Yes. So what? Would you like to respond directly to Charlie Isaacs? I'd rather report to a guy who reports to a guy who sees his pretty face once a month. I mean, we basically invented it, implosion. The G group will test it.
Sorry. - Hi. - Hi. I was looking for, uh, Simon's schedule. I can't find it anywhere.
How can I help you? We asked security -- and I heard that most of the workers go in and out the front door, but is there also a private VIP entrance? Sid had it put in for the actors so they could have ... more privacy. Are there security cameras on the private entrance? They are actors, so they also use it to do other things, like.
Do as I do, I sleep on it. - Like a pig living in his slop. - In this case, Meegan's slop. Will the thing between Andre and Meegan replace the thing between Pete and Kevin? No, I see it as an addition to a beautiful house that I am building over time.
What does that mean? - Let's go. But your house... Your house is much more fragile. Your house is made by the people who fill it,
I smell rich people's items. Is it a bag full of gifts? Please tell me it is! - It might be. - Wait, I don't understand, what's going on? Every time I go to an event, they give me a bag full of cool stuff and I let Elliot and Yolanda share it.
Making gifts with less than $20. Does this Gucci bag cost less than $20? - No, ever you know what costs less? - What? A picture of you wearing it.
I set a ceiling on the amount due to other partners. - Are you bullshitting me? - I know, - you may be wondering why.... - It is crystal clear why. So you get the exact amount to cover Donna's salary and you take it from my salary.
If we record... What happened? We lost you. The bug went down the drain. If you want it, go get it.
Wheatley, get ready to hit the building. Aerial ladders on my mark. - It's going to kill the people in there. - They certainly have no oxygen left, and the hose is not enough to get them out. I turn off the water and send it to the ladder.
Tough audience. The signal is right in front of us. Fury said to keep us at a distance. He told us to find the power source. Until we find it, the mission is not over.
- On display, 200 bucks less. Okay, but, you know, it had to be the same as the one we had. It's a dishwasher. - It doesn't match the rest of the kitchen. - Do you want me to bring it back?
I can pack things for you. Leather bar stools, door knobs picked up in Big Sur. New message from Rando818. - What's up? - Nothing. You know what? Until we reach an agreement, 50 percent of that house is mine, and you're not putting it up for sale.
Good. Did you find an acceptable specimen? Yes, an alpha male with a job: just the opposite of our first earthling. I will earn his esteem and transport him to the mother ship. Have you ever wondered why we don't call it the mother ship?
Or sense of humor, basically. Worst roommate ever. Because of her condition, Kirsten lives in a state of perpetual deja vu. One day Kirsten met a woman named Maggie, who recruited her for a secret government program. We do something here called Stitching. We take a living consciousness and stick it into another person's brain.
- It's disgusting. Disgusting. - What is it? Callie we're going to the store tomorrow. Do you want anything special for your party? I wouldn't call it a party since it's just going to be us and the Quinns.
My sources? I want the header with my name. It's header or nothing. All right. If we use it, we'll give you the header.
You have to tell me whose car you stole. So did they abandon it here? They always do if it's a piece of crap. I got here early. Someone was abandoning it here.
- Keep the apology, I need your help. You're hiding something from us. You have been hurt and kidnapped. I don't know anything about it. Name a figure, whatever it is, I'll pay it.
That wasn't the question I was going to ask, but thank you for telling me. I was wondering if you had an extra key to Dodo's morphine cabinet. I wanted to show you how well I could clean it. Yes, of course. As second butler, I'm in charge of guarding that key. Can I borrow it?
Hey, look at that jacket. Do you dare me to steal it? No. Don't. But it's a nice jacket! And I want it.
But, here's ... I hope ... when you look at this T-shirt you'll remember that Nashville is a show and you'll remember the spectacular times we had together and you'll forget that little bit of time when it wasn't. It's an XXL and I'm pretty sure it's not your size, but it's 100 percent cotton. Thank you. I love it so much. I will keep it forever and I really look forward to using it as a cleaning rag.
Are you... Holding the bag in your hand? Yes. I'm going to take your bag okay? - No. - And I'm going to put it here on the floor so you can see it through the hole.
- Watch out, boy! - But you don't have to. Leave the sword... Where it is. It'll be hard to pull it out. Better leave it where it is.
But in this weather, God knows. Are you afraid, Agnes? Put your hands on the wheel. And look at the road. This road is dangerous, we must hurry before they close it.
- Tell me you don't hate this. - It will be over in a minute, don't worry. Did he break the transmitter? I don't know. But if he still has the bug on him, they'll find it.
She has been queen for a long time. Oh, yes. Whereas we are very much amazed at her rapid rise to the vice presidency. It was very quick, wasn't it? Quite a farce. - But I don't think anybody is buying it.
- You are the only noise I hear. Well, you can hear me -- so listen. I tell the rules. Do as I say, and you'll live like a pasha. Watch your face, Mr. Gecko, or Malvado will rip it off.
I was praying for Melas. So much blood has been shed. Will we ever get rid of Pasiphae? It will be difficult ... but not impossible. Pasiphae will only be defeated ... if you find the source of her power ... and destroy her.
Go ahead instead of dancing. They pop up from every corner. City of crazy people... It's an old matter. A matter of money. It's all lies. I don't believe it at all. If they wanted a solution Saudi Arabia would give it instantly.
This is nothing more than a routine job, but one for which you must put your best effort. Are you the kind of woman who to take care of another man leaves her own? What, go inside. This great consideration moves me, but I will reject it.
E... I turn around and all of a sudden two policemen came in and walked up to my table and said, "Come with us." We went to this room for questioning -- and this policeman puts a confession in front of me saying that I would kill a man. And-why would I sign something like that, do you think? And he says, "Now sign it."
The "lips," the Negroes, did it. When they weren't hiding in the cells, they were up here painting. Painting and painting. Pilar. every day she lights a candle for them. And every night I blow it out.
Most people bring flowers to their mother's funeral; I brought a lifetime of bad decisions. They applauded her before she even came in. We were on stage for 17 minutes and nothing. Maybe we'll have to revisit this narrator thing. No, we will make it.
They. They steal electronic stuff and resell it for cheap. They want me to go see something today, - they give me a big discount. - Yeah, sure. But they do meth. You know? When they smoke it they're really happy, you get good business.
Do you want me dead, Andy? Jesus. For the record. She's the reason I even offered you my French third base. Who calls her that?
Listen, first rule: no contact until we get disposable phones. Second rule. We sell that Gudea statue but I'm not selling the other stuff. You do that on your own. Where are you going to keep it?
That way, if the road, the trap road, appears on the map made by someone else, he immediately knows that his work has been stolen. Clever, isn't it? My goodness. A whole street in London picks up and disappears, and you think it's copyright infringement. So we're looking for a trap road? We are looking for a trap road, and we won't find it from here.
No one has ever returned from the Cloisters. Not really anyone. This way, I'm pretty sure. According to the stories, there is a secret exit. If you find it, the Cursors let you go.
But in our hearts... We know that we use the bartenders' excuse to decree.... Who is better, metaphorically... As a friend. Okay, guys. I was looking for blankets, and I found this ouija board. What do you say, should we use it?
And your opponents are? I mean, who is not a competitor? Wall Street, big oil companies, - small companies... - Small companies? It's a guy who siphons gasoline from different cars and sells it on the side of the road.
To the airplane! Could I have said that? Let's all go to the airplane, I guess. IBIZA, SPAIN What's the point of having a boat if you never get it out of the harbor?
We're all set. I am actually going to coach these fascinating gentlemen for the next three months. Three months? Yes, it's a promotion! - They don't offer it to everyone, you know?
All I know is that they help kill Nazis. Now give me the damn film. And get the hell out of my house. I won't give you the film ... not anymore. - I will hand it over to the proper people.
- Hi. Hi, Kevin. Hi, Will. I'm glad you were able to come. I'm really excited about your song. I think Atlanta is going to love it.
Bring me a double espresso. - Now! - Okay... It was beautiful ... the song. I used to sing it a lot in church, so....
Better now that you're here, since you knew Mom, you know? She would have liked the ceremony you arranged. Thank you. I still think it should have taken place in Natchez. Deacon wanted her here and I really wanted to avoid fighting with him about it, although it didn't help since he still won't talk to me.
So did you. You know -- whoever -- whoever set you up expected you to be caught. It wasn't part of their plan for you to go on the run. And if I was right, if there really was another bomb somewhere.... So you think if you free me you won't find it?
We will not just get you out of the neighborhood. We will get you out of the country. I can't leave the country. - There's still another bomb out there. - You will never find it like that.... While you're hiding. Thinking about where you'll sleep or if you'll eat.
- I know, don't say anything. - It makes me feel guilty if I don't go. - Guilt is a very strong currency - in your family. - Don't tell me. We pass it on to each other. Like our weak teeth and slow metabolisms.
If I want to go to London, I don't need your permission. I can go without you. And this way you are acting now makes the decision very clear. Creative license, it seems. It's a nice way of saying, "It doesn't matter if you steal someone's identity or experience and ruin it."
One of the earliest representations of human presence. What is the price tag? 600,000 pounds. It's a bargain, actually. Here in the West, we call it the Mona Lisa of the Sumerians.
48 hours. I have the mask, tell him to relax. Hey, excuse me. I was told I should talk to you. I'll get it to you in the afternoon.
Talika Desai, 23, heroin overdose. - Arsenic? - Not enough to kill her. Apparently, this is common among embalmers. Jasper taught her embalming, and she interpreted it in her own way.
I know how to administer the treatment. Mosquitoes. - Mosquitoes? - Mosquitoes, okay? We inject the cure to a certain population of mosquitoes and let them spread it to all the other animals.
Not all of us are. Not completely. I am. And I think you are too. But if you tell someone I told you, I'll find your base and blow it up.
We all have cars designed by Pininfarina. - He doesn't. - He doesn't? Would this one be designed by Pininfarina? Sure, because first the convertible version came out, and two years later Pininfarina turned it into this.
Thank you, Father. I'll come by this afternoon to mount Stardust. You should bring her here. Can you imagine Stardust sleeping in that old barn in the drafts? But we'll fix her up, and then we'll bring her here.
And maybe even some white ones? The "blush of the virgin." What did you say? Oh, that's the name of the rose. My father gave it to my mother for our first wedding anniversary.
- There is a new studio in town. - Yes. He offered to hold a spot for him on the surgery list. Do you both know the prognosis of the operation? Kelly and I see it the same way.
And here is the reason for your presence here, Nuke. Do. It's always good to have a backup source of nuclear power. Thanks for the power boost, Nuke. Now I'm going to show the Avengers what I'm going to use it for!
- I have to go, I have to go. The bathroom is the most -- the most overwrought, and overwrought thing. It drives me crazy. It smells awful. When I go to the bathroom, I go in, close the door and lock it.
I would say yes. It's really a shame. I'll tell you a joke. How about it? It depends on how funny I find it.
- I suppose there is a catch. - The catch is that it costs an awful lot. But I have a verbal agreement with the CEO of Range Tech. We started as mechanics, and if I can wrap it up in two weeks he will sell me the whole company at an affordable price. If I can't do it, he'll put it up for sale.
Now you're just being silly. Of course you know it! Silly Deep-Ando 6897. You must know the song. Everyone here knows it.
No, actually it's impossible. Will you tell me what you want? I was hoping to take one of your devices. Just for a few days. Then I return it.
Good luck. Online services. Hey, what are you doing? The boss said to secure the area, so I'm securing it.
That incredible fortune of his! Only now, it seems that... it was me, the lucky one. Did he tell anyone about last night's poker game? - Or where it was being held? - No. No one talked about the games. That was the rule and everyone respected it.
So, that little worm can read the questions right in front of you. - Well, first of all, you'd understand if he's seen them before. But, you know, there's more to it than that. My client has nothing more to say about her casual affair with Mr. Song. Other than the fact that it lasted less than a year and he was ending it that night.
Well, the first time it worked. It awakened the man behind the beast. But Rumpelstiltskin was afraid of a life without any power and... He chose power instead of love. He turned away from me, and at that moment...the darkness regained control over him forever. You know, a curse is no longer a curse if the victim wants it.
Where is it? Where is Excalibur? I'm afraid I lost it when we got here. Don't worry. If the sword is here, we will find it.
Are you out of your mind? You don't go to trial. You raise the pressure and then make a deal. Going to trial is raising the pressure. As soon as the opening arguments are over, they will triple the offer. Look, I've sat at the table with those two four times in the last six years and if they say it's their best offer, it really is and we will recommend it.
I'm looking forward to it. Oh, please. In my place, Adams would have acted the same way. It was not a random choice. The knife senses only the deepest suffering--it detects it, and channels it in the form of force. And you emerge from it invigorated -- as fate intended.
Revere at that point used the stirrup from which the Eye came...to extract it. Washington decreed that the Eye was too dangerous, and that it would be concealed, lest it fall into the wrong hands. Wait a minute. Was that bracket like a magnet for the Eye? - If we found it, we could use it.
Short for 'Gangster Chef'. Wow, those losers have nothing to do. This witch hunt is a serious problem. The witch hunt is not the problem. The problem is the society that encourages it.
What happens. The dog catches the car. - Excuse me? - The dog catches the car. Yeah, you're not giving me much to reason about. No, the dog spends all day chasing the car and never catches it.
- Why. - My job is to understand people. And you are not that hard to understand. Now, on that, we disagree. One thing we can agree on is that this fragile little scene between us has to.... Come to an end. So... How do we end it?
A little heads up, I was using your grid today to dry socks and underwear and nothing, long story. Long story short, you need a new grid. All right. What do you have? I'm trying to figure out what to do with this gun. Bow doesn't want it and I can't stop - feeling that I need it.
Okay, you can't change that. No more than you can't change the fact that you're a fool. You tried to shoot me with a box last night. - You scared me. - Okay. Now you give me this damn gun until you figure out security. And if you still want it, we'll keep it locked so nobody gets hurt.
That was oxygen. I added 71 protons to it. Terrifying. The fart that crapped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is looking for us. Whatever species comes into possession of this thing will use it to take over the galaxy.
When I return from the others through this place we will return for your purification. Um, purification? Carbon-based life is a danger to all higher forms.... To us, you are what you call a disease. Whenever we find you, we cure it.
Noodles, kangaroos? I really need to take a look at that. Well, you may as well. Contact the tourism ministry for details Next service, teenagers call it and it's not what you think.
That was not the cause of the confusion. The confusion was more about the joke not being funny. Why does everything have to be funny? Everything doesn't always have to be funny. Just the jokes. Well, everyone at work loves it.
There is one at the Nixon Museum in Yorba Linda. How on earth do you know that? In the third season of We're on Horseback, I was elected president and we filmed at the site. We could sneak into the museum tonight and shoot the scene, illegally. When Turtletaub sees it he will be thrilled and we will have the film we both want.
One day, I will surpass every warrior in the universe! I will be the best of them all! I thought I had reached the limit, but.... No matter how many times I see it, exploding something never bores me. But dinosaur meat... Did you really not want it anymore?
I will be the best of all! I thought I had come to the end of my rope. No matter how many times I see it, exploding something never bores me. But dinosaur meat... Did you really not want it anymore? I don't want it.
He is not Wells. - I'm Wells. - Whatever, Harry. But we don't even know if this is going to work. Until we try it, no.
It would be of great help to us. I heard there is a new film. Oh yeah? Who told you about that? There's a guy looking for it-an agent from New York.
Shit. Get me the fingerprints. I'm telling you, they won't be on the gun. A man like you, Petrovich, I'll bet you'll keep the items you deal with carefully. He keeps that gun clean -- he cleans it every time after he shoots it.
I will be arrested for sure. Peter, I understand you very well. Quagmire? - Do you also like pornography? - Yes, and I know that every man must protect his porn collection at all costs, until he is ashamed of it and abandons it in the alley behind the Kroger supermarket.
Laurel. Do you trust me? Do you trust me when I tell you that this will work? Oh, and there's one more thing. Whatever seals a soul, it will not let it go without a fight.
Magnetism. Magnetism. Magnets of opposite poles attract each other. Give me a hand, Garrick. If we change the dimensional frequency of this bomb-and run it through the rupture ...
Or I could jump out the window and let you get by on your own. First, give me that stone back. First tell me what's so special about it. It's some kind of soul trap. If Lily wants it, it's because there's someone inside that she cares about.
- I don't need a prescription. I know exactly where I can find the antidote. It won't take me long. If the Strix have been using poison for centuries, then Lucien has the cure. I guarantee it. He probably keeps it hidden next to his cure for werewolf bites.
I know exactly where I can find the antidote. It won't take me long. If the Strix have been using poison for centuries, then Lucien has the cure. I guarantee it. He probably keeps it hidden next to his cure for werewolf bites. I'm sure he won't mind if we go in and borrow it.
So before I leave, I'll put the remote control in your mouth. Here's a can of chili. And I'm going to put the can opener -- in your mouth. And here's a magazine I think you might like. I'll put it in your mouth.
They are lucky to be dumb. They don't have to worry about what to say. I know you are angry with me. How could I not be? You know how much I care about dance, and you thought I couldn't do it alone.
How do you kill an addict? With drugs. How do you kill someone suffering from depression? Where do you get them? Someone goes to the doctor, tells him a lie.... gets a prescription and then sells it to me.
Yes. You have to speak clearly. I will go to America. Will you destroy your research? I will destroy it.
Let me out! You need to be clearer. I'm going to America. Will you destroy your research? I will destroy it.
He can be anywhere in here. Shima is relegated to her chair 90 percent of the time. There will be limits on where he can hide it. The wheelchair. It makes sense that he hides her somewhere in the chair.
Don't worry about us, my lady! We will take refuge with the cattle in the hills. Abandon these lands and make yourselves safe! I will personally bury--any valuables! You don't just have to pull the net or you will tear it! - Find out what is holding it back.
Abby. Why don't we give ourselves another chance? sheshe wants to start a column on divorce. Barbara is our-your...your... Editor-in-chief. - If I...offended her in any way.... - Look. Let's pretend there's a door here. And I'm closing it.
All right. Thank God it's all right. Yes, everything is fine. Are we saying that a partially blocked artery is good? You choose to see my artery half blocked, while I see it half free.
- Feelings? A leader doesn't talk like that. Oprah says this to Steadman, do you think? Jerrod, where did the gun come from? My father gave it to me when I was 18 years old.
No, I'm your father, so I'll take the bed. Okay, dad, look, I understand that you really want the bed, but you can't just have it. - Did you just point the gun at me? - What? No, I was pulling it out of my pocket.
I wish I could believe you. You're looking for reasons to stay angry. I just want what we had. When Jolene was little... and it was just the three of us--happy, in our little bubble. Before I burst it.
Magic... Is an illusion ... composed of many steps. Sobriety is required for only 12 of them. First ... we must admit that our lives have become ... unmanageable. Is she crazy or do we like it? I was once so abstinent from alcohol ... that I stole from a store a can of hairspray--and drank it.
Thank goodness. And I'm going to do Howie Mandel. My God, it's almost worse than "Freak Show." You have to be there. I'll have Tal record me and she'll give a copy to the casting director, who will give it to Ryan Murphy.
Me too, I just have to put Kelly in the car seat. I'll take care of that. How long have you lived in this house? About six and a half years. Not that I thought I was going to be here forever ... but when I bought it, I had no idea I was a Grimm.
When Tracy arrived, Holden drugged her. He removed the murder weapon from the scene, took Tracy to a motel, and planted the weapon in her room. He is responsible for the angry messages on Tracy's phone. It is all a set-up to create a motive. This story may strike a jury, but not even Tracy's testimony will back it up.
I mean, you men always look down there, and you go, "Oh, there's my dick." Well, hopefully. But we girls would need a little mirror and be like Cirque du Soleil.... It's hard to find. The only time we see it is when we go to get waxed.
Well, hopefully. But we girls would need a mirror and do like Cirque du Soleil.... It's hard to find. The only time we see it is when we go to get waxed. They wax you, and then they show you, and ... there is no faster response in the world.
I know we were supposed to meet today to finish that interview, but it's Sunday. - We can wait until tomorrow, right? - Okay. Sure. Are you sure? Yes, I went crazy last night and now I'm paying for it.
In fifth grade, he broke his little finger playing ball with Dad.... - He whined for months. - Geez. - Your father must have thrown it hard at him. - Oh, no. The ball was on the ground. Kevin's little finger bent back when he was picking it up.
It is a simple question: is Mr. Crane lying or not? I am telling you that the answer is not so simple. Is the document authentic? Well, the paper is Dutch hemp and the degree of wear and tear puts it around the late 1700s.
I love you. - Would you like some coffee? - Yes, thank you! - So how is indoor life treating you? - Oh, I don't know if I would call it life, but it's great.
So you are a real shaman, huh? Just like you're a real doctor. Right. - This stuff is cool, right? We use it to have mystical experiences.
- Yes! You know it. I know it. And the men here guarding the monument know it too.... I can't hold it against them, they are working. But what I will ask of them is to remember the man whose legacy is carved on that glass. - Remember what he fought for.... And what he fought against. And remember how much he believed in all of us. If you don't believe in the monarchy ... If you don't support it... That's okay too.
It's your turn, Peter. Make good use of the excavator. You don't mind if I... I don't mind. You don't mind if I keep it a little longer?
But at the same time, this security is just -- a nice way of saying you're lazy. Do you want to go and check the door yourself? I'm just saying -- you can tell from here that it's not completely closed. I'll buy you a beer. Well... if you put it that way.
It is unlikely. The mass doesn't seem worrisome. - We see them all the time in pregnancies. - So let's remove it. We will remove it about six weeks after delivery.
Go for the headphones. Then the... curvature of his rib is very similar to the shape of his ear. So we're going to take three small pieces of cartilage, shape them and join them together to create this structure. And then ... comes the best part. We'll take the structure, and we'll cover it with the skin of his forearm here.
- Don't bring my sister into this! - No problem. As long as you vote to remove Jessica. - I can't do that. - Then, not only will I buy her, I'll tear her company apart.
- You don't know about. - Sh! No, I think that's it. But look, the new wand is nice. - Sort of. - It's, uh, I'll take it and have it cleaned for you.
Jared got mixed up with some guys who wanted to buy the list. So Booth infiltrated, to keep the wrong people from getting their grubby hands on it. Booth won't give up until he secures that list. No, he won't. Which means he'll either succeed and be a hero--or the poor guy will die trying.
I had access to the list. If I had wanted it, I wouldn't have needed Richard. I really think I did. Because if you had downloaded the list and then disappeared the full FBI would have come after you. That's why you kidnapped Richard's girlfriend and blackmailed him into downloading it for you.
- I think I need to move my head. - Don't. - I do. - Don't. - I move my head. - Negative. - I'm going to move it now.
Especially when you are a girl. Oh, thank you, but I still have to drink the first one. Would you like another one? When I worked at the Daily Planet Perry White grabbed a chair and threw it out the window.
Jimmy Olsen. Thank you for the photos at the humanitarian initiative. - You're welcome. - I knew you left the photograph. Ah, well, I'll take it back when needed.
You know, it was his world versus her world. He didn't stand a chance. Not against the math superstar. But had they had an affair? Is that what she would call it?
If we flood the chamber with the right amount of water, the submarine will change position, freeing the embedded hatch. Just 18 degrees should be enough to free the hatch from the bottom. The others have diving suits, they can leave and get to the surface This room we're in is an enclosed space. If we partially flood it, the water will compress the air above us.
My name is Brian Finch. I was a classic 28-year-old loser until I took a pill called NZT. That suddenly gave me access to every cell in my brain. When you take it, for 12 hours, you basically become the smartest man on earth.
Okay, Cuba quiz. Did you know that Ernest Hemingway wrote "The Old Man and the Sea" in Cuba? - Yes. - E... That he donated his Nobel Prize to a Cuban church? - Yes. - And that... In 1492, Christopher Columbus declared the island part of the Kingdom of Spain and named it...
Is he checking my trunk? He can't do that, man! Okay, shut up. All right, the car looks clean. I'll have forensics take it to the garage and give it a good inspection.
This hawk pops up and spills everything on the ground. The king warns the hawk not to do it again, but he does not follow the warning. So the king cuts off his head with a sword. The cup falls into the river. When the king retrieves it, he finds a poisonous snake lurking.
My name is Brian Finch. I was just another 28-year-old loser, at least until I took an NZT pill. Suddenly I had access to every single cell in my brain. Every time he took it, for 12 hours he became the smartest person in the world.

Father is looking for his ashes. Do we really have to explain something like that to her? - Did you have to? - Death is not something to be avoided, Booth. From an anthropological point of view, the more openly a culture accepts death, the less anxiously it will be experienced.
It is too inflated. - Let's leave it open. We will definitely come back to it, given the extent of the wounds. Let's put a temporary cover over the incision and use a mesh. - We will suture it when you are ready.
Tell him. As he runs on the natives, as he is about to strike, Hobbamock collapses to the ground. - No, he collapses. He takes an arrow in his hand, and thrusts it into the native's foot.
I had to do an autopsy in 10 minutes. Find evidence in five. You're not going to say the TMI skull helped you, are you? Dad, you have a stingy son. I don't need much-just a couple of weeks paid vacation, meaning I go on vacation and you pay for it.
Oh, hey, you know what? My friend Eddie lives on the edge of the desert. Give him a call. He's got a time machine. Yeah, he lets me use it on the weekends.
What does this have to do with Justin's murder? Everything. - The picture is related to an acquaintance of ours. - Who? Two years ago, a lawsuit was dismissed by the family - from whom the painting was stolen. - And guess who filed it?
Sean, Kim. - Hey. - What happened? Andrew has developed acute anemia. His red blood cells are at too low a level to cope with surgery. So do we reschedule her?
They said he was gone. That's when he realized something was wrong. This weekend we were supposed to celebrate our anniversary. He had been planning a vacation for months. Lance wouldn't miss it.
How many are there? It's a small group--too small for it to be a coincidence. Two acclaimed geneticists have disappeared in the last six months -- two award-winning civil engineers -- always a man and a woman. Someone is building an ark, Lizzy. And he is populating it with some of the most brilliant minds of our time.
You... You will go to another city as soon as this is over. Do you think that as soon as I seal this deal, I will move on to someone else? You're a selfish fuck. The orchestra is my family. I'm not going to let anything or anyone hurt it.
Well, I'm doing great. Today is the day I'll get the results What is it? It's a service for tracking ancestors. You spit in a vial, you send it to them, and then, two weeks later, they e-mail you your ethnic and ancestral composition.
Yes. I sent a drone. Circumstances had changed, so I changed my plan. All perfectly legal. And now you stage a covert operation on American soil in direct violation of an executive order prohibiting it.
And it happened last night. At Rinkorama, of all places, but I wanted you to hear it from me first. - You know, given the history. - It's water under the bridge now. I know, but if it gives you any trouble, I'll shut it down right now.
He was the one who alerted NSA that the informant might be part of Libertad. You and Graff thought it was me and that I had arrived to settle the matter. Yes, but then Graff realized it wasn't you. You were genuinely surprised to learn that Libertad wanted to leave Tor. Do you have the flash drive? He gave it to me just in case.
My house. I left after Ross, so I'm not a suspect, am I? Well, he could have passed his badge, waited, then left. But this is crazy! I wouldn't even kill a fly, if I see one at work, I just push it to the window and let it fly free.
Do you know what that expression means? "Why marry a woman if she is already having sex with you?" But it no longer has anything to do with today's relationships. Now it would be, "Why buy the cow?" Maybe because the cow asks you every day when you are going to buy it.
No way. No, this -- this is the room I most associate with my mother. Then how about the bathroom? I'd like to change my answer. All right. Then the dining room. I guess we didn't use it that frequently?
Obviously the plan didn't work. - All right, what did I miss? - Just. Your only granddaughter's second birthday. I apologize, Edie. But if the party had been better, there would have been more people there, and I wouldn't have missed it.
Well, almost. It wasn't in the papers, but it came with the papers. Another victory for Mr. Millstone. Good, but now what? Do we take the bug to the police? - Do we destroy it?
Don't try to look for me, please. Who is that guy? Where... Where is he located? Miami International Airport. This is a trail, and we're going to follow it.
Hey, be careful with the temperaments. As soon as it's midnight, I bet this Cinderella will be a prostitute again. You don't know how much pressure she's under. This party must be great. The kids are going to love it.
Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially from my father. I will never forget the first time I got a bad report card in school. The first time I got a bad report card, I took it home, gave it to my father, and he beat me up.
I will never forget the first time I got a bad report card in school. The first time I got a bad report card, I took it home, gave it to my father, and he beat me up. He swelled me up with a beating. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card at school, I took it home and gave it to my mother.
A Mickey Mantle baseball card, in excellent condition. Preserved between two small pieces of plastic. But I was a child. What did I know about it? One day I brought the baseball card to school and traded it with a classmate for a candy bar.
What? I've always said. Hey, look at the picture of my dad in a Hawaiian shirt. Axl. I think we should break up. It's not like he wears it all the time.
He wants to sleep in my bed. Honey, take it easy. We're in a new house, she's not used to it. - You have your own room now, honey. - Yeah. If you don't want it, I'll do the gym in it.
The story of the book! The story of the book! Please, Miss Rebecca, just one more time. The story of the book. But -- you must know it by heart by now.
- I'm not kidding, I'm going to get a job. - Carter. - What? Not everyone hates school. Taylor loves it.
I'm in the front and you're in the back. Don't be ridiculous! Why? Do you think they would notice eventually? Lizzie, life is so short. Why don't we enjoy it while we can?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Drax! Stop twirling that thing around, you idiot! I'm not doing that, Rocket. Ronan used this weapon to destroy my family. I will use it to destroy Thanos!
Okay. Follow the light. Let's do it. The waiting is killing me. I want you to take your hand and put it on the good eye.
Would you like to. I feel like Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense." Jay, would you mind moving the crafts table to the hemp rug? No. For a word you don't use, I'm hearing it a lot.
- It wasn't where I thought it was. - And where did you think it was? I don't know, on some island in the Caribbean or something. We're in Central America. - I know that now. - They say my suitcase -- it will come on the next flight and they'll have it delivered.
I know, I know. E'... There's nothing we can do except -- wait and pray, I guess. There should be something we can do about Molly's. Dawson doesn't have to come out of this thing and have to worry about that. I could call my cousin Anthony. He's in construction, if there's a loophole in the code, he'll find it.
Who is that guy? Where is he? Regarding the first question... I don't know. About the second one? Miami International Airport. - Well, they could be anywhere now. - In fact, they could be. But -- this is a lead. And we're going to follow it.
Stop everything. My brain is having an idea. I've got it! Ready. Listen to this. I'm going to invent a brand new thing, and I'm going to call it a parade -- of fashion!
We need to get the other flash drive back. How do we find the other buyer? The only distinguishing feature was the pin that he no longer wears now. Well, if we could get into the security system-we could go through the footage. And find out who was wearing the brooch before Rich took it back.
We have to hurry, this portal will collapse space around Earth within a minute, you have to transport it! Transport it? Transport it here. It will be the end now. There is a problem: someone has to stay behind to give the command. I am responsible for this mission and I will carry it to the end.
I'm good at party planning. - I didn't say anything. - Look at the pi√±ata. It's perfect. You can't tell we've been using it since Eddie was two years old.
Oh, Jesus. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You know we have a hierarchy for a specific reason. If residents ignore it there will be consequences for patients.
And even if it wasn't on the basketball court. Dave had his shining moments. When he accused Councilman Sanders of really being in deep shit, not a fly flew! Well. there were only six people there, so not a fly flew. I know you would have liked Dave to love basketball. Whatever his passion will be--you'll share it with him.
Oleg, it's time! See, the little monkey has an erection! I think that's a banana. It's yellow and he's holding it.
Sync: IrishMarti Subspedia Our subtitles for your shows Garfield... I like that air of disdain you have for other people. This is my new version of the cool walk that Eddie does. I call it a jazz walk. No.
Your mother and I have applied for custody of Ben. Is that okay with you? Yes. Sure, it's okay with me. How do you think Lori will take it?
You can't let another man take away your dignity. Because if it's another man who owns it, at best, you're renting it out. And that rental rate. It's astronomical, man. And what do I have to do? You take it back.
When I was at the academy, they were developing a new cruiser with a gravity projector powerful enough to pull a ship out of hyperspace. They seem to have finished it. It is possible that they are still testing the system. According to Imperial procedures the test area for these ships should not be very large. You will probably find it near where we lost Commander Sato.
- And he pulled me out of that situation. - I will never forget that call. - "Please come and get me." - I don't know why I called him. You were dissolving cocaine in that fucking cider - and you were injecting it, at that moment.
Actually, Alfie, you are wrong. Ballistics proved that that was the gun that killed the professor. And the O.D.--that would be "the time of death"--corresponds exactly to the time you accidentally picked up the gun. I like how you use the range like it's a library. It's nice--you take the murder weapon, and you return it the next day.
Great. It's been a pleasure. We'll see you on New Year's Eve. Just because we don't go to church doesn't mean we won't. A lot of channels broadcast the Christmas Eve Mass, so we'll stay home and watch it on TV.
No, no, no. They are in a box somewhere. A toy box from when you were little. I think it was something like Know-it-all.... Know-it-all. Oh my God, I haven't seen it in ages.
I love it. It's what I wanted. Look, I can sit on it. And I can put things on it or in it. I know exactly where I'm going to put it.
I don't know! Okay, Axl, just tell me what to do. Please, I'm begging you. I can't, Sue. You have to make up your special lie, so when you tell it, you'll believe it.
Thank you. Have a seat. So, how do you feel? Like I have a rock hanging over my head. And the rope holding it up ... Is about to snap.
I have a daughter who mocks her father's life. Aren't closets interesting? Since when? Do we want to talk about betrayal? How about someone who steals a song and sce takes it for sce himself?
But okay, I had lied about my grades. Crazy, right? Again like on a honeymoon. Okay, honey. Now we will write "Welcome" on the cake and take it to our new neighbors.
Buy that good beer. And make Frank's Special Sauce. The one with cream, cheese and chili in a can. And those great chips you get in the can! So then we use it for garbage!
Oh, you want people to come to your BB grazioni, to buy your antiques, to eat all your homemade mayonnaise? Then I suggest you shell out the money. Or you can try your luck yourself. Thank you for the offer, Neon Joe. We will consider it.
It's simple, as soon as... DEPUTY MARK GUNDRUM Camera Steven Avery has been charged with this murder, and a lot of things -- seem to clearly indicate that he did it, as much as you want to mentally give him the benefit of the doubt, doing so becomes impossible. This is Action 2 News at 5:00 p.m. The information you can count on. Steven Avery's arrest came at the same time that Governor Jim Doyle was expected to sign a justice reform bill inspired by Avery's wrongful conviction. The reform passed two weeks ago unanimously, and Governor Doyle told me today that he will sign it, despite the murder charge against Avery.
Heck, you don't search a place eighteen times looking for something unless.... The only reason to go back a second time is to believe you didn't find it the first time. Once searched, the place is normally returned to the owner. The key was unusable as evidence, as I understand it, because of the number of searches. Now, this is a key that she had been using for several years, and they took the key and meticulously analyzed it for DNA. Which, at first, seemed to make sense.
Now I am a little more worried about the blood than when I found out. At the time I was really happy, but ... I don't trust the FBI ... at all, and I think they're going to come up with some kind of test ... unreliable that will somehow prove that the blood in the test tube is different from the blood found at the crime scene. And that will be a little bit harder to disprove. I'm not worried about the key at all. I like the key and I'm glad they're using it.
- A digital camera? - Yes. He didn't give every person a camera that Saturday morning, did he? No. He only gave it to Pam Sturm because he knew she was going to the junkyard -- of the Averys.
It's a smart move on their part not to... DEAN STRANG Steven's defense attorney call Brendan for their main case. He is not a good witness. Which we predicted months ago. He's -- I mean, even... As soon as he starts ... incriminating himself and Steve, he fails to do so consistently. The story clearly changes every time he tells it.
He is not a good witness. Which we predicted months ago. He's -- I mean, even... As soon as he starts ... incriminating himself and Steve, he fails to do it consistently. The story clearly changes every time he tells it. So... they spread it -- during press conferences.
Which we predicted months ago. It's -- I mean, even... As soon as he starts ... incriminating himself and Steve, he fails to do it consistently. The story clearly changes every time he tells it. So... they spread it...during press conferences. The audience knows it.
Clear? And you need it to get into court and to pay the poll tax -- and to get your name published.... And to get yourself killed. - It's true. - We need a new plan! We can't go to Washington and show up at the White House with a list full of useless demands. Tactics, my friends! We want to fight this institution, and to do that we must use a strategy that can dismantle it.
Like when you give a sermon--and it comes to you out of the blue. You don't read it on a paper, you don't go from memory... you are prey to something high, something true.... It's God guiding you. I know that feeling. It is rare, but I know it.
Come. Come here. I like your necklace. My mother gave it as a parting gift to my father. And even though she is with the gods now, I want you to keep it.
There, that's better already. See? I didn't even know you were interested in abstract art. I am. But they make us do it.
Bills are paid, gas, electricity, water. Kitchen, dining room, fully stocked refrigerator, office.... This is your key. Thank you. The gym is close, you can almost see it.
No, I am an artist. I used to live on the Left Bank. Now I am settled in America and looking for a place to exhibit. I like my place the way it is. If your stuff is cool, put it in a museum.
This is your father's last wish, and you negotiate? He was not a perfect husband or father, but he was certainly better than others. - Mother. - No. Your father had a final request, and we will honor it.
That's River's End... that's the one. Look at Ryo. Holy crap, look at it. Look at that! That house, we're looking for it.
Unless you like old legends. Well, yeah, I might like them. Don't bullshit these kids, Lucky. According to one of those legends, that house is still standing. The story goes that the flood came down hard on the house, but didn't knock it down.
Why? What do you mean? I mean, tell your friend to put the fucking bat away! I think you're looking at a door that will never open again. Not with those roots, blocking it.
It makes you anxious. I could be halfway south before that thing blows up, or you could make me a good offer. I'll offer to disable it before it blows us all up, what do you say? Oh, we're far away. How about if I send it straight back to sender?
Here we are, now I have the feeling of dust and ashes. Do you want sugar, dear? The flu is spreading among the troops. I read about it in the paper. They call it Spanish fever.
the Kragle! [SUBSTITUTE] BUSINESS: As you see, they're loading the Kragle into a big machine, upstairs. I call it The Tentacle Armed with Kragle Oblong Spray.
What is it? Is it microscopic? I can't see anything. It's my hand. I want you to take it.
Is that why you sent two assassins to kill me? It was my mother. - Don't blame her. - She wanted you dead. Who do you think put your sword where you could find it?
They are jealous of our imagination. Of our incredible ability to create. Why do they spy on us? There is a prophecy among the Jinn. Very few know it.
- So congratulations, use it for Lear. - Why not go up there in the front, in the audience and see the real energy? I'm not going to waste it. I'll save it for the stage. I'm saving it for tonight.
What if we go to the gas station? We force it, get the stuff out and put it in the buckets. Shit, I don't know. The pump doesn't work like that. The gasoline is in a tank underground, under the concrete. Without the pump pulling it up, you can't get it.
Let me again tell you an old story and it will be seen how well you know it.
Excellent. That's a very good idea. I'll need the house key. You might want to give me a call. Maybe I'll take it home or leave it at the bar.
He flew away the moment he got free; there was nothing we could do. The Russians would not protect him. He's probably in Thailand or maybe Cambodia. Nick, you don't have to think about that right now, man. All the guys send you this postcard, I'll put it up here.
He sets his sights on an armored Liberian madiga. His eyes are bigger than his stomach. Better try again for a lighter lunch. Delicious. In the middle of the day, the sand is so hot most creatures can't stand it.
In the note you said, "Watch out for the Golden Fang." Why do I have to watch out for a boat? They are an Indo-Chinese heroin sign. A vertical structure. They grow it, they cut it, they import it, they run the distribution here in the U.S., and they take percentages on operations.
That was pain, that. Deep pain. Who is he, your new partner? You want a banana? Bend over, I'll stick it in you.
You would fight like a mortal. A little too risky, don't you think? I will tell you something that will freeze your blood. No matter what advantage we've accumulated over them nor how many have gone over to the dark side nothing can extinguish their ability to hope. They pass it on to each other like the flu in school.
We can't afford it. "We" who? After New York, the World Security Council agreed--to a technological leap in threat analysis. This time the results are outstanding. Keep a weapon pointed at Earth and call it protection.
In that case, I would like to say something. Let it be known, for the record, that Steve and Thomas Anderson saved Christmas all over the world. Which you will not be able to deny them, even if you can take away their freedom. Don't worry. Sometimes adults find it hard to accept the magic of Christmas, but when they see it with their own eyes, even the coldest heart melts.
Well, this is camera number 4 He's directly framing the marrow and Dekker comes in At 1:30 in the morning with flashlight and bag Well. This is where it gets weird. He walks past camera 3...looks at it.... and turns it off.
Why did he do that...? I don't know. Then he goes to room 1. Again, look... - And as you see he turns it off...
Apparently the press office botched the Hitchcock release. I said. It was a risk. You said you would check it out. (man)Guys, here's what we're going to do. I throw a ball in the middle of the pool, you dive in and catch it.
Shut up. I hate this song. Are you kidding? It's my favorite song. I know, I've just heard it too many times. Yes, you have. They send it all the time.
Whoa. All right. All right. Come on. I don't want your tongue in my mouth. Then where do you want it, man?
- I did. - No, but your -- hairy tongue yes, so.... - Should I shave it? - No, maybe just cut it straight off. And I'll mail it to you.
- What is it? - I think it's a heart attack in the brain. I've already had one. - So we steal the power? - The neighbors lend it to us.
Good hit. The missile missed your power source by a whisker. We call it "Spark." It contains our life force. And our memories. We call it "soul."
- Our former president. - And who is it? - Miss Wanyan Ying! - Miss Wanyan Ying! And now, a new song so new that Gershwin won't write it for the next 10 years.
This is not a game. We don't have to be in the same room, we don't have to sleep together, I'm not asking for that. If this becomes important, you decide that. I'll listen to the music, and then I'll know. And if I don't hear it.
It's true. You should see the Giant's harp. He plays beautifully without touching it. Of course it does. Why don't you go to the kingdom, bring it back and show it to me?
He just wants to go home. Okay, that's not going to happen. It's too precious. - This is crazy, this is crazy. - So. we're going to follow this map, and you're going to help us make it operational, and it's going to take us right to the ship, and we're going to neutralize it forever.
That is your opinion. But you could be wrong. Evidently, Casey had managed to solve the dilemma. He sent us his research just before he was killed. As soon as it's fixed, we'll send it to you.
Let's do it together! New tradition, guys, okay? When this team starts winning, we'll go back to the old one. Here we are at last with the choice. It is currently being wielded by an attendant with a walkie-talkie who is taking it to the Commissioner's podium.
Then the batteries are not doing well, recharging only 70%. Um. Zin. Zane says. - Zaytsev. Zaytsev says the diesel engine is good, but there's a leak he can't find, leaking on the turbine housing.... He would find it and fix it.
It's in the city of San Angel. - Are you sure? - I swear it! I swear it! A handsome hero wears it to protect the city!
Dear friends, we are gathered here ... Neither did my dear Agatha succeed. She and our baby would be killed two years later by the Prussian flu. A nothing disease. Today we cure it in a week, but in those days it claimed millions of victims.
There is spring break. What a nice tingle. I have room for a baby. A grenade. Why are you putting it there?
And you will come back. And I'll hold the door open for you. Jessabelle, you will get what you deserve! The unwanted presence in the house. When you see her, she's corrupt, right?
Damn jodine pills. Do you have any water? I'd give you some of mine, but it's not ready. It takes about half an hour with a iodine pill. But you have to filter it first.
"I tried to tell you the truth, but you were too small to understand." "I tried to take you away..." "but they found me out, now they won't let me near you." "They sent me to the asylum." "So I leave this letter with my lawyer, Mr. Jerome." "They can't stop him from giving it to you when you grow up."
I want my car back. Yes, I understand that. You're not going to get it back. I want my car back. If you don't give it to me now, I'll get back in the ATV and stay on you until you do.
I said it goes 230. The top speed at NASCAR is 228. This is faster. 8 o'clock tomorrow morning at Shepperton. If you get close to 230 ...this car Ingram will buy it immediately.
I want to stay there in the now. I am already there in the now. Now. This knob controls the thrust of the ship and acts on an increasing scale of 50. Of course, we never push it that hard.
I mean, we are both two broken people. You lost your hand in combat, and I'm--I'm--I'm--I'm--I'm--I'm... Yeah- I'm not- I'm not-. I didn't lose my hand in combat. I injured it cleaning a laser refraction piston the first week of service.
I need you to infiltrate. Absolutely not. Five... Million... Of Spanish dollars. When I take the ship, you will earn.... When you take it?
- Uncle. - I'm glad you're here. But I would have liked to see you under better circumstances. Your circumstances are my circumstances now. It takes more than four rednecks to destroy -- my home. It has belonged to my family for three generations, and no matter what happens to me, we will never give it up.
You know, you two getting back together and all these good things. I'll gladly drink to those good things. That's so nice of you. - Do you need a hand? - No, no, I can manage.
Yes? I found you a little bowl. I hope it meets your needs. All right. Where would you like me to place it, sir?
It is too powerful. But if we don't, we will never understand what it is capable of. It's not our job. We are the keepers of the dust. We nurture the dust, care for it, measure it, package it, and distribute it.
To be so perfect -- in thirty seconds. Do you have to go? There's a fundraiser at the children's school. Please don't take this the wrong way, but suddenly it seems -- impossible for me that you have this life. I don't take it badly, in fact it seems impossible for me too.
GPS. He won't reveal the location, I don't know what that means. Oh, and he wants you to meet him with a strange list of little gifts. You have to have them before you pick him up. I'll text it to you.
Karos is not there. Some idiot stole it. He loaded up with stoned escorts. - Did they take the briefcase? - They can't find it.
If you don't want to say goodbye, don't, but I'm going to go anyway. Know that this is not easy for me either. Mom? You will have to leave that equipment with me. We will return it to you when you are ready to leave.
Enough to divorce me. When we were still together my father died, and Alex, at age five, became terrified of the dark and obsessed with death. So I made up a story about heaven that could comfort him. He didn't actually buy it.
Yes! We are going back to England. Because that land was really -- generous to us last time. But this time we will not go alone. Because King Horik and Jarl Borg... have agreed to join us. And maybe...we won't have to go back so quickly...but we'll stay in that land for a while...explore it...maybe even stay for the winter.
It's a process that takes time, Barbara. Not a list of things to do. Certainly, but if you had more specific suggestions. You know what's the interesting thing about her story? Her voice as she tells it.
Why didn't he return the gun? You know it's evidence. I-I don't... Nobody asked me. We'll take it now, thank you.
Wait, wait. There. What's that distortion? I don't know. He picks up the box and lifts it -- up -- up.
Have you decided what song you will sing for the last assignment Mr. Schue gave? Yes. "Defying Gravity." What? ! No, you can't sing that song. Kurt and I will sing it, but we'll split the parts so he can do the high note at the end.
- No, I think so. I clearly need to go back to Salsa Castle to see my wife with that guy so my mind can convince my body to be less stupid. Okay, let's give it a try. ESPN only broadcasts soccer during the day anyway. So I took the curtain from the bathroom window wrapped it around me like a sarong and went back to the table for tiramisu.
Give me the shirt. My grandmother's homemade stain remover will work. White vinegar and rock salt. But doesn't it smell? I'll put it in the washing machine.
Not if I show you first. Jenny Mills. I'd love to stay and chat, Chase, but we're leaving now. If for no other reason than you know I have the best aim of anybody here. When we're done with the lantern-you have my word, we'll give it back to you.
Hello. My name is Saeed Jobrani. I'm the CEO of ImmediBug. And we are here to... revolutionize... the way bugs are reported on various mobile platforms. Happin will revolutionize geolocated news aggregation as we know it.
It won't make any difference here. So it really is. What will happen to the singing room? Well, I'm going to hear from a real estate company. I'll probably turn it into two classrooms.
I definitely would have done that. - Oh, okay. - This algebra is shit. What the fuck is the point of math? When am I ever going to use it?
- I shouldn't have interfered. I'm not going to make the same mistake again, okay? I know you were just trying to help me. Let's just hope this edition is a success. My assistant is taking it to press right now.
Don't tell mom. Not right away, okay? Do you need my bike today? No. But thanks for lending it to me. I was glad to know you were using it.
And I started to think that if you looked at it long enough every day, that would keep you alive. - I guess it worked. - And then I had this thing with your chair. My chair at the precinct? I wouldn't let anybody touch it.
Good. What the hell are you doing, man? Looking for a gun. Nobody keeps a gun in the refrigerator. - That's where I would hide it.
Guys, my grandfather lost that house in the storm of '95. And then he died before he had a chance to rebuild it. I got hundreds of offers to sell the property. But I don't want another castle to block people's view of their ocean. It's not just about me. I can't let them take it. We will take it back for you, brother.
- Stop lying! Go away! I can't think if he stays here. He has a point, Annalise. - It's aspirin, everybody buys it.
It's about time, it's the only phone. You don't make the cut. Maybe we should leave Lassen alone. No, this Ignis stuff is the opportunity of a lifetime. And I will destroy it, because he has scarred me forever.
Memory banks, but ... much more. It is what keeps the Dalek ... pure. How would the Dalek be pure? Dalek mutants are born hating; that's what fuels the fire. It extinguishes even the tiniest trace of kindness -- or compassion. Imagine the worst thing in the universe and then leave it alone, because you are looking at it right now.
It's ruining the Harriet Tubman experience. - Am I ruining it? - Yes. I'm here to save her. You are ruining her by allowing off-topic snacks and spreading misinformation.
You know I consider you the most charming man in the world, but Pierson doesn't like to feel surrounded. I think it's better if I talk to her alone. Besides, you have a new job. McQuaid should see you in action. First outing since Mack's birth and we spend it apart, what a waste of a good babysitter.
I didn't remember it being so spacious. Well, maybe because you were much bulkier at the time. Thank you for coming with me to say goodbye. Gosh, I love this little house. I can't believe they're tearing it down.
I'm not ready, okay? We're not ready. Yes, we are. We are like this little house: solid, reliable and resistant to the wear and tear of time. We are here because it is being uprooted with all its roots.
You have the right to remain silent. You cannot prove anything. The jacket you are wearing, you stole it from a closet in a house where a girl was murdered. The original owner's DNA will be all over it, and now ballistics is analyzing your gun. And we'll compare it to the bullets you fired at Bug.
It's hard to live up to that. Because I certainly can't tell a better story than what we witnessed last night. I don't know what was more miraculous, whether ... the technological success ... that put our species in a new perspective ... or the fact that we were all doing the same thing at the same time. Sitting in this room, we can still feel the pleasure of that connection. Because, I realize it now, we longed for it.
I don't know what was more miraculous, whether ... the technological success ... that put our species in a new perspective ... or the fact that we were all doing the same thing at the same time. Sitting in this room, we can still feel the pleasure of that connection. Because, I realize it now, we longed for it. We really did. And, yes, we -- we will feel it again when they get home safely.
Hey. Why did you stop? Something is wrong. It was just fine with me. Where did this song come from? My mom used to sing it to me all the time.
How many fucking women would there be? You have to sign these documents. - What are they? - Loan papers for the house. I don't want it anymore.
- We have to get him out of here. - And how do we do that? So Andy steals the bag and then runs the hell out of here.... He didn't steal it! Okay, you're arguing and he borrows it....
How are they connected? We don't know. That's why we want to listen to his meeting. Galan, on his desk he keeps a model of a car. This is a bug and we would like you to put it there.
If we were to try to absorb these price increases, this would be Hankmed's last summer. Okay, so, Ray -- bile duct tests confirm that you have primary sclerosing cholangitis, or PSC. It's a disease that causes inflammation and blockage of the bile duct in and out of your liver. - Well, how did I get it? - We don't know exactly what causes it.
I think it is grounded in the series itself.... The scenes are very boldly acted - and very realistic on the rooftops. - Stop. The series could not be shot anywhere else. The charge of New York street life seeps into everything we do and you really feel it on the streets.
The crescent moon mark on your shoulder did not disappear after you became a hybrid. Go ahead. Talk to them. What the hell do you two want? Hold your tongue, or I'll rip it out of your mouth.
- The judge will certainly be against it. - Your Honor, I ask permission to approach the bench. No, it's... it's the game. The stenographer has a word for each day of the calendar. You get that word, and you have to enter it into the record without the judge knowing.
And there, if I understand correctly, is the entrance. Well, let's cut down on expenses, you kindly go back to Rome and explain to all those pussies that the game is over. Giammai! Understand? Giammai! Caesar has given me a mission, and I will carry it out. At the cost of making slaves die on the job!
Knock on wood. I took the liberty of ordering for both of us. Gosh, what is this goodness? Veal Parmigiana. Chef Vola takes a whole veal chop, cuts it lengthwise, breads it, fries it in olive oil, tops it with cheese and tomato sauce.
- What nonsense. - Damn, he's coming to blackmail me from New York and I won't let him. - Where do you stand on this? - On what purpose? With keeping this city in the grip of those who own it.
He's a good guy... He works hard, keeps his mouth shut. He's a bit of a simpleton, in my opinion. What should I do this time? Keep this town in the grip of those who own it.
What's the matter, you old whores? I'm going to punch you. You too, you squirrel-faced asshole. Watch your mouth. Why don't you pick the shit out of my ass, and eat it for dinner?
A car accident, it's a long story. Let's listen to it, it tells the whole story. Did you shoot this man? No. - Ballistics check your gun. - Hey, I want it back when you're done.
Produce and multiply, my little green friends. Here he is. My friend and prot√©g√© Danny, the rising star of our company. Take a good look at this pretty face. You will see it a lot.
Good for him, who has you to fight by his side. Your Philip seems to be enjoying himself. - Is that Amy Dyer? - What is she doing with that candy apple? She eats it.
It hasn't let me down yet. All right... Now what do you want? Before I'm too drunk to say yes. Fattah's interview. I need you to destroy it.
Okay, hello, everybody. What about the Liberty Bell? It's a strange thing to be patriotic about. It has that big rift on it. It's like we fight hard with England for our independence, and we get it, and the first thing we do is ruin something beautiful. Something beautiful.
I trust. It will be your downfall, not mine. I will call Keller back. You will destroy this operation. No, you will destroy it if you don't withdraw your informant.
No, there is something... E'... Is it my necklace? I didn't give you permission to put it on. Daz said my stuff was still in the shed. Yes, but you can't use it anyway.
- Hello, puppy. - Bye. I'll see you tomorrow. - I'm going to eat your leg. - You're not going to get it.
"Malum" means "evil," but it also means "apple." And I think the phrase should be read like this, "The apple opens." And, as a result, it triggers the death that follows. I think I saw that apple.... Or at least the box that contains it.
By the power vested in me by the state, I declare you a temporary agent of the LAPD. Congratulations. Okay, move over. Hold this. - Don't put it on!
I don't. I think you do. I think you know as well as I do-that there will never be as much peace in your heart as there is today. My heart has never known peace. Then maybe, just maybe, we will find it together.
Do you... You know this woman? It's Allison Ball. Funny case, she had molasses on the soles of her shoes when she was killed this morning. Well, molasses is used in cannabis cultivation, right? - Sure, a lot of growers use it.
Then I suppose we have to get a plane. Get up, get up, get up, get up. - That's it, I can't do it. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look, look. All that stuff in you, I want you to throw it all out.
If you want to tell me that I have to be careful, don't waste your breath. What about my gun? - It must have been taken from you. - I keep it with me all the time, I told you. Well, not at night--you don't wear it in bed, I'm sure.
Well, maybe it doesn't matter to you, but you are about to execute the wrong man. Well, this is news to me, but... Yes, of course it matters, if it's the truth. I've been working on this story since Jamal was ambushed. Not that anyone is going to read it, that's impossible.
You call it that, huh? I'm really sorry. Are you going to keep that star, then? Yes. The dome goes hard on those who wear it.
If we get stuck here without supplies things will go downhill fast. Well, there's still plenty of stuff at Sweetbriar. I don't know how safe it is, though. If it freezes as much as you think-we could lose everything if it freezes. I'm going to go find Barbie. We'll take the ambulance and fill it with supplies.
Yet, here she is. And that's the girl I knew. Your sister faked her own death, I don't know, maybe Melanie somehow? Rebecca, I saw her die. And I know death when I see it.
I can't have syrup on my fingers, but he can swim on his back in a toilet bowl! It's nice that they get some exercise. Although, now that I think about it. Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt. I'm sure he brought it along.
- Holy shit. It's like that then, huh? So they extract helium-3 from moon rocks-and use the raw ore as fuel. - That's right. They refine the raw ore into energy and transport it to the energy core, which converts it to wireless electricity and transmits it to the earth.
They brainwash you. No, don't clap, don't clap. I don't read, I don't read. I was saying. They brainwash you. You come to church, your mind is clear, and they fill it up like a cream bomb.
- Did you see anything or are you just standing there talking? Sir, we just got here, okay? We haven't seen your bicycle. Leave us your name and serial number and we'll look for it. I painted it orange to make it less desirable so no one would steal it.
But instead-you came to my office and raised the alarm. - I thought you should know. - And now I do. And now we're going to reorganize all our resources to find a solution. And when we drop the bomb -- and mind you, we're going to drop it. all those lives will be your responsibility, Charlie.
It really worked last time. You know what? Forget about it. It was a metaphor. Your house is really nice. I don't think of it as my house.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it. See, the power is back on. Why are you stealing the power? We're borrowing it until we get ours back.
When I saw Dekma. He could not know where the weapon was without your help. Matter of interest. I had to make sure he had the weapon. I will destroy it.
Yes. For love? John and I had just gotten married, and he wanted everything to be perfect for me. There was an unstable gate that would close on you, once he hit me and I was bruised for a couple of days. John found a round stone and ... worked it with another stone, like a mortar and pestle, until he made a hole in it.
Don't cremate me! Don't say. The dead remain conscious. The dead maintain awareness of everything that happens to them. So your mind is here, your soul, or whatever you want to call it, and it's in a new body, in a new world.
- The masseuse in question. - Sure. Okay... - Can I see the tongue? - Where do you want it?
What we need is an athlete who is not a complete asshole. Jake, what do you know about a certain secret book that athletes use to categorize their adventures? Do you know about the phone book? It's a silly tradition. Meaningless. Yeah, well, we need you to get it for us.
- Seriously, come with us. - No, no. No contact. - They said no contact. - No, you idiot. Gabby is throwing a surprise party for you and you're missing it.
It's none of your business. I need to know if I can do anything to earn the chance to come back. I'll do anything, man. Please! If I were in your place ... I would take that gun ... I'd put it in my mouth ... and I'd pull the trigger.
Investors are already warming up. The last thing I need is a war that brings the feds snooping into my relationships. Put an end to this rebellion. I hate to tell you this, Mr. Marks, but the war has already started. And you are losing it.
Actually, sir, I was thinking of heading west. - To Tijuana? - No, no, Baja Sur. - The southern peninsula is beautiful. - I know. I haven't been there long, but I remember loving it.
Yes ... they brought me an audio tape ... the old ones. Do the names Paul Briggs and Juan Badillo mean anything to you? Yeah, I thought so. You know, in this recording, it almost sounds like.... You know what? I'll play it for you.
In the desert. I want to show you something. Show me what? - I want to show you the truth, Charlie. - No, I don't want to know it anymore.
That stuff is mine. You are not the only one who needs protection, Noel. We need it, too. Okay? And I promise you, I'll keep it in a safer place than this.
Would you like to wait for him in his office? We actually wanted to talk to you. In private. Is this a target list? We call it the blacklist.
But if we don't get out of here, someone will die. - How do you know that? - I just know. We have to at least check if he's blocking the exit. Yes, he's blocking it.
So help me help you. Go ahead and do that. But don't stand out. Have you ever tried the ice cube diet? It should work if you're serious about it.
I had a kind of vision when I touched the stone. I saw Thanos destroying a planet with this thing. If it's that powerful, he won't stop until he gets it back. The stone is the only thing that stopped the robots. How do we use it if we can't touch it?
Oh, Lady Syl... Are you still working on those self-esteem issues by throwing yourself on... Stop! Does that word exist, in your vocabulary? It doesn't matter. If you want it... I mean, if you really want it, you can have it.
Yes, of course, all right. Just fine. Nice skirt. It must be really in fashion. A lot of girls are wearing it tonight.
Well, Meredith, we all have to share. Let's be like the three musketeers, not a three-way thing with the musketeers, like that graffiti behind the gym. I have the paychecks. I know where the television is. Ginny took it, but she's not using it.
It even overflows. You have your career, your friends--hey, look! It's your favorite pen! Thank you. I'll use it to write a note to remind me to go there to get the deposit back.
Lorelei said that if she had been born on Earth she would have...lived on the beach, and surfed all day. Maybe one day we will see a real one. We will never touch the earth, much less a beach. That's not true-we'll get there. We'll be old but ... we'll see it.
No, no-the grass was wet! Yes, Anton and Mr. Jaffe come here often. Anton rented a mailbox here about six months ago, number 552. And he shared it with Jaffe.
So what did they need the tape for? All I know is that they came twice a week to check it. - Together? - No, usually an hour apart. - They used it as an exchange point.
Dress. - Are you married? - Yes. You don't wear a wedding ring. Well, the... I take it off during work.
Right? Everyone is true to their own nature. An explosion goes "boom!" The force of energy expands. Right. So how do we reverse it?
You are a beautiful woman. But if you had lied, I would have had no choice. But ... now I know you were telling the truth. May I ask what convinced you? St. Ninian's source. They also call it the "source of truth."
Now I know why. Oh, were you always sitting there, thinking I hated it? Not always. Always. The song... Mother used to sing it to me, didn't she?
Just concerns for your daughter. Ashley, I am so sorry about the chrono. Divya had it under control, you didn't have to come. Yes you needed to, I don't care about the race, I just wanted to.... As long as I can remember ... the only thing I could always rely on was you and your voice. It didn't matter where I was, or what I was doing: when I heard it ... you were there with me, and I felt safe.
As far as I remember, the floor was quite comfortable, but... Well... If we have to keep this secret santa thing a secret, - better split up. - Good idea. How could you not tell me? Well... Maybe I didn't want you to take it personally.
Twenty thousand tons? Powerful enough to wipe entire cities off the face of the earth. Cities full of people... Of children. No, the military will detonate it in a place where it cannot harm anyone.
It looks like someone is returning to no man's land. We don't have much time, Admiral. Make a bold move, Locke. Send a team, destroy the warehouses, nab whoever's extracting that stuff. - And find out who they're selling it to.
We don't have much time, Admiral. Make a bold move, Locke. Send a team, destroy the warehouses, nab whoever's extracting that stuff. - And find out who they're selling it to. - We know who they're selling it to.
See that prefix? I know the place that uses this trick to cover the origin of their e-mails, come on! The way the e-mail sent to the governor's daughter was created, it has the imprint of this place. It's like a petri dish for hackers. One gets an improvement in the deception and passes it on to another.
I tried every way I could. I tried to hack Vlaxco's records, but all drug trials are kept secure and isolated. That means they are not uploaded to the web. We can't get them. If I had another cup handy, I would break it.
Walter, it's going to be... Walter! We see you from the security camera. I'm in a dirty room, Walter. Stay calm, go to the door on the east side, do you see it?
What? You wear this mask every single day.... What is it? A new kind of makeup? Sit down. I'll confiscate it for you!
And I understood. She was the activist, not you. Coming here was her idea. It was her dream. She couldn't have freedom, so she wanted it for you?
No. There's a thought that I should have my own wing by now. Has that been the case for you? - Recovery community? - Oh, yeah. They call it Chino.
Yes. Somewhere his people can keep an eye on them. What about the stuff? We didn't expect the drugs. We're storing it with the weapons for now.
Rachel, what are you doing here? I told you I needed time. And then you told me you needed to get that image out of your head. - That's why I need... That's not true. Because you'll never get it completely out of your head.
James hates cows. Maybe they wanted to get away from it all. Maybe there they could have ... been together and lived together. There, they could have been them and ... produce meat. Maybe it was worth it to him. - Do you think so? - Yes. You know, I have a theory about life, I call it "rapid adaptation."
Because the boy I loved -- he was taken away from me. And because I fucked Eli yesterday, and I've been going crazy ever since. Tina! Tina. You have to read your statement -- and then, if you confirm it, you have to sign it -- at the bottom.
And you ended up right in front of my house? You don't know anything about me. I'm just getting to know you. And I guess I'm a little disappointed now. Look, if you end it, give me a call if you like.
Okay, the place is 30 minutes from New York City. It's a top secret research facility of the NRO -- the National Reconnaissance Office. The most technological of the 16 government spy agencies. They developed this weapon. Who is carrying it?
The most technological of the 16 government spy agencies. They developed this weapon. Who carries it? A half-dozen soldiers staying at Fort Dix. They leave the facility at 7 a.m. -- and take it to a facility 45 minutes away.
- Obviously. If you steal the weapon, you know you will spend the rest of your life behind bars. - Of course you don't. - And if you do? Do you know what kind of person Burton will sell it to?
Yes. How the fuck is it that the gooks stole your heroin? Wrong. Technically-that was their heroin. They just took it back.
Yes. I could. I could do that, Becky. The Russian flu is real. It's some kind of crazy chemical weapon from the 1960s, and they're going to release it, did you know that?
Oh, that's great, you must feel really fabulous, Brody. Honey, we don't have time for voiceovers right now, okay? Four people from upstairs just disappeared. Richardson, Thompson, Martinez, Jackson. All good guys who left their stuff or, as I call it now, our stuff.
I mean, sexy but anxious. - Oh, thank you. In... How long before he gives me weed? Oh, no, it's not weed. We call it "medicine."
Thank you for sharing. Recent advances in CT and MRI technologies, have led to a new interest in these modalities, in the diagnosis of chronic and acute pulmonary embolism. In the past, our paramedics and combat medics, had to rely on marks on the physique and scars, to make decisions... My daughter's first riding lesson. I missed it on the way here, so my husband sent me the video.
- I can explain. - I'm sure you can. The problem is that your explanations are not always true. - Hank's cookbook. - No. Are you kidding? The proof is right here, we're looking at it.
Oz." Now, actually, I should go. - Someone's new car is here. - Oh. - But I'll be back before you wake up. - Okay. Where are they going to leave it?
It might be a little difficult. It's reduced to ashes. Well, then we have a problem. How so? The girl who was wearing it was killed.
That's how it starts. Then without realizing it-you get a family. It was hard for you to watch Tobias and his son. After my father, Hank, died, I felt ... imprisoned in a world that is not what I want for my son. I would like Carlos... to enjoy life, not just suffer through it.
Perfect. Talk to you later? Maybe we'll do something more. At this moment, a song comes to Zelda's mind. She doesn't call it that, but from now on it will be her "triumphant song."
- Yes, of course I do. What? My badge. Those ghouls on the party bus must have stolen it from me. If you have a license and credit card, just pay up and take it. Oh, great. Thank you.
But they will not strike for Agnes. They are afraid. But there will be neither Hankin nor Allingham between them and the urn. Allingham underestimates us and them. Train to Sheffield, Bill. Show them a better choice and they will make it.
How about it? - Yes! - Yes! Bill, I don't usually go that way. Plus, it overlooks the Allingham mansion. What's the point of a protest if no one sees it?
Not really. And the time when I should have asked has long passed. So a reviewer takes a text and contributes... To change its form and make it a narrative... - Coherent. - So, for example, a proofreader... Would take your sentence and turn it into something that I can understand.
I'm afraid his story will not have a happy ending. LONDON TODAY And is he taking any other medications? No. This therapy is absolutely experimental, Mr. Bourg. We are testing it on a limited segment of maniacs.
It says here that when it was built in 1875, the light was the strongest on the East Coast, and it is the only one of twelve lighthouses in the country still equipped with Fresnel lenses. Impressive. No, no. Fresnel lenses are incredible. Fresnel was a French physicist who etched grooves into circumcentric circles on a glass lens. And each groove works like a prism, reflecting light and concentrating it into a beam that can be seen from far away, using an even thinner piece of glass.
To keep him from being questioned-or he would end up exposing her. Blake would never have made it. He would have been arrested with the weapon-and the investigation would have gotten out of hand. Shit, if you're right, he's an evil genius. Yeah, and if Frank gives her that weapon ... he must be giving it to the terrorists he's trying to stop.
It shows the collusion. But not between Mike and me, but between him and Charles Forstman. - And you give it to me like this. - Sure. And you'll pass it on to Woodall, so we'll see what he thinks.
Take me home. Okay, geez! But I'm not going to look for parking in Silver Lake. I'm going to slow down to a crawl so you can dive and roll. You know what, you can take one last look at this face - because it's the last time you're going to see it.
"Well, if you take away our guns, then only criminals will have guns." Not true! When they banned guns in Australia it worked. When they did it in England it worked. The Bushmaster gun that the kid used at Sandy Hook cost $1,000 American dollars and you can buy it at Walmart, they ship it to your house, and it's done!
THE EROTIC LETTER. Oh, sorry. I was looking for Michael. You just missed him. Is his bag inside? I'd like to leave him something. Yes, yes, I'll get it for you.
Trouble, Walinski? Lighten up, man. It's boiling hot in here. I suggest you enjoy the fresh air. I'm enjoying it now.
What, you want me to give you...? No, no. No. It's my favorite. You're not going to put it on a dead guy.
Your father ... has an ulcer. Oh, what a relief! Yes, it's a relief, but you'll have to watch your diet. Well said. We'll take it seriously... White fish, chicken, no alcohol.
- We can't stop. She's not an Earthling, Finn. - We have a wire. - You've seen it. She won't make it back up.
Let's clear the corridors and check. You mean this gun? - It's not bad, senator. - So it's all good? The Post reported DuPeche's skit word for word, and now they're playing it all over again, but
- Are you ready to go to the station? - Yes. Louis, I need a favor, honey. I'm supposed to host the women's caucus dinner tomorrow night, but the living room is still damp from that broken pipe. - Do you mind if I do it here?
Roger that, ma'am. What's the problem? We are listening to the enemy. If you blow up the antenna, we won't be able to do that anymore. If we leave it there, we won't be able to contact any other Ark survivors.
Because I also have faith. In my daughter. Thank you. I'll send an armed escort with you. No. They will take it as a threat.
Cows? - Do you have milk? - Milk, butter, yogurt. Especially for you, penicillin. Amy makes it herself.
Did you happen to take the department's camera? Yes, I was going to take it home to get my head back. I think my hair is thinning. Cool, cool. Look, I accidentally left a tape in there and I'd like it back.
- Who doesn't care. - Do you work for Berlin? What do you want? Berlin sent me with an offer. If I were you, I would consider it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
We will face what we have to. Take Brody with you, find out something. What the hell are you waiting for? You bought us breakfast. We're taking it with us.
This is the key. Thank you. I understand your frustration, Mr. Page. But for a warrant for DNA testing of someone who was not even a suspect in a crime committed 11 years ago, I need a plausible reason. - And you don't provide it.
It wasn't exactly well-preserved evidence, but I was ready. - Okay, so what happens? - Get this. I get a call from the Jersey State Supreme Court office. Some judge wants to know what case the evidence belongs to and why I'm analyzing it here.
Excuse me, I... I didn't... I didn't mean to disturb you. My mother used to sing it to me when I was little. She sang it to me all my life. I hadn't heard it in a while and I ...
Mike, I'm sorry. I've been a fool. A colossal--stupid! It's not your fault. It's both of ours. We searched for happiness, and the universe clearly didn't want us to find it.
Thank you. Avery, did I tell you that Dr. Hunt and I are starting a special project with veterans? Did you? Yes. We're taking a portion of the funds for my research, and we're we allocate it to prosthetics for veterans. Free of charge. Painless.
You need to hear this one. Please, I can't help you if you don't give me an address. What is it? A 911 call came in a few minutes ago. - I'm tracking it down.
I won't put my wedding ring in the closet. I -- I can't let her keep anything. I'm sorry. No jewelry is allowed in the operating room. I'll give it to one of the guys. Adam will take it, I'll give it to him.
Suction, I can't see anything. - Come on, come on! - What happened? I'm losing her. There's a solution, we'll find it.
You are out by half a million. Then give us more. - I agree. - Reggie. Honey, we found the dream house and I love it.
Shutts Hill. - It's not a "West," is it? No, but this ridge is high. It proceeds in this direction. - There are houses that line it.
Well, yes. He's been dead probably at least a century now. What did you find? A mistake. The original Mary Kelly had a wound on her wrist in the shape of a semicircle. But one newspaper, the Manchester Herald, incorrectly described it as a star.
Cristela, don't use that word in front of children. I don't mean sex sex, I mean sex as the sex you belong to. Keep talking, go ahead. Cristela, don't say the word sex. There, now I'm saying it. Out!
Before the Earth swallowed me whole, my mother gave me the moon candle of Artemis. As in "Tremors." Kenzi's second favorite movie with Kevin Bacon. Demeter knew that Hades abhors light and that she could? - could light the way back. - And where does daddy keep her?
What's in it? I don't know. If I had opened the box and there was evidence, morally, I would have been obliged to share it with the prosecution. So I didn't open it. But I didn't destroy it either.
Thank you. If you see this child, please call me. Good morning. Good morning, if you see this child, please call me. Please give me a call.
Just give, uh, my information to Leonard. Tell him I stopped by. Thank you. Here's the test: I want you to hurry up the stairs to the roof, grab the rolled up pump, and bring it back down, fast, but safely.
Every time I start the engine, I donate something to the Earth. Not only is this eco-friendly, but you are Liev Schreiber! That's amazing! Just like... this scarf. But tell me, Liev Schreiber, why do you even wear it at home?
He just responded to a collective societal email... about the fracking lawsuit.... "Not my problem, bitches." Okay. I have a plan. What is this song -- and why is everyone sharing it with me?
Bitch, you think you're the only one with a bicycle chain? I'm buying an E. You don't think I want to go along with such foolishness? Sure. If you don't want me to rip your face off, and feed it to Behind-Pat.
USS Serano calls SanDominick. Answer. Do you have the money? We are close. My boss signed the request. The bank is processing it.
Actually, I should sit at the special table, with the other department heads. - Did you sleep in my classroom? - Like a poor vagrant? Gareth just needs a place to sleep. This is my room or, as I call it, the Fucking Lair.
We need evidence for that and we don't have it. He killed my dog. He attacked me. Isn't that enough evidence? There's nothing to link him to these two events. But if there is any evidence we will find it, Andrea.
- RTCC has been quick. - Well, they're good with computers. Spanish Harlem? It's Trinitarios territory. The abandoned school is their headquarters. They keep it well defended.
What do you think made the "special brownies" special? - Love? - For us, pot is not a drug. For us it's a medicine. And we only provide it to those who need it.
Maybe, yeah. You know, Bones, I was thinking about Christine. And the school. You know, there's a great public school near our house. The neighbor kids love it.
It didn't help much. Okay, you stay here. Be careful. We have to do some digging. If the placenta is buried in the Hugo yard, I'll find it myself.
- Believe me. She knows we are looking for her, so I doubt she will come home. Now, where are we on the Wagner imprint? Well, I talked to one of the partners at his firm. He uses it as a biometric password.
Dean! know that they would be able to go to any lengths - to save each other. - Say something. It was related to religion. She was connected to faith. She was deeply connected to Dean as an individual. I think that if you have to have faith ... one cannot have it only when miracles happen.
Yeah, so what? So you know what's wrapped in wax paper? The dynamite. She got in here to steal sticks of it. Ranches use dynamite to clear the land, what the hell did Whitney use it for?
It's been three years for me. Even the first few times I did it.... What can you do if you are always worried about it? If you don't break the cherry, it will only be more annoying! You can't keep it all your life!
26 satellites scanning the world for its map. - Good. - Multispectrum imaging, georadar, etc. Now we wait for the "ding" that alerts us to a match. If there is evidence of this city on Earth, the computer will find it.
It's a form of ostentation-when someone replicates the actions described in a story to bring them to life. We've seen this before with the poisoning of Halloween candy and more recently this year with the Slenderman case in Wisconsin. This is the case in which two girls stabbed their best friend believing that they were thus acting on behalf of a mystical being. This phenomenon is called "legend tripping." The unsub inserts himself into an already constituted story, then brings it to life in his own way recreating the circumstances described according to tradition.
Either you bring me from Berlin-or I bring Berlin to you. How exactly did you get this information? An informant, someone the bureau trusts. I don't believe you. If the Bureau had a lead, they would follow it.
I meant in this wheelchair. It's an old thief's trick. What is it? Knock-knock method. Perfect for multiple choice questions. You tap the number of the question you get stuck on with the pen--and whoever has the answer, you tap it with the pen in turn.
You are amazing. All my life you made sure the wheels on my bike were inflated. You carried me on your shoulders when I had to take out the trash. Every time Mom cries "I can't take it anymore," you pack my lunch for a few days. And the best thing is. When you find a pretty stone at the quarry, you always bring it home to me.
Listen, hey, listen, I understand. All right? You have a problem with me. You hinder my career, all right. But don't take it out on Molly's II.
He interrupted me before I could disapprove. Eliza, wait until you see what's here! - Oh my God, I can't wait. - I'm bursting, I'm failing. I can feel the promotion slipping through my fingers, I can feel it.
But this time, you might really get hurt. Everyone can see that. We are all worried about you. Here it is. Here's what? This feeling. I haven't had it since I left Fowlerton, since you left me.
Do you know how much blood is in the cock when it is hard? It all started to come out. - But I think I stopped it. - How, I opened your mayonnaise, dipped it in a couple of times -- mayonnaise has healing properties, the Indians used to use it.
I was told downstairs that the Queen was here, but I wasn't sure. Where is King Francis? He is looking for you in the east. But I saw a carriage outside.... I will use it to take you back to the castle, and I will send messengers to the king to reassure him.
HYDRA loyalists from the old Skull knitting circle have occupied a S.H.I.E.L.D. armory. They are threatening to blow it up unless we release it. I'm sending you the location. That base is just outside Seattle. If they blow it up, it will wipe out everything within a 50-mile radius, including them.
- How much longer are we going to have to... When you took off your suit, in what order did you remove the components? - I followed the protocol. The boots. Then I opened the suit and took it off.
- I'm not in. - And a spicy bean burger menu. Good drink? Okay, don't be like that. We paid for it, so I'll drink it.
We get closer and you get nervous. Everything we've done, it leads here. Our task? Find it before anyone else does. If this city exists on Earth, the computer will find it.
Since we don't know how many of those creatures are in there, We can group the containers into various groups and detonate them to eliminate them one wave at a time. How are you going to get the creatures close enough to Ridonium to hit them? Well, we're going to need a decoy. And where do we find it? We don't have to find it; we are the bait.
Read the history books about the founding members of the town. The guys who live in this house -- that's Damon and Stefan Salvatore. Why are you telling me this right now? Because...they are vampires, and wherever they go, death and pain follow them so... If you're looking for family, you're certainly not going to find it here.
Her pulse is back to normal, and her levels are stabilizing. She was very lucky that when she was electrocuted David was there to give her CPR. Did you save my life? I'd like to get her an MRI if she's up to it.
Joel? You can keep it. It's our children's home. It's your house. I want you to keep it.
I don't know. Okay. Look, a friend of mine has a cabin in the mountains, not far from Park City. Does your friend have a cabin? His parents. It's like a vacation home. They use it a few times a year.
- Yes. And that's a very good start. Hello. Thank you for the bottle of champagne. The bartender said you sent it.
Across town. I live with my boyfriend Gunnery Sergeant Mike Johnson and his son. Do they hang out at the house? Not really. Mike would check on it once a week.
look, sometimes in the movies, people think they want something, but then -- ooh! Like in the "Care Bears" movie Okay. I learned my damn lesson. Lewis has my shit, and I want it back.
He doesn't strike me as a Rolex guy. I'll take a chance and say that if I check the watch's serial number, it tells me it's registered in Jack Mikorski's name. I would listen to my partner. I don't like being up here. If he makes me take the gun, he knows I'll use it.
Really? Twelve hundred dollars a night for a room.... And they don't even say where the ice machine is. I can't help you with that. Could you at least open it for me? Like, the with your hands, because....
We didn't have any money. We made one song, "Chicken Fried," which we put on a CD in 2005. A band. The Lost Trailers, called and said, "We want to record Chicken Fried." I said, "It's no problem for me to record the song, but the song is ours and ... just don't throw it on the radio, if you want to have it on the record, that's fine with me."
There were the Gershwins, Irving Berlin. People who were writing songs to be famous. You know, they were buying sheet music. Sheet music was the first recordings.... When they created the music industry, they created it for a completely different reason.
Who knows about this? Hunt? Anyone? Fetal surgery is a new field. The few among us who practice it are the ones who are inventing it right now.
Electrocution is something I use sparingly. Usually on my back... Other times elsewhere. How can it become deadly? If the person administering it doesn't know what they're doing.
Wrap his butt with the scarf. Really? - Hey. - Hey. Here's your scarf. Sorry to return it so late.
I hop here and there. And I'm so cheerful. Then I crawl to the car. But I have my haul. How often do you need your fix? I'd like it more often than I take it.
- In the league they should be unlimited! No, I'll leave that question for another time. Now, I would love to know what animal would do such a thing. Ruxin, enough! Taco, how is it going with the new house? When do we get to see it?
For I was also the daughter of Jacob's four wives. And it was here--in the sacred place where women went to bleed on the full moon--that I came to know the secrets and wisdom and love of my mothers. Four half-sisters born of the same father--a stingy, cruel man named Laban, who cursed the gods for sending him only daughters. The oldest, my mother, Leah, was strong and experienced and wonderfully arrogant. My aunt, Rachel, was as deadly beautiful as she was unreal, and she used her like a sword.
Did you hear about the Troubles, Mr. Brody? Did you know that if your father died, you would inherit his popularity? Oh, Chris, we love you. That infection on your leg is very bad. So let's do a little biopsy and get it tested.
Etene would have cared Would you have let the spirit of your only daughter burn forever? Power the lantern -No -I suppose, after all these years,you don't care about her anymore. .../ i Hold your tongue, or I'll rip it out of your mouth!
Yes, it is always the same. I am the most fantastic king of all time, Maurice! SHUT UP OR BE EATEN And then I wake up and see you.... Maybe someday that dream will come true. But please, you should snatch the crown from my uncle's cold, dead hands. And even then he probably wouldn't give it to you.
You are lying through your teeth! Am I? No. I spent my life in taverns, claiming to be a hero. I know the truth when I see it.
I guess he needs a map-as soon as possible. Everything is fine, very fine actually. It's giving me a lot more responsibility. The way I see it, chores are my taxes to pay for teaching. ANSWER, X PLEASE Listen, trust my experience, know that he knows you feel that way.
"King James County, Virginia, 1794." It is the only extant copy. But in truth it is not the most valuable map among those stolen. How much are we talking about? It's been a while since we've had it appraised, but I'd say about around two hundred thousand dollars.
Including the Bray map. It's the only one left open. Zupko was probably standing here. Obviously, he was examining the map when he was killed. Or he was showing it to a buyer.
I know the one they found is a fake. I am as interested in the original as you are. Knowing that the Brays had a copy is as close as I've come to finding it. Which is the other reason I'm here. I would like to hire you to find it for me.
Bullshit. If so, he would have told the police the same way he bought the atlas, anonymously. No, the real goal of this meeting was to appear our loyalty. He knows we are looking for the map. And in case we find it, he wants us to pass it on to him and no one else.
There is someone who may possess the knowledge you seek. Who is it? They call them the Gray Sisters. They are the most powerful seers in the world. Nothing escapes their gaze, not even the thoughts of the gods. If there is a cure for Ariadne. - They will know it.
Stop questioning my authority. That's not how... - you do in an emergency situation. - I followed you... I will take responsibility. And I took it immediately...
Jeremy and I, on the other hand, were too busy enjoying it to notice the view. Wow, that's the way to do it. Yes! It's a rally track. I'm going to throw it in ... power it around, a tap of the brakes, I'm going to counter-steer it....

This view is beautiful. Yes, yes I agree. You know, when I used to walk past houses like this I used to think that people on the terraces looked down on everyone, feeling superior. Now I know it's true. Roger sold our beach house saying we never used it.
Carmelo, a little bit, but that's not the point. I have to have my gallbladder removed. I swear. First the dishwasher and now this. Why is there always something to fix in this house? Are they going to take it out?
Why is there always something to repair in this house? Are they going to take it away? - Surgically? - No, Arthur. They'll talk you out of it, with the promise of a better life.
We all need a companion... - Hello, hello. - It's only natural. And it will take you a while before you find the right one, but you will. And you may lose him, but -- in the meantime, it was good to have found him. Everyone here has had a partner and then lost him, but -- life is only interesting if you share it.
* Your expressions are funny, impossible to capture in photographs. * Are you still my favorite work of art * Is your figure less than Greek ones? * Is your mouth a little elongated? * When you open it to speak, are you biting?
Take the key and open the back door. The alarm is 4242. Go up to the bedroom. On the bed is a letter. It is addressed to Michael. Take it home and keep it until I get back, but listen, promise me you won't read it.
- Let's not waste any more time. I'm here. I'm listening to you. - Can you tell me what the hell you want? - There is only one thing I want from you. And I want it so desperately that I would scream.
And now they are looking for radiation. To reproduce. Simulations indicate that our three targets are converging here: the San Francisco Bay. But if we fit a nuke with a protected timer and put it on a boat and send it out to the middle of the sea, the radiation will attract MUTOs and the MUTOs will attract Godzilla.
[IN BLACK LANGUAGE] I don't answer to dogs, Female Elf! I would not make an enemy of her. Do you like killing things, Orc? Do you like death? Then let me give it to you.
We don't know anything about you. Who can vouch for your honesty? Me. I will vouch for him. I have traveled long with these Dwarves facing grave dangers, and if Thorin Oakenshield gives his word he will keep it.
I know. Thank you, it was... important to me. Are you back at the factory? You can't get enough of it, can you? I heard they're going to close it down.
Look. I told you. I have no talent. Your file says you are a very intelligent man. I expected you to see and understand the situation and accept it for what it is.
The next part of the boogie woogie is very strange, it needs an explanation. It's called 'boogie woogie pause'. When I play it at a certain point I stop. You may think I have forgotten the music. But I haven't forgotten it, there's nothing written for this part. That's why they call it a 'pause'.
It's so beautiful. No, I mean, why? I'm getting rid of this stuff and I thought you wanted the credenza. Mom. No, Mom. I wouldn't know how to take it to Colorado. Maybe Ivy will take it.
Boy mangles his penis and sues us. Our goal is to eliminate phase 2 and phase 3. Now, I understand the problem. Why don't we move the fan? What if we put it in the ear?
Sorry, Jean. I don't want to waste my time with them. They will almost all die very soon anyway, without your help. Three of them, in a week, in the same truck This sword is hundreds of years old--and was christened Danzan by the first samurai who used it.
So you didn't find them? Don't mess with me, bitch. I could kill you. If you could make me feel something, Harada, that would be really sublime. I could rip your pretty little mouth open before you open it to say another bullsh--.
Is she all right? Come here, honey. Did you film it? Yes. I'll have the film developed and send it to Father Gordon.
Cut me, I have to have a wound like Jamie's. - I can't do that. - I will heal in a few minutes. Take the knife, do it yourself. They'll be suspicious of this scar, I'll hide it with a cut.
Do you think you traded me for the cherry bomb? Do you think that's how things work? I left it there for you. It wasn't an accident. I-I wanted you to find it and return it to me.
What? I can't believe you're asking me that. Okay. Okay. Sorry. But, uh, what about the car? I mean, someone must be looking for it.
I mean, somebody must be looking for her. What do you want from me? Should I call the police? I wouldn't worry about it. I'll make sure no one finds her.
My problem? You spent the last five years - taking care of Methuselah. - We were married. You see, nobody believes in friendship. People talk about it, you see it on television, people drop in on you, you go to the doctor together, nobody eats alone, but most people are alone.
- Jerry would have wanted you to have it. Thank you. Ray. What the hell happened to my car? Next time don't put it in the fire station.
Get me the G.l. Joes now. Star One is proceeding on course for launch. So, listen up! The warhead is not far away. We find it and disarm it before landing.
Each satellite is equipped with ten hollow platinum tubes through which a tungsten rod passes. Zeus 1 -A satellite arriving in London. Weapons active and loaded. Awaiting clearance. To direct a bar to the target, we neither launch nor fire it.
And on that note -- I was thinking it would be nice to have a royal party. With an embers... My sister told me that your magic is very powerful. Is it? Yes, it boggles the minds of those who try it.
"and then a light, which chilled my blood." Heaven one, was two seagulls flying over the water. Paradise two, was a pile of clouds, in the northwest sky. Yesterday, I sensed a strange presence. There was no one there, but still I felt it.
Of course. I would like it. Hell, yes. Four years later, why not? I would definitely want to get her.
Only one year? Do you not love me, then? Please, good Mercutio, let us go. The Capulets are out. You are like the man who draws his sword, promptly lowers it, on a tavern table, and swears he will not need it.
Do you not love me, then? Please, good Mercutio, let us go. The Capulets are out. You are like the man who draws his sword, promptly lowers it, on a tavern table and swears he will not need it. Until, after the second beer, he grabs it and stabs the innkeeper through and through.
Shut up and lie down on the ground! And you better tell everybody Motherfucker was here! What's your problem, boy? Get on the ground too, Gandalf, or I'll put a bullet between your butt cheeks. You'll break your face with the recoil of the gun if you don't hold it right.
Oh, my goodness. That's good enough. Hallelujah. All right, there's a word I'd like to hear. We'll say it, when we find out where we are.
Oh, my darling! - Mother, mother, there is a sword. - A sword? - There's a sword in the corner, okay? - Okay. I need you to get up and get it for me.
So you'll have it for two days. You'll be okay until Wednesday. All right. And potato salad. But without mayonnaise so you can warm it up.
You'll be okay until Wednesday. All right. And potato salad. But without mayonnaise, so you can warm it up. Well, I could eat it with red cabbage, too.
I always took her to school ... in the car... every day. But that morning ... we ... she ... why did it happen to her? Take off your tank top. You don't need to wear it in the house.
There is no shame, Agent Fuller! No shame at all. It's a joke! Alma: If you had nothing to do with it, how did the signed paper get in the vault? What do the children call it?
Give the spectators $3 million. (TRESSLER RIDE) They know how to entertain them! - A resounding finale. Theunicimagic tows! Sedovesseserve the oxygen mask, put it on your lawyer first.
Thankyouforchoosing. - What moves Tressler besides money? - Ego. Pick a card. Look at it, put it back in the deck, and tell me what it is.
Contrordination. Open back. Here's the plan. They think the safe is on its way. So we follow it to....
- OK. I get it.... I'm sorry, man. I got your stuff. - Excuse me? - I took your stuff and I did it all.
This ... is our case. What do the experts say? They say the gun was inside his mouth. With the stock down, that is, the barrel facing up. Now. Someone shouts, 'Get the gun out of your mouth! ' She takes it out, quickly.
"Don't you want something else?" And the Italian replies, "No, give me a fork" He says, "We don't have one!" And the other says: So the Big Boss walks away, finds a fork, takes it and gives it to him.
I mean, look. It's pretty much done for us. I mean, you fix it up a little bit, put a nail here. You paint it. You change the sign, like 'Mike, Chris, whatever or they don't change it.
I'm thinking big, okay? It's going to be great. We're going to use video surveillance. Something well done, from head to toe. You're not going to do it properly because you have too much of a government mentality to be small and quick
Sorry, dear, what was it you asked me ? Do you remember Notte Fonda? Vaguely--it was some kind of bomb, I think. There are people looking for that weapon, wanting to use it.
Cyberspace is like a galaxy of roads constantly moving streams of data. With just a computer, anyone can enter and explore. That's what Julian Assange loved to do, explore. He used back doors to enter where he didn't have to, to uncover secrets and reveal them. He built a machine to reveal secrets and called it "WikiLeaks."
If it works, we have a good chance of getting out of here. Let's say there was an ecological disaster for the Carcharias. An oil rig failed, spilling millions of gallons into the ocean. Now there are 3 Carcharias companies potentially responsible. One that built the platform, one that operates it, and one that has the oil.
- I don't... I'm here about Victor Crowley. - Well, then what the hell do you want? We're here as public officials. You have evidence, which is part of an investigation. We want to borrow it, and then we'll give it back to you.
You know what, son? In the past I have been in your place, I have mistaken my arrogance for God's will. That's not religion, son, it's called self-celebration. You'd better let it go. Put it down.
- It's ours. What do you mean by is it yours? Is it still your property? Yes, it is ours. Michael is restoring it.
Sure. In a stupid way? Sometimes. But we don't care -- because that's the way we are. And when it's time to die -- we don't oppose death. We invoke it.
'Blade Runner,' either. Without 'Blade Runner,' no William Gibson, no 'Matrix,' and so on. They're all joined together. Many people took images and scenes from them by putting them in their projects. So there will always be a reference to Jodorowsky. When you have to bring something that big to life and you don't have a chance to make it, to transpose it, it has to live on in your head. You can't exorcise it. And a story like that can creep in and creep in until it haunts you for the rest of your life unless you realize it.
Interesting. Like a completion? For example, the handshake, the sum of the different handshakes of people of different peoples forms our idea of a handshake. The handshake good or bad, firm or yielding. Usually, a nymphomaniac is seen as ... a woman who can't get enough and so she has sex with many different people, which is certainly true, but to be honest ... I see it as the sum of all those different sexual experiences.
- Magda. - For my mother is very suitable for me. - Magda. But I don't agree. I will now enter this coffin. Magda. I want you to lock it tightly.
End of conversation. Why did he do it? Leslie Chow is the madness. You don't talk to insanity. If you're lucky, you put her in the trunk of a limousine and kill her.
Let me know when you are hungry... Should I leave you a bottle of water? I'll put it in the shade. I'll put it here. Look... Otherwise you won't find it.
- Watch the ball. Smooth movement. Splendid. Look at the ball. The thing is, when Frank threw the ball, I hit it.
- We are meant to work together. - Sorry, didn't you see that reception? Yes, so what? Do you feel sorry for yourself? No, I like my music. Who cares if they don't get it, right?
We have had water reactors for 50 years. There are about 400 of them around the world. And they have produced a lot of waste that we didn't expect. I mean, if you're talking about stuff that you have to keep isolated from the rest of the world for 100,000 years that's enough to scare a lot of people. That was perhaps the price we paid for commercialization in the sense that we didn't look ahead. Nuclear power was developed as a boutique energy source by executives who didn't know it very well.
First of all, let's talk about lives--even just the quality of life. And if you look at the countries with the best quality of life are the countries that consume the most electricity. With all climates, 24 hours a day, a constant flow of energy. The global south is hot. They would like air conditioning. And until now they couldn't afford it, but now they can.
- For our exodus. NASA asked me to build a state-of-the-art space station.... ..and I sent them state-of-the-art the fuck out. Why? I had built one for myself. It's up there, right now, floating in space. It's waiting for me and my people to inhabit it.
Little bastard of an Englishman. Yeah. Well, you know... How did you know that song? My mother had the record. We used to listen to it over and over as kids.
Well, now you sound like a high school teacher looking for lust. Fair warning. You won't make many friends by reopening this case, not down here. Word gets around. Whoever gave you that file screwed his promotion. And your career. They call it the trail, like for horses.
Shut up, robots! They're showing Calculon's star on the Walk of Fame! Oh, yeah... At least I'll always have that to look forward to. Calculon has done his time more than any other piece of junk. Therefore, it is with immense pleasure that I remove his star and replace it with a second star... in honor of the magnificent Robert Wagner!
When the Freedom of Information Act distributed a bunch of documents, it turned out that all these different people who took the drug all experienced the same drug reactions. They experienced something in that state, that caught up with them, that met them in the middle. But what you can't hide is what it meant in terms of human lives. There were deaths, there were lasting and harmful effects. Everyone who took this drug witnessed the same thing. And they all called it the same thing even though they were separate subjects.
They experienced something in that state, which reached them, which met them in the middle. But what cannot be hidden is what it meant in terms of human lives. There were deaths, there were lasting and harmful effects. Everyone who took this drug witnessed the same thing. And they all called it the same thing even though they were separate subjects. What-what did they call it?
Hurry up and don't talk to anyone. What are you waiting for? Hurry up! Judith's grave has bloomed. Thank you. The neighbor no longer cares about the house and keeps it for you.
- Relax. - No. I don't relax. How am I supposed to explain this to Jason? Just don't tell him. - Because we're not going to cut it.
Get it down, trust me, when this stuff kicks, it kicks. I see what you mean. Very sweet, very soft, very wow. Where did you get it? Manny, he's giving out samples some little old lady in Pasadena is growing it in her basement.
Karim... Don't look at me like that. Where I go, the rivers are of wine, and the women -- the women are more beautiful than those in the Shah's harem. and maybe, there's even a redhead there! God gives us life -- and God takes it away.
I don't give a shit if they don't let out. You didn't see what I just saw. We have to go. What about the infection? We have to stay inside so we don't get it.
Neither does Aunt Jackie, and she's right up there at the top. Do you think it could have been an accident? A close shotgun blast? No. - Did Mima have a gun? - She keeps it in the hall cupboard.
I will buy some more. - Will you cut it out with the dog and cookies? - Sure. Joseph. Duncan wanted to buy the farm. Joseph wanted Mima to sell it.
Right, son? It's a huge mountain, Mali! Only God can lead the boat all the way up there. Over there! We take it up the hill and then to the truck.
- Of course you do. We're almost there. And you're afraid you won't make it. The closer we get, the stronger the fear becomes. It's no use trying to hide it. I know fear when I see it.
A demon? An illusionist's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered him. And from that day on, I hated magic and all those who practice it.
We do not provide it. It is part of the training to manage those who want the recipe at all costs. There is a sentence to say. - What is it? - 'We will not provide it.'
Don't be silly. I asked the man at the gate and he told me that you replaced the chief. I'm just his personal secretary. What about the car? He lets me use it.
An army of 500 soldiers is only a few hours away from me. All this talk of reason-it just seems like a cover for weakness. We are camped here because we have no choice. We need land! Either we conquer it, or our people perish.
Sure, please look upstairs, absolutely. This is my darkroom, as you can see. I'd like to take a look, if I may. It's just my photographs. Well, I'm very interested in photography, we're using it more and more, too.
Why revenge? Tell me what did they do to you? What did they do to me? Yes, them. Understand? Not me. You seek justice and you want to impose it with revenge, but there is a difference between these two things and you don't see it.
- Very good. - I don't care what I look like. - There's more of you to appreciate. - All right. Cool. - Do you want me to read it to you?
How to make... the knot. I always used to make--a Windsor knot, I think. I'll tie it for you. Maybe it's not a Windsor knot, but ... that's what I do to myself when I go to church. Do I tie it on myself and then you put it on yourself?
One day, Wolf, everything you see here will fall under the rule of Rome. And if that day is a little late in coming because of da Vinci's inventions so be it. But he has the key. That makes him one step closer from having the Book of Leaves. Let him keep it for now.
It shows them, and us, how not to... donate your whole heart. - Do you want to give it a try? - Sure. Charming. So. you're not revising the song, you're just setting it differently.
No. Not yet. What if we talked more clearly about fame? About what people do to get it? Wait. So the song about fame and how you get it doesn't express that?
If you don't want to do the necessary, I will find someone to do it for you. That's no good. This song is about when Marilyn realizes that being taken seriously as an actress is not the same as becoming a star. I understood the song. Thank you. Maybe you get it here, but I don't hear it here.
Renai, it's me. It's all right. I tried every way to communicate with you. I even played your song. I should have known it was you. No one else plays it so badly.
No. You're not driving in the canyon tonight. Baby, why don't we make him a bed outside in the studio? Oh, I also wanted you to hear the song. It's just a demo. Both of you. I'll wait until it's ready for me to hear it.
Hey, dad! Did you get another one? Hey honey. Look, I just wanted to bring you this casserole. I want you to eat it this time.
Take it, dad. - Well, look who's here. - Hey, Olivia. Olivia brought me a casserole. I won't eat it, but it's nice of her to bring it.
You always hated the water. When we went to the beach you wouldn't even bathe. I can change, can't I ? What are you going to do with a boat ? Paragliding ... or put it on my balcony as a planter.
Did you drug me again, you piece of shit? Of course I didn't! Guess what, though! While you were sleeping, I wrote you a fucking song! - I'll play it for you in the hotel.
The land of milk and honey. Kate. Betty. Please let me help you. I gave my daughter life. You will not destroy her.
That's Morris Brown. The owner of this chain. Here to get his ass kissed, I like that. I really think this is his best shot. I mean, they can call it Coffee Town, but I call it.
- Anticipate problems, - before they hit you right in the face. - Communicate, not compete. But politics is competition. "A blood sport," hasn't it been called that? - That's why we never bring it home.
It may prove necessary for you to develop ... other ... less direct alternatives. The Medici are the reason Florence is a haven for sorcerers and... sodomites. They have turned my city away from the Lord. Together, Holy Father, we will get it back on the right path.
What does that mean? The landing gear doesn't work... we have to make an emergency landing. It's very dangerous, we have to prepare the runway in a special way. In short, a mess. Why don't they prepare it?
Then I brought only heroin, coke and pills. Where's my head! Mescaline was withdrawn in '86.... They manufacture it in Valencia. I have a pusher friend who sells it in Madrid.
Let her speak. Explain yourself, Bruna. I've been hearing death for hours. From the beginning of the trip, but I thought it was the farts. I don't hear it in the whole plane.
I don't want to fight here. You make me feel like I'm in the wrong. No, you know very well what you are doing, Orrin. You are using this poor girl's death for your own political purposes. You stood in my way when the peach growers were whining because I wanted to demolish her.
But I can't, can I? I thought it was top secret. Don't worry, I know you read my magazine from cover to cover. There's no shame in that. I won't read it much longer, it gets worse every week.
Wait. I'm going to assign it to one of my deputies, we'll handle it calmly, and I'll be there to help you out. - That doesn't sit well with me. - Then what do you suggest? What a martyr wants more than anything is a sword to immolate himself on, so you sharpen the blade, hold it at the right angle, and then three, two, one...
Alone? Are you alone? What about me and Josh? We used to be enough for you. I'm sorry you didn't get your freedom the way you wanted it.
What is the key for? For a locker that contains a very valuable figurine. It's worth a fortune. I already have the buyer, so all we have to do is get the figurine. Marko doesn't know the buyer, Jake, so we'll sell it, make a bunch of money, and run away together.
Oh, excuse me, ma'am! Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am, excuse me. Give the briefcase to my partner. He will bring it to me.
In sixty minutes, or he will die. Wait. Sixty minutes. Do you think he really means it? Who? No one, it's just--we--we--we ordered pizza for you--and we thought either you get it in 60 minutes or less, or it's free.
- What did you say? Shouldn't you stay here? That's what everyone says. But you are still made of flesh. That is until I burn it.
Victor Silver. Cattle rancher. Landowner in Argentina. Slaughters his meat there. He ships it in his reefer ship, to sell... New York, Europe, London.
- Do you remember the interview I had today? Yes. I got the job. Well, it's not exactly a job. They bought my idea and they're going to make it happen for me. And well.
She is absolutely not superficial in her work. I don't understand what problems you have with her. Well, I think it's enough to know that I have one. Go ahead, give me a good reason and I'll withdraw the offer. It's enough to know that I don't want her.
Micaela. Yes. Her camera. Yes. He gave it to me when he was sick.
- Really? Were you really in bed when I called you last night? Yes. It's Pete Townshend. Townshend wrote the song, Daltrey sings it.
With all due respect, Governor, our consumers are vampires. And given your political leanings, the public relations nightmare of a partnership with vampire enemy number one is not worth the risk. You haven't heard my proposal yet. You see. during my tenure here in this great state, I confiscated my fair share of property, one of which -- it's this old oil refinery. The company that used to use it left it for a newer facility.
We have to think-about the greater good. I need your help. What? We told you about this ridiculous "employee of the month" thing. Tom seems to have taken it to heart.
Hilarious. I am reminded of the day I met my beautiful wife, the winner of Miss Avon and Somerset of 1992 and 1994. It was always the same person, huh. Don't worry, I'm not a ... Mormon. A double hassle--who would want that?
And I'm tired of coming in last. Because when you're there, and you get to the finish line, you find that the cake is gone. Because some bright guy like you has already eaten it. The cake of success. That's where they keep it.
We knew right away that we were going to have a lot of work. He was like another Fleetwood Mac phenomenon. Joe was always very good to me There was a plaque that he had brought me ...when Nevermind had gone to number one. And we hung it on the wall And it was only a couple of weeks later that Joe passed away.
Thank you for keeping it. - Are you okay? - Of course I'm okay. I'm more than all right. Now I can go back to my life, without a little rodent ruining it for me!
Do you think she would like the idea? If I'm honest, I don't know. She has her own very rambunctious, nonconformist approach. Classical news bore her, but if you could show that you can be daring.... I have a story to turn over to you, if you want it.
Nice to meet you. - Sally, Alex. I'm Joss. Wait until you see this house. I think you will love it.
Yes, I have a million of them. Okay. Goodbye. Yeah. If we're late for Shabbat, put the chiatra in the locker and we'll take it back at the end of the day, okay?
Goodbye. Yeah. If we're going to be late for Shabbat, put the chiatra in the locker and we'll take it back at the end of the day, okay? Okay. If it bothers you that they play it, tell me I'll take it home, okay?
Yeah. If we're going to be late for Shabbat, put the chiatra in the locker and we'll take it back at the end of the day, okay? Okay. If you're annoyed that they play it, tell me I'll take it home, okay? - I don't want them to use it.
- So I would sell myself. - No, Jack. - But yes. - You wouldn't. They'd probably get it anyway.
Request denied. You know what we have to do here. The official mission begins at the Romanian border. No, your official mission begins here and now, with me. And if you jeopardize it, I will court-martial you.
Will you think it is under glass A or B? B, definitely. - Why? - I saw you put it there. But Lucy didn't see where I put it.
I thought you were going to put pizza in a bowl of salad. Oh, that's kind of what I did. In fact, that's exactly what it is. That's why we call it 'salad pizza'. You know what I mean? You take a pizza from Domino's, and you put it in a bowl of salad, also from Domino's.
A condom? I wonder what he was thinking. - Look at this. Huh? - Nice. When that thing comes back I'll tear it apart.
They all came here with a lot of pain. And they still suffer a lot. But what we can give them is a life of love and prayer. There is hope, Mr. Decker. This is where they find it.
- A child is missing. - So tell me about Carroll's accomplices. He used this prison guard to get access to the Internet and create a following for himself, like a cult. Let's not use that word. People don't take it well.
Chuck E. Cheese? - Really? - Promise. Dad will get you tokens and you'll play everything, okay? Then we'll get your favorite pizza and eat it all.
So when you get out of here, I want you to work on turning that theory into reality, okay? Whatever you need, I'll get it for you. I'll talk to Evan about it. You don't need Evan's approval to do the right thing. If it was the right thing then he would do it.
Surely we are all wondering after the events of last week. But hello! It'll just be a downpour, we'll go to the playground later. - I got you a hot chocolate. - I don't want it.
So it's a tough place. - Before he was banned, Shane was at a soccer game, And all these kids started spitting in this cup. And this was going to be passed into the hands of a little boy. He had been a great friend of Shane's in the past, and when he got this cup, he was pointing it in the direction of Shane's head.
And the way they saw Tom, and not the Tom that I knew. When I got up from the seat next to Martha, All I could think was, "I have to kiss the coffin for Shane." So I approached the coffin, and I kissed it,
Are you fucking with me again? I never joke with the devil. Do you know that I'm getting very-very bored? We are having so-much fun. Cut the duck into pieces and brown it for 15 minutes over high heat.
In any case, this is the dawn of a new era. The fifth angel has been born. An era of darkness will dawn. The vastness of darkness will push away the light. Men will call it that:
Race, breeze, crazy, square. There's a war in the square and you just think I'm crazy. We will present the song at the Fall Concert. - It's in a few days. - If you believe, you can do it.
- He is waiting for me... He also has to look after his little brother, his parents are not here. But you are here now. You don't see each other very often. I'm making meringue pie and we'll eat it together.
Are you too good to play? What, too good at wiffle ball? I don't like to sweat. You know what, Connor? Come a little closer. Marcus' turn, he's not taking it.
Then it's probably the library. Racist, son of... Sodom and Gomorrah! It's Pierce's special gym. He never lets me use it. He says I'm a child. Wa...
I married you. It's not easy for me to tell you, but if this guy is a professional, do you think he's going to release a person who can identify him? Then what do we do? We have the one thing that drives him to keep her alive. If we stop him before he gets her, she might live.
My baseball career was decapitated years and years ago. Amen. Surely another head will grow in its place. Maybe the head of the movie star. Or the car driver. Although a head can be selfish and wicked.... there is nothing to prevent the one that replaces it from being selfless and kind. The hydra has many heads.
I am really mortified. I'm afraid I have to ask you for your bag. - How? - Your purse. Hand it to me, please.
I would really appreciate your suggestion. Dr. Chilton, would you like to help me with the dessert? With pleasure. I love Norton's grapes. Both the inside and the outside are the same color. You peel it--and the flesh is purplish, too.
He loves the language. He knows more than many others, even English teachers, and he cares. What else to ask from a teacher? He really cares. He is confusing, disorganized never has a planned lesson, or if he does, he never follows through.
A scorpion. Too obvious. Stings the mate, a foolishness for the Arachnoid Vice. A pitcher. What is it? A spider that throws a net over its prey, bites it, and sucks it in completely.
Why should he have? They were not important. They were just "subjects." That agenda was not in Reuben's study. Maybe he kept it in his apartment.
He has been here for ten years and says he will be here for the rest of his life. - I really got out of the business. - You're in prison, aren't you? No, no. In Mexico, they call it carcel.
Anyway, we rented your room. - How? - Don't worry, we put all your stuff in the car, locked it and parked it on the street. What? You got a ticket, where do I send it?
I pushed her away every time. But she wouldn't stop. And then one night. "Put your hand here," she said. "Feel," she said. She took my hand -- and put it on her belly.
What about Martha? She will heal. The situation has been precarious for a while. There is a medicine called "Three in One." Veterinarians don't prescribe it, but any breeder believes in it.
Whose? There must be a subject for this feeling. John found a miracle cure. I don't know where he got it. They call it three-in-one.
You want a nice cool shoe. This is a shoe mold. You put it in the shoe, and you turn on this little fan. See, what it does is it cools the shoe before you put it on.
He was a genius in whatever field he worked. A genius through and through. Genius? Like he could figure out how that thing works? We have to find the creature and get it out of here before Kanan sees it.
- Yes, Don, unfortunately we are under new management. - Very strict. What if we don't involve the partners in the study? - What do you mean? - It's not a legal case. We buy Don's house with the money we got for burning down ours and sell it back to him once his assets are unlocked.
All office workers have it. 3-inch fisherman's knife. This bulletin board is so clean! - Well, thank you. - How often do you clean it?
I... I mean, if you want me in the room, I'll be there, but ... I'm not going to watch. How do you feel about the death penalty? I'm in favor of it. Are you? I certainly don't approve of this penniless state paying the appeals of a bunch of idiots on death row, but -- yes, I'm in favor of it if we use it.
I have a stomach ache. I'm sorry. You'd better get better for tomorrow. Do you like the shirt? - Why don't you try it on?
Bring in ... the woman lawyer." Yeah, baby! It's like "Matlock" with a windowsill! Hey, look, we like this house a lot. Do you know who's selling it? - Actually, me and Andy.
A necklace. She wears it in every picture. - Like she never takes it off. - Right. But she wasn't wearing it when we found her.
I have seen this necklace before. Yes. So have I. Where did you get that necklace? Dr. Murphy noticed that she was wearing it the night of the gala, and I saw that she was wearing it the day we came to talk to her son.
Now! Goodbye -- forever. - Adam. - Adam! Turn around! - They bought it, huh? - Oh, completely!
Yeah. Usually dessert is my favorite part. And my favorite dessert is pudding and my favorite is chocolate pudding, but -- my favorite part of chocolate pudding is the skin. And the one tonight didn't have it. But don't tell mom, I don't want to hurt her. It's not going to hurt her. I love the skin of the pudding so much, my old mom used to make it for me all the time.
Well, what if it gets stuck like this? It's going to sink. They'll be looking for her car. I know. Look, if they find it and trace it back to us, we're screwed big time.
New York is on a different planet. I don't know if he'll get the job, but ... I want him to have options in case things get worse. So what did Wilden say about his car? Emily says they're talking about theft. Don't you think they will find it?
I'm taking Hanna to New York with me. So you wouldn't get the promotion here. No, in New York. Well... When would you have to go, if they offered it to you?
How long have you been living here with Terry? A year. We had a mansion in Streetsville before. - It's nice. - Terry hates it.
- Have you ever been to Poplar? - No. - In Poplar... there can be as many as 12 people living in a small house or complex. Under overcrowded conditions--and little ventilation--infection spreads easily. Meanwhile, an infected person unwittingly brings the disease to a production line full of people and passes it on to his colleagues.
Can you really be angry with me? No. Would you like a glass of wine? Oh, I'd love to, but the bottle is empty. Norman and I drank it before we got dirty.
All right. By law I have to give you this. Why? If you see Kieren acting strangely, it could be a sign of... Well, there's this illegal drug going around. The kids with PDS call it Blue Oblivion and it's very dangerous.
Because otherwise it's over between us. Yes. Very interesting, don't you think? Look, I think you're getting too worked up, okay? I didn't want this double date, you didn't want it.
Through your eyes, brothers, I finally see the world as it really is. This city is infested. 8 million parasites, dragging their useless existences, spreading disease -- forcing us to live in darkness, like carrion. But enough is enough! They are the real plague! Together, we will rid this city of mankind, and claim it as our own.
- I would also take you if your beliefs required communion with nature. I don't want to walk around. Okay? I'm going to hang this damn cross. Because it's my religious freedom and you're violating it!
But my guy, Fried Potato, told me that when he was in jail, they used to bring the drugs in by sticking the stuff in the birds. - In the chickens? - No. I think it was pigeons or something. - Were they shoving it up his ass? - No. They would put it in sachets and then shove it down his throat.
We put the plate back together with glue, and it doesn't matter what the damn bird says. Where did you get this stuff? The fumes from this glue are going to my head. My landlord gave it to me. It's high-strength. He said he uses it to forget the past.
- Where is it? I don't know, I swear, I don't know! This package... contains a sacred relic of inestimable value. Made of Welsh gold, inlaid with sapphires. Someone wants to steal it.
Then why do all the bad things happen to me? Years spent in shit! A husband who falls off a cliff! Loneliness that gives me no respite all day long -- and now this? A chance to be happy comes my way and you're taking it away from me, throwing it away without giving it a chance.
Okay... Michonne. Hershel told me about the boy you shot. He had a gun. Was he handing it over to you?
The other is Louise Sinclair, from New Orleans, a former Blackwater agent. Another expert. Ask if they've run the license plate yet. We've put out the alert within a 500-mile radius of Richmond. - If it's out there, we'll find it.
He wants the key. To give it to my brother. Why don't you give it to him? Because I trust you more than my family. There's too much at stake to let them take it.
NYPD. She was supposed to protect Beau. - So what happened? - Beau told me to wait outside. When your boss gives you a directive, you follow it.
I had nothing to do ... with his death. But I may know who might have done it. Scarlet... said he was protecting this SD card with his life. Now I know why. I thought I could use it to my advantage against Randolph, but ... it's pretty obvious he was using it to blackmail someone else.
You are enslaved to me, Elena, what you think you feel may not be true. But there is hope now. Tell him what the tattoo hunter told you. He said there was a cure. Everyone wants it for different reasons.
He will lose control. That's exactly the point. You don't know anything else. Now I have the professor who will help me find the cure. You are just the competition. The first one who finds it can decide what to do with it:
Working late? Hold on. I found something. Look. See how he picks up the bag, picks it up with his forearm?
One who knows how to choose the right moment. And understands the repercussions if something goes wrong. Choosing the right moment can take you straight to the top. And one mistake can destroy you. You see, Bea -- anger is a healthy emotion out there. But here--unless you follow it through to the end--you're better off keeping it to yourself.
If they find out at the department, I'm finished. You were packing his stuff -- that's why you collapsed? Did the police let you know anything? - No. - Do you want me to take the stuff away, - put it in storage?
Anthony thinks I am the mole. She thinks so too, I know. I argued with Hathaway, and he's dead. I ordered her not to contact his men, and the radio is destroyed. She was against the Volm's mission, all of a sudden, she approves of it.
And what would that be? Well, for one thing, that having money and power doesn't mean your shit doesn't stink. And most importantly--the only thing that separated me from the future I wanted--was my will. I had the talent. And the ambition. All I needed was an opportunity. The problem, it's obvious, is that opportunity is rarely given, and you're more likely to have to take it.
Alec, find the bad guys. You know how powerful these suits are. You're right. I'm sorry. Is there any way to track the suit if the person who had it wasn't wearing it?
I did some research on melamine, it's pretty toxic stuff. It was banned when they found it in milk powder, in toys, - in pet food.... - Is it lethal? Exposure at the cellular level can cause cancer, but... - it can't cause suffocation. - But something that contains it could?
We have to hurry. How? What-what do you mean, "we have to"? You found Yaoguai in a matter of hours. It took me weeks. You track the beast and I kill it.
- I couldn't tell you. I needed to keep my mind clear. This is what girls do. They go out with guys. So don't come and ask me if I'm serious or not. I gave my daughter life. You are not going to destroy it.
Your father defended his good name. Arlo doing something like that? Frances was good at forgiving, but I never could. I would still kill Henry Crowder today, no matter what. A thousand times and a thousand more, always the same way. When you make a decision, when you take a path. then you have to follow it to the end, or at least -- I always thought of it that way.
Thank you. I appreciate it very much. So... This sentence here... "He felt like he was suffocating from the inside because of a black smoke." I-I love that metaphor ... but I think it would be better if you moved it to the end of the paragraph.
- True - Yeah. But I'm probably the only one who's ever touched a woman, so it doesn't mean much. Let's welcome our next speaker tonight -- Mr. Hank Galliston. When I was nervous, I would always chew gum -- and forget to spit it out. So we created a signal. She would remind me to spit it out ... and I would stick it under the counter.
It was the last thing he was working on before he was taken to the hospital. There is this part here that he mysteriously erased before he left. According to some theories, before he died, Einstein made a discovery. An equation to create a new kind of power, but ... he felt that people were not ready for it. And he erased it, so no one would know what it was.
Love. What makes you believe that love cannot be seen? What makes you believe otherwise? Because I have seen it -- in the poems written on post-it notes stuck on the bathroom mirror. In the yellow thumbtack he gives me every birthday, knowing that wherever he puts it on the map, that's exactly where we'll wake up the next morning.
A Nazi officer with my face. He looked exactly like me. Now I dream of a man with a gun. The location of the cross must be secret. I will not put it in the mud.
What do you say? Even at home he's as fast as a splinter? Zac, zac, in and out like a bunny? I hope for your sake you're quick on the draw, Cinderella. If I get you that little pansy gun, you'll have to pry it out of your ass with pliers.
What's going on, Charlie? How do you like this place? It's okay. You know, this house could be yours. - They're not going to sell it to someone like me.
For Laila it meant something. It means we are getting closer. We are going to find her. I need to know what this is all about, Father Mark. For thousands of years, pastors have been doing what they can to protect the Cross from those who covet it.
Well, maybe I could at least get a copy of the curriculum, and I could teach her some of this stuff at home. Look, Miss Fox, the children are glad they are not in the gifted class. They called themselves the "B Team." We also gave them a bumblebee pin. Well, some of them used to use it to sting themselves, so now they have stickers.
You really have a thing for Mexican cul-de-sacs, huh? I do. Open the door. It's a wooden door. Why don't you break it down?
Heracleo told the truth, at least about one thing. You are not the man one expects. My apologies. Share a drink, and accept it. My cup speaks for me. I do not claim it.
I would like you to accept my next order in such a spirit. Say it and it will be done. I wish this crate to disappear from my sight. A simple task, yet one of great importance. Where do you want me to put it?
- Two minutes out, major. - Too long. I'm going in. I've heard this speech before from your competitors. And now Hanka Robotics serves it up for the milky good.
Look, you don't know how sorry I am to have caused you trouble to help us again. Really, no trouble at all. Good. So, same procedure as always. The money will stay here tonight. We'll take it out in the morning, and divide it among the branches so we can pay the farmers who will cash the checks.
A demonstration is necessary. It is difficult to kill what does not really live. My construct is not fueled by science. It is fueled by the mind. I live because I will do so in existence!
I already sent it back to you with my comments. Did you put it off? I thought we were pitching it. You didn't include any of their notes. If I send it back like this, they won't read anything of yours anymore.
That's right. Yes. The evil. I see. Evil is the shadow that exists at the gates of our world -- constantly looking for how to enter -- the way to become flesh and blood. We either wait for that day to come -- or we fight it preemptively on our own terms.
Good morning. - Hi, guys. - Hi. Mack, did you see the game last night? Since when do I use the remote control? Someday you'll get it back.
- What is it made of? - The note. Go ahead, take a look at it. And guess what: I'm not giving it to anybody.
Yes. Too long postponed. We are city people. I always wanted to take a road trip, to see the country. To meet the people who live there.
And paths where you could walk without getting lost and. Trail markers made of cans crushed by fraternity members. That's right. Thank you. This is the best camping spot in the area, okay? And nobody knows it.
Trail markers made of cans crushed by fraternity members. That's right. Thank you. This is the best camping spot in the area, okay? And nobody knows it. - How come you know it?
No, no, that old box is where I used to put my robots. And that scary statue is where I put my comic books. Well, I put some of your stuff in storage, Dennis. Do you want to put my hamster cage in storage? Well, Dennis... Anyway, I don't like this mirror and I don't want it in this room.
I cannot entrust it to someone else. I owe it to them; no one else can pay my debt. Debt? What do you owe him? And Susan, he's giving me ice cream -- and he dropped some and he's licking it.
Here we are, in the dark and eerie Unbalanced Forest, searching for the mythical unicorn -- for some reason. And here she is, the fearless unicorn hunter, - in search of... - Edith, stop! You will scare the unicorn away! If somehow we actually find a unicorn, I'll film it and get rich.
You will scare the unicorn away! If somehow we actually find a unicorn, I'll film it and get rich. Look at that! It's here! That's where we'll see it!
The car, the little boy. Ancient history. Why are you still talking about it? What's so important about a bust of Margaret Thatcher? I can't stand it, it's always like that.
Perfecting. - Designed, sculpted, with tools... - Unknown. Exactly. This is why I wanted you to see it.
Well, then you shouldn't have sent Ty that picture of me. That's not exactly how it happened. I mean, he's a liar. - font color = "#8080" HARPER: You threw out his tooth. - They sent him back.
You don't like the way I handle things? She knows where the door is. She started the whole thing by discovering this island. And I'm not going to run away from it. I know an enemy when I see one.
Please, you little bitch! Slivko, get her out of here! You know it's the wrong choice. (NOSE UP) Put it down, sir.
There is more. What do you mean "more?" This world was never ours. It was theirs. It is only a matter of time before they take it back.
Patient? The sensor is active. If we move, it will explode. - Power? - It will destroy the apartment and those in it.
Go ahead. Launch initiated. I am launching the Persempre Puppies and there is nothing you can do about it! No! Baby Corp stole all my love and now I'm going to take it back.
Mija, I don't think you understand the situation. I don't. Okja is in our hands, you know? We are doing you a favor. Do you understand that?
Yes, take a seat. Now, we all agree that this sentence, "This is a wall," is a truth claim. This wall is real. i see it, you see it.
I tune a few more. "Well, it's still a wall." But. What happens if I remove every single atom from this wall except one? And you have seen me remove every single atom from this wall except that one atom, and I point to it and say,
I told Katie. I didn't want to. What can you do with cancer except remove it? You have to stop it before it spreads and every cell dies. This could spread everywhere if we don't remove it.
What kind of questions? Are we doing the right thing? I don't know. Did you know that a gang calling themselves the Yang Clan had an agreement with Patel before we acquired that pier? Someone was using it, so what?
It is a unique force...used to protect K'un-Lun. It is passed down from generation to generation...and is given to a student at the monastery to wield. How come they chose you? I was not chosen. I earned it.
He is holding those people as slaves. We have to do something. The beggar. He said they go out for dinner around this time, right? As soon as the building empties, we sneak in and raze it to the ground.
The protectors of K'un-Lun. I didn't think it was like that. None of us thought it was like that. But now you have a duty. And we will face it together.
All right, all right. So tell me about Dean's telescope. Oh, shit. I can see it at the base of the wall. Why do you keep it?
You will find your peace. I pray that you will find yours. I've always liked this place. It is a miracle... That this park still exists. That this city didn't destroy it to build skyscrapers.
- How come he is invulnerable? - What is that punch? - I've earned it. - Earned what? He earned it.
- Make a bold choice. Good morning. Good morning. Can we meet? My phone is blowing up. You owe me that. Can you pass it to me?
- Thank God you are here. - What's going on? It's as bad as what Dad did. They're hurting the animals. All right. We have 90 days to tame this horse so someone will buy it.
Well, good luck, since after ten minutes of clean water each slide becomes-a urine delivery system. - Oh, yes. - No bathing in piss. - No. We'll look for our favorite slide, bomb it once, then stay the rest of the day poolside, disease-free.
- Hey, hey, hey... - Just "Jerry." - Charlie, you need to change the keg. - Yeah, just a minute. Like, if Jerry jumped off a bridge would you do it too?
I love you so much. I love you. Way to go, big brother. Let me see the ring. We'll pick it out together.
I am saying it. i am not the god of war, Diana. i am the god of truth. mankind has stolen this world from us. They have ruined it, day after day.
No. If they destroy it, it will destroy everything for 50 square miles. We have to keep it on the ground! bad news. There's a timer on it. If we keep it on the ground here, it's the same thing.
This is the dean of advanced studies, Dr. Campbell Grant. Also known as "Crazy Legs," from his lacrosse game days. - It is an honor to meet you, Dean Grant. - Pleasure. Cam, I asked Ezekiel to bring his college essay with him so that he could hand it to you in person.
Do you think I'm thinking about the hem? Already we are late with dinner, Ramon.... I can't make it tonight. I have an engagement. Could you wrap my plate with tin foil and I'll eat it when I get home?
Isn't he still in hell? No, it's in Ponta Delgada in the Azores. - Similar to hell. - I inform you that we no longer use the wound in the shoulder as a signal. We don't? No, we change the code when we think those lousy Brits have cracked it.
- Are you a good actress? Your father thought so. And did he think that before or after... Being crazy? Love is a kind of madness, isn't it, Mr. Thoyt? Or have you never experienced it?
Do you know what it contains? Yes. The truth. If it were up to me, I would have burned it. Not to run the danger of the river bringing it back to shore.
No, no, no. Listen, go to this address, all right? You will find a man with marks on his face, he will take you to my friend Atticus. You must tell my friend Atticus where Helga is. Write your account, he will protect him and keep you safe.
- Here she is! Bring it here to me. Very good. Your director also sold me the costume you wore in the performance of: "The Little Princess." Tonight, you will wear it for me.
It's time for the leader of dancing without clothes to get attention. It's called "Crucible," based on Miller's play "The..."... So what happened with the ballet? No, we... Actually, I never did it.
So. Are we leaving in five minutes? You promised to help us. - We still need to find the portal. - I didn't promise to help you commit suicide. If you can't help us we will find it ourselves.
He can stop them. The Nazis lost the war. Why is he still obsessed? Why does he want an army? He doesn't want it for them.
You remembered Stiles.... And at that moment a new portal was created. - If the Sheriff could do it... - Maybe we could, too. But the portal closed. So we will reopen it.
Even consecutive discharges. Mason, are you sure this is going to work? Well, whatever is inside the cage is isolated from the electricity outside. So the Ghost Knight won't be able to use lightning to escape. Let's put a lightning rod on the roof and connect it to that conductor cable drawing the Knight to that spot.
A decision has been made. You will be exiled from the Free Tribal Lands, never to return. I will take you to our border. And what will I do then? And then you will cross it.
Lucas, stop! Stop it, Lucas! Stop it! We would have lived a year with the sale of that dagger. - Why did he have it?
We would have lived on it for a year with the sale of that dagger. - Why did he have it? - I don't know. She never told me about it. But if I took it, part of her would follow me.
So. I want you to drink it. - What? - You want the power, don't you? That's how you're going to get it.
What's the crime? Well, the way she left, I thought she figured it out. The menu, sir. Crime. Isn't that what you call it around here?
His brother ... damaged his corneas with radiation. Was he dying? And she put him out of his misery. But why leave the pin of his prosthesis there? Does she, does she have it with her?
But I still have to write my father's name. I just said that, but each tree will be different from the others. I have to write both parents' names, otherwise I'll get in trouble. You won't get in trouble for that. I want you to write it down.
One of her friends mentions this on her Facebook page. She said. "Is this the shot you want to use for your secret project?" question mark. "Is it sexy/dirty enough?" question mark. I mean, what kind of project is it, Nathan? Well, if it's a secret project, that's probably why I don't know about it.
Ah, over there, please. What do we have here? I haven't seen chicken like this since before rationing. Lady, if the food is no good, we're sorry. We'll take it away.
What do we have here? I haven't seen chicken like this since before rationing. Lady, if the food is no good, we're sorry. We'll take it away. No, please leave it.
For security. There is a Soviet empire. Stalin needs an eastern port. He had his eyes on Karachi. Now he will not have it.
-Yeah, I'll be fine. What are you going to do? I think I'll read a book or something else. Calculus is the mathematics of change. It doesn't necessarily predict the future, but it does indicate it.
You have been chosen because of your physical advantages that you have benefited from. With your natural gifts and our determination, we will do great things. Something perfect. The "Coagula" method is a man-made miracle. Our order has been developing it for many, many years ... and it has only recently been perfected ... by the blood of my blood.
My hammer. The one I used to use to kill. Now it's blunt, but... The secret to keeping it clean is to use it. Yes, the blood feeds it. It makes it shine.
- Brilliant. Nina's intelligence is endangered. They could offer Jordan the role of Ed. Kill Me. Maybe he won't get it. We both know that if Jordan wants it, he will get it.
- What? What? - Do you want some ice cream? - No. Especially if you eat it.
No one can come between two sisters, right? So. I'm in. I would love to. I guess I'm already home then. Besides, the apartment is Regina's, and I'd feel bad if I took it for us, while Daphne would have to ... Pay for a place off campus.
It's five kilometers of torture. Where is the fun? To call it fun is Orwellian. Why do you care if I don't come? Who else would call it Orwellian?
I don't believe it. You were late twice this week. Now you lose the first quarter. Sorry, I didn't know I was going to be late. Jess, if you have a problem, come to me and we'll work it out.
You can stop time whenever you want for as long as you want, when you unlock others, you are stuck for three times that time. Did you read that in a book? No, I made it up. For real life situations where you would like to have a super power. If you had a super power, what would you use it for?
He may have some. I'll show you. Okay, here's the first one. Pass it through the other side with your hand like this. Then you take the ring upstairs, pass it down here, up and back through, and finally...
I ... am not a farmer. I need ... help. No, trust me. I saw a wild blueberry bush outside. If it's young enough, I'll rip it out so we can replant it here.
The difference is that we have no money or nice stuff except a stroller. What else do we need? You're being an asshole. You haven't understood anything. Explain to me, then. The stroller costs a thousand dollars and we can't afford it. And, having it, it seems like a sham.
If I'm going to derive information from the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you'd better give me a decent brainer." I might as well order you some pancakes, since I don't intend to leave this part of my brain. Oh, I think you do. The alternative is to relax the cerebellum.... Shoney's. or the 9000 Series will beat it to a pulp.
- Where are you? - On the workbench, Morty. Are you invisible and farting in my face? Turn the pickle over. Why? After I touch it will you tell me it's an alien penis, like?
Now you're killing me. I have to go to Phoenix tomorrow morning. I'll be back Thursday night. But there's the show, and it's the premiere.... So... I'll watch it when I get back.
No one will buy any painting. I don't mean no one at all. I mean none of you. No family member can buy a work. I don't want to know about your ponchos of your purchases made out of pity. If you like a painting, I'll give it to you for free.
Holding a grudge... I don't want any more of this. So. I'll give you the stamp. No, you won't give it to me.
- Officer Myerson. If you need a little work done over the weekend, - give us a call. Do you have my card? - Yes, sir. Just hold on to it.
The reason I wanted to show you this picture, though, is that my life changed that year. When I was nine years old in school, I did an essay on what I wanted to be when I grew up. And I wrote that I wanted to be a janitor, because my father was a janitor in the municipality. And I loved my father. I got an A+ for that essay. I brought it home all proud, but when I gave it to my father, he tore it up in front of my eyes and said:
In fact, you name the price. - Really? - Absolutely. I have...no idea where it is. And, even if I found it, I would never sell it -- to someone like you.
Okay, boy. Here we go. We're off. Sir, you forgot your backpack. Oh. Thank you. 2 If I forgot it, I was fifty thousand dollars poorer.
I want to ... pick up where Anne left off. And here's her office. We'll have it set up this afternoon. Is there a key? No, but we'll get it unlocked as soon as possible.
This is the best day of my life! Well, Keith. This is the golden rope to riches. Pernell. God has done everything to show you the way. But for some reason, you are not listening to him. So, we've gathered your family and friends here. Those who are left, at least. They are here to show you -- that if you choose the wrong path -- you will walk it -- alone.
Well, I'm sure of that. I don't see how I could say no -- even though I would like to very much. Thank you very much, that's very kind of you. What should I do with the check? Mail it to 6325 Quiet Oak Highway -- in Trumbe, Connecticut, zip code 06614.
I will. Thank you. You will be pleased. And you will be disappointed. Just because I believe in the merits of the agreement doesn't mean I'm any less concerned that they won't abide by it.
Who knew I was coming to New York? - No one. - Nobody? Then who knew about our meeting in the West Bank? The Israelis suspected it-but only one other person knew for sure.
I will be tried for embezzlement by my own company, which I created when I was 24. My family ... now no longer speaks to me. This morning, I ... was sitting in a park ... a place where I spent the best times of my life, when my son, who is half Vietnamese, was little ... and I was sitting there watching a young man build all by himself ... a beautiful sand castle. And then he got up ... he assumed a truncated attitude and destroyed it ... turning it into mere grains of sand.
I thought they had departed, you know? Along with all the others. I never even considered looking for them. If only... I took the crucifix from the chapel and carried it out there....
Excuse me. Okay, go back and pass again. - Have a good trip. - Thank you. Give it back to me!
But you said we were supposed to be in Miracle on the 14th. In fact, we will be back by then. But there is one man, very special, and he has to be here with us, but he is in Melbourne. And because of this unexpected event, he has stayed in Australia. He is stuck. God has placed an obstacle in our path, but He wants us to overcome it.
Even that took a long time. But I was able to find him, and I asked him to build another machine, he already knew how to do it anyway. And he asked me, after I got that far, why I wanted to go back. And I told him that that was not my place. So he built it.
But I think they will try to do it again, but somewhere else. So what? Is that supposed to comfort me in any way? They told me there are no leads. We don't know where the hell they are. And you're telling me that my wife is going to die tragically, and everybody is going to see that.
And they doubt more and more every day that you are anywhere near a solution. But I have a far worse fear. I have a fear that they understand what your solution really is. I know you want to hand that slave girl over to Flint and his cimarron allies in exchange for the pirate gem chest. As shamelessly as you reached this agreement, did you really believe that no one would find out, that I would not find out?
Just to keep up appearances? And did you refuse? Why would you do that? I remember the day I met Eleanor, I was fascinated by her. She was a woman who spoke clearly, who was not afraid of the world or the men who ruled it.
All right? We found it. I don't see the chest. There are tracks starting from about 200 meters away. He dragged it all the way here.
- First. - He wants a meeting. And he wants it... - And I want it face... Face to face. - Is that all? - And he wants it...
And he wants it... - And I want it face... Face to face. - Is that all? - And he wants it... And I want it without old Milt invading my head.
VIAGRA Because of this, two billion dollars worth of these tablets are sold every year. Because through them you get the assurance-that when the time is right you will know how to be ready. Some of you use them. There is no shame in using the little blue pill. But if I threw this bottle among you now, no one would catch it.
What are you talking about? My old roommate wants to go on a hunger strike. She shouldn't have to endanger her life to get justice. Of course not. It's the first time I've heard that.
I never thought about that, I assure you. - So why didn't you tell me? - Because you were so stressed! About your team and regionals! Travis, wait! Did you show Travis the tattoo? It just appeared out of the blue -- I wasn't expecting it.... How did you do it, did you wave it in front of him?
- All right, officer. Ma'am. Can I have your scope? Your rifle sight. I promise I'll give it back to you.
- Guys. - I'm shocked, officer. I'll tell you what. If you solve the mystery, Agatha Christie style, you come back here and tell me who did it. In the meantime, why don't you take that butt and shove it up your ass?
Yeah. I can relate to that myself. And -- I should have told you last night, but you know, she's got so much to lose, and I'm -- I'm like, you know, I'm going to have to do it. Anyway, her phone is in my fucking car, you know? And if anybody finds it...
A group of military intelligence men and then... Engineers? Who knows? Maybe... It's some kind of coordinated terrorist attack. Turn here. I'm doing you a favor. I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday.
Full house? But... - Of course there is no one here. - There's no room. There's not even a car parked out here. We have a dress code here, and you don't abide by it.
Ah, the food here is a treat. Let's take a seat. Does that mean anything to you? It means "bond." I guess the additional traits enchant the dagger -- to kill me instantly, in case I break it.
I wasn't saying right now, but yes. Marn, call me back, okay? I have a real problem, in real life. Please. - Rice. - I know it's a tradition to throw rice, but I don't want them to throw it because the pigeons eat it, and I heard that then they die, and I don't want that on my conscience, right?
In our time, I was a fool. Here, I'm an amateur. - Stop that right now, John. - Do you know that here you can walk into a store and buy a rifle or a pistol, completely legally? These people promote that.
Okay, lie down. He said to put the stethoscope under the beaker to amplify the sound. Anything? This is not the appropriate instrument -- I'm -- I'm not a doctor, I'm not -- I'm reasoning with my usual.... So, you don't hear it?
Yes! Bones, are you ready? Almost. Come on, you'll be fine. Come on, come on -- they close the institute for a few weeks, that's all. They clean it up, put it back together and it will be better than before.
- He survived the explosion. Okay... Why do you have a broken watch? It stopped when the bombs went off. When the lab reopens, I will hang it in my office, to remember, forever.
Don't be so hard on yourself, Daisy. So far your work here has been perfectly adequate. If I had to give you a grade, I would give you a full B. - Yes. But I can do an A+ job, she knows that.
- What? Why? As an author, I can understand my audience and everything I need to know about my future as a speaker was -- evident in Aubrey's attitude today. She doesn't really have a poker face. Also, someone else reminded me that ... my work has already moved a lot of people ... no matter how you read it.
- I made you angry. - Of course I'm angry! You underwent a major operation without telling me! Wait. They found a body, they're taking it to the lab.
The right word is "space." It's a great sport... Bones, it's hugely important and let's face it, it's much more interesting than golf. I suppose the muscle groups involved in wielding an axe are the same ... used to move a golf club. You've been playing with it for four years and you still call it a stick.
- Booth, Booth, Booth, stop! No! A good axe blow requires... - Are you kidding? First we find the radius of the log--and divide it by 1.25.
You don't buy a four-carat diamond for a friend. Four carats. A very expensive ring. Do you know if Helga ever received it? Even if she did, she will never find it.
Speaking of secrets, I just met Tim Sullivan, is he a figment of my imagination or is there some history? Tell me all about it. That was Clark. So the fragment found in the victim is -- a piece of animal bone. It looks like he was wearing it.
Man, what are you doing? Get that food off my car. That's a nice set of tools you've got. Is there blood on that wrench? I don't know who the hell you think you are, man, but if you don't get it off, there's going to be a lot more blood on this tool.
A study of the effects of superhuman strength on the skeleton." Great idea, Hodgins. But, to write that paper I would need the bones of the Hulk, - and since the Hulk doesn't exist.... - Trust me, the committee will eat it up!
And people who are afraid can do unthinkable things. Who is there? Who are you? Someone who has been doing this work much longer than you have, but also someone who recognizes real talent when they see it.
You will be safe three thousand miles away. I'm here to guide you. Not to force you-or spur you on. - But to guide you. - We can't leave. - Who are you? - Someone who recognizes real talent when he sees it.
And I will go alone. Your call surprised me. One of us had to call the other. I need a tissue sample from a body. I was hoping you would do it for me.
More or less. More or less? Maybe you should see it for yourself. - That's not just a dead body. - You heard it too, didn't you?
- Yes, Dr. Hale, put him right. So, I think we're going to have to pull his intestines out. - Pull -- pull it out of his body? - Yes, to find the cut and sew him up. And then we put it back in and close it up.
A.D. It's my turn. You didn't sleep either? No, I was waiting for that phone to start screaming again. But did you hide it? If Caleb finds it ...
Who is it? It's you. And how long have you been ... The game appeared shortly after it happened at the school for the blind. We hid it at Spencer's.
The locker? Yes, I think that's what you said. Look, we've tried this a million times. Has it ever worked? It only needs to work once. Hanna leaves it there and we'll see who comes to pick it up.
- No. - No. No one has to talk about this matter with Ali. Did you see the book yourself? Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it. Where is it now?
He tries to throw me off. There is an even bigger code encrypted in the eyes. What does it say? I don't know yet. But with all the computing power I'm using, we'll find out very soon.
- What stories? - What stories? - No, it's the truth. - Jack didn't want to have sex. Well, he does with me.
What...? What is that noise? Do you guys hear it? How strange, it's like there's... Come on, that you want it.
Those two liters of water I made you drink. We have to get you to sweat them out, and then we'll adjust your vitamin levels -- to normalize your glucose levels. - Boy, you really know your stuff. It's just basic human physiology. Today we're going to clean out your body and tomorrow we're going to rebuild it.
It has no nutrients. It's excess calories. However, when you eat sugar, you don't get inflammation right away. When you eat sugar, you don't get plaque in your vessels. When you eat sugar, the body will store most of it as glycogen or burn it as calories.
Alice thinks they are intimidation gestures to get her to sell. There was a suspicious arson at the Wyatt farm around Easter. "Alice Wyatt blames her sister's boyfriend, Ryan Campbell." Apparently we have the ranger raft, a fishing boat found it. - They're taking it to us.
I saw what you are planning. Your mind must be sicker than I thought...if you're willing to risk the lives of all the people here--no one excluded--just to destroy a single man. The only life that matters is Henry's. And he will kill us from first to last to protect him. This man's brain is at the mercy of a demon -- rotting him from the inside out.
Yes, it was Grandma Davenport's. She had written her name on it. She was reading it to her students the year the Titanic sank. Yikes. And Mom read it to me.
And you will pay for it. He didn't mention my backyard. Well, your garden is part of your yard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn. It goes with the house, Mom. Well, I think you have to mention it by name, in case some dirty judge decides to play tricks.
Because our ... sisters secured the places that gay men had before our lives were ripped away. That was before I got the package. When... A doctor in Texas told him to... Start writing a will. He always said that when he got sick he would do it all by himself. I'm writing to tell you that Ricardo died. He would have wanted you to have these things. He didn't want you to see him.
Anytime. I am asking you to help cancel the demonstration on our part. We need to show that we have integrated. Have you noticed that they put corn syrup everywhere now? I avoid it by making my own powdered milk.
- We all feel guilty. - Yeah. Think about what that means. Not just for you, but for Wes. Someone killed him, set the body on fire, and then stole it!
Previous episodes of How to Get Away with Murder. Someone killed him, set his body on fire, and then stole it!
I don't know why you don't want to try my resolution to stay positive. I assure you that it helps. For example--I don't see this glass as half empty, I see it as half full. - But it's completely empty. - But I see it as half full.
Here, have a drink? In fact, no. Better not. Better not. You're underage and you might have the drinking gene. Sometimes I can sense it.
I hate to say it, but this file contains only dead ends. There is absolutely nothing in it. There has to be something. Look, I don't want Paul to have died in vain, but we have to approach this whole thing differently. Read it yourself.
Okay, which friend? He's at Patrick's house. What happened to your grandmother's ring? I'm such a fool. I took it off and secured it before the trip because I didn't want to lose it, then when I looked for it on the way back, it was gone.
I won't hold out any longer. You find a puppy yowling on the street, - what do you do? A... - No! you run him over to make him stop.
Okay? Grace. Where did you get that? Grace, what the fuck are you doing? It's Karma's pendant, she never takes it off.
I'm not smart enough. I'm not smart enough. - Hey, hey, hands off. - No, no, it's not your fault. Okay, plan B. If we take the remote, he can't do anything with it. So we steal it from this dandy asshole, knock him out with a jolt, and get the hell out of there.
- You don't know that, Clary. You don't know that. Jace... Join me...and my son! Together we can rid the world of the Demons that infest it!
They control their impulses. Are you talking about Lucian Graymark, sorcerers like Magnus Bane, and even ... Clarissa's Vampire friend Simon? No matter how good they try to be, the Hidden cannot control their demonic blood forever. If that blood is so evil, why did you administer it to me?
Do you have anything to say before we start? Facilis descensus Avernus. "Easy is the descent into hell." I'm glad you believe in the sacred Conclave motto. Alec and I use it to remind ourselves that we cannot be bent.
Is he okay? What happened? Alec. Someone stole my spell book. Are you putting up your barriers? No one leaves until I get it back.
Hey-what's going on? Are you handing out free booze? Apparently some Vampire is crazy about a new singer. See? Vampires recognize potential when they see it.
- He already knows that, Ray. - But yes! Well, have you figured it out? Well, I carbon dated the amulet that Sara took from Darhk in 1987. Before she returned it to the Legion of Doom, I guess.
Yeah. No, they're still here. No. I'm not wearing this dress. Arya, you were wearing it in the first part of the scene.
How are you doing? I almost died today. What? Are you okay? A car hit the cart while I was pushing it.
- Bosch. Anita was just now updating me on the Holland case.... Okay, I have to tell her. After today's events, I'm worried. Don't be.
I think he had distanced himself from everything and everyone. Did you see him often? Every first of the month. When he came to bring his check. The deal was this, I would cash it for him and that was it.
I am grateful that our marriage is... Recognized by the federal government. I know we don't need anyone's permission to love each other, but you know what? I'm glad I have the same rights as... Any straight couple. To no longer be excluded. To be protected by a law. We're in danger of having that right taken away from us, but boy, as long as we have it, I want to exercise it.
And, after one of the most embarrassing conversations of my life, Jesus got the green light to resume sexual activity, albeit with some restrictions. Well, thanks for the help, Dr. So. If we tell him, does that mean we're okay with him having sex? Well, he would do it anyway.
The thing is, he has no place to live, and if he doesn't take this job up north, he will have to live in his car. I think he's depressed. - Well, he might as well have told me. - He hoped he could come up with something. Anyway, he has a new number, and he wanted me to give it to you.
Black or Hispanic, not very tall, lots of tattoos.... What do you want us to do? Do we hand the phone over to Cynthia? No no no. Call me from that phone so the number will show up on mine. Then I want you to delete the call log and put it back where it was. Okay?
Military people tend to be people of habit. If he is using a prepaid, he will be using the same model he used in the US. And he will be the only one making calls to Markovians. Walker's cell phone is an old model. The only network that supports it here is Detralink DST.
- Edlund lost his entire family. On the Internet, Edlund was an avowed supporter of the RASC. - What is it? - It is the Star City Weapons Registry. The previous city administration took it down.
- The prosecutor came to me and... - Are you referring to Adrian Chase? That's right. He asked me to review the report to point to the Ninja Star Killer as the culprit. This report. And she went ahead and signed it, even though she knew it was false, and then turned it over to the police.
Okay, all right. Listen. I appreciate what you're doing, but I'm fine. Mr. Mayor, with all due respect, your head is bleeding, and our trauma protocol is stricter than the NFL's. Well, I am the mayor. So I'm suspending him.
It must have been me. What do you have? When my sonic scream hit the Vigilante, it broke off a small piece of his visor. It seems to be covered with some kind of circuitry. That means it's industrial. Maybe I can trace it back to where he bought it.
Yes. Thank you. So what's going to happen? Are you referring to what I'm going to do with your secret? I'm not going to reveal it.
Fortunately, I saw the document they are working on. Orekhovo-zuyevo. It is a shipyard in Moscow. Then we'll go there. Let's stop Kovar before he retrieves it.
But first I have a gift for you. This tattoo of yours. Being an American and being named captain in the Bratva, you must have done something extraordinary. When you look at it, it must -- it must remind you of that victory. Now, when you look at it, you will think of the time we spent here together and the secret you confessed to me.
I will see you later. Ah, the pain. It has a certain charm, doesn't it? Some would do anything to avoid it. Others would accept it, even adore it, like you.
How is it that hunting pigeons will help me with my training? You're not hunting them. You are tracking them. The main purpose of this lesson is concentration. Now trace this egg to the bird that laid it.
- It's about the queen. - If you've come to tell me she's made a deal with Valentine, I already know. Wait. Izzy found the opening through which the demons enter. And of course you want me to close it.
- I don't know, Tony, you tell me. I...I'm worried about you. I'm worried about you getting sick again. I'm not getting sick again, Tony. Just because I don't see the world exactly the way you do or the way Elise does.
- So, it was 1958, '59? - More or less. - Did Mr. Walker ever tell you the name of the teacher? - No. Or if he told me, I don't remember.
And I knew--when I saw her shining like a diamond in the rough in this receptacle of immorality--that I had to free her from the cruel condition to which she had been condemned by this heartless city. You are ... a righteous and devoted man, Judge Hathorne. I am, yes. - And you don't decide when you find love. - And we have found it.
Mary doesn't love you. Stop tormenting me, mother! You and your sister have made the same mistake. Lower beings mix their own blood to remove impurities, but Marburg blood is already as pure as it gets. And that is why we never dilute it.
You made a terrible mistake. I really would have loved you forever. But you remained faithful to a man totally unworthy of you. How did you imagine the future with John Alden? I can see it clearly.
Take it from me -- a fool can recognize an equally foolish road. And you are going down it! - Give it up! - And give up my kingdom on Earth? No. But I would share it with you.
Tell the bearded women I will go. She called the publisher about the book pages, she is six months behind. Do you know what it's like to be an ex-president? It's like being a man's nipple. Everyone avoids it and would rather jerk off.
Remember. The only reason Gilfoyle and I stayed up for 48 fucking hours straight was to reduce the server load, not to keep it at the same level. Technically, the reason we stayed up was to maximize the possibility of having a million users, and that's what I did. Because--who wouldn't want a 10 percent image improvement? Who wouldn't want that?
Technically, the reason we stayed up was to maximize the possibility of having a million users, and that's what I did. Because-who wouldn't want a 10 percent image improvement? Who wouldn't want that? Anyone. Anyone wouldn't want that!
Mom. You should sleep, Sam. The dead don't sleep. "Legends of the Long Night. The Targaryens used dragon glass to decorate their weapons, without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
What are you talking about, dear? About when you're happy. When you really are. Meaning. you stop to take ... a picture, and you focus more on taking it than on being happy. Finally, for a moment ... you are.
Kevin. how's it going with your wife? Am I going to see her at a meeting one of these nights? I don't know. She still makes me stay in a hotel, since Nathan was born. And today -- I found out she had a rash and hadn't told me.
May I be frank with you? You're welcome. We wanted the bishop to perform the wedding. He married my sister and her husband, and people -- they still talk about that sermon. They still quote it on Facebook.
You interviewed Sheriff Platt about a witness in the Joey Campbell case and reported it to higher-ups. What on earth came into your mind? It occurred to me that he would report it to the higher-ups. I don't have the power to expose Joey Campbell's case to him independently. So you got the sheriff to put it on the record.
I wanted to turn around and go back, but my curiosity got the better of me. So I decided to go toward him, only the closer I got ... the more I felt him moving away. I finally decided to turn back, but I had gone so deep into the moors ... that I could no longer find my way home. I wandered three hours in the dark without finding anything familiar. But then I remembered what my grandmother had told me about leprechauns. So. I ignored my hunger, took out the bread ... placed it on a moss-covered rock ... and lay down to sleep next to it.
This is an exaggeration. People love to invent scandals. But it was by murder that he ended up in Arkham, a criminal asylum. I saved the city from the lunatic, Theo Galavan. Some call it murder -- some call it public service.
Yet they all failed. I think you are the first person in the world who goes on a killing rampage to find a life master. What if I leave the puzzles alone? No. A good riddle--reveals the one who asks for it.
Are you hungry? Are you buying? Try it. That will be the logo of my novo locale. What are we going to call it?
Okay. You failed, no one came to your opening. Don't stop there. Greatness takes time. And you know. If a lace is knotted, patience will free it.
Iris, your mother -- she left something behind. She left a son, wonderful and brave. And the woman I love. All right? I don't know what the future holds, no one knows. But I do know that we will face it together.
- Why did you lure him here? - For you. I... need your help. Help? You ask in a strange way.
I forgot, I have... Scheduled a dinner with. Gold Brothers president next week. Hey. Did the three-diamond bracelet ever come back from the jewelry store? I should probably wear it to the dinner. Yeah, no. I checked the other day and it was still being tightened. But it's been a couple of days, so I'll check again.
Unless you pity me. No, thank you. I'm trying to help you, Jake. - I don't... - I don't want you to solve my problems. And if I got the job, I'd take it. - Come on.
Jordan, you lied to me. - Where are you? - I'm in Austin. It's just an interview. And if I got the job, I would take it.
I intend to find a way to make them pay. And since our only weapon is on the way to Paris. - The tuning fork? - It is actually called the Staff of Arcadius. Cade's enemies forged it from the fire that killed him.
Alive. - But we have run out of options. - There has to be another way. This is the way. I can't stand it either, Bonnie.
- What does it matter to you? - Matt had visions because of that journal, and then you show up looking for him. Coincidence? I don't think so. So why don't you tell us the real reason why you want him?
I don't think so. So why don't you tell us the real reason why you want it? All right. I have about six hours before Cade kills Stefan unless I give him that book. - Why does he want it?
- Why does he want it? - I don't know. But if it will save my brother's life, - I don't care. - I'm sorry. You won't give the devil what he wants if you don't know why he wants it.
Winchester. I'm -- my name is... My... My--my name is... Gideon Loughlin's address was in the counselor's book. If the book is there, I will find it.
No. There will be a cure. There is always a cure, and we will find it. - How? - We're going to capture Ramiel. And we kick his ass until he tells us.
Everyone ... in that room, was logically focused ... on sending you back to the cage, using my mother's spell. Everyone except yours truly. Now, Rowena! I was able to change the spell. Thus, your essence was not sent back to the cage. You see, we found your old abandoned vessel a few years ago, repaired it, improved it, thus making it a perfect and permanent home for the real you.
Will it be the panel? Is it dead? - Yes, a long time ago. It was a ghost. - The salt just slowed it down.
You see, I didn't choose this place because of its ... atmosphere. Obviously. This? It's a fortress. No one gets in here without me knowing about it.
Dean. the extraction of Grace. The spell to track him didn't work, right? But the extraction ritual ... - did. - So? What if Cass used it with Kelly's baby?
Let's say -- a hole in reality leading to an apocalyptic world? Make it 11. It fits. You don't have to worry. The child has opened the portal and will close it.
Listen, I was wondering, here's -- if I drop in, say in half an hour or so, would that be okay? I need to borrow the old laptop. Why? It's got some files on it that I need at school. I'll bring it back to you later.
Who sent her the flowers, Trish? I don't know. They left them on the door. There's a card. - Do you mind if we take it?
Let me see your phone, Mark. Why? Just do it. You think I'm stupid? You record me, you give it to the police as new evidence.
She bought a train ticket, she wants to leave. I asked her not to, begged her not to. She said she would sleep on it and let me know. Do you know what I would do? I would tear up the ticket, put it in my pocket, go to work and that's it!
- Overcrowded by my people. - I'm trying to change that. My Education Program is the first step to break the cycle. You can't deny that. I am not denying it.
Much, much worse. Whoever they are. But at least there seems to be nothing missing. Apparently you arrived shortly after he did. He was looking for Jesse's phone and the video. - What makes you think that?
What is it? I wish he'd stop seeing me as his second chance with Joey. Hey, little trotter. I'm wearing your bracelet. I never take it off.
- I lost it. - What, Breeland made a report. Assault on officer and drunk driving. - But did that really happen? - No, but it doesn't matter. - He's going to tell the judge, and then it's over.
Mr. Leonard. Did you know that "Wright" comes from archaic English? It means "wood carver." And here I thought it meant "adulterer." I'm intrigued that he doesn't know the meaning of his last name, considering he chose it.
This is Scarlett O'Connor Peabody, sir, reminding you to respect your manners -- and to always speak frankly. You certainly have a wonderful voice. Thank you. Don't worry, pumpkinhead. Well, the job is yours if you want it.
- He owns the Smokey Joe's - on Highway 9, Pa. - Yeah. I never really liked that place. But really? You know, the Commercial Appeal people might disagree. They named it the best barbecue six years in a row.
- Yes, I am an idiot. I left my wallet on the bedside table in the hotel. - I'm sorry, I really am. I don't know what to do. - Call someone and have them bring it.
- Can you talk? Yes. Thank you for getting my phone back, although I would have preferred you to bring it to me. It didn't seem too smart to me. Did anyone at the station see that you had it?
- But it's not my birthday. - Yes, it is. - My birthday reminders are perfect. - Okay, it was but it's not anymore. I don't like having a birthday, so I avoid it.
I had to check with Dr. Hamza to be able to confirm. Leo, he has neurocysticercosis. A parasitic worm has gotten into his brain. It is relatively safe as long as he stays alive, but if he dies, it can become quite dangerous, so we have to move fast. It is likely that he had it before he went to Malawi.
Do you know why they broke up, really? It certainly wasn't because he wasn't doing well in bed. It was because he wasn't doing well on stage. Heavens, Gary was a piece of wood. Just as Bette realized her marriage was coming to an end, she took him on tour.
"The Early, Murky Years of Joan Crawford." And it's been under lock and key in my desk drawer since 1946, the last time you went to Louella behind my back. As I told you even then, Hedda, it was not I who told Louella about my divorce with Philip. No, it was she who came to me. And you confirmed it.
Really? Let's call it the fallacy of sunk costs. So what about now? Now? Now we... We take that plea deal, and we shove it up Chuck's ass.
- We are asking a lot of you... And if you don't feel like testifying -- maybe you should let it go. I don't. I'm the only one who can adequately explain the context of that tape. Otherwise, the defense will tear it to shreds.
No, I am the one who is heard. But I have questions, for example about the tape recorder. It must have hurt like hell to touch it. There was some discomfort, I admit. And where had you hidden it?
They all came here willingly to support their advocate. Jimmy McGill went to the aid of people who otherwise might not have seen a lawyer in their lifetime. He devoted his time to making sure that their wills really reflected their wishes, at rates they could afford, because Jimmy McGill cares so much about people. He devoted the last three years of his life to his brother's health. Waking up at 5:00 a.m. to buy Charles' favorite newspaper from the only newsstand in town that sells it.
Let us do something. Just show us and tell us what to do. All right... How about emptying one of those packages into the wheelbarrow? And you... You fill that bucket to the brim with water. And then you empty it little by little while he mixes it with a hoe.
And after then, every day after school I check the box. You know, if something catches my eye, I stick it in the box and put it up there. And it's a good thing they were supposed to bring good luck. It's outrageous that they lost this place. They never should have even bought it.
But not now. "Baby Jane" was my last chance. Maybe not. I read a beautiful script today with a fantastic role for her. Pauline brought it home.
Go to the club and have a drink, you're having a heart attack. Zack Thomas is intent on getting his hundred thousand dollars back from Joe Jarrett. This is the movie. If every scene shows Zack getting a foot massage, the audience will never understand his ambition! People know what I want. And they also know that I get it effortlessly.
- Really? - I want a big signing bonus. Jack Warner falsified the accounts for Baby Jane. I want my fee up front. When I take a payment after the fact, I end up taking it right there.
This is the time for detour, and this awl ... Is what will make you choose. Are you going to read tarot cards to her next? Do you happen to have... - Even a crystal ball? - Well, it depends on how she responds. Now, if I stick it -- here -- you won't be able to walk except with a stick.
Do you happen to have... - Even a crystal ball? - Well, it depends on how it responds. Now, if I stick it -- here -- you won't be able to walk except with a stick. But if I stick it--here--you won't be able to walk at all. - If, on the other hand, I stick it here...
Now I really have to go... But come on, wait, let's have breakfast together. It's just that... I thank you, but I really have to go. But...did Scottie happen to leave you my number? Yes, she gave it to me. Why?
I hope everyone is. I really regret that I had to resort to such extreme measures. You can't take the company back by force. You need our consent. Right, and if I don't get it, I'm ready to leave, only after you hear what Dr. Whitehall has to say.
Okay, I fell for it. What's funny about it? - You're not going to kill him. - Really? I've already given the order. And now you're going to cancel it.
My, what is that noise? It sounds like a saw cutting a bone in two. That's right. You'll get used to it, I-I don't even hear it anymore!
That perhaps that victory-no matter how small. represented freedom. I was soon reminded ... again and again ... that there is no triumph under conditions of slavery. Only respite. We blacks know pain. We have known it for a long time.
That fire for freedom ... is not something that can be ... fueled in people. And the embers are not enough. Once, I saw a fire -- when I was a little girl. I was with my father, I had it there in front of me. I stared at it for a long time, and to this day I can barely describe it.
I've been thinking a lot about forgiveness lately. And I think, to say that you forgive somebody is like admitting that you no longer have power over their mistakes. That the only thing you can do is give in, forget, or even.... Kill yourself. But now I have the power, and I... I don't forgive. You know I wanted to.
The shelter is back to the river. From the windows we check the only entrance. And there is a little boat if we need to escape. Harriet helped me with the return plan. If we follow it, we'll get out of here safely.
Jason and Cheryl Blossom drove to the Sweetwater River for a morning boat ride. Are you scared, Jason? What we know for sure happened next is that Dilton Doiley, who was leading the Riverdale Boy Scouts on a bird watching expedition, ran into Cheryl on the riverbank. Jason. Riverdale police searched the river for Jason's body.... But they never found it.
It's Jason's number. It's yours now. Sophomores play among the starters. There's a spot on the first team this year. From what you've shown us. I want you to take it.
My goodness. Wearing what? The ring, Polly. That ring... It's been in the Blossom family for generations. you must always keep it close to your heart.
- What do you mean? Ah, nothing. Just that I had a word with our director/presenter and reminded him that he had heard you sing on several occasions. Even if it compromised my artistic integrity.... To cut to the chase, you have a spot if you want it.
You have to do what is necessary, regardless of the consequences. - Don't let yourself. - I'm already doing it, Olivia. My job. - I'm protecting this place. - No. You are destroying it.
And then you found this. Your mother's earring? No, Em. It's your mother's earring. Norma kept it, I don't know why.
Have you noticed something strange -- in Jules? Now that you mention it, he always sneezes three times in a row. No. Do you know how much I've been working on the article of attacks? Yes, you point it out to me every 12 seconds.
- Yes, him. They let him go. So your article says. That there's a vigilante on campus. That's so cool. I can't wait for you to read it.
Chin up. You're in Montgomery, Zelda. You're at a dance. At a country club. You bought that dress. Specially for the occasion. E... Even if your mom doesn't like it, you know. That the boys love it.
Did I tell you he's wearing a headset? - I'm going to go watch TV. - E'... See, it does the same thing to you as it does to me. It doesn't fit in this office. And I know how much you love it.
See, it's a priceless family heirloom. Didn't he buy you a ring? Yes, he bought it for me. He bought it back from the pawn shop I sold it to. That's the sweetest thing, because he knew how much it meant to me. Well, if it meant that much to you, you probably wouldn't have sold it.
Jerrod, look at your skin. You should be furious for now. Enjoy your appetite. Damn, that bread looks hot. - Do you think they make it at home?
You should be furious for now. Enjoy your meal. Damn, that bread looks hot. - Do you think they make it at home? - Of course they make it at home.
Sensitivity? - Gosh, what does that mean? - The quacking... Senseless of a tavern rat. Your hair is brave, but your humor.... Is dull. Boring as an old bore, your rhymes are a nightmare! Your humor is so stale that not even worms would eat it.
No. There's some nutty hippie crap written on there. Where? On that paperweight. My father-in-law gave it to me for Christmas.
I shouldn't have let her eat the whole cake. - Can you hold on for a second? - Sure. She was insatiable. What if instead of doing it in the program ... we did it on Snapchat?
Then we make some jokes and we're done. Great rehearsal, guys. I really appreciate you agreeing to attempt the banter exchange. - Well, I'm a team player. - But do you mind if we try it?
And of course, not only your clothes to go home, but also the baby's travel clothes. Do we have any seamstresses or seamstresses in our ranks today? I am a seamstress. I sew clothes for me and my husband. I am certainly not a fashion expert.... since I wear a uniform most of the time ... but it's fair to say that the right clothing is ... as important as the event for which you wear it?
Let me introduce you to your daughter. Let's go. I have longed for this child, Patrick. I wished for him, I prayed for him to come. And now I wonder why my prayers were answered -- because I don't know in what world we'll deliver him.
It is really very interesting. Do you know who built this channel? - No. - Napoleon. He built it ... in 1802 ... to bring drinking water into the city because there had been a cholera epidemic.
Centuries of peace and prosperity with a Targeryen sitting on the throne of swords and a Stark ... serving as Protector of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the promise your ancestors made to mine. Kneel and I will appoint you guardian of the North. Together we will save the country from those who wish to destroy it.
These same people spit on my sister not long ago. And if you were to betray us, they would like to see your head stuck on a pike. Or yours. After all, they really like severed heads. Look -- if you have any advice for me, I will gladly listen to it.
We are such golden roses. Your brother and his new queen thought you would defend Casterly Rock. Well, the truth is that Casterly Rock is not worth much anymore. It's worth a lot to me, but my? good childhood memories are not going to help Cersei stay on the throne. So you let them take it?
Stranger things have happened. Such as? The barns have been emptied and the contents are in the carriages, my lord. - And the new crop? - Teams are harvesting it from all the farms on the Plateau.
That I have come to destroy your cities. To burn your homes, to kill you and leave your children orphaned. That is Cersei Lannister, that is not me. I am not here to kill. I only want to destroy that wheel that continues to bend rich and poor for the sole benefit of the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Kneel down and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it.
My lady. The last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow. The last time I was here you killed my son with the High Fire. There is a path to the left that runs along the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it.
Since when is my mother dating Tom? Something doesn't add up. I declare the meeting of the Shadow Wedding Planners open. As you all know well, it is our duty to control every aspect of this wedding in great secrecy. Together, we will transform it from a trendy youth event into a normal, traditional wedding. Where everything is normal and enjoyable.
My grandfather told me about it when I was a little boy. He was from Europe. He brought some of these old ideas with him. In those days they weren't afraid of the unknown. They just stared at it.
And to his brother Luke. Their patience... Their ardent faith in our Lord has not gone unnoticed. But one question remains... But a question remains. Even with the gift of the second chance... When on earth did you buy a phone? Incoming call from: Just... turn it off!
You are definitely taller. I have a tall daughter! Oh, there. The door was open. I spent all weekend installing the double cylinder, but if you don't lock it....
You know, our moms began to talk less and less ... as the years went by. But ... there's one night I'll never forget. Your mom -- she called mine the night you were born. They talked for a while and then ... when my mom hung up the phone she was beaming. She pulled out this...cupcake...that must have been there for a week and.... went looking for a candle, but we didn't have any, so she took a match and stuck it on.
I talked to the practice manager. If you want the internship back, you have to apologize to Ashley. - For what? Being honest? - If you want the job back, you have to do it. You don't want it back? Fine.
It is not exactly in weightlessness. You saw a device that redistributes body weight. I don't care! Let me use one! I mean. I'd be grateful if you'd ... let me try it.
No. He won't bite you. He already has. I'm sorry. I'll tell you again.
- Yeah, that one. I can't even see what that has to do with anything. Look, the fact that you can't see what I mean is already part of the problem. Okay, Clay, I'm not saying it's not real. I'm just saying that people do it every day.
Are you okay? Is something wrong? Why did you tell him our business? He just asked if we were dating, and I told him the situation is complicated. Gunnar, I've made my peace with the past, but that doesn't mean I'm okay with other people knowing.
And I have to deal with it every day of my life. And sometimes that influences me and I -- I overreact to my husband and -- and my... and with business and I say things to my daughters that deep down I know will make them run away from me, but... I can't help it. Because that horror is all here, on the surface. And I don't want them to feel it. And I don't want them to think I feel it.
- What exactly does that mean? - Well, for Maddie, a midnight release. No press-no announcement. We won't have to beg the Slate reporters to mention us between the lines. No, no, no, we'll get it out on our own, all the columnists we know will talk about this magnificent song we just heard, and in the morning, they'll all come to us, man.
That's why I'm happy to do it, okay? But we were hoping to have your auction item here already. Kristi, I'm sorry. It completely slipped my mind. Because we usually write it in the program and...
No. Come on, you must know another way to get off the block. We could use a coyote. Do you know one? I know one, but you won't like it.
Farewell. Robert? Yes? Why don't you take that Kindle thing back? I'm never going to use it.
- Vanessa says Jake has spent every night away from home since the election. If we find out where he's been, we can start putting the pieces together. The day Jenny was killed, I picked up a satellite phone signal near the cabin. He's here somewhere. He bought a satellite phone and is using it.
Can we please avoid making a scene in public? We wouldn't have to make a scene if you listened to me. Let's start again. From your position, there will be no place for others, for affection. It is easy to talk before you have power, but then you get it.
Why? Now. All the satellite maps are blurry, but ... The boathouse... is here. And -- the village is up here, around here. They call it "Revival," that's all I know.
It's not a meme. - But it has a meme font.... - IT IS NOT. - Then what the hell is a meme? - You just know, - when you see it.
Act surprised at the show, okay? Amy, it's time for the risotto. Come. I need to find a replacement to write under the pseudonym Belinda Lacroix. - My writers won't do that.
- Oh, my goodness! Hi! - What's this? Nothing, my stupid diary. Audrey Gelman used to do that, too.
Why? What's going on? I love my work. - And I'm in danger of losing it. - You're not going to lose it.
War tends to put things in perspective. So how are you doing in your new position? It's challenging, but I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it. Of course, you are totally unsuited to the assignment. I don't say that to be cruel.
Room service, sir. I didn't order anything. It's from Adil... Mr. Joshi. He knew you were at work and thought you might like some coffee. - Would you like me to take it away, Mr. Hamilton?
It's the job. But I thought they relieved you of all charges. No. They are allowing me to continue the work, but they are watching me. Could you smile, please? You have a lovely smile, and I don't see it anymore.
It looks just like Delaware. You're right, it doesn't. Denise. Jane. This service is your idea. I didn't even want to do it.
La Large. Hey, do you know how to remove a cancerous testicle? No. A lot of people think they just amputate one of them, right? Actually, what they do is they make an incision just a hair higher, at which point, they go in, grab the testicle, pull it out of the scrotum, and then out of the actual body.
- I want to make a deal. No, guys. She is not lucid. One small consolation is that the bitch is with the Beast now and I don't see how it can end well for her. It means "bonding." I guess the additional traits enchant the dagger -- to kill me instantly, in case I break it.
Purple orchid, purple dress, purple vibrator. We are purple people. Okay, I love your product. I mean it, I love your product. Yes, people who try it love it.
Even if it were benevolent. The fear would remain -- that if we disobeyed, we would find ourselves without air, with water rationed -- ejected into space. Or herded into rooms to be used as animals. That's the way it has been until now. But not anymore. I stole your secret, Fred Johnson. And now I'm going to give it to the Belt.

When is your second interview? Mindy? Mindy? - Mindy, are you still there? - I actually haven't checked yet, because I don't want the job anymore since my life is already perfect. Actually, I hope someone else has it. #mindy
Your devotion to diversity is really touching. It's just what we need. Congratulations, the position is yours. How dare you? Stop trying to give the job to a white man. Dr. Lee deserves it.
I mean, look at these pictures. They look like the cast of a Clint Eastwood movie. Boy, Jody was right. - His picture would be perfect here. - Look, Mike, you were our first choice but... If you don't want the job then we'll give it to Dr. Ledreau.
The Cursed Twinning. I can't do it. I'm with the children. No. Eve will do it for me.
Not if it helps us. So how long have you had this mirror? For as long as I can remember. It was my mother's. I remember my father brought it here to the store for me to play with when my mother was in the hospital.
No, no, no! Leave it, I'll do it. I just don't want to destroy it until we know what happened. Yeah, that's... good. Let's put him where no one can see him until we find out what the hell happened to him.
"Human - Reptilian: Pathology, Diagnosis and Therapy." Of course, Bouyi's Vle. Bad smell, but it only harms scaly Wesen. Southern Grimms used it to lure Galenchidas from swampy marshes to catch and decapitate them.
- Hi. We just went to the medical examiner's office. There's a corpse full of an enzyme called hyaluronidase. It's found in the saliva of insects. We were hoping you knew a Wesen who uses it to kill his victims.
This will work. All right. The knife has to go through all our hands together. - And then what? - We pull it out -- and our blood must flow together into the vessel.
Or very angry. Maybe both. The pain would have been unbearable. And there's this strange postmortem indentation on his arm. - Do you see these marks running through it?
I don't think he's particularly enthusiastic, but -- mom said it's a perfect match so, I think he'll get used to it very soon. You've been a great friend to me, Drake, so... - I brought you a present. - Oh, no. Master Geoffrey, it is enough for me to have had your friendship. You can open it later if you like. I'll be offended if you don't take it.
I do not support bloodshed and anarchy. But freedom, equality, brotherhood. With these ideals I agree. Well, I have no intention to do that. No, the power has to be there, someone has to have it. And since man is not perfect, sometimes it is misused, but who is more likely to misuse it? The man who recently finds it within his grasp, like someone who has never tried alcohol before?
Is that right, Dean? When Gavin Jacobs found himself with his throat slit with a box cutter the laptop was on his desk. And whoever took it didn't throw it in the bathtub with the other things. No, his laptop didn't. They took it with them.
Who wants me, Nance? Who have you offended? Whose name is on my warrant? Look what was in front of the door, Ma. I would have sent it elsewhere, but it has curves that I would call unusual.
Mrs. Wells is breathing down my neck morning, afternoon and evening and I know I can do better. I assume that Wells owns the dress in which you are wrapped. What is your debt to her? I don't know, maybe five pounds? As an act of goodwill, I will pay it off.
And how do you like it. He loves Scott Joplin. Sit down. Listen, I understand you have a job to do. But don't do it today, okay?
I have to take care of some business matters. Harvey, come on, you're not leaving for work. It's time for you to leave it all behind. I've complained about the broken heater a million times. The owner always tells me he will fix it, but then he does nothing.
There must be something more important he can do than hold a door and say hello. It's not possible for every supermarket cashier to be in the Good Place. Super-market? It's a place where ordinary people go shopping. You don't know it.
You can't -- this story -- a lot of people have these clothes. Let's go. You said I have the right to remain silent. Do I really have to - answer these questions? - No. But you have to give us your phone. Put it on the table.
Let's go. You said I have the right to remain silent. Do I really have to - answer these questions? - No. But you have to give us your phone. Put it on the table. Open it, please, right now.
Get out, you pricks. You don't know what you're missing! That costume was really... Adherent. Taking it off must be a real shit, huh? Unless he never takes it off.
Oh, about the woman who was walking on the overpass. She was really lucky not to get run over. What about the child? Did she lose him? Did they find him?
Guys! - You made a lot of friends, huh? - I had heard that you were dead. So I organized a festoon in your honor. Just the fact that you called it a streamer makes me sick.
Bring the dogs here. They will kill themselves. - What do you want? - An office. When do I want it?
When they ask you to enter the year of birth, - you just have to... - Okay. You talk too much as a woman. I don't like the stereotype, but I accept it.
My apartment is too crowded. Without room for new clothes, these magnificent graphics will start going in the opposite direction. For you. Now, I have found a new office and have enough money to pay months of rent in advance. But the jerk landlord won't let me have it without a guarantor.
I know. He got compensation and signed a confidentiality agreement. He had nothing to do with it. They made everyone sign those things. If one guy doesn't comply, he cancels all the others.
What's in those boxes, Louis? Everything the studio did for Couture Apparel. Will you take us to your annual meeting? Not just. We will conduct it together.
And James Palmer will challenge them all, and this will go on for years. And it will end when it's in Harvey's hands. We will not see each other here again. We will meet for the first time at the hearing. Don't you dare leave. I hired Harvey for a job, he entrusted it to you, and now you listen to me.
Well, since this is murder, why don't we ask Chief Howard? You're going to have to think of a new tactic very soon, because any day now, that "Let's ask Chief Howard"-it's just going to be a thing of the past. - Well, while we are still in the present... If Major Crimes insists on special treatment, you will get it, no doubt.
There will be a lot of blood. We'll have to wrap it in something that won't leak. We'll have to load him in the car, inside something that doesn't look suspicious. With a body inside, that trunk will be very heavy. Then we won't lift it.
- Phone. - Really? Does this one look like a phone from the 1970s? My goodness. I remember when phones were fixed to the walls. They had this little dialer disk, and you'd stick your finger in it and rotate it.
She received the silver medal." The girl next door serves her country and this is her welcome home gift. - Law Order S.V.U. - Season 18 - - Episode 12 They found the object she was hit with. CSU is examining it for prints.
He definitely had a lot of pent-up anger inside. Look, I have to tell you. He put me in a very, very difficult position. He totally lost credibility as a witness, not to mention that what he just did in there was a crime. - He deserved it.
Will you be here when I come back? No. They have to measure me for a new overcoat. Paid for by me? You don't want me to pay for it, do you?
Very good. You will continue to report to me, though. Was it you who brought the plate with the food to Madame de Raynaud? Yes, sir. You took it from the kitchens--and brought it directly to her cell?
Close the wound. Get him out of here. Enlarged and swollen lymph nodes and a primary mass evident in the right lower lobe of the lung. Lung cell tumor? We are waiting for the biopsy results, but I am almost certain they will confirm it.
The "no's" are the majority. We will look for another recipient. It was fought over Meghan Scott despite not meeting the well-defined rules for being a transplant candidate. Yes. I'm, I'm conflicted. I've worked with quite a few alcoholics, and I... I know true repentance when I see it.
But leaving the country? There is no control. The bacteria that caused the abscess probably came from one of those treatments. It was worth it to leave the wheelchair. She touched Nick's abdomen and he felt it.
Mr. President. We don't know who survived, but our best agents are looking for the Quinjet. Agent Burrows has the package, but we don't know if it was on board. Yes, sir. For our sake, we hope Director Mace got it.
I told you not to mess with my mind! I assure you... That your mind is safe and sound in your head. Intact. This body is mechanical. Yes. What? He's controlling it remotely.
It's not your fault. All right? In the Framework we all lost our compass. And yes, it may take you a long time to forgive yourself. But, on behalf of the whole team -- you have nothing to apologize for. If there is a price to pay, we will pay it together.
It was wonderful. You are stupendous. Did you see the language of the contract? He expects you to be the perfect girl. You and I have a secret, so if you don't want me to reveal it, you'd better think of a new deal.
No one tells her when to call her boyfriend. She doesn't have a boyfriend and probably never will. - Well, you know what I mean. - Of course I do. But -- we repeated the conditions of the contract before you signed it.
Really? Poor little thing. Don't pity her, it's her own fault. The snake does not feel inspired to stand up for her. She doesn't worship him like I do.
I paid your debt this morning. You will have it next time. You are lucky to have me. I like your attitude, mademoiselle. Keep it up, the customers will love it.
Flaps. You can ... come forward and form a circle. You know the rules... Of a Particution. When I blow the whistle, what you do is your business. Until I blow it again.
Neil, am I mistaken or are you asking me - to take part in a fraud? - I'm asking you to do your job. Look after my interests and trust what I tell you. If I have reason to believe that you are lying to me, - and I do.... - Suffice it to say that I will fire you if you don't do this for me. And then I will find someone to do it for you. The deal will go through whether you help me or not.
Right, because you killed our neighbor. So what's the plan? Do we keep him? - Am I finally going to have a brother? - We have a plan, but I think in your current state you would judge it negatively.
- Mine is broken. - Fair enough. Okay, it's been a busy day today and we're starting to see the effects. We don't have time. If we don't move the body before tomorrow morning, the dogs will find it.
Oh, let me do that. - Do you mind if I have a soda? - Sorry -- we don't drink soda in this family. Just milk. Do you take milk to the beach? Well, they don't sell it at the beach.
Who are you planning to eat, Loki? Because you may have to kill someone,-it's not all singing and dancing. - I have an agreement with my old gang. I'm free. If they have to get rid of a body, they will leave it for me in the Magic Mountain parking lot.
- Are you crazy? - No. I don't do high-risk investing. I play in the stock market. So for that, I would use my private capital. - But you would make a lot of money. - That's what I hope, but there is a lot of risk in this operation, and I would take it all on myself.
I know you know that I am working on a project together with Benjamin. However, I don't think you know that we brought Stu in as an investor. - I didn't know that, Donna. That's great. - It is, but there's a problem and I need you. - Tell me.
So are you okay with it or not? All right, Harvey, I agree. There you are! I need your help. And you can have it, after I enjoy my ham sandwich in peace.
I am proud of you, Eve. Thank you, General. My conscience is the least of my problems. There is a sarcophagus... It's an Egyptian deity called Apopi. We've looked everywhere for it, we just can't find it.
Thank you, General. My conscience is the least of my problems. There is a sarcophagus... It's an Egyptian deity called Apopi. We've looked everywhere for it, we just can't find it. It's because we have it.
There is a sarcophagus.... It's an Egyptian deity called Apopi. We've looked everywhere for it, we just can't find it. It's because we have it. We brought it back from Egypt.
Thank you very much for such a long journey, Prince Magnus. It has been a pleasure. Although the channel in your harbor is not nearly as safe or calm - as that... - Denmark's. Perhaps one day I will see it for myself.
We are at the vows. - You catch the bouquet. - What? You take it, come on. And when we get out of the vestry, you give it back to me.
They can wait a little longer. What do you think of the banner? I hate it. I was sure of that. And the guards didn't understand who was doing it, right?
The "bathroom?" Hey, Kyle! You want to show Detective Geils where the "bathroom" is? - Sir? - I think they call it "toilet" down here.
- I think they call it "toilet" down here. Sorry, toilet. Of course. Right this way. And for the record-we pronounce it "toilet."
I should have attracted the attention of my former comrades. And when they come back in time to rescue him-I'll be there waiting for them with open arms. Not too open, I hope. Rest assured, Mr. Thawne. Nothing binds us anymore. In that case, kill them all take possession of their fragment of the Spear of Destiny and ... bring it to me.
He said the Spear could alter reality--that it was too powerful for one person to possess, so we broke it into four pieces. - Mr. Hunter took one of them... - And he sent you to three different time periods. When I arrived in Camelot, it was a mediocre kingdom. To protect the Lance piece, I turned it into the court of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.
We tell Kara. - Can you take it easy? - No. I can't-I can't do this anymore. If there's a rip in your costume, that means it's defective, and that means I have to fix it.
The story is not me. It's Cadmus. All right. Off the record. I'm not going to say you told me. You give me a name, I personally verify it, and "bam," we're on a roll.
- What did my mother do this time? Cadmus stole the alien registry. They are abducting everyone on the list. My article was intended to warn -- everyone. Well, one very important thing. If Snapper doesn't want me to publish it in CatCo, do it as an independent journalist.
Marriage will legitimize your union in the eyes of the daxamites. We will have a formal ceremony. You're crazy to think that I will attend this little show for you. Yes, you have made it abundantly clear what you think of me, Lena. I don't expect you to do it for me.
To steal a deadly virus, and use it to kill aliens, in this very bar. He discovered a Phantom Zone projector among your cousin's Kryptonian artifacts. A projector? That sounds old-fashioned to me. They used it to transfer prisoners directly to Fort Rozz.
Like the nozzles that blow fresh air over passengers? My wife redesigned them, patented them, and sold them to Boeing and Airbus. And to a company that makes Chinese airplanes. She forgot to fasten a button on her shirt. No, I had it, but ... my son ripped it off this morning.
Didn't he work at the braeband? Yes, but it's not on the resume, so how...? My assistant Susie used to work there and she recognized his name. What a shady place. No one ever takes that off their resume.
What did they say? I'm going to the bank right now. Oh, okay. It's going to be okay. Thank them for the mortgage we have and tell them we'll change it for a smaller one.
Oh, God. I'm just getting old. Everybody's getting old. Frankie now wipes his own butt, my eggs are dead.... Honey, he doesn't... Okay, yes, he wipes it, but he doesn't do it right.
- I'm really nervous. - Is your girlfriend going to come? I usually take a shower. But I like the smell of your sweat on me. I'll keep it on me as much as possible.
I don't think it will happen anytime soon since Charles is so busy. Face it, mother: France needs new leadership. I can't believe it. Charles took the regent's office away from me so that he could rule the country himself, but he is not doing that at all.
I thought it was only for young people to be reformed. No, it is for you. That means you will never finish the probationary period. That is not fair. I will do it twice, and once applies to Chelsea.
I love you. Hell, Kenny. What's the point of having a voice inside your head if you don't listen to it? How come you're awake? I'm trying to make this table perfect, but this vase is ridiculous wherever I put it.
I've been better. - Thank you for showing up especially for me. - Well, I'm not here for you. I'm here for that thing. Just because they sell it doesn't mean you have to buy it.
Go ask him to wait for me, please. Governors, we are running out of time. The fact that you are here at this emergency meeting on very short notice confirms to the American people that you care as much about their safety as I do. Terror is unacceptable. I do not accept it.
Aquamarine, let's talk about it. Yes, I bet you don't really want to hit us, you ... you probably act mean because deep down, you're scared, you're weak! Go ahead, let it out! We're all sharing right now! Topaz, you had a job. And if you don't, you don't make any sense to me!
Then a beer? He's going to hate this place. I hate it. And I've been here ten years. Grimes only arrived this semester, but already he hates it too.
The bonfire tree? Throwing objects in small circles? The hammer? I'm not quite sure what it is, but.... You probably need a hammer. And then you throw it.
He said something about blue lights. Yes, it is the Fifolet. Legend has it that a spirit can show up in the form of a shiny blue orb. Great. How do we kill it?
Did you see her come in? I'm going to say good night to Hope. Hayley, wait. Remarkable confinement spell. Unfortunately, it only lasts as long as the witch casting it.
In fact, it's because of you that I've learned to believe in a phrase your uncle once told me: "Family is synonymous with power." You are a good dad, Klaus.... and you deserve to know the truth. There's something you need to know about the ritual. Vincent didn't want to tell you, he thought you wouldn't agree, but I know you will.
A strong soul struggling in a dying shell. But, like a little of all of you, it is nothing compared to me. For the last time: give me what I am looking for. - Why don't you come and get it?
Look at this monster. - Wait, wait, you're not going to... - Sure! I'm going to eat it. Certainly. I'll sprinkle it well with garlic, and roast it with heather wood.
So am I. I'm not pretending, I'm not looking for my fifteen minutes of glory. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. - This sign is the only thing that gives me the strength to go on. If I take it off and allow it to silence me, then....
I've got you. Okay, there you go. - Really, I have to do that wrap.... - No. Let me make it.
Is it? No. We are traveling back and forth this month competing with various companies for that contract for next year. Competing to provide services. My colleagues don't know about the competition, they think we've already secured it.
What? In the wall? No, not in the wall. I'm not in the wall, I'm the wall. They are all the walls. These little robots... they didn't build this place, they replaced it.
I know you! You are the con man! I love your work! The sound it made... I couldn't hear you, but that sound -- it was like you could feel it in your bones.
So if light is just a wave, then ... - Space is not empty? - Exactly. So just as sound waves travel through air, light waves will use some medium to travel through space. Scientists call it "aether." A substance that is invisible but surrounds everything, pervading the universe.
Need help. Downtown Sandicot is ready for redevelopment. Why would I ever invest even a small part of my money in your area? I don't expect you to do this business to please my uncle. I expect him to do it because of the casino.
I appreciate that you took my son out of Siberia, but I didn't imagine you would consider it a permission - to keep coming and asking me for favors. - I don't. Like no. What do you want? So the receiver in Paris receives the signal from Berlin and broadcasts it to the whole area.
As if being born lame was not enough for her. This will be the coup de grace. I will not make my daughter unhappy because of an outdated view of womanhood. Not only did she pass the entrance exam, she got the highest score. Do you think the world stands aside just because you want it to?
- Yes, how much do you think you make from writing? So you say no matter what I do, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s still not guaranteed that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll make it. Even if I win the best award a playwright can win? Yes, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more about what theater really means to you. - I love it. - And you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re doing it.
However, if waves propagate better in denser materials, then ... why is it that if I lift my hand I can block even the brightest light? Yeah. Why? Here, scientists think that light travels through its own invisible medium. They call it "aether."
What if, instead of studying gas, we study a cup of coffee? You really need to sleep, Albert. Jacobus van 't Hoff's 1901 Nobel Prize article, "Particles in a solution behave like a gas." When sugar dissolves in coffee, water surrounds the glucose and rips it out of the sugar crystals, right?
Look at what we have discovered. Don't look. You thought it would be a thousand times stronger than uranium. This element is a million times stronger. And it's not even pure. It is beautiful. What shall we call it, my love?
Hi. What's up? Look, I know I'm telling you this last, but I'd like to get together today to talk about that logo. I know it's Saturday, if you have something better to do, it's not a problem. I... It's when the australopithecines put moss around their feet and closed it with bark that the shoe took its first steps.
Do you take anything as an appetizer? So, we thought we'd have -- a shower of buttered bread. What is it about? Go ahead, tell her what it's all about. We take bread, butter it and serve it in baskets galore until you tell us enough is enough.
Me, the floor, my papers, we were all falling together, so I couldn't feel the pressure of the floor on my feet. What if the elevator was going up instead? I would be accelerating in the opposite direction, that would produce the opposite effect. - You would feel the floor. - I would be glued to it, as I am now.
Mom's here. Tell me about the fire in Prague. That was a long time ago. What does it matter now? I always thought Dad set it.
- Then change the course. And where... Don't... What do we do? - Where do we send it?
Sorry. Hamid, thank you for meeting me. - Do you have your phone? - No, I left it in the car. Good, I don't want the cops to use it as a microphone.
You see, Charlie Simms called me. He's afraid he's going to press charges. But he won't, will he? - Oh, no. - No. Because that would hurt his case more than you're already doing.
Let me guess? More magic? It's a spell. A trivial object powered by their magic can make a spell last for a long time. So if we turn it off, do we also turn them off?
Yeardley was about to find out. I came back to find him. How can two farmers succeed when an entire expedition has failed? When the gold is in my hand, brother-then I will be my own master. We will not find it.
At least, that's what I hope. Governor, I saw her going out at night with my own eyes, alone.... whispering to the moon. If it is witchcraft and we do not suppress it, the king may doubt your government. Let him question her. If it is a servant of the devil, I will find out.
No one has seen Darnley since this morning. - What if Lord White had harmed him? - White never made it to Scotland. I stopped him at one of the borders just before dawn. Your marriage to Darnley, if you still want it, is safe from Knox.
- There will be repercussions. Be that as it may, Scotland has one true ruler: Mary, Queen of Scots...daughter of James V...crowned six days after birth and appointed not by the Pope, but by the Almighty. It is my duty-my God-given birthright, my crown. And I will defend it from anyone who tries to take it away from me.
Sparky is not just a dog. He is the son my father never had. Really. My father would come home from work, we kids and my mother would stand there, and he wouldn't say a word. He would pick up the dog, hug him and kiss him.
I didn't greet you properly. I'm sorry. We just moved in, so... Tawny's setting things up. Hey -- when you find a rug in New York City you drag it to your new country.
Wait a minute. What, you think you've made it? Do you think that pathetic bar or any of those things matter? - You don't know sacrifice. - And you know it all too well.
Let's go. You know, for a woman who usually sees the big picture, it was extremely rash. I refuse to distribute a mediocre product with my name on it. - I worked hard to establish this name. - Oh, come on, no one is questioning that. The problem is not your message, but the way you send it.
Why did you stop it? - It doesn't give you the right to ignore the light. - What do you mean by ignoring the light? Do you know how many I have seen ignore the light? - They deserved it.
Was he a fucking friend of yours? - He's more like a brother. - Yeah? Was he? Well, you-- You're fucking fired. Now get your little Jewish ass out of here before I take him there!
Have you ever seriously tried it? The uncut stuff? Never. You know, I have a hookup. All the cool kids do.
You are not listening to me. This is a Pennsatucky free zone. That means you have to stay 100 yards away from Leanne at all times. Well, I didn't see any fucking judge sign that order. The court system doesn't do its job, so we're going to do it.
- Angie! Jesus. - Shit, sorry, I forgot. This is Dr. McCurry. He's going to cut your finger off and sew it back on Leanne.
It doesn't feel like the time for that. It's something I think about. - Is Poussey in heaven? - Of course he is, honey? In my faith, we call it Heaven.
We need to be more firm with her. Yo! Hold it! Yo! Yo! You better get your ass over here before these bitches drag it down!
Watch. We have just surpassed one million views! A million people saw what a miserable pathetic and violent little man you are. You could grab his arm twice with your hand, yet you had to break it to hold it back. Do you really think anyone will care tomorrow? Some 12-year-old girl will add the sound of a fart to it, show it to her friends who like farts, then a new fart video will come out, and you--you will all be forgotten.
- Busy. - I need my stomach pumped. - It won't get you out of trouble. She took your file. Ask her if she has examined it. - Open the door!
- Police Depot. Okay, well, the good news is that we are the police. Why don't you let us help you? Can you be more specific, doll? We liberate the vehicle, hand it over to you, and your brother's debt is paid.
Prepare to be disappointed. - I shouldn't have said those things. - I know. - Nothing can be printed. - That tape has all the interviews. You're not going to get it.
Larson. What does he see? I don't know. What is that supposed to mean? The rendering of the file is still in progress, the data flow is more complicated than expected. Send it to me, then.
I improvise. I bend over. I wear black socks with a red stripe. Then I decide to use them as bait. I take a piece of fabric with even a bit of red and wrap it around the hook.
No? The piece of paper. The deed to his empire. It all comes down to that, doesn't it? And if you were in possession of that document, where would you keep it?
Martin Byrde. His boss would not allow it. He used those words. Even after he saw the body? I saw Sheriff Nix fishing it out right in front of him.
I'm going to lose out on my family members, you know? There was the agreement. They were going to come home. Now someone will come looking for answers that I won't be able to give them. We made a deal and they will honor it.
- Ice hockey? There's only one kind of field hockey. What do you watch, basketball? What makes you think that? A lot of people follow it.
When we lived on Oceanside, we used to share a room. Do you remember that? Mom and Dad's fights were very violent. They would go from room to room and throw everything at each other. Do you remember that pirate ashtray? And that Mom threw it against the glass door?
Yes. The beauty is in the hunt. I will make the credits on this slaughter. I liked our meeting. I'm sure I'll hate it when I see it, but I liked it.
- No? Okay. Well then, thank you for the concern. Okay, that's fine. Well... but... please consider it, okay?
Careful, Reyes. Emori has already claimed me as his. Um, little doubt. A.L.I.E. had a security system to protect the place, right? Any idea what he was protecting it from?
But -- but actually, this book is about.... Pablo, yes. - A guy and his two dogs. - Fantastic. And the main character had such an interesting, special, distinctive name. I had never heard it before.
No, no, you guaranteed it. And a guarantee is a guarantee. It's a family matter now, buddy boy. I want the diamonds within 48 hours, or their market equivalent, which is 250,000 pounds. Or I'll cut your dick off. And put it in a pickle jar.
- Let me go! I have footage of a man, about 5'8, wearing Cavendish monogrammed moccasins at the scene of an armored car robbery two days ago. You're Albert Hill's little buddy, acting all gangster and walking around with a stupid bow tie to set the tone. I want that gold, boy. And if you don't bring it to me -- I'll come get it.
What has your son done with my diamonds? My son would never rob you, Saul. He's not dumb. Let's tell Saul Gold who robbed him. I want that gold, boy. And if you don't bring it to me, I'll come and get it.
So, the truck is speeding along the jade ... *road when it hits the spiked strip. The tires rip apart like cheddar bonnets. I run toward the driver--full of adrenaline--but he pulls out--an iron. *pointing the weapon at my track, *face but I'm faster. With one blow, I take the iron out of his clutches and turn it back on him, and he investigates in his underpants.
All you have to do is say. "Please." As you said, it's about pride. You stole mine, - then I'll take yours. - The gold is mine! And I won't let some slimy piece of shit steal it, just because no one has ever embraced it!
Didn't I say he would kill Fink, as he killed all the others? - Do you need more proof? - I agree with Mother. Forget about the gold. Let someone else handle it.
Yeah. What have we got? How does it work, Norman? It's a no-brainer, son. If that dog comes near my ham sandwich, I'll beat it to a pulp.
My pleasure, boss. So, I'm here for my father. Fuck the gold, you can keep it. They're bluffing. They want it all.
It is shit your poetry, and it is shit also your task. Sweet prince, an offering. A shit called by another name.... It doesn't smell good. The beloved... Magdalen weeps forever. Her heroic captain lost in the deep waters, her love as brief as it is bright that must cease to exist, her grief... As deep as the sea that contains him.
- Yes, get lost, brawlers! Oh, praise be to ignorance. And the fool am I? Well, my friend, you have a drama to write. Yes, but I will need your help.... If you will grant it to me.
- For all of us! - But shut up. What a strange girl! She mumbles, like a nutcase! I intend to make that theater thrive,-until you take it over and run it.
All right. Here's what Julia found out. August 20, 1976. A baby was abandoned in a hospital. A nurse, Michelle Walker, turned him over to state social services.
No, Chief. The fire department said the church is safe again, though. Get your butt in the chair. When I first arrived in Rome, I was not warmly welcomed. I was forced to buy pounds of paint to cover the crap they had written on our garage door so Rose wouldn't see it.
Say what you like, but we have weapons and a plan. What do you have? Ta... Da... Fuck. The royalty equipment. This... This is a ritual, people. And I expect you to enjoy it to the fullest.
I took a little trip to get the necessary stuff. Oh, good stuff. Heroin. I always thought I'd die this way. Potassium chloride will stop the heart, adrenaline will restart it.
Install an elevator outside the building. Good solution. Here I am! Here are the cocktails. I call it the ParadeMutandine.
- I'm exhausted, really. - I'm a little bit groggy. We have to keep going. No, look, there's a generator. Why don't we hook it up to the generator?
Here it is. He calls "Chapel." He picks up the phone and dials it. My hands are on the wheel, it's safe. He holds it to my ear, so it's a speakerphone.
- Guys! - No, no, we can do it! Okay, you need to find the processor, remove it, and reverse the flow to the ODBC interface. - What? - In our language, you idiot! But then it can't hijack it, it will just loop the signal. - If you have a better way.
Never mind the price. Well, generous of you. The transmitter must be very important. For the Hullens, it's priceless. So we'd better get moving before they find out.
He knew what he should do. He made his land very small. - Until the whole world... - Could fit in the palm of her hand. And then she ate it, so that no one could harm her people anymore.
That should make things more interesting. Ah, you brought me a present. - So, is this a date? - It's an optical implant. If I turn it on -- you can hear the blood flowing, the eyes moving.
Seven hours my ass. Lucy, where is Dutch? I need you to help me find her. Processing in progress. - Sending coordinates. - Lucy, if I had a body I would kiss it.
Where did you get it? From Tabor's closet, and it used to be in Dr. Alfonso Rezov's lab. He was the friend of a client's cousin, sort of a ... scientist, who needed help financing his technological research, so Tabor ... The guy owed him money, and Tabor kept some of his inventions. - I was getting to that. - What do you know about that device? We got it from his lab when he wasn't there, so? not much.
E'... Confused. Frightened. By what? From death. I told you, when we met. There's a mistake in our programming. Or at least... Humans see it as such.
Welcome to the club. Why did the recall program only work now? I'm not sure. When I left, the engine was just an incomplete prototype prone to instability. Yes-we noticed that.
You won't find him here, Ryo. Only your death. - You have taken an oath. - To the throne. And the throne will still be here when you're gone. And who will occupy it?
- Was he afraid? - Yes, but then he discovers a way to stop being afraid of the dark. How? If you want I could read it to you. I'm sure we can find it in the bookstore.
I switch to manual control. Murphy. Thank you. We have to catch up with them before they get to Polis with the fuel. They will use it to make bombs.
Thank you. We have to catch up with them before they get to Polis with the fuel. They will use it to make bombs. They will kill everybody. You mean they will use it to eliminate the Ice Country.
I will shed so much light on the spider's web that the whole world will see it for the deformed pestilence that it is. Hunsdon will no longer be able to support Topcliffe, it will be as if he were stricken with the plague. But how do you intend to stage it? The censor would never approve a political drama. I'm going to write it.
It is impossible to find it. What happened that day? Paris Cannon We were almost at the end of the War. The Germans had a new artillery piece, the "Paris Cannon." They hid it in the countryside and started bombing the city at random.
We schedule it for next Friday. Thank you, but this -- it has to be heard tomorrow before more blood flows. We can alert all parties in an hour. I can't cross the lobby without my cell phone. But you don't use it to unleash your neighborhood.
For me this is the essence of Uruguayan asado. For all Uruguayans, the theme of 'asado is the same. From an early age, let's say even as infants, we already know 'asado , because it is a very old tradition, handed down to us by our ancestors. We carry it on. We do it almost every day.
You have to believe in it to do this work. There is no alternative. It is hard work, a hard life. But it has to be done with love. If you don't do it for the right reasons, it will shorten your life, I think.
I studied, and in my spare time I worked. That's how I learned. Now I am 20 years old, almost 21, and I have been doing this work for five years. When the work is finished and I taste the mescal, I say the work was done well, the product is good. And I like it when they taste it and say, "This mescal is great."
- Yes, it is. - Then take off your shirt. - I had a big breakfast. My advice? I guess it's to leave every place you've worked, a little better than you found it.
Call Foley directly, arrange for us to meet physically. That way I'll know if I have an enemy. - Your locker, Mr. Rhoades. - Thank you, Domingo. Now -- some people, when they age a cigar, keep it at 70 percent humidity.
Well, also a bit of a snitch actually. One night he got the "Code Red" treatment at the college. Were you the leader? Let's just say I was part of it. I never got it out of my head.
I could have gone out every night. Models, singers, what you call "friends." I could have done something like that to you. Maybe I should have done that. I would receive the same treatment from you, but at least, in that case, I would have deserved it, even having fun.
Mrs. Washington. A clever utensil, don't you think? During that terrible winter at Valley Forge my husband made do with a spoon. With this, however, he could have counted on a full set of cutlery. Why don't you take it?
They want to kick out one of the women in the camp because she refused to do laundry. And she is stubborn, but she has a child and ... And I'm sure I can change her mind. If you could ask the general for a little more time. He never wanted non-military personnel here. We have to do what we can without forgetting that we all serve the army and the general who commands it.
The white man who wrote your book didn't mention that, did he? No. The doctor realized that we were destroying ourselves with violence and pollution. I mean, not him, but ... The Light. Then The Light gave him the message and he transcribed it.
You can't bring food from outside. It's not food. There's a badly injured squirrel. All right, have a seat. Just don't let him out of the box.
I know what you're thinking. Yet another superhero clash. Well, my name is Emily Locke and I grew up in a so-called flyover state. Superheroes never used to stop there. They would just fly over it.
I'm waiting on the line. Hey, guys, just a moment. What is this sound? It's a device I built, it alerts you when someone you can't stand is approaching. I call it the Emily Alert.
Can I choose the color? It's 7 o'clock in the morning. Why am I here? Van, this device we invented just alerted me that Jack O'Lantern is in the area, giving us enough time to get to safety. It uses advanced chemoreceptors to pick up the specific scent signature of Jack O'Lantern. We've named it Jack-Alarm.
With Blaine it took a couple of days. Understood. You know, I had a great speech prepared. It was funny and sincere, profound, even. But it seems like a waste, since you'll forget it later anyway.
Yes, my lord. With all due respect, Lord Uhtred, you still have not explained why you went to Denmark. I never remember your name. My name is Aldhelm, I am the commander of Lord Aethelred's personal escort. Would you like me to write it down for you?
- To Larry! - To me! Luga, let's party for my book. That's right, give him a party. No, in the sense that we celebrate it. And you, and Corfu.
It struck me how these kids would do anything to get out of the house. - Mia used to come here quite often. - Yes? How come? The parents wanted the rent in cash. She used to collect it.... so it wouldn't go to accounting, you know?
That makes you too easy to buy. No, no. You don't have to get me anything. - But we want to do something. - Yes, it's an important birthday and we want you to remember it.
Except that I'm sorry you never got to write yours. It's the way it should have been. So it's good that there's still a place here. I grew up knowing about this book, but when it didn't appear for my special birthday, I wrote my wish anyway. I keep it in my jewelry box.
Is it hollow? - It contains liquid. - Oh, yes, mercury. Yeah, ancient peoples valued it a lot. Chinese emperors even drank it.
God, they are raiding our building. Come on professor, let's get out of here. No. The Lumen. The book is safe, they will never find it.
I didn't call you to have a fair, balanced judgment of the situation. You're right, my mistake. Okay, maybe I can get some clues from Don, but in the meantime you have to put a little spin on it. It's like with dogs. Okay? You don't just pull out the food and wait for them to find it.
I saw it! - Shut up, peasant girl! She's a citizen, a witness. Pay her and take her home. Thank you, Prince. My nephew is a fool, but he is not so foolish as to kill a Capulet, I swear to you by the name of the Montagues.
As the world awaits news about the president's condition, all major indexes continue to fall. The Dow, NASDAQ and Standard and Poor's are approaching historic Black Monday losses. The Dow Jones has already lost an incredible 2,000 points in a single day after the shooting of President Kirkman. I hope that's not my pudding. It's my pudding, I've earned it.
No, no, no. I understand that. I really do, believe me. Running this country is the hardest job in the world. But with everything that's happened, the problem is that you're not running it.
I know there are times when our country may seem divided, but I have seen one thing that will keep us together forever.... Love. Love of country, love of hope, love of dreams, love of life, love of freedom and the pursuit of happiness. I am a husband, I am a father, and I am a son of this nation, and never before have I been so proud of it, so optimistic. And you don't need to tell me that you feel the same way, because I see it in your eyes and I feel it in your hearts.
Don't apologize. You are welcome. I know it has been a long time since we were sent to the Continental Front. And I was telling you that your place has been taken. And now you're taking it back.
- In the "Gazette?" It's you. - Yes. I asked him. Sergeant John Champe, Second Partisan Army. I was not told your name and I will not ask it.
My mother. Well, I don't really know how you did it -- and I don't think I want to know, but.... - great job. - All I can say is it's good to have friends in high places. And on that note, congratulations on the promotion. Well, yes, I was offered Blair's job, but that doesn't mean I want it.
There is not much solid foundation on which to build my column. So you want a guarantee before you make a commitment? No, I didn't say guarantee. Well, what words would you use then? The work only works if you extend it to other people in your life.
- Absolutely. Lucas can stand next to the camera, and you can get closer between takes when we're not filming you anyway. Okay and what's the other option? We would give you this earpiece. We'd cover it with your hair -- and then we'll try to get the shot away from you, like this.
- What's going on. - When I lived in Memphis as a kid, there was this record store.... "Hoppy's." I heard they closed it a couple of years ago. When I was a kid it was a magical place. They would let you listen to any record, even if you didn't buy it later.
He worries about you. Yes, he does. She does. You know, I didn't believe her at first when she told me about your psychological breakdown. Is it okay if I call it a breakdown?
Why are you making the bed? I like to make the bed. But it's a hotel. It's a motel... And this is a bed, and I like to make the bed. I'm just saying somebody else is going to do it.
STAX MUSEUM ON AMERICAN SOUL MUSIC A butcher shop where you could go and pick out your chicken. He would kill the chicken... - What? - He would pluck it, clean it... - And then he'd wrap it up for you.
- Also. Are you okay? Philly left. And that's when I decided--that nothing made sense anymore. When a plate breaks, you don't fix it, you buy a new one.
And are we sure what the extent and nature of its... - power? - No. However, if the data collected does not lie, he may be the most powerful mutant we have ever encountered. Given what happened to Red Hook, I would say that to call him powerful is reductive. Therefore, he has power. A power that he does not understand... or perhaps...is unable to control. I would like to delve further to find out what triggers it.
I didn't eat anything from sunrise to sunset, so it was a total fast. It must be very difficult to fast with those tasty cupcakes at work. Did you know that Hakeem Olajuwon fasted during the NBA Finals? - Interesting anecdote, right, Navid? - I knew it already.
Sgt. Arnott. Where was your wife on the night of the 17th -- all the way through the morning of March 18? All right. I assume you are aware of the law regarding the coercibility of the spouse? Normally the spouse is the one who corroborates the alibi, not the one who dismantles it.
Amen. We never got married. She would have wanted to... Especially after you were born. She took my last name. She wanted you to have it too.
What are you doing, Chief? How many times do I have to tell you not to call me that? Well, Nunez is missing. It's just me and Rita left, and she called in sick. Same thing Warren and Franks, so, I would say the place is yours if you want it.
This place brings back many memories - of when we were all together. - It's been a long time since then. Far too long. I live and work here. It is always as full and dusty as it used to be.
What? - Do you trust Lem's friends? - I don't know them. - I don't know you either. - I know a cheat when I see one.
You are the best we have ever seen. Now let the girl go so you can tell your story. No! No! No! No! No! Arrest, as we call it, is an extremely changeable situation. You must rely on your instincts, your training and above all, your profile.
- Fuck, I don't want that. I want him to read the script. Today's? No, another one, which I've been carrying on for years. No one gets it, I can't produce it.
Cancer. He tried everything. Chemo-radiation, operations. Do you know what they do with a tumor once it's extracted? They put it in a bag -- and burn it.
That we... That there is not... The slightest chance of doing something so horrible again? That it doesn't... Changed us forever? What has happened to us is a miracle, Megan. We drank the evil... And we spit it back out.
All right, we'll do Heather's piece on the pirate party. - Thursday, third segment. - But it's the lame segment! - All our viewers go to the bathroom. - Okay, then we won't do it.
There are still two days left before it's mine. In East Peck, if no one claims a body part in two weeks -- you can keep it. But I wouldn't sing victory, because I've been there before. I once found a finger. I kept it for ten days -- before anyone claimed it.
1957. The two of us. That's how Olivia knew. It's all on that document. - If anyone would see it.
Sold -- to bidder 337. Do you want to buy the whole building? - Don't bother. They are under stress. - Maybe they took it and fragmented.
The lights would flicker and we wouldn't feel very good. Mrs. Markridge? I'm sorry, but you purchased more than we expected. You have exceeded your credit limit. Okay, then increase it.
You cannot stop it. You are wrong. He can choose his own destiny. He did not covet his future. He despised it.
Okay? This place is mine now. It took me forever to find it. But it's total shit. Why did you want it?
If you were caught, you would be imprisoned for theft. I have to retrieve it myself. Then I will go with you. If the money is also yours, you might try to get it back. The money will be protected when we bring it to the church.
If Darnley no longer wants to share your power, he will try to take it. He is a threat to your throne and your life, Mary. You must get rid of him. I am not ready to talk about killing a king.... Or raising a son without his father. There must be another way, and I will find it, as long as you are by my side.
Or it was Don E. He knew I had the cure. He was trying to sell it at a very high price to a rich guy in his club. I would have wanted ice cream. It would have been a trivial choice, I agree, but Jesus-I was already tasting it.
- You sniveling beast of a... Hold it right there, you big beast. You attacked an officer. That wasn't the best move. You have the right to remain silent. And I bet you already know the rest, but I'm telling you anyway.
A monthly subscription is needed. Everything you do with the phone is recorded, including calls and texts, then it is all sent to the subscription holder. Ken was spying on me? There is a number associated with the credit card used for the Tinker Spy subscription. My colleague is calling it right now.
Shall we begin? While you are waiting, have you ever heard the story of the poor woodcutter and his wife? No, I don't think so. One day, a poor woodcutter and his wife ... came across a crane that had walked into a trap. Feeling sorry for the bird, they set it free.
Is he dead? He built this place with Cary -- thirty years ago. Before the Divisions were born. When no one could know how quickly the world would change. They built it and then looked for people who could feel at home here.
Launch sequencer initialization. Raven. Becca? I know it's none of my business, but why live in a hole in the ground -- when you have a fully functioning rocket? But are you plowing the ground or stabbing it?
It would be up to you, or... - Clarke, or... - O., stop. We wouldn't have been able to do what you did, and it wasn't just winning a fight. You gave people hope when there was none. You are... You are like Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and ... gives it back to the human race.
He could visit her, and tell her that she is no smarter than the great Father Brown. Has she ever read the fable of the eagle and the crow? I don't think so. A crow saw an eagle swoop down on a flock of lambs -- and take one of them away to eat. The crow thought it was just as strong, so it too flew over the flock... and rested on the back of another lamb. It grabbed it in its claws...and began to beat its wings with all its might...but it could not lift the lamb.
Who would say such a thing? One of the local people described a person he saw. I thought it might be him. It wasn't. If Eddie had gone to Peru, I would have known.
I don't know. I took part in a session with Richard to get it off my chest. And of course-I couldn't do it completely. I wanted to tell him everything. Yes, it's natural, it's an impulse--completely understandable, of course, but if I went along with it, it would be a real disaster.
Great, that's exactly what every table-bound girl wants to hear. Chris lived to help others. She made life better for people all over the world. She helped build the hospital where she died. Which stood for a month before an unauthorized U.S. bombing razed it to the ground.
What-what little dress? This one. I-I don't know. You don't know? Why have you never seen me wear it?
- I don't think that's what happened. - It's not right what Bailey did. You can't put some random guy in as chief of general surgery. I mean, Kepner is good, but Grey worked hard for that job. Okay? She deserves it.
Jackson, stop it! Stop it. All you do is repeat, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery," but you're not, you're not showing it by acting like this. A title doesn't mean anything. It is the person that makes it important.
I can see why he resents you. It is much worse than what I did. Worse in what way? You took away his job. And you kissed the person who took it.
Once the metastasis obstructing the bile duct is removed, his liver enzyme values will decrease and he will be able to participate. Meredith does not think it is wise to perform the surgery. Meredith is no longer working on the case. And now that I have found out about this trial, there is all the more reason to perform the surgery. And I would like one of you to perform it.
I will give them-I will give them everything I never had. I will give him everything I could not give my children. I will give him everything you could not give your first child, who died in the womb. My child does not represent a method of making up for your mistakes. This child will be good, it will be pure, and I will not expose it to your darkness and anger.
I'll use you to practice real jujitsu if you don't catch that snake! I will, let me explain. Rattlesnakes do not hunt by following sight. They sense vibration and heat. So I'm putting my phone on vibrate and opening several apps to overheat it, then I put it in my stocking.
Perfect!!! Your help was really appreciated. Walt, Cabe took rattlesnake vitamins. Where are you on the hydrogen sulfide? I'm picking it up.
It will take some time. We will also have to stabilize the silo or it will fall down before we are done. How? It can fall at any moment. We will secure it with cables.
If we don't act now, it's like dropping it! That's right. We drop him. I'm so sorry, acid must have fallen on his head and is burning his brain. We tie the safety nets, pull them down the chasm, cut the wires, drop the silo into the nets and catch him, so we save Joe.
Basically--some are simply better at it than others. Being a programmer teaches you that. The number seven is the number seven. Calling it eight doesn't actually make it the number eight, it just makes you ridiculous.
- Excuse me? - I demand a vote with all members to determine the leadership of the study. We're going to go in a different direction. Oh, and the new leadership would be you? Are you serious? Of course, I'm taking my firm back. You ruined it, and these days I can't let it drift.
You don't look well to me. It's time for you to get changed. Wake up Bianca and get some freaking sleep. I said I'm fine! And even if I wanted advice, I doubt I'd ask a pirate for it!
It was a nightmare. Larry, no. If the defense believes that all we have is the testimony of Detective Hiss? then he clearly has not seen the coroner's report on Margaret Henderson. No, I have not seen the coroner's report. I didn't know there was a report, I've been asking for weeks.
This. I didn't think it was possible. That was not part of the plan. So, maybe... Maybe we should make a new plan. And this time we do it together.
I think-yes. - I shouldn't have. - A little bit excessive. I'm so excited to be here. I haven't been to the beach in years, and every time. I get burned every time, but I love it.
- Wolf trials are there... - When there is a full moon. - The full moon... And the accused turns into a werewolf. Like, literally, he says, "I object..." The judge throws the gavel at him and he eats it or brings it back like a stick.
"Now I have become Death, the destroyer of worlds." You know what that means, don't you? Pop quiz. Hey, hey, hey. If you don't get a little hate in this job, it means you're not doing it right.
And I am not one of those snobs who underestimates Robert Herjavec just because he is the son of an immigrant laborer. And what would Robert do? He would say we need a slogan, something to make the business unique. Maybe our slogan could be. "Ice cream is simple, delicious, and people love it." No.
- You know what? I don't. I don't. I'm not sorry. - Because we spent it together...
- You don't know. - I know she was looking for board games, and if that is her main concern, then she is not concerned about food. If they have more food, they should share it with us. - Can I ask if... - Do you think those bitches will share it?
From fridge to trash. I'm cashing in a lot of shots today. There's also an awards ceremony at the Embassy Suites hotel. The trophy is a crystal palm tree. We will hang it on a necklace and you will wear it when relatives are there.
Friend! And look how delicate it looks on your finger. It's impossible for you to say "no" to that ring. Yes. She will love it.
No! The older it gets, the more it increases in value. - Damn right it does! - Just kick his ass! - You've been saving it for 13 years.
- Don't worry, I'll make her pay. How did you find my duffle bag, Carlos? - She told me. - We were talking. If you wanted it so badly, why did you give it back to me?
But please, I ask you -- Monday morning, in court -- can you drop the charges? I'll tell you what I'm going to drop. I'm going to drop you. I see you're done with that shitty accent. Yes, I used it to... what's the word -- get your wife wet.
You, you, you said Jennings and his people stopped this story. With the city on fire, those in the Vault knew that their only hope of finding the Djinn was for one of their own to read the pamphlet and accept their cursed fate. Eventually, the task fell to Samuel Wilson, NOTICE: TO RESIDENTS IN WASHINGTON D. C. Once there, Master Jennings used an ancient tome of elemental magics to invoke a strong storm. He flooded the Djinn's lair and struck it down with tremendous lightning.
- Are you sure this is the place? - Yes. I know what I saw. You may be right. I saw this place on a list of Dreyfuss properties. They are going to turn it into a server farm.
But using the Stone is the only way for our nation to survive this first phase. Here the missive ends. We know that Washington has, in the end, followed Banneker's plan.... and so does Dreyfuss. Exactly, but following this new hypothesis that Washington intended to use the Stone before it was divided.... If we could find the rest of the correspondence, we might find out its purpose. All right, we will look for it after we find the last piece.
Let's go. - Who is throwing those things at us? - I don't know. We're definitely above the Talisman segment. I think something doesn't want us to get it.
So. Do you think it's over? Is this the last we will hear of Dreyfuss? I'd like to think so but the devil is able to rise up in ways we can't even imagine. But even if it happens...we will face it together.
But according to you it is not about that. It's not. Agent Thomas? When Molly was little, she had an imaginary friend -- he had green hair and and he was made out of her cover. She used to draw him all the time. - Anyway, she called him...
So how are a bunch of catorces going to help us take out this demon? Okay, not everyone knows this, but ... cars are filled with small amounts of gold. Anti-lock braking systems, the chips in the airbag inflators. Come on. If there was all this gold in cars, people would steal it.
Really. You could see anything. Even programs with people challenging each other to cupcakes. But ... one day came ... the Dreyfuss. He stole power from the people and kept it all for himself.
Molly. You are free. When you grow up, you can choose to fight evil -- or not. What about the Witness burden? I don't have it anymore. But you carried it with... courage and tenacity beyond the age you possess.
One had a gun. They pushed me to the hallway and started shouting. "Where's the money?" No one noticed anything. What money? They said they gave Adam half a million dollars. - And they want it back.
- Red or white? Red. Thank you. You're out of chalk. Yeah. Did you take it off yourself?
I heard it all. God, how come the rakes are so relaxing? You know, I think I'm just beginning to understand energy. Which, apparently, my book doesn't have. Nick, everybody loves it.
- In previous episodes... - You were right. As long as Mary is alive, there will be Catholics who will want her on your throne. Unless you share it with someone of their faith.
I asked Rizzio to keep his eyes open, but every person at court is a potential accomplice. These are gestures of a desperate man. I stopped all Darnley's attempts to get the Marriage Crown. Knox and the Privy Council must have promised him my throne. Which means they will take it by force.
Last night, in Tampa, this kind of doodle was found on the arm of a corpse while it was being dissected during an anatomy class. What is it, some kind of tattoo? No, it's done in pen. Yeah, and fortunately for the police, the teacher of the anatomy class is also the county coroner and recognized the symbol. He also saw it on...
Well, let me take a look in ViCAP -- and in the neighboring states' databases. Man. Another body, or rather a torso, was found 10 blocks from the first body. Was it found in a dumpster? No, a passerby saw it in a parking lot.
Weren't you supposed to leave the novel to your mother? Which, for the record, was exactly what she wanted to do. Hey, Dad, where's Mom? I want to give her my, uh, bracelet. Mom... - wanted to borrow it.
Who needs a love test if you have visual evidence? Here is test number one. Yes. Words of wisdom, counselor! Are you feeling better about the test? I was fine, until you reminded me.
People cheat. They lie. So I have to be careful. And make sure the people I hire are careful. I had discarded her, but she's the only candidate who got it. So the job is hers if she wants it.
Stop being brave. I can't stand them, the brave ones. I will write history in stone. I will spread your name in the air. Everyone will see it for centuries.
Yes, the girls should have prepared the bedroom. You can approach. Congratulations on your citizenship. Thank you. Hong Kong recognizes talent when it sees it.
He mentioned it in the recordings of the therapy sessions. Are you absolutely sure that the deacon is the Nurse Killer? Yes. What are we looking for? I'll tell you when I find him.
Geordie. Yes? They're asking for you. So why is our friend Lawrence so obsessed with sex? Because he sees it as a discovery, as an exploration of ourselves, of our... innermost desires.
Are you okay? Yes, I'm just tired. I have a present for you. The guy sitting next to me bought it for me. I made it very clear to him. That I was going to give it to my husband.
But they all face each other. You haven't been back there for a long time. That's what your father says. Maybe it's better -- if you keep this book on the shelf, along with others on the same topics. That way if someone sees it, they won't pay attention to it.
It could be brutal. I'm ready for it. Really? I think there would be a conflict of interest if you were to accompany me to Billy Brennan's victory party. How about we go home, I put on my nice dress -- and you take it off?
But fuck you. If you watch my business, I'll watch yours. Okay. Let's take it slow. I'm going to rape your email inbox. If you took even one fucking selfie, I'll find out.
Help. Gavin. - I like your hair. - I like your eye. Yeah, a woman made it for me.
- Yes, hello, Alex. You didn't... You didn't hold up your end of the bargain. That can't be all there was. I entered the name and that's what came out. - Okay, but did you spell it right?
I couldn't, not forever. Maybe it won't be forever. I have... I talked to Meghan and Robbie about the case. We reviewed it.
You can rest assured. I just realized I had it in my car for weeks. The kerosene alone would have killed you. I'll get you another one. Aldous was so proud that he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me that he wrote it, and Aldous just simplified it.
I like it. Then, a golden egg appears between them. A what? A golden egg. The woman eats it and a few months later has a baby.
Miss Rodriguez had a sex dream about you. There must be something else behind it. What, did you just make up this example or is it true? Let's say I made it up....
Oh no, Jon changed the code. Wait, what? How did Jon change the code? You know, every now and then we change it.
What a mother. - My housekeeper does that too. - Yes, but you are my friend. In a town full of gossips, she's the first. She wrote to everyone about my divorce before I knew. And she implied it was my fault.
- It worked and didn't harm anyone. - It actually harmed someone. Chloe Brown Mueller fired the maid for theft. - She knew the candelabra was missing and was suspicious of Roberta. She said if she returned it, there would be no consequences.
No, we didn't. In fact, we were hoping to have a chance to come back. As you wish. In return you must give me a gift. A gift? Tell us what you wish -- and we will bring it to you.
He was a good guy until he crossed paths with Damian. The Antigua police offered Zion a deal if he involved Damian, but he obviously refused. It's hard to rat out the man you consider your father. Yes, being forced to gut someone is a pretty traumatic thing. Maybe his first murder stuck with him so much that that's why he's dusting it off despite the condition he's in.
I see. Well, what do you want, Mary? You have become a beautiful woman. An example for others. That's true. I know it is hard to look at yourself and see the power in you, but I see it and you are radiant.
Yes. And in return? A royal child from Yuletide. The fairies want a baby? They won't eat him, will they?
I need some assurance. All right. Here are the keys to my house. You can pick up the mail and feed the cat. Who do you want me to feed it to?
Who told you? Your cell phone? Yes. It says there's an accident up ahead. If there was an accident, I would know.
Just to be clear, we stay off other people's property anyway? - That's right. - Good. A check from Neumann's Hill arrived yesterday. I'll use it to light the fire.
Yes, Colt. That's right. By the way, I hope we catch 328 fish today. The same number of shots that intercepted you. Maybe a fish swallows your phone and we catch it.
- He fixed it last time. - He didn't. He is the wizard of the generator. He really talks to it. Without exaggeration. He comes up to him, caresses him and says:
I sent her to clean up so we can prove Maxine right. Liar. I knew you wanted my story, this story will save my career. Anna, I'm trying to help you. As soon as I get the tape back we'll sit down and listen to it together and you'll write the story you wanted.
- What, Mom I never said that. - You did. She also told me your little secret. What? What secret? Well, Willie takes the newspaper from the rude neighbors every morning and gives it to you.
It was '87. We were late for that damn Hands Across America that you made me do. Hands Across America was in '86 and then you even thanked me because you held hands with somebody who had held hands with Willie Nelson. What was it for, then? World hunger? Give somebody a sandwich in San Francisco and pass it down the line to some bum who gets it in Boston?
You may recall that we left Jane working on a novel about her abuela. My niece is a. "To Be Read in Miami." Don't get too excited. We don't know if she will choose it.
Is it you? I am Guthred. I visited the Danes in the guise of a dead knight, thus succeeding in freeing Guthred. By taking an oath over the body of a saint, he was crowned king. Create an army and I will lead it.
So. I don't want to run that program. However -- I have an idea. When I proposed my traveling program, you told me it was not feasible because I am a new face. And I understand that. You're right. But...what if you and I did it together?
Glove. No. My team died because of that thing. We could all die because of that thing. It doesn't mean I'm going to hand it over to Snyder.
We would only need 24 hours to wean her off morphine and recharge her system with - milder opiates or methadone,-to provide her with safer abstinence. - But the simulator isn't ready yet. What's the problem? Okay, we might feed the baby with the umbilical cord, but if we use it to oxygenate the blood, clots will form.
I, on the other hand, am alone. You can call me. I will help her. The love she feels for her daughter is stronger than what she feels with this stuff. She has already proven it.
How can you be so calm? You've never been a mole. - Hey! - Scarab, stop it. Check that thing, Beetle. Or I'll check it for you.
If it is divided, each part develops into a new individual. It reproduces by budding, and is virtually immortal. And the secret is a gene: FOXO. FOXO produces stem cells in high and constant amounts. We humans have it too, but it is not as active in us.
Look at this, see how basic this knot is? I love these thermal viewers. Amy, listen to me carefully. If you and Jake are thinking about trying this, know that you're ovulating big time right now. Take that visor off before I slap it off you.
Well, that gives me an idea. Really? Do you have any ideas? Chopper, get his attention. Bring him to me and I'll hit him.
Lucy, would you check that these handcuffs are locked tightly? Yes, they are locked. Ladies and gentlemen, as has just been confirmed to you my hands are locked behind my back. I will now enter this trunk. My brother Dash will lock it.
In every square, in every garden, in every playground! You are burning, you are literally burning, you are very caliente. - It means "hot" in Spanish. - The statues are transmitters! They amplify the signal and transmit it all over the world!
Sure. We still don't know what happened. Given the facts, I think it's pretty clear. If it were you, wouldn't you want the benefit of the doubt? If I got drunk and killed a little girl, I wouldn't deserve it.
Okay, and then what? - I don't know. - Okay, why didn't you tell us about the oxycodone you took? I forgot. I was prescribed it a few days ago for a shoulder injury in the line of duty.
It is good news because it is pleasant to converse with you. Yes. So is talking with her and that's lucky, otherwise she wouldn't work. When a male penguin chooses a mate he makes an offer to her. She looks for a pebble. He takes his time because he looks for the smoothest one. Then he gives it to the female.
It is portentous! It is portentous! I'll be honest with you. Your insurance premium is about to skyrocket. Actually, everything is about to skyrocket, because I'm going to blow up the lab. First we just need some kind of detonator. But what will you blow it up with?
I haven't slept for days. - How is the song coming along? - I've finished it. - I want you to sing the first verse. - Why don't you or Simone sing it?
I think I left it in the new house. - Excuse me, Cott. I'll take it. - But don't they get ruined in there? Honey, don't worry about it. I have an iron on top, I'll put it in your bag.
It's the same old story, as soon as they wake up, they look terrible. So much for the truth? It took me a long time to read that book! 2,000 years, at the last count. If he didn't want me to read it, he could have stopped me at any time.
Do you realize that now there is not even an accurate map of this place? What the fuck... This shit is radioactive. Your Majesties, welcome to Loria. Have you seized our castle? I will put it back as soon as you change your mind about my offer.
She must really like being married. No. But then. Why get married five times? I like wearing the dress. Plus... When you wear it... Something magical happens.
Hurry up, in ten minutes we will bring champagne to the future Mr. and Mrs. Stein. Okay, we're on our way. - Take off your ring. - Yes. I'm trying but someone made me eat seven courses and I'm a little bloated. You take it off in the car.
Help me, Yolanda! Well, if you want Josh to appreciate you, you need to show him that you have other job offers. Yes! And where can I find them? Give me your resume and I'll put it online for you.
You remember that Logan is my boss, right? What if he walks by and doesn't find the couch? What if anyone else walks by and sees the couch? Gabi, Logan chose to give the couch to me out of everyone in the office. To send it back to him would be like a slap in the face. But I don't want it!
What do we know about him? No arrests, but he was kicked out of school years ago for starting ... an illegal sports betting ring. D'Andre could be the middleman. - Do you have an address? - I'm sending it to the phone now.
Sometimes I think the only thing you will ever agree on is that you won't agree on anything. You make it sound simple, but it's not. Congress still has to pass the treaty and support is weakening. They won't. They will approve it if you continue to support it.
I want to quit. What, I'm sorry, I can't, I can't do it. Elliot, listen to me. Do you know why you're so good?
I don't know exactly. I'm not sure. It just seems like he needs the money, and so I'm afraid he might get rid of that thing in a place where he shouldn't. - The bracelet? - Yeah. - Okay, do you want me to sell it?
Minister Chen is always waiting for you. Minister Chen. I'm very sorry to have kept you waiting for a long time, my assistant is away at the moment, and it's a chaotic day for everyone. It's certainly not every day that we receive a Mongolian horse as an incentive to intervene in the democratic process of a foreign nation. The... horse... It was just a congratulatory gift from Minister Sendoo, not... An act of bribery, and anyway I already promptly refused it.
Okay, but how? They are probably ten times more numerous than we are. Their soldiers may be fanatics, but they are also untrained amateurs. We can defeat them if we deal with them on our own terms. Perhaps we could use the tracker that BB removed from the glove. We throw it into their shelter, wait for the drones to respond, and take the glove away amidst the chaos.
This is ridiculous. Wallace asked me why you pushed me to take the case. I thought it was paranoid. Whatever your purpose is. It has been achieved. UIC has accepted the case and the media knows it.
Why did you make him do this? If you had touched him, you would have found out. He saved you from that and maybe from much worse. The painting is yours. he wanted you to finish it to save you.
- We need this for pee smell in the house. - Pee smell? - It smells like a big toilet. There is no pee smell in my house. You're the one who doesn't smell it, but I do, Mom, and other people too.
Okay, according to this crazy schedule, I should be with you all the time. - When am I going to get together with Geoff? - Do you see that little piece? There, there's a little piece. - You may not see it, but it says "G.S."
- Wait, what dance? Stop your head in the clouds, Dave! For God's sake. The Valentine's Day dance. It's being organized by the Robin Scouts as a fundraiser for middle school kids in East Orlando.
The shark's oil-rich liver keeps it afloat and stable in the water.
So... Look, Mom. Over there is the cheap vending machine. They give you a free lighter if you pay cash. Because of Honey's honking game, I almost missed it!
Do you really have to yell, "Not in my house" every time you intercept a shot? Well, if you keep making wimpy shots, I'll keep fending them off. What's that noise? I'm entering a contest. You have to create your own comic strip, and if the publisher likes it, they print it and give it away for free to comic stores all over the country.
- Well, then imagine that her mother with all the commitments she has, she takes time to come here, to ask for assistance, and then she is embarrassed... In front of her... her son. No, no... Do the right thing, Roger. Not for the store... But for mothers everywhere. They may not be perfect... But they are our mothers. All right. I'm going to take my phone back.... And, uh, I'll use it to call my mother.
Never mind, I carried on. I told Frankie that we went out, because there were some rascals in the parking lot, we wanted to see what they were going to do. They ran away, but they opened my car and stole my coat. That's why I don't have it now. Anyway, I gave it to charity so I won't accidentally put it on at work.
- Good. - Yeah, so... I just talked to Ron Donahue, he said. About seeing my plumber come into your house. Yeah, remember that broken pipe, a month ago? It was still giving me problems, but, Herb, he fixed it great.
Please tell me that the portrait we painted of him - it wasn't ... - Always there. "His favorite book is Good Night, Gorilla. Every time we read it, he kicks."
- Wasn't... - Always there. "His favorite book is Good Night, Gorilla. Every time we read it, he kicks." And there's a picture of you reading it to me!
- Come on. We have another thing for you, too. You used to love... This Colt's towel. Are you sure about that, Frankie? I don't recall Blake liking my lucky Colt towel. So lucky that if I don't keep it during games, the Colts lose.
Yes! Why doesn't he call? The car has been sitting for days. He must have seen the tickets. Unless... He's elderly, and he's on the floor of his house because he had a heart attack and no one knows.
Call him on the phone or I'm leaving! I can't call him. What does that mean? Look, we have a way to contact us in an emergency. I call it the Bat-Signal, and the only time I've used it since he started hiding was to tell him about our father's death.
What do we know about Darlene Jones? She is a pediatric nurse in Fredericksburg. - No record, she has never been arrested. - Is her alibi confirmed? We are verifying that now with the hospital.
My mother would have done anything to become Erica's hero. Meanwhile, Big Tasty and I began our day with an epic cartoon marathon. Did you touch my can of 4-flavor popcorn? Calm down. We're just sniffing it.
Okay, what if I stay out of it? Please don't send it out. And, print. Please stop this unbearable noise. I want to, but by now I've pressed the button and it can't be stopped. Not if I cover it up.
We're going to cut this one out. Who do you want to send it to? May. I don't know what "Barry" means. - Who do you want to send it to?
This is the kind of countryside where people can do pleasant activities like taking a walk or having a picnic. This, however, is the kind of countryside that will be my home for today. Mud. Yes, I love mud. When I say I love mud I mean I hate mud. But the people who are here with me today really love it.
- Yeah, yeah. I'll have to go out and attach the winch to a tree or a... Yes, you will go out and take the strap with you. The strap has to be wrapped around the tree to protect it. Then you take the winch up to the tree or whatever obstacle we attach it to, and I press the buttons.
So sex and drugs, is that it? But do you think about the power you have? And do you know what that power is? It is that one thing you have that every man wants. You just have to make them think they have the power, but they don't, they don't, unless you give it to them.
Would this machine be of interest to someone outside the hospital? Not to my knowledge. Do you think someone from the hospital took it? I don't think anything. I wouldn't be surprised if someone just borrowed it.
It was an epiphany, so I designed the project. People had no idea how little it takes. Now many people do. - Everyone has read the article. - 731 people have read it.
- No, no, this I will not do. - If you want I'll give you the money back. - I don't want the money, I want my painting. Then ask someone else for it. I will never paint it again.
- The king spoke through him. - As if he were a ventriloquist. - I want my painting! - Then ask someone else for it. - I will never paint it again.
Do you have any idea what your life would have been like if you had been charged with murder when you were 5 years old? Yeah, well, you know what? The orphanage would have been better than this shit. You think so? Maybe one time I'll tell you about it.
- It will take out those and the other cells. - Yeah, but they are not easy to recover. - Nah, my friend Nick can help us. - Good. I'll make the plan more concrete when I tell Baz and Pope.
- Why do we not consider the seasonal Yarkovsky effect when calculating the probability of impact? Because the heliocentric orbit ... is much larger than the geocentric one. - Therefore, the closer we get to the planet... - The smaller its influence. So the predicted close pass became a direct impact. Exactly. So how do we prevent it?
- The amount of salt, the few bacteria, etc. Yes, so since El Jefe turned into Tutankhamen in two weeks, that means he died within 48 hours of his departure. Mitchie-is this murder? Leave me alone. Yes, it works better when Rosie does it, doesn't it?
Is it magnificent? You deserve to be the captain. Being a captain is more than a job. It's about who you are. And when they offer you that job, I will make sure you take it.
Can I talk to you about the costume you're wearing? Those bracelets-they're my late grandmother's. And this was the costume I wore on our honeymoon. Let's start with the basics, do you have a name? Do you?
Like I'm holding on to you like we're flying on a magic carpet. We could, but my dick can't--. - It can't stretch or go around or--. - No. Why don't we do it--like this?
The shield cannot withstand this much power! We may not be strong enough to beat this monster! - Hang in there. - Ulaz? I will destroy it from the inside!
Maybe the reason why... I got so upset is because.... A small part of me is afraid that he was right. It can't know. I grew up bouncing between foster homes, to me anyone who didn't slap me around was mother of the year. Oh, my God. The one thing I'm sure of is that if you had a son, you would love him to death.
Valerie is loved by all the guests. Me, not so much. Do you have an office or a desk or anything else you can look at? A cabinet. I'll open it for you.
With difficulty, sir. We live among the boxes. It will work out. Change is always difficult and if we want progress.... Maybe you call it progress, I call it wasting police time.
This is chief inspector Gently. Inspector Bacchus. Sergeant Coles. What were the workers doing when they found the body? We throw garbage in there, but a German company wants to buy us and they're very fussy about workplace safety, so we're cleaning it up.
A few months before Alistair's death there was an accident. A fire at the plant. And guess who wrote the internal report? Tommy Norton. The first thing he did as general manager. Alistair countersigned it.
The young man who ran over? He was just a boy. I yell at him to get off the road, but he doesn't even see me coming. I close my eyes, but I hear him hit the car. That sound-I will hear it for the rest of my life.
- I don't want to be a woman. Sometimes, I think that wearing their clothes allows me to understand them better. The truth is, I don't know where this desire comes from. It just is. And even if I hide it from bigots, I won't deny myself the feelings it brings.
Because it is not seed powder, but it is a mushroom! Claviceps Purpurea, commonly known as Ergot! With increasing humidity in the vault, Ergot spores formed! - Turning on the fans, the fungus spread. - Who breathed it in?
I... I definitely see sex differently now, I don't know. In school the boys were constantly infatuated with sex and I ... I don't know. I see it completely differently now.
Enough said. We are friends. And Van is separating us. I'll put an end to this. * A pig you buried and then ate is a local dish * It's not trivial at all. #
Yes, but it all happened so fast. I just -- I just reacted. Exactly. You reacted to what you saw. A man attacking her mother. As for the rifle, she has no idea whether her mother saw it or not.
Parabiosis? Are you kidding? Is it taking blood even from babies? No, it's just plasma. Mud, parabiosis means he is treating young blood - and using it for transfusions.
- Do you know what the Ikea effect is? - I'm about to find out. It's a cognitive distortion, where a buyer considers an item they've worked for to be more valuable. Like a piece of furniture that needs to be assembled. People like it more if they make it.
No, I mean on Usher. The corpse is really well preserved except for the extremities due to frostbite. But the dental records are intact. Our colleagues in Antarctica are giving full cooperation, and the corpse will be in our possession within the next 12 hours. - I will have it transferred after customs.
Great. Although I'm not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig. When you get the machine you can find out. Maybe I could use it to figure out why women keep dumping me. You don't need a machine for that, just send a questionnaire to all your exes, saying if they fill it out they could win a prize.
We have a problem. Of course we do. We raised two daughters who give up. No, look! You can see the wine in my windowsill. And why didn't you put it at home, to see if your clothes covered it?
This is the special cure for my abuela's fever. Pass me the dried scorpion, please. - Do you have to eat it? - No, don't be silly. I wrap it in a dishcloth and lay it on my head.
Well, thank you Manny for letting me tighten the last bolt. Maybe next time you can teach me how to fight? Yeah, sure! Wow. Cam found it upstairs.
Naomi -- if we don't get to the bottom of this -- you may not make it. We don't know, but there may not be much time. Naomi, no. - Naomi, you're not going anywhere. - No. Yeah, well, if I have little time left, I'm not going to spend it in here.
They will remove it and check it to make sure it doesn't appear again. Now, I know that sounds scary, Naomi, but you're going to be okay. Well, you saved my life again. Did you use that humidifier the night before your paralysis? Yes, before all this happened, I used it every night.
So, as I said the fiberglass installations around the transducer were scattered all over the access tunnel, so anyone who went in there will have remnants of fiberglass in their nasal cavities. I checked Wu, his nose was clean. So he is innocent. So who killed Bobby Huff? Take your expropriation and shove it up your ass!
- Hey, we got into this to make money, provide for our families. I don't want to go to jail for that. Shoot him. Throw him overboard. The currents will carry the body to the bottom of the ocean. They will never see him again.
The tutoring, the mentoring of him, the. Getting him away from football for art school. Do you think they love each other? I think they are convinced they love each other. I'm telling you now, Chunk... We're going to win this case. And we're going to win it the right way.
He has a crush on the teacher. Tell Cable to check what he has been doing for the past few days. It's impossible for him to be as virtuous as he says. He did a breathtaking drawing of the Brooklyn Bridge. And, I don't know how, he had drawn it from my favorite point of view.
- I'll do it. - I don't think it's a good idea. - Why not? Well, because, first, you assaulted Beck during the balcony appearance and second -- you've been an asshole all day. Robert's going to do it.
But I can tell you where he keeps it. What the hell? Hey, you have no right to come into my-. A search warrant doesn't have to knock. I have no idea what you're looking for, but I guarantee you won't find it.
So he threatened him to call the police. And he took me back home, and he smashed my computer with a hammer, he smashed my cell phone with a hammer, and he said, "If you try to do this again, I will smash your fingers with a hammer." It was a difficult year. I call it "The Sad Times." He had ... taken this dog leash and attached it to a pair of handcuffs, and he attached the handcuffs to the bed, and ... kept them, it was almost for two weeks.
- Let me guess, you drive a Prius. I ride a bicycle. Everybody should do that. We only have one planet. And the city's Transportation Commission is destroying it?
Did I perhaps say something wrong? Was it maybe the part about the dead wife? No, it's just that. How can you compete with a memory? Memories are always better than reality. Like when you like breast milk as a child, then you drink it as an adult and wonder, "What's so special about that?"
The polyethylene fabric and positive air pressure will simulate the bubble. It will protect it, but it will need something to make it breathe. An oxygen tank won't fit under a Hazmat suit. Paige? Get another earpiece and tell Ada's father to sterilize it so she can communicate with us once inside the Hazmat suit. - I'll do it right away. - I take the filter from the regulator, put it in the small reservoir of the mask to plug the holes with sterile gauze, and voila. He will breathe filtered air.
Toby, it's ready. Plug it in. One moment. Can I talk to Ada for a moment? - Yes. - Ada? I've been thinking about the preliminary code, and I think I can create an algorithm to synthesize the world genetic data in such a way that even if there's only one compatible marrow out there for you, I'll find it.
Gunshot wound. Hemiclavicular line, left fifth intercostal space. - What does that mean? - That if we don't take him to the hospital, he's dead. I'll take him by helicopter, send him back to you as soon as possible.
- What do you want to do? - A wasp bomb! - Why did I ask that? - The moss on the tree is damp, we can make smoke, which makes the bees docile. Let's cut the nest, - and take it to the camp.
We're on our way! I may have a concussion. Stop being a baby. What the fuck? I'm going to take that meter and shove it up your...
In return I want you and yours to leave my daughter alone. Forever. O? No "or." You know a good deal when it presents itself, and I'm only proposing it once.
I don't even know him. I think you do. Calvin, I think you are the one who runs the game in here. You decide when to help and you decide when to look away, and you have a lot of friends, and they are afraid of you, so they play along with your little game. Like you said, they don't fight it.
Not all women lacked three liters. Some were only one. The healthier the victim was, the more blood was taken from her. It is as if she is experimenting. Maybe she has some kind of disorder and thinks that using the healthiest blood possible will cure it.
- Give me your wallet. - No way, I don't trust it. Very good, you're learning. I need the wallet though, that's part of it, so give it to me. I'll give it back in a minute, you'll get it back.
Where is she? What are you doing with my daughter's phone? I don't know. I just found it, okay? A lot of Coyote Ugly style girls came, and one of them left it here.
If you do me this favor, you will be a hero. Just like King Arthur when he drew his sword from the stone. Oh, yes! Oh, God, this is so embarrassing. I'm so sorry, but it's been 500 years. It's your big moment and I'm ruining it.
It will never happen, man. Hashtag: just saying. I'm not blind, brother. That's how they do it. They wait for you to like them, then they rip your heart out and peel it like a big old Babybel....
Oh, honey, don't you understand? Your magic is useful because it is unstable. You want to be loved and prove your worth so desperately that your heart is in turmoil. Well, don't make that surprised face. Anyone would understand that.
Man, you don't owe me anything, really. Look -- me and my last team were together -- for five years. And I thought ... that that ... was where I belonged. And I lost it. I know how you feel. So as for your place -- I was just keeping it warm for you.
Withrow beat your bid. Seven times. At one point I was curious to see how far he would go. And he won. The next day he sent me the flight log with a handwritten note saying he didn't want it after all.
It is common to confuse similar words using voice recognition apps. "What" and "home," "goes" and "does," "except" and "accept." Get to the positive part, the part where I'm right. Okay. The app works like this. You say the content of your email, which is sent to a server that translates it into text and sends it back.
- Vaguely spotted clothing. - And that's fine. Two weeks ago we heard rumors that Flaco Ruiz could perhaps identify a big shot in the Flores cartel's money laundering business. All I'm telling you is that it was important enough for us to locate the meeting right away. And who else knew about it?
Let's say. can turn on -- and turn off anything I want, or almost anything. I mean, not really everything, but -- you know, it depends on how I program it. It's going to make us rich, Ma. A few more finishing touches and I'll sell the patent to the Pentagon. They will use it in the war. They'll be able to defuse--or detonate bombs from miles away.
Karen. Hey. I've decided I want to keep my thesis project after all. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. We already took it to the dumpsters.
- Is it okay for the student group that invited Shiloh McCullen to pay to give her that stage? She doesn't come here for free, you know. - Even progressive speakers get paid. - It doesn't matter. She doesn't get it.
Yes. Dr. Ken will receive all his patients in there. We'll make it look legit. Too legal to give up, baby. And you're going to run it. What do you think?
Do you need a break? Do you want some water? I've missed you too, Felix. You're also missing a lot of balls. I think you were doing better in the field when you were using it to get the girls there.
Maybe for three seconds. So, in a crowded room, after drinking and taking pills, with the music blaring and the lights flashing, she actually managed to see and recognize a ring on a stranger's finger? I saw it! And I saw his face! I will never forget it.
I don't want to say that. Do you really pay that much? I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is. You don't know how much your rent is? My father pays it!
Until the most recent victim, the targets were people who excelled in college. If the killer was an academic failure, this might be his way of blowing off steam. There are aspects of his ritual that support this theory. And all of the victims were facing the geographic or geoted north. It is a geographical term, but we think the SI is using it more in a philosophical sense.
In the Situation Room. Is this about the smuggling ring? The CIA found another cargo flight carrying contraband. E'... that's a good thing, right? Not if they force it to land.
Oh my. See you tomorrow. Leon. Hi. It's a nice little story. That's -- your closet was broken, I was fixing it with the drill, and it was making a lot of noise. And when they came, I ...
And we won't leave until you tell us. Okay. Here's the truth. You have... Meddled in something much, much bigger than you, okay? If I screw up the job I'm doing, if you guys screw it up for me, then he's going to... He's going to kill me.
Maybe for three seconds. So, in a crowded room, after drinking and taking pills, with the music blaring and the lights flashing, she actually managed to see and recognize a ring on a stranger's finger? I saw it! And I saw his face! I will never forget it.
I started working with Bobby. He hired me to film the West Side a couple of months ago. So, for a little bit of money all morality goes ... out the window? No ... I began to understand how he thought. If your neighborhood goes up in flames, the least you can do is let the rest of the world see it. And yes... he was making a good living.
If I cannot violate Ferrara, I am sure I can violate her. I should have known I could not bribe her. Valentina will always be loyal to the Doge. Her power depends on him. - Well, if that's true, I wouldn't call it power.
This could be the one. Let's do it in the garage. It's a little cold, but we can put on our sweater and take off our pants. Look, it's his phone. Now I'm going to push it with my knee into the pizza box.
And Trevor probably doubled his fee. It was also a nice way to make sure the Nelsons didn't back down. All right, let's get him and bring him to us. Okay, I have his address. I'll send it to you right away.
Each one endowed, by its creator, with certain injelabili... - Inalienable... - Inalienable rights. She had been practicing, coming here. Maybe she doesn't hear that sound... But I hear it.
Well, you don't represent the people any more than I do. Out there we are a minority, but not in here. Maybe you don't agree, but I think we could do more by working together. And what would we work together for? You and your mother see this country the same way the politicians have been seeing it for 250 years, as if--if there was this ideal America somewhere and it was out of our reach.
Get an anti-contamination team here right away. I think he was given something toxic. What? Is it radiation? "The past is never where we left it."
In 1918, he survived an assassination attempt. When he discovered that the bullets had been soaked in poison, he became obsessed. He created a secret laboratory called the "special room." Its sole purpose was to turn poisonous substances into anonymous weapons, and that laboratory still exists. Putin uses it. Yes.
- Jane. Don't worry. Next week, we will meet and I will tell you what I have observed. Maybe I'll send him an email. That way, if he wants more context, he will find it in his inbox.
I had forgotten about Scott's secret diary! - And I think Petra did, too. - How did you get it? Hi. Why did she have it?
The way I feel, I cannot represent Rogelio. - But... - What? Ask for a continuance. The judge will grant it because your lawyer is resigning.
Yes, several. Because writing means exposure, and exposure means feeling vulnerable. And exposure goes through stages. First you write the book. Then you sell it.
Excuse me. Did Kathy always have a crucifix? Yes, Mother gave it to her. Do you know where it is? Did you find it among her things?
What about the crane that built this thing? It takes hours to set it up. - An inflatable? - Not from that height. Besides, what would we do it with?
We're not going to throw it, we're going to fly it. Get the tarp from the flatbed, I'll look for a heat source to seal the seam. The heat from this lighter should do the trick. Would you mind including me, Sly? Let's build a balloon and fill it with methane.
Oh, she's gone. Is she gone for the day, or is she still...? - Gone, "gone?" - She's really gone. But the important thing is that Patel is out.... And you're in. The counselor position is yours if you want it.
So you two can't... But back to the case. So Dr. Hollywood... Did he put botulinum in Broden's coconut water? I mean, that would explain Broden's asphyxiation. Dr. Hollywood puts botulinum in the coconut water, Broden drinks it, goes into asphyxiation, dies, and then the ex... Shoots him.
Nothing unusual; the people I deal with change identities quite often. He told me he wanted my help selling a book that belonged to a pirate. So you put it up for sale on his behalf. No, not really. He didn't want me to auction it, he wanted me to offer it directly to a man named Farhan Al-Asmari.
They will publish it soon. They are trying to build suspense. I brought you a gift. The person who made it really loves her baby, and she put that love into every seam. So when you wear it. You might feel it too.
- Come here. Honey, I love you. I came to say I'm sorry about your teacher. Some people can be good and bad at the same time. They should know that the whole world is waiting, so why haven't they published it already?
We need to know--the time, where you can park, the address. Print it all out, okay? You got it. And, put on Jesse's new song. Loud so we can hear it, too.
Very popular in the 1960s, when agents were all licensed operators--and they knew the Morse alphabet well. The good old days. Don't underestimate the power ... of shortwave receivers, Mr. Callen. Hetty, these are public frequencies. If you broadcast a message, everyone hears it.
Well, there is not a shred of evidence on the phone. It doesn't sound like good news. It doesn't sound like news at all. Well, we're getting there. He probably only uses it for specific purposes, like contacting members of the Xionshou Song network.
Thank you. - Hey. - So ... Michelle's body was recovered by the police. They found it in a van -- left where the bus was hijacked. They're taking it to the morgue.
Great, I'm happy for you. Yes, that's - you're there, my parents are there, - she'll be fine. - Without any doubt. - And that daycare sounds great. - It is! I went to take a look and they were very careful not to let a strange childless man peek through the windows.
There is a woman in accounting who seems to be doing her best. The booster is a baby seat. Bar a piece of the spaceship. Whether you agree with it or not. - You put it in the back seat.
My God... I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it! Damn it! - Take your name back! - I don't want it!
They could not be used for propaganda. Too brutal. Too much carnage. Capra was in Washington, where he anxiously awaited the material. His team packaged it into a newsreel that was released in theaters across the country.
When her father was killed, Cortes, the conquistador, took her in and gave her a land, a new religion, - a new name. - Who exactly do you think you're talking to? Do you think you are the only murderer in here? If you say my daughter's name one more time, I'll carve it into your skull.
Help! Help! Help! I keep... Thinking that I should do the whole speech in Dutch. Well, the Koningsdag speech is usually given in English. But anyway, we never did it via computer, so....
I haven't eaten anything in two weeks. No one has eaten your pot roast, Dougie, as for shark meat. Yours looks like the kind of courage that comes from a stomach full of red meat. Now I turn around... I count to ten... And I want whoever ate the pot roast to put it back.... And I won't ask any questions.
I'm telling you because of that. I don't know, but I know what I saw! Lindsey Vaughn? From the case in Chula Vista 10 years ago? - You remember.
I will love you forever. Mom. Gideon... I know it's not easy... To talk about Belle. But this book... It meant so much to her, and she wanted you to have it.
- You did it. - More or less. It won't last long. Don't worry, the Black Fairy took his heart, Gold will find it, and everything will be fine.
Gold will find it and everything will be fine. I appreciate your optimism, but we have to go. Do you think his heart is down here? I know my mother. This is where she would hide it.
- But I needed the body. Alive, dead -- I don't give a shit. Because until we capture every single supernatural entity you let into the Triangle, I'm stuck in this cesspool of a city. Willa is the Earp who let the scum in. I'm the one who played them to the tentacle and sent it back sliced up.
I want to take another look around. If the concrete had hit the car as it went under the bridge, the car would have gone forward again before it hit the sidewalk and caromed. Do you think a piece might have fallen off and hit the windshield? Maybe. Or, someone knocked it down.
I want to know what you think they can get out of Brookwell. Whatever it takes to put more faces.... On our board. The clock is ticking. I need operational information on whoever is doing the evidence recovery. What do you mean they're not there yet? Homeland Security doesn't see that as a threat.
I was just -- I was just trying to be less impulsive. Well... I'm a good soldier. I follow orders. You needed time. - I'm giving it to you.
Loretta, I need to know what. Judging by the severe head trauma and bleeding in the ears, nose, and mouth.... There is no doubt that Campbell died from the impact. Immediately before he jumped he complained of pain in his head. Any idea what was causing it?
Wait. Where did you get that fluid? Come on. Well: I found this compound that alters the nervous system, okay? It makes the demon think it's in a dying body, so it abandons it. And then what?
- What? They're looking for something. Yeah, a seal. Old news. What happens if they break it?
- No, no, no. If it's a cradle you want, I'll buy you a cradle. God, I wonder if I'm sober enough to sell my blood. Who cares. Whoever gets it is going to have a great time.
I needed the magnet. - And I needed the power. - I'm on it! Okay, I'll put the magnet under the piston. And when Toby hits it with the current, we'll have the Lorentz force, which increases the speed of the piston to the point that...
As soon as we remove this giant space rock from our scanners, we can locate Captain Marvel and take back both her and your companions. I'm on it. It looks like the asteroid is destabilizing. I can't risk shrinking it. Then we won't touch it until you and Tony have scanned it.
You cannot defeat us. Because we are of one mind! Do you share the brain? I understand that. Of the two of you, which one is using it now?
Stent implanted. All right, let's take one last look. You can press the pedal. Dr. Bardovi? I don't know what's wrong with the pedal, I'm pressing it.
That's right, either it bounced in the middle part of the trunk, or it moved going up through the venous system. Good. Give him an LPD. An LPD? A diagnostic peritoneal lavage. We'll insert a needle into the abdomen, fill it with fluid, then drain it to see if there's internal bleeding.
I can't. Listen, we don't move forward with Eli, so tell me you found something about the children or their adoptive mother. I wish I could, but they seem to have faded away. The music teacher, any idea why Eli was looking for him? He is on vacation in Rio, had no idea why Eli was outside his home, and the men who took Amber's body from the morgue did so using false transfer papers.
- That's a pretty high possibility. - Relax, Gamora. Now, if I know Yondu, and... I know Yondu, he will have hidden the sarcophagus in a hiding place of his own until he gets a good deal. We have to check them all until we find it.
- Hold on, hold on, Clay. Use the stick. The stick? That means it's your turn. You can only speak when you hold it.
Go to the back. Go to the back. - I don't see any rats here. - Calm down, Dean. We'll get him.
I'm really glad you're here. - Thank you. - I need your phone. My phone -- why? You'll get it back at the end of the session.
Why do you want her? She's not that great! Hey, there you are, Can you tell your daughter that you're not so great? Did you wear my perfume? It was next to mine. I accidentally picked it up and spilled it on myself.
Once, but then I became "the girl who flirted with daddy" and it crushed my career.... And a marriage. And that's why everyone was so confused at your parents' wedding. I don't understand. For ten minutes she laughed with this thing and now, out of nowhere, she hates it.
If one could, I would not spend so much time on the toilet. These cocoons are even more boring than the eponymous "Larvageddon." Boring? Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar is self-digesting. If you opened it... All the caterpillar's guts would come out.
- It's gone. This is agent Elizabeth Keen with the FBI. Need an ambulance, priority three. There were three men. I didn't see the body at first, just ... a rolled up rug or tarp, but when they loaded it into the van ... it was ...
We confiscated his workshop. So he stole his own. But his memories, the night of the fire ... He took them away 25 years ago. That's why we need him to get it back.
I should not have abandoned him. We should have fought together. No, you were right to do as he told you. Thanks to you -- the book is safe. Now we will take it to your mother.
And it is indeed. Your book of fairy tales. Or what's left of it. Impossible. My mother would never burn it.
Henry. Let's go. - You've made it. - Not really, it won't hold for long. The Black Fairy has her heart, Gold will get it back.
- Everything will be fine. - I appreciate the optimism, but we have to go. Do you think her heart is down here? I know my mother. This is where she would hide it.
- Is everything okay? - No. The satellite has begun the preliminary launch sequence. What? No, no, no, no. I will never violate it in time.
What did she do? Was she slow to put the money in the bag? - Did she try to activate the alarm? - I didn't rob any bank. I wouldn't want to catch a charge and go to jail until my old age. You know, what disappoints me is that you and your friends stole half a million tax-free and spend it on pussy?
The detective in charge of the case told us that Pettigrew was a suspect in the abduction and murder case of a young victim who was sexually assaulted. They questioned him, but could not arrest him. They didn't have enough evidence. Do you think this guy is a pedophile? The Detroit detective thought so.
No, yes, yes. I'm fine... Listen, I need to talk to you about next semester. The company said your phone interview went great. The job is yours if you want it.
And Leah would survive leukemia. I offered her the surgery; she refused it. Wait. You said doing the surgery on bypass would carry risks. - What if we did it without bypass?
But mine are not. You are stealing the code. Every day Harris is given a new authorization code by which he consents to the transfer of radioactive material. Now, I can access the ISSR facility but I can't get to the uranium without that code. At midnight he deactivates. And he keeps it in his briefcase unlocked by biometric recognition.
"More than two light years from home, "trapped and alone on the dark side of the planet "that still had no name." Have you read my book. "The Dark Side." And now you are quoting it.
In the coming months, to us, intellectuals, academics... Scientists, and... Our author, was asked, by Darius Tanz, to select one hundred and sixty people... To colonize Mars. Counterintelligence has traced the source of the attack. They call it a simulated signal.
Scientists, and... Our author, was asked, by Darius Tanz, to select one hundred and sixty people... To colonize Mars. Counterintelligence has traced the source of the attack. They call it a simulated signal. A satellite signal that hooks into a classified signal, and then disables it.
When you thought I was a criminal, did you ever think we would be working together? And who says you are not? What I don't understand is why you chose to hide the trigger in an app. Just in case? If someone checked the phone, they wouldn't find out.
Is Tina a man's name? Yes, it is short for Christina. You're right, it's just disgusting. You don't bake the bread. I'll get it.
Do you really think they will like your brown rectangle of land with one little house? Excuse me, but this is an authentic replica of an average interchange station. And it is not a small house. It is a warehouse where workers can have the eight hours off between shifts imposed by OSHA. So, yes, I think the children will love it.
It took us years to turn that break room into something special that was comfortable. A place with so many stains that new ones went unnoticed. Where the couch cushions were so worn, they fit all butts, big and small. - Flat or juicy. - Juicy? - Gross. - We made a masterpiece and you amateurs, you flushed it down the toilet and ... "Skirplash."
Sorry. We have to keep the couch nice, clean and expensive. One does what one can. Oh, yes we do. We'll do it on the whole couch. - I mean we'll fix it up.
Touch√©. Well, let's go die. Headquarters Lieutenant Hawkins 10:42 a.m. This place is great ... - I've always wanted to work undercover. - I know. We're at a secret site, Rosa. I bet they call it something cool.
As I thought. The mortgage is paid off. You can give this place to whoever you want, I don't care. In fact, I do care. Don't give it to Hitchcock,
all men...are created equal and endowed with certain...inalienable rights! This is what America is made of! You either love her or you better leave! You either love her or you better leave. Now take this stick and hit it and candy will come out.
All right, girls, I'll try to be as gentle as possible, but it looks like someone has lost her rectum on the stairs. So whose is it? Be honest. All right, never mind. But let's put this rule: if you have a prolapse and you lose your rectum on the stairs, then you also have to pick it up.
And second, if you have something to say to Paige, you need to grow up and tell her yourself! Happy, have you found a solution? We may have something. The fire department also takes care of the airport, so they have a canister of high-expansion foam to put out fires. We take the nozzle off the hose, Cabe sticks it between the cracks in the rocks, and you'll have to tie the end of the hose and put it under the rocks that are blocking you.
- What the. - You can't see the bride! My dress is in San Jose. I found a gorgeous one. But it was over budget, put it on and then we return it.
Radio... Atmospheric front... In the Pacific. - Ah, no kidding? - We already knew that. He ruined the fire. The ship won't see it when it passes in a few minutes.
What's up? - Hi, Chloe. - Didn't you see my calls? Never mind. The Sudanese have confirmed Mitchell's poor condition. They will tell the press.
A fighter jet should hook it up in a minute, sir. But we'd be too close to the city. We have Minister Bellucci on the line. Mr. President, our fighters are almost in position to destroy the drone. Minister Bellucci, this is Elizabeth McCord. We have reason to believe that there may be a biological weapon in the drone. If you hit it over a populated area, you could cause an epidemic.
Thank you. You're welcome. How much do I owe you? Oh, I don't know, how about a million dollars? Okay, but don't cash it in until Friday.
Heck, what kind of family would we be if we didn't support Mom's dreams? - That's fine with me. - Yeah, we should... You know what? Of course we'll read it.
Brioche, good choice, Rebecca. That's right, I learned your name. I learned everybody's name. Emily-I've thought about it. Even if you lost the game, and the office is mine and I can do whatever I want with it, I'll still let you have it.
FBI Director James Comey announced new investigation into Clinton's mail server. Hillary Clinton the corrupt. The small gap in the polls perhaps stems from the FBI director's announcement. Trump has led the country to collapse. Tomorrow the voters will take him back.
Okay, stay down... When you hear my signal, - hit the switch. - What's the signal? I haven't thought about it yet; you'll know it when you hear it.
Speak anonymously, but do it, because as soon as you start, it will become easier. And know that there is life beyond what you are experiencing at that moment. Swear that things get better. And that there is a future made of incredible things waiting for you. But if you leave, you won't be able to.... You will never see it.
even within the walls there's a future. this is the worst ... Why did this power end up in the hands of the worst possible person? We have to take it back... May I say -- without a doubt the only person in the world I wish Eren didn't have it -- is you! you of all people!
I could give them gummy worms from my secret hiding place to make them feel better. A secret hiding place? Is that why there were ants a week ago? Look at this. We'll tell the landlord.
Long Sol. I'm here to give Mr. Gunderson the shot. Boy, the idea of "putting him in a coma" was just to talk over dinner, I didn't give you the signal. You touched your nose. I was scratching it.
That he can't talk to anyone about it now. They never know anything. "Do you know anything about this bitch?" "Eh, she has a phobia of coins." "So we think someone was throwing handfuls of change in her face." "Otherwise, no." You take this random dog and put it inside the house with your family and watch its personality reveal itself.
She could not... Try... By the time you're there. Was there by any chance a sign that said "A goddess dive"? Ever colored an Easter egg? It doesn't take a genius. You dip it, then turn it over and dip it again.
Whoo! It came out when the country was very different from now in whatever year you are in. In any case... It was a whole different thing. This building is gone now. You're looking at it from a dusty stuff in the rubble.
Well, Fessler has a nicer butt. The trial period is over, here are your performance evaluations. Take a look at them. Happy with it? Sign. - They're positive, right? - The job is yours if you want it.
If you get to too successful, it's something that. You feel ugly. Being a salesman, going around talking and selling the film, was the part of the business he was least comfortable with.... He really had a hard time. He wanted success -- and when he achieved it, he didn't want it.
At first, I was a little taken aback, because I had to say it or he would look anyway. He didn't seem to be aware. He just got better at it. Scene after scene, he tried to achieve a goal. There's a goal he was trying to achieve, and when he achieves it, it's wonderful.
- What? Strip it off. I really wish we had never done that. I won't be able to forget his naked body. I mean, the size of that thing. If you make a cast of it, you can use it as an umbrella stand.
What, you throw in a little potato or a little pepper, close it. The steam pressure pushes it into the hole and seals it. Same thing with the egg. You crack it inside and it cooks as it goes to the hole.
- I'm going out tonight. - Where are you going? To a simple club. What club? Ah, I don't know, I haven't decided.
- You would have destroyed it anyway. - Are you in or not? - Where are we going? - To a club in Dallas. The place is all yours, but the chick who runs it though.... well, I've been trying to fuck her for months.
No. Absolutely not. We did the math, okay? I mean, the secret of who wrote the book benefits sales, absolutely. But even if someone revealed it would be just as good.
You're dead, bitch. Looks like someone fucked you, my dear. She's with us. Drop the knife. Get out of here. Before I stick it in your eye!
- Yes. So it will have a diameter of more or less one meter, right? Yes, more or less. Why? Let's say your snake exists-but no one finds it because no one sees it.
First-they strike them dead and then slowly eat them. Other animals swallow prey whole. The anglerfish, some kinds of frogs. This snake may have borrowed their tricks. Yes, but if it can do all this--how do we find it?
Wait, do you guys know each other? Well, Donald was the public face of Raymond's manhunt when he was on the run with Elizabeth Keen. Everybody in my world knows Donald Ressler. We are here to make a deal with you. If there's a deal to be made-I'll make it with Officer Ressler.
That arm you won't be able to use anymore. But it's the left arm, I know you use the right. I know because we have been working together for a good 11 years. I know that your wife has diabetes. That your daughter's favorite animal is the hippo. I know you love Chinese food, that you eat it every Wednesday when you have it with your mistress at her house, which is above the WuFat Noodle House restaurant.
Excuse me? Yesterday, Roy told my colleagues that he was following the husband of one of your clients. We would like to know this man's name. Why? Do you think he has something to do with this? That is a possibility we are exploring. Given the work you do here and the kind of clients you do it for, this man may have hidden millions from his wife.
Also counting Clay Nelson is not the only sports star I've seen recently. Nobody cares about Tyler Perati, man. It is the demigod Clay Nelson that the public is crying for. I talked to the minister of sports and the premier this morning. Look, when the mandate is ready, if we think it can hold up, we will present it.
One year, when Janet was ... eight or nine years old, her tooth fell out. She told us that she didn't believe in the tooth fairy at all. And I told her, "Of course there is a tooth fairy." And she said if I was right, then the tooth fairy would know where the tooth was, wherever she hid it. So, that night ... she pulled it out of the glass of water on her bedside table, and I had to wait until she was asleep, sneaking around in the dark in her room to look for it.
I kept it for years. Yes, it was in a box of gown cufflinks. - Did you find it? - Yes. I searched for months. I looked everywhere, but I knew you had put it aside.
No, I just try to keep mine and my family's safe. I have seen the Widows destroy the second seal. It requires an evil I'm not sure you can appeal to. Well, you saw me before drinking the coffee, right? And if you break it, and if Clootie resurrects, how do you intend to kill the demon so powerful that Wyatt himself failed to bury forever?
- Come on. - What are you afraid of? - Hell, woman. I just... - asked you to shoot me. - Doc, listen to me. If we don't break the seal, the Widows will find it and kill you anyway.
Amado has the power. I know them, G√ºero. They won't sit on their hands. One with sugar. No, I don't want that.
- Is he also in the Peace Corps? - Yes! So why for next Saturday.... Okay, hold on. City Hall? It takes a wedding! - Why don't we do it at my BB?
No, I'm sorry, I don't have time to be good now. It's our business card. Let us know if you see it. - What is it? - I'm not sure yet--but I can feel it in my stomach.
So, Mercedes attacked Nicole. Why? The widow Mercedes thought Nicole had the third seal. Impossible. She is safe, and it is the only thing keeping Clootie from rising. The Widows will not find it. Never.
I mean, to me it came back pretty normal. This guy here can't complain. It's like stuffing a cork back into a bottle. It almost doesn't fit. Subspedia Our subtitles for your TV shows It's not malicious, but I'm glad they took it out.
I need Mike to drop the case. Should I withdraw my word because your client is bullying? It's just a pro bono case. You can drop it. If I give you a task, you do it.
I know you didn't feel valued at Pearson Specter, and I want to apologize for having any part in that. Also. I want you to know that it was never my intention to fire you. I hope you are not here to offer me the job back. What if I said yes? I would tell you that I don't want it.
Certainly not. Doctor, maybe you would like to, you know. Explain yourself better. No, I meant my carving wood. I had left it right here.
- We still don't know who is involved. The president, anyone... Anyone could be guilty -- or innocent. I can't believe that Harris would be -- complicit in something so bad. If NASA launches the gravity vehicle, Russia will blow it up in the sky, they will think we are using another asteroid as a weapon.
The president, anyone... Anyone could be guilty -- or innocent. I can't believe that Harris would be -- complicit in something so bad. If NASA launches the gravity vehicle, Russia will blow it up in the sky, they will think we are using another asteroid as a weapon. But if Tanz Industries launched it as a private unit with Russia's oversight....
I came close to becoming the official voice of CBS. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but your audition for CBS was extraordinary. Could you repeat it for the audience? I don't know if they would want to hear it. I would have done it anyway.
And so we come to tonight. Over the years I have written several shows for Gil and myself. - George, do you remember the first one? - Our first show? I'll never forget it.
Did you keep memorabilia from your films, things that were special to you? Would you tell us what? I have my costume from The Three Amigos! - Do you ever wear it? - Do I wear it?
You know that massage parlor where they jerk off 44th and 8th? What's it called, Shake Shack? Yeah, you walk into this wacky place and we'll shake it for you, but outside there are just families waiting in line. While waiting you can stick an anal vibrator up your ass. So I took this thing and shoved it up my prostate. While I was shaking it a little bit.
Woman. I need to talk to you about something. - About what? - About the fact that I'm pissed off. What happened? I gave an assignment to Stephanie Patel, and she passed it on to someone else.
Actually, I'm very sorry. Excuse me, Stephanie, I'm talking to you. It doesn't matter what year you're from. I run the associates. If I give you a task, you do it.
Start up! I am Groot. You're right, man. Next time we don't ask. We'll just take the helmet and pocket it.
No one is on anyone's side. We're just trying to protect the little boy. I wore that helmet once and its powers almost destroyed me. - You have to give it up. - Absolutely not! Since then the helmet has been fixed and no one will take it away from you.
Maintain training. What is he doing? He is becoming SuperNova! That glow... It's not the first time I've seen it.
- Katie. - No. Have you decided what the color of fall will be? I'm still looking for it. It's like I see it out of the corner of my eye, but when I turn around and look at it -- it disappears.
Can I say, "Pathetic?" Put that thing down. Hey, honey, did you remember the fan? - It's hot as hell in those bungalows. - No, I thought you were taking it.
Darmani Rock! I regret leaving the ring like that, but I wanted the Golden Boy fucking award. I never won it. I fought and won 12 national championships for this country and I never won the best boxer award. Statistically, you get it one time in ten, and I've won 12.
It's not a memory problem. That thruster requires the shell of a unique crystal to work. We extracted that crystal from a meteorite that Darius owns. And it's the only one of that kind on the whole Earth. It's the most important and unique device in human history, and no one from Tanz Industries has thought to properly vet the man who builds it?
- Okay. - You need to check the invitation responses. Oh, and my smoothie. I need my milkshake. I'll get it for you right away.
Well, believe me, no one is more surprised than I am about where this has gone. I know. You have this idea of the kind of writer you should be, but -- don't let that stop you from being the kind of writer you could be. Yeah. - All right. - We're uploading it right now.
Did I say... - something wrong? - I don't... My God, how long did I sleep? I had an incredible nap. I really enjoyed it.
Oh, yes. I like this room, too. It's where I do all my deep thinking. Man, I still can't believe it.... La Fionna -- in my bathroom, touching my toothbrush, throwing it into my garbage pail.
- Is there an online event? - Yes, I will add you to the online event. Add me, because I have a funny comment to write about it. Oh, my goodness. Okay, I'm looking for it now.
Right? Me too, I mean... - She was wearing a leather jacket. - I wouldn't buy a leather jacket. Well, maybe we shouldn't spend so much on chicken. Maybe we should steal it so we can afford a leather "G."
Good evening. Good evening. As promised, here is your manuscript. As scheduled. I will read it carefully.
Despite the fact that the winning work, Drifting Emotions , contains the word "emotions" in its title, you will not find a single emotional expression in it. The flat daily life of a woman working in a coffee shop. The rambling conversations between her and her bedridden mother. Not even at the end of the book do we learn the names of the characters. However, what has remained in each of us who have read it is an undeniable emotion.
I was told that more than 400,000 copies were sold. Really? That's fantastic! Isn't that great? So many people are reading it.
No... Xeron, attacking the Sphinx will only endanger my friends. We must try to solve the riddle. The only important thing is to retrieve the signal. And I will use it to summon Warlock and annihilate him.
A riddle to ponder, perhaps. Okay, why don't we postpone the hugs until later? Great. Let's run! The entrance hasn't appeared yet. The Sphinx called it a test.
I'm sure it's a who's who.... The penises, of course. Yeah, I think I'll take the tray. I need it for fifteen, because I'm having a goddess party.... Sorry... I'm having a party this weekend, it's... Amazing how hard it is to say. Yeah, no, certainly. I'll pick him up on Saturday.
You don't have to. - It doesn't matter. I want to take it. - You don't. Good boy. - All right. Looks like you'll take it.
Wong. I break the laws of nature. I know. Don't stop now. When the Shrine is rebuilt, they will attack it again.
It is already burning. Embers. Spark of life. Now, you throw it--into the pile of dry grass. You catch it.
- You know what ? That book was our baby and you abandoned it before it learned to fly. Books don't fly and neither do babies.... You don't. If I had a baby flying, I wouldn't tell the press.
Ed's son, Ed Jr. Of course I was referring to him. If I may-when was the last paranormal phenomenon you witnessed ? Could you classify it on a scale, say, between T1 and T5 ? Garret saw it on Tuesday and wet his pants.
I check the adjustment--perfect. What is it? It looks like the cotton candy machine. It's a psychokinetic energy detector. If there is a ghost here, this jewel will find it.
- I'm going to preach. You know what we're going to do ? We're going to get a ghost and we're going to bring him.... God ! We'll catch a ghost, bring him here...
Remember that we represent only 4% of the universe, 4% ! - Overall, 4% ! - Abby. We believe in the scientific method, I have dedicated my life to it. And we ... have, indeed, put it into action.
- Okay. Cool! I made a mistake, it was a medium explosion. This little item is called a ghost-shredder. Hollow laser technology, it sucks up the ghost and neutralizes it.
Yes, I do. No, you don't. - Put it back. - Put the knife down, please. Put it back.
You have a purpose. You are always happy. How is your book coming along ? I've never written about myself before. I think it's some of the best work I've ever done, and I don't even know why I'm doing it.
I left a high explosive mine down in the subway. There is a flooded tunnel that leads straight under that building. The SEALs can retrieve the mine and place it under that being's feet. We confront him, distract the son of a bitch while the SEALs detonate the bomb. And so we eliminate him.
Dopinder, I'm beginning to think I'm in this cab for a reason. Yes, you called the cab. No, tan and skinny friend. Love is a wonderful thing. When you find it, the whole world tastes like daffodil fantasy.
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and there were a lot of new German experimental drugs. Vanessa is already working on plan A, B, all the way to Z. Me ? I am memorizing the details of his face. Like it's the first time I've seen him.
You know, in the first few months they only see in black and white. That helps stimulate spatial cognition. Or maybe an early seasickness. I got him one of these, a rocking chair. I'm not sure where we're going to put it.
All right. Talk to a published author. Online, Mom. I sent you the website. Yes, they do.
She works for him. Who is she? I work for Belloch. I want the route Rold√°n will take from Laos. One hundred million pesetas for you if you get it for me.
See. More salvage material. Oh, perfect. Soon the coal will be ours. They want to nationalize it.
Okay? To defeat Duran, you're going to have to humiliate him. You're going to have to shame him right there in front of everybody. That's not going to work. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you have to defend the title or they will take it away from you.
- Special project? - Sammy. I -- I'm afraid this project will die. No, no, no. I gave it to you. Served it to you on a silver platter, are you kidding me?
The Indianapolis is a heavy cruiser designed to shoot down enemy ships and aircraft, but our weapons are useless against submarines. That's why we usually travel escorted by destroyers ahead of us. Their job is to detect and destroy enemy submarines with depth charges before they can get to us. Many of the crew are just kids who have no idea of the danger they will face at sea. If we are targeted by an enemy submarine, and if by some miracle we see it soon enough, we will have at most four minutes before the torpedoes arrive.
He sticks his hand out. It's Theodore, you fool. You little shit! We found your book on a dead man, man. I gave it to a sailor for comfort.
Thank you, dear! - We are living a dream, dear. Here is Edina Monsoon leaving for her book launch. With takeoff, I lost my pelvic floor. Don't worry, we'll get it back when we return.
Is it dangerous? - What kind of question is that? Of course it's dangerous! You want a safe job? Work at Ikea, don't come to me! You don't want it, I don't care.
In the meantime, I record. You know what I think about it. What, you think I'm ruining my project? Sorry, our project. You know you're ruining it, but it's easier to blame me.
Understand? Don't worry, you don't hurt me. Again, but with more force. Good. Then, finally, you grab my wrist and pull it toward you.
How much would 'a little' be? I don't know. Not very much. I won't have your address. I would like you to give it to Dion.
Who? Oh, there you are! I've been looking for you everywhere. Oh, there you are. My book. I was looking for it everywhere.
No, you will come with me. If you want to put it that way, that's fine. As far as I can see, your little group wouldn't manage without me. No... Whatever the power of the mirror is, I won't leave it to Freya.
If you want to put it that way, that's fine. As far as I can see, your little group wouldn't do without me. No... Whatever the power of the mirror is, I won't leave it with Freya. We will find it and take it to the Sanctuary.
I had my daughter, Mom. It started to look like something that could become a person. I was so scared. But now, looking back at all the lives and stories of others, I know it's going to be okay. Some people can't see the love they have until they see it through someone else's eyes.
Lust, absolutely natural. I see that my words are not wasted on you, Marisol. That's comforting. These days, few people possess open-mindedness. But allow me, Marisol, the veil you wear only covers a false tranquility, take it off.
Hey, hey, hey. Let me give you a little advice, okay? - What? - It's about the mall again. I don't know if you remember it.
We had more fun in the studio. Everything was more experimental. The songs were better, more interesting. There were no big plans, sometimes they were made as we went along, out of nothing. John didn't have the mechanical bump. He had put on a tape and then the tape wound on the other reel and he would move it around, as if it was the beginning when in fact it was the end of the song, and so the guitar would do...
I have already died and gone to heaven. But yours is there. One morning, St. Peter was looking at his book, making notes for the Judgment, and he let me see your name. It was under the letter 'M.' He also had the name Rose, but I did not see it like yours.
11:00 p.m. Thank you very much. Good. Now let's check his dating app. He's had it. Once he gets in, set off the alarm. I can mute it, but he'll get the signal.
Oh, my goodness. You look stunning. I'm wearing a bra, a new one. It's not new. It's old, but I haven't worn it in a while.
It's just. it's weird, you know? Listen to me... Your father believed in you. That's why he gave you the note. He knew you would take that money and use it....
I use the verb "addict" all the time. Can you addict me to ketchup? Can I addict some questions? - Is that the meaning? - I don't know.
And then later, in an agitated state, he found himself at the convent of Saint Francis. But above all, ladies and gentlemen, trust this boy's words of his words. He has already confessed the crime to the arresting officer. He admitted it to his fellow prisoners.
That's exactly what I need. (SINGING) But sir! The region is perpetually patrolled by Galactic Rangers! We will have this planet! And we will take it, going on the attack!
We're just worried about you. Yeah man, classes haven't started yet and, correct me if I'm wrong, you're already the frontrunner for the dumbest freshman of the year award. Right, guys? - The award for what? - And an annual award. We give it to the dorkiest freshman.
It would be nice if we could find out you didn't find it by accident, did you? No no. Harrison believed it could be worth much more than money alone. Harrison believed it could open portals to other dimensions. And if that is the case and we find it,
The Egyptian princess? I read a little bit about Harrison's diary and learned a few things from the story, but the language was a little too far over my head. Well, to answer your question, yes, I have a theory. I believe that the pendant, or "pendant of light" as some would call it sent the spirit to a place similar to Purgatory, for all eternity.
What happened to the jaguar... The cameras caught it! Bingo! Very clever, slick! But if you didn't have access to the computer system before...I doubt Captain Musk Buffalo will give it to you now.
- Are you all right? - Oh, sure. I just disconnected the engine before entering the lobby. - Why? - So no one would wire it.
But actually, I don't know how it's done in Saudi Arabia. I mean, Mr. Alan Clay meeting Dr. Zahra Hakem outside the hospital. I hope it doesn't seem too inappropriate to ask her advice. I will pick her up on Wednesday at noon. I will write your initials on a card and put it on the rear window.
- Well, glad to meet you. - We came to pick up a book, which your husband was kind enough to keep for me. Ah, yes, the book. Well, it's somewhere inside the house. As soon as I get a chance, I'll find it.... - And I'll mail it to you.
All right. What do you want to know? Was there ever a time when you thought betrayal was wrong? Of course, I still do. Then how do you justify it?
Today is the 22nd - Today. - Birthday. Sometimes I feel the danger as if it were physical. I really feel it.
- Yes. You put it on, then you lick yourself. You will feel much better. It's a natural ointment. I put it everywhere.
It goes into the city cistern. We look for a large underground space, with columns, artificially lit. Then it is the ancient cistern. Sixth century, Yerebatan Sarayi. They call it "The sunken palace."
All right. Then shout as much as you can, invent, lead! If you love humanity, if you love this planet, you will do anything to save it. The greatest sins in human history have been committed in the name of love. No one, looking at this act, will call it love.
It was sent to class and I sent you a copy, And slipped one into your closet. Yes. I haven't checked it yet. Yes. I mean, I get it.
Don't swallow it. Please don't. Please. So now decide your fate. If you tell me the story, I won't send the elevator down, because if I send it down, to the basement, it's impossible that while it's down, you can stay here.
Cowan, I know I'm new here. But as far as I know, people who don't even know her, they think she's a jerk. - And you... - Ma'am? You don't know me, but when I was a freshman, she gave a speech. She called it "The Long Game."
- This does not make any sense. Okay, sorry. At least, and I know it's no consolation, but -- apparently, we're surrounded by Chinese food. Guys... I think, in this place, people don't call it "Chinese food," but simply -- food.
The card can decrypt anything. It can open a way into every computer on the planet. - Including your own. - Yes. Not only do we make him think we have it, but we will use it to expose and destroy him.
I tried to hold on to him for 30 years. It had a special way of slipping out of my grasp. This demon has a life of its own. It doesn't want to stay in a box. It has a way of influencing the world around it.
The demon spread all over the city. I remember investigating that incident. Good for you. However, hiding the demon in the middle of the swamps is not a bad idea. So I stayed in town for a while, in case anyone came across it.
- I can't kill my little girl. - That's not your baby anymore. I don't understand! So we wouldn't always have the same problem, but inside me? Now we make poison, then you drink it go down there, do what you have to wait until you die and you will be with your child again.
- Do I add it to the cost of the room? - Rooms. We are in separate rooms. - Then you want separate accounts? - No. Add it to my room, 106.
Also -- I'm not a policeman, so talk openly. Did you do that? I created the program. Not bad for a kid. Where did you find it?
The plan would not work without her. Okay. So after you tell me, why do I need you? Because we know how this work has to be done. I would have people who would do it for me, even much better, probably.
Citizens of Bana. My friends and I crossed the universe to find you. It was no accident. Fate brought us to this place. You are citizens of what was once Bana. A Bana that will be again! Zhong devastated our planet. But together-we will take it back!
Agreed. Your damn science is made to cut the connection between body and mind. In this way they can do terrible things to us without anyone knowing. This world is full of wisdom. No one ever questions it.
Whoa! Someone had a hard day. What if there are still people living there? What is this place now? I don't know. No matter what, I'm going to find that laptop and fucking destroy it!
We want the truth! Justice, for everyone! You have a plan, am I right? I didn't know about a prisoner transfer. - Well, you know it now from me.
Come on, dinosaurs. Use your Jurassic super strength! Look out, you guys! The ferret has landed. I'll push him in. You go with Peach and Ellie!
I need to refine the acronym. I spent a lot on this process, which is able to affect the hippocampus to eliminate ... traumatic memories. It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport, Nor what I did to avoid grieving. But, sure $611 million for my little therapeutic experiment. No one in their right mind would have funded it.
- No. I owe you again. I'm keeping the list. You know, he tried to kill me. Sorry, I'll put him on the list, too.
Staying down. Last notice. I can go on all day. That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it!
- You've gone crazy. - No way. Mr. Snyder is not an accredited coach. Good. I hope you know the German national anthem by heart. Because you will hear it every time a Nazi wins one of my medals.
All right, then. Let me give you my card. - What if she changes her mind.... - You don't need to leave me your note. Please keep it.
In the beginning ... there was only the ocean Till Mother Island emerged ... Te Fiti. His heart had the greatest power ever known he could have created life on his own. and Te Fiti shared it with the world.
Te Fiti. His heart had the greatest power ever known it could have created life on its own. and Te Fiti shared it with the world. But in the meantime someone began to search for Te Fiti's heart They believed that if they possessed it they would possess the great power of creation
I know, it's not every day that you get to meet your hero. You are not my hero. And I'm not here to get my oar signed! I'm here because you stole Te Fiti's heart! And now you're going to get on my boat -- we're going to cross the sea and you're going to put it back!
What are you doing? Escaping! The heart! Forget it! You'll never get it back!
We just have to pretend we don't know what went wrong. Ben and Ashley, they will vouch for us, they don't want it to go too far. Who would hire a company like that? You would! Okay, listen, my uncle has some undeveloped land in the desert, just outside San Bernardino, we take the body there, dump it and then come back here and pretend nothing happened, okay?
No? Sorry. Have you lost a cat? Hi. I found a red kitten if anyone is looking for it.
- Lt. Col. - Frank. Have a seat. We haven't been introduced. Okay, Frank, whatever the job is, I don't want it.
Hello,problem. don't take me by surprise so The past can define our future. But I will not allow it
I just want to know where it is, who bought it.... Who do you think it is, Interpol? Come on, get out of here. We're not serving hippies today. I was in the tree, I climbed up while she was uprooting it.
- It's a star. - What's the date on it? The website is updated, it must still be there. Holy God. They use it as the company logo!
"I talked to my parishioners. "Our intentions were good, but now we know it was a mistake." "Many young members of our community "are aware of the sacredness of nature, the environment, "we made a decision. We would like "that this sacred tree would bring peace and harmony to his family, "Clearly, it would be returned to the place where it was planted and grown." They make it there!
Put everything back in order. Listen to me. Listen to me. The whole case is based on this. We have a case here, and we're going to win it.
You have always done it. - I feel like I'm exaggerating. - No, you are wrong. The worst vice is advice. I'm just giving it to you.
I put out a notice and we have officers on the beach. More baggies are coming, but less than before. I talked to the coast guard. Given the wind yesterday, according to them, that backpack is coming from somewhere directly south of St. Ninian's. Or it was dumped where we found it.
- Who is. - The man who fixed the World Cup. The trophy that disappeared last year? Were all the newspapers talking about the dog that found it? Harry found it again.
- What the hell are you doing? - God! Oh, my God, but Jesus! Dad. Your mother, she puts orange juice in that thing. Then I wash it.
It's a cold, dreary outpost full of pathetic peace-loving cowards. You talk as if you know her. Where do you think I was when Viktor was wasting his time with Selene? Get ready. The journey will be long, and I want you to undertake it alone.
Hello? All right. It's heavy. Open your hands like this. If you do this you'll catch it.
"Mom has cancer" or "My fucking foot is falling off." "I'm trying to get my life back." Like, "I got lost in adolescence, and now I'm working on me a lot," and, "Oh you know, my father died in Iraq." Every sad speech, and they repeat it again and again until it becomes meaningless.
Okay, do it yourself. Do it on your own. Do it on your own. Do it yourself. I had given you a gift, and now I'm going to throw it away.
- Go ahead and cancel it, Lewis. Now, here's a question for you. They built a vault in the back of a store, right? Yeah. - And we find it.
- They are in position. - Good. Where did you stick the microphone, then? Let's leave it alone. Let's just say when we're done I'd throw it away.
Excuse me gentlemen, are you waiting for someone or can I take the plate away? - Yes, you can take it away. - No, no, leave it. No, take it away. I would like you to leave it.
He was a legend. To Thad! - To Thad! - To Thad! Then why don't I hear it? You say there's lime, and I don't fucking feel it at all!
What kind of trap? You mentioned a trap. The reactor. There is a weakness there. He's been hiding it for years.
Good night. This morning, one minute before 1:00 a.m., the Capitol switchboard received a phone call. A man said a bomb would explode in the building in half an hour. At 1:30 a.m. it did. In an unnoticed small bathroom on the ground floor in the Senate part of the building, next to a barbershop and near many offices, including a committee hearing room. For a report on the first, serious damage to the nation's largest building since the British burned it in 1814, here's the envoy to Congress, Lawrence Lawson.
Let me think about it. In any case it has to be approved by Fort Meade. - Obviously. - Do you have a name for it? Yes, if it's not already used, I would call it Heartbeat.
All of them. And if they say no, they are lying. Yes, sir. But everybody thinks it should be distributed, free of charge, like confetti. Especially to them who, of course, will use it well.
- What is the announcement? - If you only knew! Anything to turn off those damn cameras in Atlantic City. I started screaming-and a white man hit me over the head, telling me to shut up. My dress had ridden up, so I lowered it.
Like. Like the grim reaper. I guess I'm going to die in these mountains anyway, so, I don't know. Just a nickname I don't beg.
Check it out. Oh, suck my damn balls. No thanks. How can I work with this secondhand equipment. Is that what the ladies call it now?
- It can't be true, Holmes, it can't. - No, it can't. It's called Pepper's ghost. A mere reflection on a glass.... Married to a living, breathing person. Audience Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they took it out.
Mr. Umberto. This is James Harvey from Millennium Realty. Yes, I wanted to call to let you know that in the next few months a dozen homes in your neighborhood will be foreclosed on. And when the bank forecloses on them, the overall property value for the neighborhood goes down. Soon what you had, what you now own, won't be worth much. Divide it among these.
How do you know Barbara? We used to dance together in San Francisco. Oh, we did? Well, I hope the apartment is to your taste. It's a little kitschy, but Barbara wanted it that way.
He is a detective, and he has everything a woman could want. He's strong and handsome, smart and kind. I know he's the one. He even gave me this ring. I call it my magic ring.
All right. Take care, love. Hi, Elaine, it's me. Yeah, you left your ring here. You're probably driving, but I'll leave it on my way home.
- Yes. Dr. Stockman. We just received confirmation, sir. The "package" is shipping later tonight. Well, make sure they're following it every step of the way.
The guys secure the portal device. I take care of these two. "Secure the portal device"? What does that mean, even? It means shake the ass of whoever protects it, Wait for Donnie's drop signal and close it.
I deal with these two. "Protect the portal device"? What does that mean, too? It means shake the ass of whoever is protecting it, Wait for Donnie's drop signal and close it. Yes, but we don't know how many people are watching it!
And a son. Let's start over again. I was offered a position at Harvard. I was planning to turn it down. Now I think I will take it.
Like it's here. There's me, here -- right here, and I'm not going to leave. It's true, it's not easy to get rid of you. I'm stubborn -- just like my husband. Now -- let's talk about the future -- and how we're going to change it.
I acted to save my life. Mr. Cuatro was 78 years old and was using the oxygen tank. Did he take the knife with him? No. I took it from his kitchen.
She had the promptness to flee from a crime scene, to get rid of the evidence linking her to that crime, to drive her vehicle without running into something, but she didn't have the promptness to type three digits into her cell phone? The Prophet Muhammad used to say this. "You must use all the strength you have in your legs to help those in need." Is that what he did, with Andrea? That's the point, Mr. Khan, and you know it.
The Reverend was talking about an incident that had involved my mother and father. And the way he talked about it, it made me think that there was something big behind it, or maybe something bad, and definitely something that he didn't want to put in writing. I don't know why, but it scared me. Then... I put the letter back in the box, closed it, and.... I never read it again. My father kept a diary. He wrote it every night after dinner.
I had no other choice! I didn't know this was going to happen. All you care about is this fucking experiment. You took it, the serum! Why did you take it?
Just a second. Joe's effects? - That's good, that's good. Hop! - Like that? Yes, but move your thumb, otherwise if he bites he'll cut it off.
George says the piston can get stuck at any moment Unfortunately, it is a problem. We cannot afford to keep a boat with a broken engine. We ask for a loan. And what do we pay it back with?
Just a check. What about your makeup? Should I take it or... We were joking with the school band.... I'll take it off.
- Finally? - Finally. Have you talked to him? He's not answering calls and texts. His phone must have broken or he must have lost it.
Shut up! Shut up! The East Side has a lot more traffic than the Upper West Side, at least for now. - Can I have some coffee? Okay, I'll get it at school.
But giant's blood runs in your veins. And you have to train. It looks like a fair fight to me. Benjen always raises his chin when he is about to attack. And he lowers it when he is about to dodge a blow, my lady.
- This is Erin. - They are getting impatient. - What time does he get to work? 7 a.m. Tell them we are doing it the most profitable way.
Yeah, no! I threw a gay slur at him, which he blurted out to my face, pretending to be some kind of fruit that grows on trees. Everybody thinks so fast! Stan Smith, immediately abandon the tree. Not until you promise me you won't cut it down.
And nobody would like to see you triumph here more than me, of course. But -- this place is just -- it's so big, you know. It holds 1,000... 3,000 seats. Well, Lily Pons' voice filled it.
Yes, the foot guy, that's me. Yes, I'll hold. - He's still here. - Is he still there? - Do you want him? - No, I don't want him.
When I was a child ... my wet nurse never let me eat all the food in front of me. "There always has to be something left for Madam Education." Now I know that Madam Education doesn't exist, and it's madness to try to soothe it with any kind of pleasure. Now, we extend our right arm upward. We move it counterclockwise, making a circle, and repeat the movement four times.
No, I was wondering if you could show me how to use -- there's a record I'd like to listen to. Oh, how romantic! It's just to get in the Latin mood -- for Spanish. Certainly. Then I won't just show it to you -- I'll play it.
Then you will take a nice hot bath, which will help you relax. The heat intensifies the effects of castor oil. He's not alone, is he? Dr. Turner is with him. Johnny is expecting the baby. And I promise you -- he will see it.
The picture is a memory. I've been working at Hayward for 27. My husband was there for 30. He received a watch as an award before he died. Ian wears it now.
With a college degree, I can be a teacher. Or write for newspapers. I could work for the BBC and do programs on poetry. I could put more food on the table than you have ever seen in your life. I would be proud of the way I would do it.
I mean ... he tried ... but good intentions are not enough to run a store, right? Doesn't he know that this store is the only thing he has? It's not the only thing I have, Mrs. Cadman. But it is mine. And I would appreciate it if you would leave it.
And then I met Denis. My miracle. My gentle, wonderful miracle. He was bringing frankincense to the church. They call it-the scent of the shelter.
Yes. Can I take one more, for the last time? If you need it, I'm done with the iron. This hat gave me a hard time. I haven't taken it out of the box since my mother's funeral.
The traffickers know the jambo, Amahl. They're cool guys. Base, there are a lot of Russian SA-7 rocket launchers. Tell them not to lose sight of the truck. We find the depot and raze it to the ground with a Hellfire missile.
And with that hatred... I cried. I cried like never before in my life. The world was never the same again. You had destroyed it.
When you played who won? Me. Just because a brother died doesn't mean I have to change the facts. - What will become of this place? - Ah, sooner or later the bank will take it.
That's right. And as a proud NYPD detective, you see, my partner and I, well, we have to answer for each other. We always have to know where the other is. And thanks to the GPS on my partner's phone, I have Mr. Cage's address. And I will give it to you if you be a good boy.
It's a long story. I will find the time. - Don't. - What, are you afraid I will spill it?
I should be out there doing my job. Your job is there waiting for you, detective. The question is, do you really want it?
Are you the Frank Bonneville? - It would seem so. - I listen to her every day. - Really? - I wouldn't miss it.
- New York Post. - Yes, of course. I have to be in makeup from morning to night. I hate that. - You do it for Ian, so.
What is it? Welcome aboard. I'm glad you're joining us. Hop on and I'll explain. Tommy, this is Richard, the scientist in charge. The machine will amplify your power, and take it through the conductors allowing you to transport, anyone wearing one of these, into the future, in an instant.
And about. Hey there. Come on, come on in. He's no longer on the case. He assigned it to me and he doesn't want the other lawyers in the firm to waste their time on it. And I was looking for an outside person to help me.
Do you want it? No. Do you have his cat? Do you want him? I don't want it.
I killed a slave hunter. I have to leave... Take care of mother and grandmother, do you understand? You are a child of GOD You have a purpose, it is within you The Lord has given it to you, and there is nothing that can ever take it away....
Kyle didn't like them so he took them out. He didn't like them? Who doesn't like custom-made wooden shelves? Jesus, I mean. Half of us build the world, the other half destroy it.
Fergus, fill me in. CSU is on its way to the piggery to take blood. What is this place? Who owns it? Well, it used to belong to the Sullivans, but the Graysons, they... - they bought it years ago.
I've never been to her house. Did you paint that one? Yes, I know it's not very pretty, but I'm just starting out. A kangaroo with a switch for a head. What do you call it, "kangaroo"?
- Oh! We got a little heated earlier, huh? I don't want to talk about it. You have to tell me what's going on with you with this case. You know we won't solve it until you tell me about it.
Thanks for letting my cousin come, I never know what to do when he comes to visit. Hey, Paul? Can you go get a yogurt? We have to work now. That thing is old and expensive and he bangs it all over the place.
If you want to impose the final judgment on me, you will have to do it with your own hands, as I certainly intend to do. - I am not your judge. - Yes, you are. You are the only one who knows me thoroughly, exactly as I know you! Do you think the world stops when you leave it behind?
Take the canister...out of the box, holding the fuse up...and the explosive cap off the nitroglycerin. Then lower it inside the hole. Then lower the explosive cap into the nitroglycerin. And then gently insert it into the rock and fill with wet sand.
Was Otis selling illegal products in his store? The discrepancy could be a problem in the manufacturing process. I will know for sure by testing the THC levels in the samples. When you say "test." Exactly how do you do that? Well, we burn it in a controlled environment with proper ventilation.
The deadbolt is rusty. It takes strength to close it. How do you know my wife did it? She and I have not been. Mr. Fakur closes it tightly.
Please put a tape for me. You said you would put it for me. Let's let the gentleman work. You must not talk about the VCR in front of strangers, you know. The authorities will take it away from us.
I mean, nothing stratospheric, Arcadia had few inhabitants. However, a stone's throw away from us was San Bernardino, we just didn't have the money to put a kiosk there. And that's when my brother hatched one of his great ideas. - Tell him, Dick. - I thought about... He says, "Why don't we move the kiosk we have? We'll put it on a truck."
Then I showed Detectives Lange and Vannatter what I had discovered, and in talking about the situation, we became concerned that it was possible that Mr. Simpson himself might be in danger. Injured or worse. Well, that makes more than sense to me. What did you do as a result--of this entirely reasonable concern? I climbed over the wall to get to the gate from the inside and then opened it manually.
Detective, could you tell us what you see -- here? These are photographs of the area that I was looking at GUANTO FOUND IN ROCKINGHAM behind Mr. Kaelin's house. And in these is what I later recognized as a probable glove. What did you do then? I approached the glove and observed it.
And in these is what I later recognized as a probable glove. What did you do then? I approached the glove and observed it. Did you touch it? I didn't touch it.
I was raped in Italy by a waiter. And I buried that memory. I haven't forgotten it. I just... Like buried it. When the first rape case happened to me, the one that had happened to me, of course it got... Freed from whatever stone was keeping it buried and...
Churchill's words himself. Whoever he is, that man in my house gave the wrong name. And you did this to me -- on my fucking wedding day. The money is in the car, Mr. Shelby. Get it and count it.
If you think I am pressing you, it is only because I am trying to prepare you for what is coming. You have to become stronger if you want to face the Dagda Mor. You are pressing me to see if I break. It's no fun -- getting your mind read, is it? Your power may be growing, but be careful how you use it--and with whom.
Use it! You can't do that! We have to come back together. No, you have to come back. Don't you understand that?
I told you we would make it. Your time on this earth is over, Druid! Okay, where is the seed? I tried to tell you before... Please don't tell me you lost it.
The blue is also nice. I mean, and/or ... Both orange and blue if you stand on it will be nice. I was thinking about the blue carpet. Maybe we won't get it for my house.
Way to go, Julia! (speaker) Last lap. De Martino is attached to Minotti's Lamborghini. They are closely followed by MP1's Ferrari and Team Antonelli's Porsche. Anticipate it, get on the curb. They've raised it up, you jerk!
Come, Kubo. Come to your aunts. There's no reason to be afraid, Kubo. We just need your other eye. Your grandfather admires it so much.
Kubo, we both want the same thing. You want to take my other eye. That's all you want! Well, yes. But do you know why I want it?
It's so brutal -- and aggressive. We're trying to build this space for them. Where I live now. Well, I'll get a paintbrush and autograph it for you. So they'll buy it.
You are not alone, son. You are cherished by many people. It doesn't matter... How... the master calls you. Guard your real name ... inside. And I will guard it, too.
And what did I answer? First reason. I love you. Second reason. Do you remember that?
So was the Commander. What Clarke did at Mount Weather weakened it. The Ice People have grown stronger. Their queen wants Clarke's power. If her people believe she has it. She will break the alliance and start a war.
I just wanted to tell you... - that you are beautiful. - Are you shitting me? No, you're really beautiful. My makeup is terrible. If we lighten it a little bit -- here, on the face....
Take it easy, girl, or you'll ruin our reputation as just another dive bar. Are you going to charge them for that coffee? "Free refills," am I right? I want half your tip. And I want a pony for Christmas, but I'm not getting one.
An explanation for what? The Little Venice restaurant on Forge Street was burned down. No, not at all. It wasn't us. We were at a wedding. You burned it down -- to prevent my son from showing up at that wedding.
It is not formal. It is beautiful. It was produced in Paris. But stolen in Birmingham. My mother snatched it from a house where she was cleaning in 1901.
Madness. The murder. I am the first ... who really understands you. I found her perfume. And I put it on.
Now he's suing me. What I want is for you to use your badge and your gun to scare him into dropping the lawsuit. Wow, that's ... really so illegal. I don't care. You have 48 hours -- to do that, or I'm going to take your sperm -- and throw it in the East River.
Everyone knows to enter when the owner is there. That way you have access to the safe, and you can smash his teeth as a warning. Okay, why don't you... Oh, sure, you can slit his throat, but then what do you do with all the blood? We leave it inside the body, where it usually is, - because we're cops.
Go ahead, girl. Guys, talk in rhymes. He tells Gina to sing. Captain Holt is in a vacation frenzy! He'll say yes to anything. I'd like a police horse, and I'd like Terry to ride it almost incessantly.
"What's in the box?" Brad Pitt, "Seven." But seriously, what's in the box? The worst thing in the world. Shut up, stupid. Okay, so who sent you a kitten and why do you hate it?
I don't talk about how you burned your package. It never happened. I only had blisters. The point is. The only thing those bullies have against you is that you never solved that case. Why don't we solve it together?
- Hand me the phone. - Give me more wire. - Give me the phone! Give me the phone! - So it breaks. - You are the one who is pulling it.
The last time he saw you, he started bringing trays and trays of chicken. "Take these to Richie. His are dead, someone has to take care of him." He's fucking right! Why didn't you bring the fucking chicken? I ate it.
Oh my God. I felt really bad. It was disgusting. The good news is that you're the one who has to have the colonoscopy, right? Yeah. If that hot dog gave you cancer, they'll know right away. What?
What did he do? He, Anatole Kuragin and that vile Dolochov - they found a bear, who knows where.... - A bear? - Oh, that Pierre! - They took him in a carriage to... by some actresses, you know... and the bear escaped and when the police came, oh...
I can't stand you seeing me like this, but I don't have the strength to fight with you anymore, Ray. Geez. Is this what you wanted? They didn't give me the job. They gave it to somebody else.
Roman? Here. Tell me another joke. I don't have another fucking joke. The joke is if you don't get your ass out of there, I'm going to come down and kick it.
I hope you haven't overpaid for it. Stop. Let's go. No. I still can't believe you got it, Dad.
Okay. - Yes. The law of natural selection applies to you. No, no, don't eat cookies, don't eat anything sugary! Sugar makes you collapse. You will look tired and they will take it as a sign of weakness.
I'm running, you jerk! He can't kill people with a gun, okay? It's fucking boring. What if the killer strangles someone? Strangulation is scary because it's intimate, because you have to look someone in the eye while you're doing it.
Third floor. The elevator is broken, get some exercise. INTERNATIONAL POLICE Yes, the chicken is fine, love. It doesn't matter if it's two days out of date, just cook it properly. RESTRICTED MATERIAL
So. why don't you sit down? We have a lot to talk about. I'm not going to mince words. There is a vacuum here today. We all feel it.
Come on. Come on. No. I'm here to deliver the package. Should I give it to you?
- Anatole left Moscow. - Well, it makes no difference. When you meet Countess Rostova, tell her that she was and is completely free and that I bear her no grudge. Is that all? Listen to me, I'm sure it was just a moment of madness and I bitterly regret it.
You should. Wow. You're just like F. Lee Bailey. I know my rights. I didn't need to steal that footage. That guy Orton ... he didn't even have it anymore.
Because being brave is very -- very difficult. You know what makes me brave, Mason? My badge. - You do? - Yes. I'm giving it to you now, and that will make you brave.
- I followed a lead. We think we found the person who paid Ezekiel. Great. And are you going to tell me who it is? Sandra Russo--you're under arrest for the murder of Shane Barton. I guarantee you, she couldn't have done it.
- You have to get the ball. I'm going to get it for you anyway. MARCUS, LOU, DAD, MOM Dad, do you want bacon in your waffle? Bacon in the waffle? I crumble the bacon and put it in the batter.
- He is an asshole. His opinions are also stupid. - I'd like to read your book. It sucks. Come on, you let Hayden read it and edit it, and I don't?
Any idea what she was doing out there? Nothing that was like her. This was found near the body. It contains a packet of confidential data, including some basic guest codes. It only works at high altitudes, so? if Theresa was using it, it's possible that while she was trying to transmit--she fell.
Mechanical failure. But plotters are already at work. There is talk of hacking. Our biggest act. And we don't claim it.
Real poison. It will rid you of the child, but... It could also kill you. But what else could I do? - Do you want the child? - Of course I do.
- I really have to tell you. Good job, man. You really brought it home. Oh, thanks, Charlie. When you have a good plan you go with it.
The night you left, in the cave -- you said Jack was arrested. What the fuck is going on? Spanish intelligence. They heard about the embezzled money. They demand that the governor find it and return it.
I have known him since we were children. I have overcome illness and grief with him by my side. I have watched him vow to be faithful.... to be ready to sacrifice and give his love -- to my mother -- and to me. So you can understand how difficult it was...to ask him to accept what was done to him...by men who looked tremendously like...those who killed his parents in front of him when he was a child. You can imagine how tempted I was ... to take that knife and give it to him for him to use as he saw fit.
Together with my good name. Together with your lost love. Together with the life of your last quartermaster. All the terrible sacrifices made to retrieve that chest...are now part of its contents, and those things...are something sacred that I would not entrust into anyone's hands. That chest will be opened after Anne and I take it away ... and after the dust settles ... and this story is over.
Wozniak wants us to handle this discreetly. Kovach is a white guy. 5'8, dark hair. His son's name is Brian. - Does he drive a truck? - How do you know that? He just threw Brian in it.
I am the queen of all hives. I am the fire on every hill. I am the shield above every head. I am the spear of battle. Who, if not me, is both the tree and the lightning that strikes it?
Chunky, excuse me, but what the fuck is a moyel and why do they suck babies' dicks? The moyel is the Jew who performs circumcision. I mean, like in the Brit mila. But they don't do it in the hospital, so these rabbis can do-anything they want. And so they take the foreskin of the baby, and they turn it around in their mouth a little bit, drinking wine on it.
What's new? The leaflets were seized, sir. Only one batch made it through the checkpoint. - I'm afraid it's on its way to the plains. - We will wait for him in Delhi.
Neil. What, Tom's not getting on that plane. You want to explain that to me? They said the plane was on the way, but they didn't say they sent it -- for him.
- Sister. - And here is our bride. Welcome home, father. The dress is not finished. I didn't want you to see it like this.
And I told you they couldn't have more than two days. Yes. But what are you getting at? There will have to be a vehicle somewhere. I said it was a stupid idea! Even if there was a vehicle out there to escape, how do we find it?
Listen to me, Mr. Pine. Your nephew is a great friend of mine. You know, I like cock as much as you do. But he does. And that's his business. He doesn't need to be dogged. So if he does it again when I'm around -- I'll take that stick, shove it up his ass, and leave him there to rot.
People have not been attracted to you for thousands of years. - Thousands? - Since the origins of mankind. NO JOSH, NO REGRETS. The history of non-Josherosexuality. In ancient Greece, non-Joshero love was considered the norm. Plato considered it the cornerstone of modern democracy.
- Yes, now he needs your help. The 12 Monkeys -- they planted something inside him. Something to help them find him. A tracker. - It's typical for them. - We need you to get it out.
Harry Selfridge. - Don't you know who they are? - The Whiteley brothers. Our father had a store, like you. Now that he is dead, you are taking it to ruin.
Maybe you can use them. Try to hold on to them this time. Thank you. And where would the view be? I don't see it.
Disappointed in public, pissed off in private. Will they retaliate? If they win. And if O'Shea wins? Will he bury the grand jury report, or use it to take me down.
And lucky that they are not slowly decomposing in a barrel! She trusted me! Veronica trusted me to protect the record, - and I let her down. - Okay, well, maybe. But we'll get it back, right?
He's on the board, Archer. One word and he can bring AJ in. - Yes, but... - Yeah, but shut up! Let's talk about your daughter's future, you dick! So you're going to take her case, and you're going to solve it, and AJ's going to come to school here, and when she grows up, she's going to be a mogul in her field or an astronaut or... fucking something else!
You didn't follow me to the toilet to give yourself airs about freedom, Jane. Tell me about the Nutella Tax. - Really, the "Nutella Tax?" - Palm oil is the key ingredient in Nutella. If the federal government taxes it at 300 percent, it will cost us more to binge on it.
Oh, anyway, it's a regular chicken raised in an Amish village. Ah. It tastes better because they don't know how to use Google. You see, there are over 5 million of us and we are all armed. We've prevented this kind of legislation before and we'll do it again.
What ex-husband? I didn't know you had an ex-husband. Since when? A couple of years after residency. It's strange, I've been thinking about him a lot lately and recently he sent me a book he's writing and it's violent and sad, it's called Nocturnal Animals and he dedicated it to me.
You will go to Valencia in 1099-and you will meet him. At that time he will be about fifty years old. Also...you will have to get a sample to analyze his DNA. Is something wrong, Alonso? I'm going to meet our most important warrior...and, apparently, I'm going to have to pull his tooth out. I guess he won't have it pulled very willingly.
I have always said that love is a social construct that does not exist. I didn't believe it then and I don't believe it now. Okay, so what is it? Jesus, don't ask me. Seriously... How would you define it?
My husband abandoned me. But despite such rogue behavior, you-you are still in love with him. Do you think I should not? Now you seek my advice about love? I don't know any man who understands it as well as you do.
- Sorry, but I already have enough to do. Angustias can do it. Angustias is helping as a nurse. Would you like a report? I will provide it right away and, if you want, you can write it yourself.
She just went to rest. When she heard that the worst was over, I managed to convince her, otherwise she would have been here on the front line. Very easy. The secret is to scare the octopus. You put it in the boiling water three times.
Didn't you find it strange that the pupils burst out laughing ... when the teacher said, "We were saying yesterday"? You were at Unamuno's first class after his exile. Miguel di Unamuno, one of the most important Spanish writers of all. Primo di Rivera exiled him for six years for criticizing his government and the king. If he was a bad patriot, he deserved it.
I have already told you that it is a personal matter. But if you really want to know. May I? I came to give this cameo to a Tagal who lives in the village. Days ago a soldier died, named Rafael R√≠os, and at his bedside I promised him that I would do it.
See, he's fucking dead! - Fuck! - Do you see it? Do you see him? Because you banged him all the time, like an idiot.
The rich man convinced the Paraguayan woman to marry him, and they left together. The other then remained overwhelmed with immense grief. But one evening, out of the blue, he showed up at the happy couple's house -- on the pretext of healing the differences he had with his brother. They went out walking and talking on his property, and suddenly the one with the beard ... took an iron he found there and dealt a blow ... terrible, sharp, in the head, to his brother, who fell dead on the spot, on the ground. After that, he dragged the body ... and incinerated it ... in one of the furnaces that were in the foundry.
The address, I'll give you the address. And Castelli Street. Castelli 111. Here, next to the police station, on the other side of the fire station. I give you the slip of paper, you keep it.
Deputy Chief Irving. What's going on? A roadblock, sir. I can see that. Who authorized that?
Okay, from here. You pieces of shit, I will kill you with my own hands. The application you were telling me about. - The signal will tell us where the phone is. - They must have turned it off after the call. Shit.
- About the Mexican. Poquito Mas. the best Mexican takeout in all of Los Angeles. And then I bought you a new phone. Thanks, Dad. Why don't you set it up while Mom and I set the table?
Monica, Monica, Monica. You would look so much prettier without warts and goiters like these. You should have them removed, really. And let's not talk about how sad it is that you're trying to get a deal you're never going to get. Well, you know, I wanted to see the place before you raped and pillaged it.
What brand are you talking about? Mae was able to get a partial image of Jeff's body. My analyst on the base is trying to identify him. Hey, I've got it. I'm sending it to you.
I don't leave you here. I told you to leave. Please leave. If you really--you care about somebody, Mor--. There's a price to pay, Morgan, and... sooner or later you will pay it.
Oh, heck, I'd get out alive. What, George Burness jumped in, from here. He was drunk as a skunk. He did it for a ten-dollar bet.
Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights, the rest of us are going to give Will a funeral! I'm not leaving him lying in that freezer another day! The show is over. What's up? The signal comes and goes, but you heard it, didn't you?
It's not that they don't want to vote for you, it's just that they don't feel they can do it with all the pressure they feel they have on them. So we have to postpone the vote and hold a hearing. Settle the issue. Get those votes back. The only way for the Senate to approve a postponement is for you to ask for it yourself.
She absolutely loves it and it is rare. I heard there are like 50 copies. The Jamaican on Charlotte Street has rare stuff. Boom. You get the record... - You walk into the club and have the DJ put it on.
What do you say? I'm not often invited to other people's houses. I thought I'd come early. - What is that awful smell? - Lunch. They call it "running mutton."
You had to teach me to be like you. Don't underestimate the Crayon. I promised you the Secret. Not the Answer, Grasshopper. To get to the Answer, you will have to solve the Mystery -- united. And when you succeed in accessing the Portal, we will go through it together, united.
"I'm transferring to you ... the Magic, Grasshopper." "Don't underestimate the Crayon." Look at Dizzee, "You'll have to solve the Mystery, united." What the fuck are you looking at him like that for, bro.
- What the fuck... Shut the fuck up. If that body reappears outside that trunk.... Cadillac will make sure that we're the next ones in it. If the cops find it, they'll throw us in there even if we didn't do anything.
You're headed into the danger zone What did I do? The singing, right? I know. I won't do it anymore.
No, t√≠o. I want this. I want to sign with Mr. Asheton. Me, Regina and Yolanda want to be at Marrakesh, like Misty. I trust you to protect me, and Jackie to guide me. I will let you write the contract and I will sign it, but we want to be at the Marrakesh.
I feel like fucking killing myself. - Turn it up, come on! - Frances. Hi. I'd offer you some wine, but... I think Diane pretty much drained it all.
He is the only thing that has helped me not to go crazy in the last year. And I love him. - I think. - No, you don't love him. You love his cock and all the beautiful dark hairs that surround it.
Yes, yes, exactly. - So? - Well, when do I get to read it? - Well... Kelsey is going through it very carefully.
But you don't have to be afraid... I'd really like to get to know you better. Really? Here's one thing I learned from our relationship. When you feel that there is a knot ... take a deep breath, look at it and face it, without fear and leaving aside any prejudice.
You've never seen a greyhound, have you, Bill? I've seen quite a few showdowns in my life.... The greyhound is a running dog. He spends his life running in circles -- chasing a piece of felt in the shape of a rabbit. One day we took him to the park.
He began to run. I had never seen anything more beautiful ... than that old dog ... running. Until, finally, he managed to catch it. And under the horrified eyes of everyone...he killed that kitten. He tore it to pieces.
Maybe you think you are here because you are a kind of competitor, or a -- a threat to me. I chose you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone. And my sister, perhaps, chose you for the same reason. I earned my place. No one gave it to me as a gift.
He is an experienced lawyer. He has been asked to defend you. I've been asked, but it's not like he has much desire to. So why doesn't he go home? Because your case is so bad that no one would take it.
I thought we could play with Jock. Did you bring him? Where is it, boy? I'm an evil genius and I have to hide a transmitter. Where the fuck do I hide it?
It's the human beings that baffle me. This building is not on any map of the park. Most of the maps are made by the attractions. And they are programmed to ignore this place. They wouldn't be able to see it even if they found it in front of their eyes.
Let's take a look at that contract. All right. I would underline it, but... I'm not allowed to have a pencil. The more I look at it, the less sense it makes.
Well, sometimes I think it's better to celebrate these things on your own. That's all. Roger. Well, go on, scram. Otherwise you'll miss it.
Yes. Yes, that's right. You see, I was always confined in the house, and he was out there on his beautiful horse in a world full of temptation. You see, sometimes in the evening, he would come home and bring me a little present. He would call it just that.
It's not that guy's fault you kept splitting eights even though you had a ten. - Lend me the fucking lighter. - I already gave you the lighter, Credence. - The blue one I have... - If you'd given it to me, I wouldn't be asking you!
We need food. Coming. Here... How do you pay? Charge it to the fire station.
It's true, it's true. A hound dog. Oh, someone who is fierce in the courtroom. Oh, I'm afraid I won't appear in the courtroom. I prepare the case, I don't present it.
You can't cheat on him now. Not if this marriage is really the cooperation you promised me. These are turbulent times, Eliza. - We need to be open to change. - I am not!
Ezra? Are you okay? Were you writing the last chapter? I finished it. Do you want me to read it?
They had almost beaten him to death. After three days he still did not wake up. Even Mrs. Oskarson began to worry. It did not make me happy to get my ticket to eternity. I had been waiting for it for four years, but it was not what I expected.
I am special. You know, Gitty--some people think they're who knows what on a silver platter, m instead they're just little bitches who aren't worth anything. What's that supposed to mean, Mom? That special people don't need to say that. Mom, if someone asked you to keep a secret, would you do it?
- Yes. What kind of place is this? It used to be a restaurant. But the new owner lives abroad, so it's mostly empty. So, no one uses it.
It's so hard, hard... An octopus came in today. A very strange octopus. An octopus? It's poisonous and deadly, so don't touch it.
"There will be only one left." I don't blame you, Ken. I would do the same. But I'm making a 32 percent profit this year, and given your ultra-conservative approach to the market, I'd say that's 30 percent more than you're making from Green Vista. You can call it whatever you want -- but I call it a shrewd approach.
But no. You need these nine million. Because none of us, not a single one--has ever worked for a single day since that miserable prick of a grandfather of yours fell face down in the sand in Palm Beach, and after analyzing your possessions, your affairs, and your debts, I know that this check is the only thing that stands between your family and bankruptcy. So now you take it, put it in your pocket, and get the hell out of here.
Did my father say those things? Is he going to get better? Yes, he is already getting better. They say he should be able to come home tomorrow. I've been carrying this ring around since you took it off.
- The cluster is burning. We are going to lose it. - Stay away from it. - Liquid nitrogen? Phone companies use it to cool phone lines.
The ministers and the ambassador will meet in another one. I will negotiate the local agreement with Heydar, and once it is signed, the others will join us. Then we will talk about all the points of the agreement. It will just be a final review. Once it's done, we'll go out -- and we'll sign it in front of the press, in the reception area.
For the children. We don't need international cooperation. Sharif says oil and gas belong to the owner of the land. Everyone must do their part to achieve peace. If everyone can accept the oil deal offered by Norway, the Zamani family will also support it.
STEVE AOKI AND MAYOR GARCETTI ANNOUNCE CONCERT IN CENTER L.A. I am Mayor Eric Garcetti and I approve of this evening. Well done. The famous DJ agreed with Mayor Eric Garcetti for this tribute to the city. A free concert with a civic twist. They call it LAoki.
We have just the thing for you. But, you know, I have a criminal record.... Yes, we know that. It's not a problem. The job is yours if you want it.
Come on like this. - Look, I'm on my lunch break. - Your son Lee is not bad. He is poor in legs, but he holds the cue well. I know talent when I see it.
Not so fast. Trust me. These are the M80s that ShotSeeker detected half an hour ago. See how accurate that is? ShotSeeker detected the sound, located it, and attributed it to firecrackers.
It is pressurized gas that escapes when the bullet exits the barrel. That would be the glow at the moment of firing. And it's from a Ruger .22. How can you tell? I simply feel it.
The miniature copy of the Machine is on this laptop. You know, for someone who is so terribly concerned... about the proliferation of artificial super-intelligences... you must be having a lot of fun building new ones. I can link this Machine laptop to Samaritan's... through this central computer... which will act as a forum for their virtual meeting. Or as a kind of Roman Coliseum for an endless series of virtual battles. If Samaritan has any lethal flaw--we will soon find out.
Take some weapons, Sameen. You'll feel better after you shoot someone. We would have another way to fight if we hadn't shut down the system. If I believed that, I wouldn't have done it. What if I told you that I put a little extra code into the system -- before I shut it down for good?
This was back there for ... now it will be 10 years. Everybody thinks it ... it's a bottle of bourbon, but... No, no. It's actually the most illegal thing in this bar. You know, our friend, Garth -- and another friend of mine, they gave it to me for my birthday a while back.
Red dragon. Okay. Tell me -- tell me about this. The dragon-the red dragon. I watched as the man stood over me.
Look at you, you are a young woman now. This is a mistake, Khatun. If you stay, there will be no more suffering. All the pain of life will disappear. Soon you won't even remember it.
Now you know the sacrifice. Now you are ready for what comes from this gift. Swallow it. It is the seed of life. If you cultivate it, everything you need to know will be within you.
I have always seen you as collaborators, all of you, but especially I see you as a partner. Don't. I know we are concerned about the same thing. Are we going to find the fifth movement? One of us will get it.
Finish it or die. Can you tell me more about the game? I can tell you very little, unfortunately. Very few people have played it, but, every few years, it always ends up here. Um, why are they bringing it back?
Shoshanna -- hi. What--what are you--are you here for work? It's okay. You don't have to be nice to me. I know it's like I took a spiked vibrator and stuck it right through your heart.
- Right. And it had much worse effects than we remember. Precisely. But there have been other changes as well, at least from my perspective. Spearhead, for example. In my reality. We invaded them, confiscated their core and used it to continue our mission.
They gave her a flashy name and got her into films. By '38 she was the highest paid actress at Anvil Studios. Interesting. Is it all in the file? I will read it--directly.
People have a psychological need to find the "super villain," but in my experience, the reality is much more complicated. - Who is Geronimo, then? - That is a very good question. You never took me behind the scenes before, why now? You were forced to do this work, but there are legitimate reasons why you are doing it.
What I am referring to is this man. I don't know about you, but I'm not in the habit of sleeping with snakes. I don't care in the least who you sleep with. Let's say it works. We fix this device and Vernon uses it to stop Whitney Frost.
I'm so sorry, I tried my best, but... - You didn't... - You didn't sell the membership card. I didn't sell the membership card. And now you expect to be fired. Wouldn't it be easier if you, like, wrote "You're fired" on a piece of paper, - and left it on my desk?
She found me this assignment, and I'm staying away from her. Great. Good move. - What's wrong with your phone, man? - What? You've been staring at it all day, man.
You know, if you want to see a free movie you just have to call the theater and say the projector wasn't working. I don't know what to tell you, ma'am. I would just like to know what you think of the taste. Maybe what your children would think of it. If you were to improve the taste -- in what respect should you do it?
He is waiting. She will call him sir, and his wife madam. The Treaty of Versailles forbids any other form of protocol. His left arm is slightly deformed. Don't look at it.
But I told the Austrians, "You got what you wanted. Stop in Belgrade!" I wrote a telegram to Vienna, "stop in Belgrade!" They never sent it.
This girl was caught red-handed in this officer's room. Frau Linnenkamp swears this is not the first time. Your Highness, it is entirely my fault. It must come to light the day Herr Himmler must come! God forbid he should find out.
He fell asleep. Do you have any place to go? An address. Will you come with me? I have betrayed my country, but I will not abandon it.
Don't say "good luck." That's like the meanest thing to say to anyone. And by the way, you were wrong about this place. The fish is absolutely commensurate with the price. Well, good thing you can afford it with your food stamps.
- We cannot give them to them. They will become easy targets. We cannot give this information to terrorists. We can. But only if we can track them down before they use it. We could place a worm in an attachment--so when the recipient opens it, the worm forwards its location to us.
And now I have lost my husband, and you have started a new war, so pray that the tribes will fight on your side. She is a fool. Now we have to take care of the tribes. Have them call them to the council. Tell them you own the throne as you always have, until you pass it on to your eldest son, Jonathan.
The Baroness was sterile. These are not experiments. It's a cure. She was pregnant on her wedding night. Before they burned her, the villagers removed her fetus and threw it into the water table.
That's where it all began. I don't want to. You know, you look just like her on her wedding night. The night they took her away from me. The villagers removed her fetus and threw it into the water table.
- It is a beacon from the Ark. - The Agro Station. It's the beacon. - This belongs to us. - The Ice Queen... She wants Clarke's power. If her people believe she has it. She will break the alliance and start a war.
Resist ... and you will know our strength. Fight... - And you will find death. Today is a new beginning. Mark it. Remember it, just as the natives will remember it.
I'm sorry I had to resort to forcefulness. We all experience pain. Sometimes it is physical--due to injury or age. Sometimes it is mental... due to the loss of those we love. If you think about it, whether we ... we fight the pain or accept it, we get the same result.
All right? All right. I can't believe I haven't seen you since.... When did you put me in an institution? Maddie, you know I hate it as much as you do.
Welcome back to The Work of the Heart. We have Mindy on the line. Mindy, what's going on? Hi, Dr. Greg. First time caller, 48 years old, never married, I'm a big fan. If he wrote a book, I would put it under my pillow.
- One twist. - Every three pages. One striking thing. I don't want it to look like I despise your script. Oh God, it's bad enough that you read it.
I can't read that language. Don't worry, I hope it will come back to you. All right. As for the dagger... - You need someone to steal it.
- Poem. "And even if my soul leaves the Earth one day, I will wait for the time of my return. I will wait all eternity for finally my love to return to me." The dagger! You gave it to me ... and the engraving ... it was a poem, a love poem that promises ...
There is no precedent. Technically, he should surrender the child to a third - party. - Joe Silverman. Joe Silverman. That's right. He's going to be the foster father for a few days. She hands the baby over to Joe, he hands it back.
The Red Guard is authorized to attack only if the Musketeers' rescue fails. It will fail. I'll take care of it. There will be a signal. Do not attack until you hear it.
Well, there you go. Now... - I'll put it here. - Okay. If you lift it higher than the heart, it should be better.
You know, there is a book that might help you. Sarno? It wasn't. You have to read it for it to help you. Isn't it enough for me to shove it up my ass?
And we just brought back more medicine. - Gregory wants the best deal possible. - Yeah, well... - we want things, too. - We need food. We've come this far, and we're going to get it.
I have to confess, I -- I'm working with a pro on my boast and longlines. He wants $200 an hour. But, hey, at least I don't suck anymore. - You want his number? - You just gave it to me.
- Hello! - Hello! What a coincidence! I left you a message. Did you get it?
I got angry, but the Germans, I can't stand their arrogance. Their arrogance? You insulted me, my friend. I am tired of your drunken behavior. - I can't stand it anymore.
She was only more cruel. Then Anne Marie wrote to Nicole, "I'm late, I'll be with you shortly." Only the poor girl made a mistake. Instead of sending it to the secret phone they were using without your knowledge -- she sent it to her usual phone. And she read it, because she was at home.
Once every week. And was it hot, the food? That's what it was good for. 4 km from the road and 8 km from the edge of the forest, but was the food hot? Maybe he carried it in some kind of cooler bag.
- Did you even read the talking points? - Do you know what? No. I haven't. This endorsement is the race. Your father saw it today... The place where Adam was locked up.
- Right away. - I was beginning to think you weren't going to come. - Maybe I would have done better. I just don't see what's so special about it. Do you see it now?
What is the real reason why you are here? Joey is here to--. That's the way it is. It's not something I talk about, but like you -- I'm a person of faith. I never made the connection before you said it, but -- maybe these powers, these -- these gifts that you have, that Daisy has, maybe they're not accidental.
Good morning. - Do you have an account here? - Yes. - Could I know the account number? - Actually I don't.
What are you doing in there? It's my father's store. He said I could invite friends over. If you're cold-there's plenty of stuff to drink. Some good wine if you feel like it. I don't.
- Time for truth. - Action. In 1983, Special Agent Bruce P. Mindhorn was captured... AGENT MI5 ...during a covert operation on the Siberian border. Communist doctors subjected him to cybernetic surgery. They took out his eye and replaced it with an advanced optical lie detector that meant he could literally see the truth.
That sounds like a good idea to me, partner. I'm going to go. - I'll give you a signal when I need you. - What signal? - You'll know it when you hear it.
If he can have access to Alie 2. He can tell us how to stop Alie 1. And Bekka Pramheda has his second chance for atonement. Returning to access to the mind... If Alie uses it to charge our minds in the City of Light.... There is a possibility that my mom is still alive.
"Am I Jenna Hamilton?" "What have I learned?" - "The millennial's guide to love.... " - Hey, Jenna, sorry to ask, but ... did you write a super detailed article about our relationship in Idea Bin? I thought you didn't read it.
No, but I check my phone and it's full of notifications for new Twitter followers and messages about the article. - Cute title, by the way. - It sucks, I know, but -- they changed it at the last second without telling me. I hadn't written that. I think you would like the article if you read it.
My son. Look into my eyes. Did they look at you while you were killing them? Yes. Come near me in reality, old man, I will scalp you - and put it on my belt.
If it's Jewish? No, it's Ukrainian, ma'am. E'... all very sad. Really, but I thank you for your time. We appreciate it, thank you.
Kenny? Well, thank you, Mrs. Haleford. - We're going to need that address. - Yes. Jamie's cell phone. Someone just turned it back on.
All right. Great. My parents thought I had made it on my own, but the truth was I couldn't have done it without Matty. Why did it feel like such an embarrassing secret? And then I realized, the embarrassing secret was not that I needed Matty's help, but that I wanted it.
- I don't know anyone who wanted him dead. - Okay, thank you. Chief? Tommy's cell phone was a prepaid phone. - He hadn't used it in a while.
I sold the van to Tommy a couple of months ago. He needed a vehicle. He's lying, Tommy was broke. It's not even worth the scrapping money. I think Tommy was driving it on his own.
That is a sandstorm. I know what you're thinking. But we haven't seen a sharknado in five years. That's what worries me. We are close to three Astro-X reactors. They will extinguish it if it grows in size.
One day? If they travel north. Compass. This route cuts east. We will follow it... As the raptor covers the rest of the places.
Yes. All right, where am I headed? You're coming out of the tracheal artery. You should see the first fragment. I don't see it.
All right, where am I headed? You are coming out of the tracheal artery. You should see the first fragment. I don't see it. Did I miss it?
Let's try again. Back on the attack. Where is Savage's fortune? I am particularly interested in an object called the "container." The container is the most... - Precious of my master. - Very good, and where do we find it?
What does it mean to "fold the cheese"? You fold it. I get it, but how? How do I fold it? Do I fold it in half, like a sheet of paper, and put it in the pot, or how?
They are Japanese graphic novels. They're called manga. Well, that sounds like a profitable business choice. Anyway, Bob, I've decided to use this space for my office, so--. This is a little embarrassing, because -- you gave me the distinct impression that you didn't want it.
I mean, I like it because Jared Leto gave it to you, and I gave him my first kiss, but I don't know if I ... - really like it. - That's not really an answer. I feel bad. It's like something is burning in my throat. Oh God, you would have answered the question by now. So, I think I'll put it on.
Right out here! Bob, you see, the bagel store idea was just an idea. And it's not even an idea, it's just -- an example of a theoretical idea. Well, it could be, but -- do you know how much a bagel oven costs? And Ivan would do it for free.
Well, it was -- it was really good and.... of course I'll pay you back. All right, well, give me seven dollars and we'll call it even. - Seven dollars? You paid seven dollars a bottle for that? ! But where do you buy it?
- Yes. - Would you like some more coffee? - Yes, thank you. Okay, we're out of sugar. Do you still want it? Because I'm not having it.
"This girl... She's got balls!" But I have balls! Only when you hide behind a screen. With this costume, it doesn't look like you have them. Okay, do you want me to wear it?
Is he an interesting lover to you? Okay, first of all, Gary, he didn't call her a bitch. He said bitch, please. It's just a nickname. I mean, I say that to Rachel all the time.
I guess we'll never find out, will we? I like Darius... And I intend to win. And if that doesn't make you happy, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. Yael, listen, there's been a hiccup. The assistant costume designer was ironing your blue dress, and she punctured it.
Okay, well, think about how much fun this is going to be for the holidays, David. What about parking? Okay, you don't -- you don't even have a car! Oh, God, if you want this place so bad, David, why don't you just say so? - Who said I want it?
What about parking? Okay, you don't have-you don't even have a car! Oh, God, if you want this place so badly, David, why don't you just say so? - Who said I want it? - So you don't want it?
- Of course not. - Absolutely. Good. Then, this precious artifact is yours. If you want it-give me the damn Crystal.
Don't let it go to your head, sweetheart. I'm not the sentimental type. No, but your partner ... the physicist with the big brown eyes-he is. Reconnect the core. Either reconnect it or put a bullet in your friend's head.
- Show them what it's really like! - That's the way they are. - No, it never was! We are the border between good and evil. But if you cross it now, you can never go back!
If we lined her up for recognition, surely colleagues would identify Georgina as that girl. Her sister not only found out that the animal that had attacked her was still alive, but also that Dr. Lorenz was using it for research purposes. I think she decided to use the tiger for revenge, but Goggins got distracted and the animal escaped. Apparently, it was his sister who stole the tiger essence and impregnated Dr. Lorenz's handkerchief, hoping it would attract the animal. But Ingrid Hjort borrowed it--and unfortunately ran into a guy who took it out Wytham.
- I need to talk to the old man. Mr. Drake has guests, as you well know. I still have to talk to him. Frank, don't wear out the soles, I guess they're almost finished by now and new shoes are expensive. If it weren't for the fact that I'm sure you'd like it far too much, I'd take this contraption--and shove it up your--.
- I could believe you! Lately ... I have been dreaming frequently ... about my home, about what I might have become if I had not been forced to leave it, if I had not had the need to learn this language of yours. Your... intuition... about the movement of the tides.... Your calculations were right. The collision of such powerful forces will create a vortex. But the breakwater, this...pier they built...will accommodate the vortex...give it shape, push it toward the land.
Legs. When you reach the river - Watch out! Go west for three kilometers to a crumbling bridge, looks like a crooked smile. Listen, when you cross it go to the top of the hill, look for a house.... With a lantern in the window.
They are willing to buy it back at an increased price. Increased? Don't let that fool you, August. Mercury was used to mine gold. You'd probably get a lot more if you sold it to the highest bidder.
I hold, along with some colleagues, the patent for the original prototype, which we designed more than a decade ago. Now this technology is on volcanoes around the world and has revolutionized the monitoring of volcanic gas emissions. It's my baby. I'm really happy to see him. I haven't seen it in two years, and here it is, still in operation.
They are bringing the prisoners back in. Too soon! If we don't get out now, we'll be stuck here. You, you betrayed me. I relayed the message to Governor Feron as soon as you told me, I swear!
Or we'll poke your eye out, and when I find Eduardo I'll show him your eyes, to remind him how you died. Where is Eduardo? Just tell him. Tell him. My son will drain your eye and gouge it out if you don't tell me right now where your brother is.
For the time being. - That... thing is still out there. - Yes, but we have identified a weakness in it. Now we can go on the attack. - Okay, if the hallowed ground hurts him.... - Then we take what we can from this place and use it as a weapon.
The cave in Iraq-you didn't just get gold. Oh, even then I was always looking for some... extra specialty to sell. I managed to get away from my unit-and what did I find? I had no idea the power I had in the palm of my hand. And then I felt it, immediately.
Yes, but. The doctor will be with you as soon as I have witnessed the completion of the surgery and when your cybernetic eye is in place. Surgery. He wants us to remove... - And replace it with...
- From a booth. See you in four hours in the bar in front of the junkyard. And what's this? The boy's wallet. I took it before I put it in the trunk.
- You know what solitaire is, right? - Yes, of course. When I was 9 years old, I didn't know what it was. So, I asked Grandma and she said it's a very long worm that lives in your stomach and eats your food, so, you can't get fat. I asked her how it goes away and she said you expel it when you go to the bathroom.
Well, aren't you something. - Are you expecting a phone call? - No, why? Because you've been looking at your cell phone all night. Yeah? Well, I don't know, I was looking at it to see the time.
As many as I could open. I tried everything. Not quite everything. You're still here. Yes, but you seem to have a plan, so... why don't you tell us?
Well, I have my sources looking for Marcel. It won't take long. However, I can't imagine how this turn of events will improve your chances. The game is not over. When the Strigi find Marcel, they will also bring back the Charter and hand it over to me.
They are my mother's medical records. How do they get them? You and I need to talk about Ezra Fitz. CHAPTER THREE Do you know what you're doing? You wrote it, for the most part.
The mystery is figuring out how I will walk when I wear it. I may need Emily's legs. I will hem it. She will be all the rage in this dress, I promise. Please try it on.
Did you tell Yvonne to leave her phone at lunch? Yes. To prove to her that she can't trust me. That's what I told her. Yeah, but then you never told her I took it.
Look, you wanted to believe that the army would straighten me out. It's true, I'm your brother, but I'm not like you. I don't view the army the way you do. You see the world as a place to be fixed. I see it only as a broken place, so I made sure I earned enough to survive.
It is the wound of Ra's. If he cannot take the life of others, he is the host who will be consumed. Thea, please don't leave. There is only one way to prevent him. My father once told me about an elixir called Lotus. And I will gladly give it to you on one condition.
Andy told me that Genesis was coming. Doubtful. Phil Collins said they won't tour anymore. The Old Testament, the book of "Genesis." God wanted to make the world over again, so he destroyed it.
Doubtful. Phil Collins said they will not tour again. The Old Testament, the book of "Genesis." God wanted to make the world anew, so he destroyed it. He destroyed it with a flood.
The earplugs did not work. It's the sonic device that shouldn't have worked. Wait, you said Cisco custom-made it for Laurel? It should have worked only on Laurel. The amazing thing is that he is using it with much higher decibels, compared to Laurel.
Darhk snatched it away. Darhk would control the world's nuclear stockpile. Andy told me that Genesis was coming. God wanted to remake the world again, - so he destroyed it. - He destroyed it with a flood.
We are very close. Well, Stewie, remember what we felt last night. And here's a tip for being confident. Go into that room, and imagine that everyone in the room is desiring you sexually. I'm doing that right now. - And I feel powerful.
Oh, my God. - Peter, did you get my message? - No, wait. No, I don't know what he's doing here. Okay, Stewie, when Barbara hands you the orange juice, you're going to drink it and you're going to smile.
I have to go, my helicopter has arrived. Do you dare... By the way, you have no idea what noise a helicopter makes. Do you insist on carrying on this charade? Yes, but it's perfect. Shelby has already disassembled, so now I'm going to take the ring and return it before they close.
Oh, just some rich jerk I saw bragging about his vacation on Instagram. He posted a picture of his feet in the sand. You're a man, you don't have to do that. What a jerk. Hey, I'll swallow his floss, then you pull it out and we'll put it back.
- Here you go, Chris. Your first cell phone! - Yay, something my father held in his hand in the bathroom! You know, Chris, maybe that cell phone is still salvageable. If you put it in a bag of uncooked rice, it will dry out.
Cole, it's over. Your country thanks you for your service.... Shirley. So how does Jones plan to get us back without a bond? I have to take out a coded ad in the paper -- give her a specific time, a particular place. Then she reads it in 2044.
I listen to Beyonc√©. So. take it down a notch, bitches! We wanted to give you my brother's number. He's a surgeon. And I'll take that, thank you.
They are not easy to kill. These Predators are even more deadly ... which makes your task ... even more difficult. - My task? - For the experiment to work we need the blood of a living Kree. And I want you to get it.
No. Do you feel guilty about that? Not so much. I don't see the world the way you do, Christian. How do you see it?
And stay in the fold. Venya, you know the parable of the master who hid his talent in the ground. And you also know how it ends. You too have talent. And God doesn't want you to hide it.
They were going to his grave. So he said. Where, here? Aggie wants us to spend it with her.
But in forgiveness there is a force. It is a powerful thing. Not only for those who have hurt us, but also for us. In forgiveness lies love. Come girls, or you will miss it.
They really had nothing that could compete with the Corvette. GM had about 60 percent of the market share. And within a year there had been, literally, almost a 15-point swing where they stole 15 percent of their market share from Ford. Henry Ford flew into a rage and said, "What the heck is wrong with you? If you're cheating and you don't want to comply with the ban, I'm announcing right now, publicly, that we're not going to do it and we're going to compete."
They had arrived, they had taken over. Shelby hadn't fired me, but it was obvious they didn't need me anymore. Enzo Ferrari did not tolerate mistakes. Especially when it came to engineering. And if engineers made a mistake, he made sure they recognized it.
As a pilot you always look for power. In the beginning, the 289 left a lot to be desired. It simply did not have the power that the pilot seeks. Eventually, they built the Mark II. They said, "We've got to get the job done, so if we don't get it done with cunning and daring, we're going to do it brutally, forcing this big engine and we're going to rout them.
Ferrari, having lost at Le Mans, had retaliated by going to Daytona. Early in their careers, they were not as durable as their opponents. It was the first time Ford was going slower than the opponent. So at that point it was clear at the top that something had to be done. But it was not clear how to make the Mark II significantly faster in a short period of time. Phil Remington returned to Dearborn with two of his chief builders and they took the first J-car chassis, put it in the wind tunnel and literally started cutting the bodywork to try to improve the aerodynamics of the car.
Dan Gurney does something incredible. He sprays champagne on the crowd. No one has ever done that. Like a fire hydrant, I could pick them off one by one. I didn't understand what it was going to be. Now, in every race, especially in Europe, whoever wins uncorks the champagne and sprays it.
- Why shouldn't he be part of the 22? - Because he was one of us! Lundberg? and that he met Burlin and Forsberg. for example. The Sami use it when they kill a bear.
In a month there will be nothing left. - Can you repeat that? I don't understand. - Of course. because you will have him taken out of the mine.
Well, let's say I need seven, but one will do. Put these in compartment eight. Yes. That's all right. Are we teasing you or are you doing it with us?
I just wanted to bring you some joy. In the dark depths, you were a ray of hope. Do you know why I am on guard, why I stay ... hidden in this place, while others live in the light? Once, and only once, all the gods acted in unison. We took all the evil in this world, and hid it -- in this box, Pandora.
We need to find a way to isolate him.... Jen! - Let her go! - I'm not going to tolerate--any more people meddling! My power is my property, and no one will ever take it away from me again!
It really strikes me -- the insatiable desire of mortals to fight so hard for what they cannot -- get. I don't know what irritates me most about you--whether it's the way you talk, or the way you treat women. Let me help you decide. I know well the... meaning that mortals give to love. Now I will take what is dear to you -- and turn it into suffering.
- OK? Nobody forced you to quit. - Fuck you. Fuck you! I got you this job, and now you don't want it?
Salt. We keep it around. It keeps them quiet. Trolls are children of the mountains. If they can't get salt from rocks, they get it from blood.
- Carlos is not wearing underwear. - Sol, you need to see Carlos. - No, I'm fine like this. - Do you like bingo? - He loves it.
Neither do I. Do you want to know why you haven't caught this man yet? Because you're too good... Too courteous. You, of all people, should know how rude I can be. You give everyone the benefit of the doubt whether they deserve it or not, and Mr. X? He doesn't deserve it.
She's too far away for me to read her lips, but if you look at her body language, it's like she's saying. "Are you lost? "Where are your parents? Should we call them?" Joey gives her his phone. The man walks away with the phone, probably destroys it.... Then he hides it.
Where is my bracelet? Why do I have a hunch this is not a courtesy call? I need the bracelet. You see, you're okay with stealing from other people, but when it happens to you, you don't like it. They forced me to steal it to pay my debt, and if I don't turn it in,
- And look where it took me. - That was the old me. This is the new me. And they will shoot the new me in the head - if you don't give me that bracelet back. - If I give it back, I become an accomplice.
- That was the old me. This is the new me. And they will shoot the new me in the head - if you don't give me that bracelet back. - If I give it back, I become an accomplice. If you keep it, they will consider you guilty of a crime.
This is the new me. And they will shoot the new me in the head - if you don't give me that bracelet back. - If I give it back, I become an accomplice. If you keep it, they will consider you guilty of a crime. And I also tell you that my benefactor is not the only one looking for it.
Would you like to try Felicity's omelet? No, thank you. Already tasted it. Why do you want this bracelet, Rhys? - Why does every thief in town want it?
He will try to divide and conquer. He always does that. So we can't let him or anything else come between us. Will you promise me that? I promise. We don't know much about the bracelet.... Only that apparently every criminal organization in town wants it.
He always does that. So we can't let him or anything else come between us. Will you promise me that? I promise. We don't know much about the bracelet... Just that apparently every criminal organization in town wants it. But you think Christopher has it.
Let's talk more now than when - you were Christopher Hall. - Where are you? I'm on my way to the Laragan consulate to return the bracelet. Alice, don't do that. Agent Dao is also looking for it.
Can I have it? I'm sorry. Mickey Shive was waiting for me. What do you think they're going to do with it? They will sell it, of course.
Margot. - We had an agreement. - Sure, and the deal was to steal a bracelet from the Laragan consulate as a reward for nonpayment, - but now... - We had a deal for that bracelet. If you want us to steal it again, then you're going to have to totally cancel our debt.
We cannot allow them to push against the fence. We go out once a week to dispose of bodies. Are you okay? He had a pickaxe. He was wielding it like-I don't know.
- Yes, it is. - And I would like to say that no money is asked for here. - No, no. And there is no commodification. I have a gift, and I want to put it in the service of the needy.
How did you know I had lost him? From time to time, I would call the orphanage where you were growing up. They said you always had the pipe piece with you, and yet you were missing the other piece. But how did you find that piece? I lost it after you left me there.
The turkey pot pie was better. Just saying. I've never seen anyone get so upset about a turkey pot pie. It... reminds me of someone I know. Do you mind if I eat it?
Instead, Lele always puts him face down. - How do I hold him, sorry? - Face down. Do you think I haven't noticed? These are things one doesn't notice. One takes out the phone and lays it down.
- Yes. - 50 euros! - What are you talking about, dad? - Shut up, let Dad do it! - What about this tiramisu? - Aunt Aurora makes it, it's so good!
The day... will come. - The day will come. - The day will come. Bram and Gracie? I'm back, and I have apple juice. I almost didn't get it.
The little girl... drinks for free. We seem to have a good versus bad news situation on our hands. Marcel, I simply do not have time for this. I have a lead on the bullet. Whoever found it will give it to the highest bidder.
Kol is tied to that candle, so whatever our two lovebirds say to each other our witches can hear. I don't think a few extra minutes of privacy is too much to ask. I don't care anything about love. They have a task. They'd better get it done.
- No, that's the wrong answer! - No, no, no, no. I know it's a war, but I've lost a lot of friends, too. Today -- I need your help. Then you'll get it.
Okay. Thank you. We just got a call from Raleigh County, West Virginia. They want the body. So we've arranged transportation, now they're taking it to Charleston.
Listen: I have to launch this product next weekend and you let Parker walk out of here, potentially jeopardizing a billion-dollar deal. I want you to look into the face of the man who fooled you-so you can see how stupid you are. Okay. I want you two idiots to go find that other idiot and bring that product back to me, otherwise it's also useless for you to come back. So are we fired if we don't find it?
- Well, the sex was great. And it stayed great for another minute. - What? I thought you took it off. - Why would I take it off? - I don't know.
* In God's name, we tamed the savages * Listen, man, the product is irrelevant to the story. Okay? That's why you need to give it back to me. It seems really important to your boss. I mean, you said he wanted it back, too.
Look, if I were a girl... The... People lose it when something happens to a girl. There are support groups, there are lesbians who hate men, but ... a boy? Do you really think people don't care if they rape a man? If I put a mattress on my back and carried it around, would I end up on TV?
We all have a "soft spot" for something -- am I right? The demon demands payment. We have to give up a memory related to the person we love most. We don't! Keep this with you and think of me when you wear it.
And can he speak to you through that pendant? - Here, inside the Institute? - It was like when I saw Dot. It is the splinter of a Portal. That's why your mother wanted you to have it.
I am listening to you. √à... It's in the loft where you found me. There's a bumpy floorboard. My mom didn't realize I knew about it, but she hid it there.
DEAR LUCAS, COME TO MY HOUSE TODAY AT 8 P.M. FATHER JOS√â Look what I got for us. You always have good wine. - I'll open it and you serve it.
I love you." We attend the same church, I thought he meant that. Sisters in Christ. Yes. Then he wrote another note and passed it to me.
Ben joined the group when we were forming and I think he played a key role in guiding us along the way. We respect each other and we both contribute in different ways. Ben has to be credited with two things. First, he believed in the project. And he was right, because they funded it. And then, at every stage from then on, he encouraged and supported.
Do you understand? - I just want to help you, sergeant. - No, you can't help. You're the problem. Because of you, this uniform isn't worth shit anymore. Cops don't... prevent crime anymore, they chase it.
He asked me to read the following statement to you. "It was a difficult decision not to return. But I know my husband well -- and if he were conscious he would tell me to go on. And that the best way to stand by him is to serve my country. And I can do that better in Germany -- than in a waiting room.
Safe? Yes, isn't it strange? I understand. I would like you to see this place. I can if you describe it to me.
You said we are going to war. We are. And there will be a time and a place to vent what you have inside. But right now, the last thing you need is for everyone to be afraid of you. Tame that fire -- or others will do it for you.
Wait. No, no, let go of me! - This is not my idea! - Don't do this, please! Now turn it off!
I meant what I said, Ray. I love you. I guess you found the ring. The ring? It's kind of a weird way to get engaged, but, uh, I'll take it.
A patient named Richard Kester. His wife convinced him to try Dr. Shaw's therapy. Let me guess, it didn't end well? She had an affair, they divorced, and then Richard sent Dr. Shaw--a death threat. It's been over a year, but that kind of anger can erupt when you least expect it.
Yeah, I know exactly how he feels. - Decker. - A couple of phone calls and we know who did Rose's implants. She says she went to the studio a few weeks ago with a guy. The guy was weird and apparently so was his name, but... - The girl doesn't remember him.
Yes, that's great. So are you going to take the job? Well, what do you think? Do you think it will be fun to work together? I think you have to take it if you want it, for sure.
She's screwed. Oh my goodness, thank you. Ms. Grant, they didn't have any more stains so here's a regular coffee for you. Look at you. You're handing it to me like a boring normal person.
It's no good at my place. Have you moved yet? No, everything is still there. I thought the purpose of this, was not to pay rent. We use it as a kind of warehouse.
And we still have no idea who this person is? Unfortunately, no, which is another good question for us. But knowing that Emile and Tamika may have talked to the same person before they died gives us a mandate. We stay on the mystery phone, but it's turned off, no battery. Well, maybe the owner will turn it back on.
Unfortunately, no, which is another good question for us. But knowing that Emile and Tamika may have talked to the same person before they died gives us a mandate. We stay on the mystery phone, but it's off, no battery. Well, maybe the owner will turn it back on. And will he leave it on for at least an hour so it can reappear online?
We need to find it. I think it's in the parking lot. But there are already people here. Do you want... Do you want me to hold them up? No, whoever has the phone might figure out what we're doing and turn it off.
He always sounds credible no matter what he says. If your client could tell us where Gary is, it would help us take her version of events more seriously. Gary has one of those disposable cell phones. Can that help? If you know the phone number and if Gary is still using it.
Too many right questions. Which makes the other search I did-very strange. The serial number of the Uzi was searched 11 years ago. How is that possible? We just found it.
True form? He needs to possess four living souls and then he will walk the earth. Four souls, one for each corner of that hell in which he is trapped. After that he will be free from his suffering and free to walk the earth. Well, how do we fight him?
Hester? Who are you? Why are you following this Synthetic? It's...manifesting a strange system defect. It could make it dangerous, so we're going to fix it.
You know, there are different studies every five minutes. I mean. At first they say, "Oh, red wine is the fountain of youth." And right after that, "Oh, it's liquid death." Come on, Stefanie, listen, when you have cancer, you get rid of it right away.
Do you want Sally Benton's support? We just need to show her whose idea it really is, so.... Let's challenge Lexi to a debate. And then it disappeared? Yes, I think whoever posted the comment removed it.
- And I your wife. - This is your bachelor party. And this is my life. - Do you care anything about our marriage? I consider it my staple ... - for when...
We went to Kevin Copeland with that. - Just that one. - That's a great jet. That's what I'm saying. If you want it today, all you have to do is take over the payments.
Well, it's relevant now. I thought it was to bring order, I didn't think it was a cover-up. If Dan White was an agent, that means he was vetted by ASIO. Which means there is a file. And even if you got it, you couldn't publish it.
They have been taking the Class Leader away for at least two hours. After a while you lose consciousness. How long did the pickup last, Captain? Half an hour, more or less. Apparently they take our blood and give it to half of their own.
The organ seller who sold Will's kidney. Good. We must not let any details slip through our fingers. Tommy's life depends on it. "Let me pray, not to ward off danger from me but to face it without fear. Let me pray, not to plead for an end to pain but for a heart to overcome it."
We will find them tonight. What's going on? Didn't Minow lead you to the cargo? He did better than that. He led us to the facility where they keep it.
Here it is. I will make them pay for what they did to us. This book, it's the bait! You want the Master? He will hunt down whoever possesses it.
- You can choose its name. Whatever you prefer. She is at your complete service. Give her an order - and she will carry it out.
Here are the reports. And the number eight wins. My lucky number. I have a good feeling with this lotto. If you say so, I believe it.
But it can't be presented in court, I went a little further.... If it can't be presented, it doesn't count. I know, but in the meantime, listen, okay? I can link it to the Lobos murder. I knew that, but nobody fucking believed me, and that's okay.
Yes. My hair was much shorter, though. What is the name of -- the place you come from? China. And who governs it?
Why did you look at me like that? Like that? Why should you feel sorry for me? I think you carry a terrible burden. And that you carry it alone.
Bring it to us. Let's go. - Do you have the warrant? - Yes. Are you going to show it to me?
So, start from scratch. What happened before that? I would start with the suicide in college. It happened a month before the first murder, I wouldn't call it a coincidence. Okay, we'll call it the first event, Kevin Whitfield is the second event.
Do you ever feel the need to hurt yourself? To others, sure. But to myself? I just need to send a message. Will you lend it to me for a second?
- I know where he might have taken her. - What do you mean "might?" Connor owns 200 acres of land north of town. - The lab is there. - How do we find it?
She's been lying to us all this time. But Duval, Gracie is your daughter. It's your call. Let's go. Do you know the place well enough to draw us a map? Yes, I know it well.
Okay. Two minutes. - Stop. - The... my medication is here. If I don't take it, I won't be able to answer Connor's questions.
It was about time. I was going crazy. Okay, let's sit down and get started. I thought you liked pain. Only when I ask for it.
Jacob and his mother -- they are heading for a wall of Germans. Do you have to socialize often with your husband's colleagues? It's not my favorite part of the job. That book you're reading? There isn't one that he would read.
I can't lose my job. Is he still furious? - I don't know. - Ken, what state of mind is he in? He's hiding it, pretending it didn't happen.
I worked for a team working on the Hubble Telescope. He's being modest. - He has a letter from the president. - I don't believe it. I was once stopped from getting into an elevator because the First Lady was using it.
Who are you? What do you want? I'm looking for a device. It belonged to the Connavers. They used it to get into Arkyn.
So is this goodbye? You tell me. I heard you two talking. I know you have a warrant for the shield. You know I would give it to you, but ...
Maybe an animal. It's a dog. A dog. Now, Elena... I want you to take this dog, and I want you to take it out of the room.
No, no, Piggy's tail on the front page! Wait, let me see. I don't see where the problem is. I was born with a pigtail. The doctors cut it off, but I'm holding on to it, so when I'm reincarnated, I'll be in one piece.
I'm fine. We have to leave. Vorza could come back with the soldiers. All right. We have to move the body before they find out.
I smell promotion. And, unlike Angela, you didn't have to suck anyone's dick. You didn't blow Mike to get on the task force. The Justice Department has drawn up a deal. If Ruiz accepts it, we will finally have a witness against Lobos.
- Grace, let me... - No. I've got to go. - Grace. - You haven't paid your bill. I haven't brought it to her yet, but I was going to.
You know that teacher who believes in kids, who changes their lives? Professor Eastman. Advanced calculus. My father was that teacher for so many people. He was very proud of that watch. He wore it all the time.
So you basically stole it. Listen -- obviously I get involved in something else. You say this phone is connected to a murder. I don't know anything about it. I picked up a phone, I turned it on to see who it belonged to, I was going to give it back, and the next thing I know, you guys burst into that damn restaurant.
So with my scientific knowledge, I thought I could increase my powers-and I did. So you've already taken Velocity-6? Yes. But there were some side effects -- unforeseen. That's why you didn't want Barry to take it or even know about it.
This guy here -- he's the best blacksmith in the whole damn Union. That's who he is. Let me tell you, this guy ... possesses a rare ... almost mystical gift, inherited directly from the Mandinka artisans. Those who live along the Kamby Bolongo River in Africa. I once saw him set up a cannon sitting astride his mouth. He was hammering it while firing it!
Good schools. Do you know a gang called Los Guapos? It's their territory, but we have an agreement. So I guess it will extend to my baby too. Okay, if the baby poops, would you clean it from front to back or back to front?
I just want to hug you again... - You could be in a Lifetime movie. - Thank you. We'll work it out the easy way. Do you want the couch? Whoever sits on it the longest gets it.
I love you. But I also want a real ring. I'll give you a diamond the size of a raisin. We can go there tomorrow. So we can pick it out together.
Father and son. Dani, look at that picture, it softens you. I'm already too tender, leave me out of it. Maybe you should talk to each other. You have precious time and you waste it in front of the television.
I need my samovar for the party. You mean my samovar? I found it at the Rose Bowl in 1999. - The early bird catches no fish. - And I got it back.
But he won't stop until he gets that painting. He has already sent me six messages - and they all say, "Kenny Loggins." - Here's what you can do. You go down to the garage, retrieve it, tell her she brought it back to you, and send her regards.
- Yes you do, Troy. Why was solitary confinement the only place they couldn't reach you? The only place you felt safe? Yes. And why do you have that tattoo? They said that... If I didn't... If I didn't let them do it, they would have continued to beat me up every day.
- She is the child who was there at the distribution. - She had no identification. She told an officer her name was Sara. I put the teddy bear with the other belongings. Maybe that way someone will recognize it when it's all over.
INSIDE THE CORD I LOVE YOU AND MISS YOU. I AM STILL ALIVE. LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO WASH CLOTHES. I PAY IN RATIONS. ANSWER. I tell you it's true. The Confederates used it during the Battle of Atlanta.
Trey. But what's going on? He's healing Cinco. Dr. Cannerts, what are you doing? I'm extracting the antiserum from Thomas's blood, mixing it with the interferon--and putting it into Cinco's bloodstream in real time.
It could lead to a cure. Hope may be in one of us. That means it is in all of us. Personally, I am glad for the president's apology. Wait, just because they didn't make this attack doesn't mean they won't.
Why there? Because that's where Kendra is. - How is that possible? - She sent us a message in time. Go ahead and say it.
I'm just saying that he gets along well with his family and the neighborhood. Just like me. - But did we get a dog? - No kidding. I don't want him in the kitchen, I don't want him on the couch.
All we have is the present, and this is what we have to do now. We stop their supplies, we prevent our parents from leaving. We can worry about the "then" tomorrow. The best solution is to blow up the bridge before the truck comes so the parents can get away. If we blow it up too early--they will never leave the fairgrounds.
What are you looking for? I think you know. We gave you work. We thought you needed help. You found it in the caves, didn't you?
I won't let just anyone keep Vivian. She's too important to me. And so are you. What are you thinking about? Just when I think I have no room for more food, I find it.
- So this is about my book? - It's about you! That you live a morally questionable and unsuitable life raising a child. But yes -- I found the book -- excessive and disturbing, both Faith and I did. What will happen when Vivian grows up and reads it?
That's great. It means that values are something invented by us, and having them should be a choice rather than an imposition. And you learned everything from an architecture book? "The Wonderful Source" is about much more than architecture. - I will have to read it sooner or later.
And I... - saw a chink. - There's no chink, Scott, really. There's a chink. And I'm going to stay here -- and I'm going to wait for you to get it, too, because I know somewhere inside you know this thing is true, too.
And you still haven't seen ... the best surprise. Did you make the bed? - But how? - I googled it. And when it comes undone, I'll make it again.
That. It cost me three dollars, Chip. Is that the watermelon that was in the fridge? - Yes, and it's gone! - Yes ... because you ate it.
I thought we were going to talk about how to survive inside. Okay, if I ever end up there.... - what advice could you give me? - It was all about power. There are those who hold it, and those who want it.
- It was all about power. There are those who hold it, and those who want it. If you have it, what will you do to maintain it? What part of yourself will you suppress to stay at the top? And if you want it-what will you do to get it?
Well, I'm not surprised. They are beetles made of dung. They are not made of dung. They live on it. They cut it, then roll it up--and bury it.
Is that your big plan? Well, Sven is Greek Orthodox, yet he says he likes the confessions part, and the hats. - So it's all planned. - If this wedding is going to happen. Honey, this wedding is going to happen. And I would love it if you would plan it for me. Please.
Don't be paranoid. We are building a whole new image. Tell him to go fuck himself. In a subtle way, as you usually do. Oh, and delete the message. In case those who work for Elo√≠sa see it.
Where are you going? I'll be right back. Excuse me. I put all my effort...to make sure...that there was a suitable memorial...to the good people we lost. - They deserve it...
Sorry to bother you at this time. I'll take care of it, Rosie. Take care of what? Apparently we have a problem here. Then you'd better fix it, but don't leave these girls here in the cold.
No. Because I told him I was going to cut his dick off.... And he knew it, and I meant it. He actually told me he was going to cut my dick off, and I knew it.... But I wasn't particularly worried considering... The fact that I don't use it much except to pee. In fact, I would very much like to see it disappear.... Because I can just look at it every day.... And it reminds me of better times. But you see, when I mentioned your bird, it wasn't my intention -- for you to turn it into a topic of conversation.
They keep saying the same things, on tape. According to police, Siletti was driving with an expired license - and refused a blood alcohol test. - Really, I don't know what you expect. The Ramirez family has asked the prosecutor's office to make sure that Mr. Siletti's high profile does not grant him preferential treatment. And today, the prosecutor's office responded. We will thoroughly investigate this case and we will do so diligently, as we do with all cases.
Sorry, I can't come to dinner. Why not? Give me a moment. I've got it. I have to go on a diet since I ate too much of your food because I love it.
You are tense. No, I'm not. I'm not tense. The work I have to do, my research in Whitechapel. - You would rather I did not undertake it.
Do you want to make me generous? Do you think I'm a silly little girl -- with brains in my boobs? No, sir, not at all. I will give the job to the man--who will offer me the best price. For three or four -- we'll do it at half your rate.
- That's all I have to say. - I'll tell you what, Wayne. The people you work for must be pretty pissed off -- knowing that your drugs are hitting the streets. And Eric O'Bannon... going and blowing the whistle to the feds...it's definitely not going to make things better. Sticazzi, they've always left you on a long leash ... but, sooner or later, they'll use it to hang you.
You are exploiting me. I do all the work and you two take all the money. Well, sure, yes, we'll work something out. I'll be back at midnight to collect the rest. If I don't get it -- they'll pull your bodies out of the lake too.
Do you want to touch it? The flower? Yes. It's beautiful. Yeah, my cousin won't appreciate it.... But, uh, I don't care.
I had something to do. There's always something. Yes, but -- I really wanted to give you this cake. No, you wanted the credit for it. And you took it before you even acted on it. Then you didn't do shit, but you still collected the loot.
- Cathy. Is there a problem with that? No, sir. I will coordinate with Doug. After a dog bites you, either put it down or put a muzzle on it.
If they had wanted to, they would not have released the two hostages. They are actually looking for an excuse to get out. If the press spreads that footage, I will pass as a traitor. We'll say it's a prerequisite. If they spread it, the deal is off.
Acting deputy director. It would suit you. Yeah, well, I thought a new role might suit you, too. Head of the counterterrorism task force, Hannah's job. It's yours now, if you want it, although I guess not, given the request to transfer to Los Angeles.
- I have to check the same, man. He was hit very hard. He may have internal bleeding. What about the bite? Keep it clean.
We hope they keep their clothes on. She only got the job because she is Mr. Grove's daughter. Well, she's down in the warehouse now. There are girls who would kill for that job. Those who deserve it should have it.
Why does everything have to be so complicated? Why can't we find what we need so that Cat and Vincent can have a life? Hey, hey... Come on. I'll get you some ice. Only if you put it in a drink.
But they are not controlling the tunnels. And I don't know how Braxton plans to blow it up. By tomorrow it will have been checked. Yet it's ideal for what Braxton wants to do.... It would cover up the Prince's assassination by making it look like an assassination attempt. Yeah, and Vincent will be blamed unless we prevent it.
- What? - And Eddie Redmayne will play the fetus! - Do you people realize what you are talking about? We can't stage a fake abortion on live TV! Well, of course we'll record it first.
- Yes, thank you. Welcome, please come in. Hello. Thank you, Abby. Do you still need that binder? I can't find it.
I... Michael. I don't know, I've always ... wanted to see that. Yeah, you know, I think... I've seen... a report on that. I watch a lot of... things on Netgeo... which, after a while, they all intertwine to become a huge... shark temple show... monkey aliens. Well, if you actually go there, you'll remember it.
Look -- the packaging is coming off. Then don't mess with it, that's worse. I'll peel it off just a little so we can peek at what's inside. - Are you crazy? - I'm not opening it, come on, I just want to....
- Listen to this--jurassic asshole! Nobody's shitting you. You're out. And they all have the same size glass. You drink it, and you're ready to go.
Because then you won't get the answers you're looking for. And because I don't think you want to deal with another murder charge. The buyer... He's going to contact you. He'll tell you what the next test is. - What if you don't?
That's not what I meant. You just have to glamorize Braxton. Get his attention away from his computer. No, I know. And then you take that thing and you plug it into the computer and you pass it from the socket to the cloud or something.
How did he get into a mess like this? Do you really want to know? Now you must think I'm demented. They promised her a better life, and a job. Then, when they brought her here, they took her passport and papers, stole all their salary.... Saying they were going to send it home to their families, along with whatever letters they wrote, which of course they didn't have, and they couldn't do any better.
For divorce proceedings. Hi. They think they've found another one. They said it on the national news. Did they announce it officially?
- No. Why? Because you wouldn't take care of it. No, I would. I would walk it, feed it and everything.
Hey, welcome back, man. It's time for the second job. The 7-7s gang took your territory while you were gone. Tonight you get it back.
Apparently we won't need DNA. The suspect has an alibi. She was already at the Kings Theatre at the time of death. We obtained the address of Peter's old apartment in the Village, Apparently, he used it as a love retreat.
Yes. While Henry will be on one of those rides that he'll want to do 17 times in a row. Okay? Don always drank soju, which is a Korean liquor. They tease Don because he drinks it with Korean food. My brother drinks it with anything.
- Is this a group home? - Yes, that's right. Do you know the property across the street, the one that burned down? Where they found the body? Yes, there's a shed and it looks like some kids use it as a -- kind of a clubhouse.
Fox Ryder. That's my new name. I beg your pardon? It's just... I can't really use the name Brent right now because, uh because Cobra Video recorded it behind my back.
We always celebrate, but we brought out the best things for you. - Oh. - Good. So, Sean, we've written a script. I can't wait for you to read it.
I'm not going to give up. We still have a lead. - Catherine. - The message. JT can track it down. And Garrus mentioned a foreign client of Braxton's. Let's sift through Graydal's records, maybe find a name, give it to Homeland Security and make a deal. - It won't work.
No, absolutely not. You cannot trace it through your Parabatai connection. It would weaken both of you. - Or it would break the bond. - Jace has already weakened it.
Do you know when it will be a good time for me, Clary? Never. Don't ever call me again. - What the hell is that thing? Did you kill it?
Simon, wait! What's going on? We need your help. The White Book. It contains the spell that can wake my mother, but she hid it so Valentine wouldn't find it.
Sure. - And what is it that you are requesting? - A new possibility. You want an Act of Transforming-Me-Into-A-Vampire. And we need you to formulate it.
- Yet true love never dies. - But people do. People are more than toys for your amusement. You are hundreds of years old and yet you are still so naive. If you found it, you wouldn't know what to do with love.
It looks bigger than in the brochure. If it had been smaller it would have been worse. Do you remember that terrible hotel we stayed in in Greece? It wasn't that bad, I quite liked it. Although I seem to remember the local liquor was pretty bad. Do you remember that, Cathy?
The twin gods of Fillory that when they get angry, they take everything away, I know. Basically, yes. They have their reasons. But that's what happened to the manuscript. For some reason, I didn't deserve it.
Dad, I need to talk to mom right away, it's important. Well, after having fun she usually goes to the tepidarium. - Can't you just call it a bath? - Nonsense. This is my domus and I call it whatever I want.
Jesus. You're using time magic to be able to make it right. Yes, but only a witch born by accident with that power can do that. I did every research I could do about it, and one day I realized that I was trying to solve the problem from the wrong angle. We don't have the necessary power, but we don't need to generate it, because someone already has it.
Well, I'm going to need it. Why? We're asking all the key witnesses to hand over the clothes they were wearing the night your sister-in-law was killed. Okay, that's fine. I guess it's good that you're not wearing it now.
- Tell me what happened. Straight to the point, huh? Just like dad. You know, you two are very much alike. You set a goal and you achieve it.
I know about the 12 million bill at TriCoast. We will-we will pay it all back with the first installment. Don't lie to me. The bank statement is locked in my desk drawer. No one will find it.
God, I hope not. That dog is a hero. If I had to hear "Over the Rainbow" one more time. That's funny. I thought you liked his ukulele. You seemed to love it in Big Bear.
What about the blow? It did not seem to be given by a powerful man. There was strength, yes, but imprecise, almost fearful. A little further and Marley might still be alive. I would call it an unfortunate blow.
No. Really? That is my favorite item in the whole store. When I grow up, I'll have a hairpin like that, too. I'll wear it to gala balls and ... men will compete to dance with me.
Let's make this dinner a success. The wine, Bumble. Right. Yes. Even if he can find some money, I'm sure he'll use it to play cards.
He served you on a silver platter without a second thought! Don't you understand? If you don't speak up now, you'll end up hanging. I hope you won't take a peek at the dress. It's not bad luck if I accidentally see it, right?
Should I have apologized earlier? Besides, you did a lot to excuse me. Do you want this milk? Because if you talk to me like that, I won't take it from you and you'll be left thirsty.
I wonder what will it be, a boy or a girl? I don't care, a daughter or a son, as long as it is healthy, but I wonder what it will be. - It is not wanted. I want it. James wants it.
Not on my watch. If things get bad you will be there with him. You'll be there, won't you? No, I won't be there. I'll be at Pearl's wedding Saturday night, and I'll make sure I'm nowhere near the bouquet when he throws it.
We are busy. How else are we supposed to get to know someone? Look ahead, man. There are cameras here. I'll let you know everything, if we get a name you'll know right away.
No matter what his trophies were, we had caught him. I hunted Mr. Smurf and Bubblegum for years, and you caught him in one day. What do you have to say? Another perspective. No, I know talent when I see it, and you are full of it.
What about this story, Brian, your story. The implanted memories and the innocent condemned to death? It's better than I had. - And it turned out to be true. - And we can sell it, Brian.
Senator Morra and I would like to offer you a job. A job? It would be very lucrative. You would work for the senator's private security team. I will write a number for you on a piece of paper. As soon as you see it, I'm sure--you'll be convinced.... of how serious ... our proposal is.
Draw your own conclusions. But, thanks in part to my work at Datavision, I knew how to work even the toughest clients. Did you ever think that the drop in sales might be because of your name? I mean, I understand why you chose it. It's powerful and I love it.
Exactly. And once the bubble is inflated, the Legion sells off the bonds.... And then they burst the bubble, making a huge fortune, and most importantly.... Instantaneous. Thank you. So they're making everybody believe that the treaty is going to happen.... - And then they crush it?
Innocent blood. Innocent. Vengeance. "And my righteousness shall descend upon them with great vengeance - Furious indignation. As Christians ... it is our duty ... our task ... to act against sin wherever we find it.
I don't want to look ... obsessed, because I know I've already worn the perfect dress once today -- and I should wait.... - Are you thinking that too? I want to wear it again. - You should wear it again. - I know! Okay, I'm going to wear it now.
What the heck happened to my castle? We, like, razed it to the ground, to erect... houses and stores for everyone. Ah, that explains why it looked familiar. You razed it to the ground? I demand that you rebuild it immediately, otherwise I will order you to be disemboweled en masse and...
Look, all the horrible hiking, grueling biking and humiliating swimming are paying off, because the other night, Jeremy, which is his first name, walking by a jewelry store, asked me what kind of ring I liked. Three carats, square cut, Or at least baguette cut. A man can dream, can't he? - Pearl. - Yes. You know I now fully support your mission in finding love, but I will need you to find it before 8 a.m., staff meeting.
Not at all. If you are talking about me to social services, we are talking about adoption. - Look, you're fine. - I know what they do. Sit down. What they do is they take your baby, they take it away from you, and they give it to some fucking bourgeois baby-hungry couple, and then I'll never get to see the baby again. You know what?
He's right, Nick. You can't do it alone. I'll be all right. Wait, wait! What if the Black Claw knows about the keys, and that they were in the trunk? The Claw doesn't know we have the trunk and those who were looking for it are dead.
Give her the damn pen and paper. Who do you want me to give it to? I'll tell you what. I'll keep it. I'll give it back to you when it's all over.
You are cold, Mr. Ford. The funny thing is that abandoning the dog got you caught. I got a call from a vet in Hodgeville. They brought him in for identification; he had a microchip in his ear. When you examine it, you find out the whole thing.
They were never successful. Not a single one. They were all defeated ... burned... and put on the run. That's who they are. What is this? It's a hamburger, I always bring a snack -- but I don't want it anymore, he made me hungry.
This is mine. Gonzalez. Nicotero State Hospital? That place has been closed for a while. Maybe that's what he's using it for.
What, bongs filled with holy water? No-nothing so boring. The ancient ritual de los bacabs. If we do it right, maybe we can free Amaru's soul and save Katey dear....
They trapped her and killed her. That's why she did like Corleone, and had all the other Lords killed as soon as they caught her. All right. That's not all, man. They feasted on her flesh -- but they kept her blood because she was very powerful. They gave it into the custody of the Lord Oculto.
- What do you want? - What? No. Fuck that. How do we bring her back? - How do we get it out of her?
Or to help us find him. Because if the Russians get him before we do. We won't have any cards to play. And they are bloodthirsty. President Bozek did not order the assassination. And he certainly doesn't condone it.
He can help us. We save him-and he will save us. Mother, we already checked this path. There were no tracks. Then we will check it again until we find some.
- It excludes him from the suspects. - In other words: you were wrong! Mrs. Batch is still a suspect. If we can figure out where the cyanide came from, maybe we can link it to her. Some pharmacies sell it.
Criminal harassment, stalking. Peter develops unhealthy obsessions all too quickly, and there's a new woman in his neighborhood. She's blond, he follows her around and fantasizes about her. - Do we know her name? - I don't think he does either.
No, but he'll be watching, he'll be there. Yes, but then we can nab him. And it will be over. What should we do? Send a message to the bastard and hope he gets it.
Okay, but if something sexual happens, know that it's not love. I just want to have a little chat. You know, confidences between friends in a totally safe atmosphere. Well, I've been having this recurring dream lately.... Yeah, well, you will again.
Hi, this is Amy Dubanowski from store 1217. We have an employee who is having a baby and I was wondering if we could pay her maternity leave. I'm sorry, we don't pay maternity leave. Don't give up. Well, some of us were wondering if you could change that policy, because we really, really want to.
We need to send a notice. To cover our backs. Kenneth, it should come to you, as chief scientist. Address it to the PM. Of course, he will never read it.
To cover our backs. Kenneth, it should come to you, as chief scientist. Address it to the PM. Of course, he will never read it. But the important thing is that we send it.
After the incident, a cross-party delegation was sent to Donora on an urgent fact-finding mission. They recommended establishing clean air zones around London as a precautionary measure. - I never saw the report. - For obvious reasons. Our prime minister threw it out, saying it was not a priority.
Sophie wasn't exploited, she just wasn't a careerist. I'll find other people to help out. Don't worry, things have always worked for me. Well, new businesses thrive or die by their reputation. If you don't deliver an importarte order to a verbose mayor, I think Martha would make sure everyone knew about it.
Once ... you've seen inside the machine ... they never let you go. I argue that the universe is infinite and finite at the same time, infinite energy in a finite system. Everything because of sphincters. Everything is controlled by sphincters. From black holes -- to butt holes. So, the universe is shaped like an apple, and at its center is crossed by a passage, which cuts it in the middle.
- Yes. One more night and that's it. This is a good deed and will not go unnoticed. I will pay you back completely. From black holes to ass holes. So, the universe is shaped like an apple, and at its center it is crossed by a passage, which cuts through it in the middle.
How is your life going to go to shit? Look, you're going to be there, I'm going to be here -- what if -- what if I need something? Like what? Like, like the remote control. - I can't even find it right now.
So where is mine? - It must have been switched. - Well, where is it? Where the fuck is my dick? Okay Dice, if we don't find it, I'm sure Cynthia will make another model.
Not this stupid thing you carry around. It says. Hey, I'm the director of the "Welcome to Vegas" commercial. Yeah, don't you have a name? I do but you don't you don't know it, I used to do it this way.
- Who gave you the information? - A confidential source. I see. So the DEA should give up all the data it has collected, but you don't want to reveal anything to us? Look, we can be your ally or your enemy. We are asking for help, not demanding it.
And you didn't think that criminals could have used it? - Or the enemies of our country? - Yes, I thought about that. That's why I modified the code by including the phone-home component. When the program is used it gets in touch with my server so I can track who downloads it.
He spent 20 years meticulously restoring and expanding BRT's old pneumatic tube system. So it's true. It exists. Oh, yes. Fully functional and perfectly reliable. Hugo runs it as a -- private service for his special clientele.
It was unfair, after all you did for me. I haven't done anything for you at all, Lizzy. I'm afraid for my little girl. Inject the drugs. The children the world almost destroys are the ones who will one day save it.
Look around you. You call this living? After losing my daughter ... I ran away ... crawling across a wasteland ... like a mortally wounded animal. To get as far away from the herd as possible, to disappear from circulation. To disappear from circulation and die... If you came for a survival manual, you won't find it here.
Did you have such a big fight? I've been thinking for a while about.... There was this little boy ... back home, after the war ... when everything was still devastated. And often he and his friends would ... chase me when I went across town to get milk. They would steal it from me and ... then they would beat the shit out of me.
Are you crazy? You could have gotten yourself killed. Would you have powdered me to death? You should be so lucky. This brush costs $150, and it would be a waste if I used it to stab you.
We can go anywhere. Tom, there is money. - If we went... - Verloc's money? You see, he kept it hidden.
But I found something else. The firm was given a temporary email address. And that was the only way they had to contact her. She must have done it to hide the pregnancy from her husband. Tell me the address, I'll have the technicians open it.
Anyway ... my love ... do you remember that ... homeless guy I was telling you about, the one who sucks cotton balls? I've known about him for weeks. You can't hide anything from me. No, sir. I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. I'm talking about you...pulling your dick out of your pants...and sticking it inside my sister! What?
"and the blooming of roses. "He talks about winning, "about providing society with better things, "And what a wonderful relief it is "to know now and then "who the enemy is. "Because in the garden "the enemy is anyone. "The aphids... "Time, time... "And then you devote your heart and soul to it, "you care for it so much, "and before your eyes you see the birth,
Neither did I. I think I just came out to you. It doesn't matter if it's already noticeable from a mile away. It's good because you can't feel the alcohol. You'll feel it when you come back.
- Jon, I know what you did. The note "My father was wrong about me, I had no choice." - I didn't mean my father's murder. - No, you meant the lab. You blew it up to stop Brenda so she wouldn't launch Exhale.
Now that is no longer the case. So. what? I want to be. But then I think about this stupid tattoo -- and the fact that it's going to be here forever. And what's going to happen a year from now, or five years from now, when I hate it and want to get rid of it, but it's etched into my skin, and the ink won't come off?
A few days ago, ZOMO received an anonymous message. He threatened to tell everyone his identity if she did not meet him in Carroll Park at 4:00 a.m. - How did they find out who he was? But he said that when he arrived, the guy just gave him a sketch. And told him he wanted him to paint it for an exhibition.
- I did everything you asked for! - Your boss requested the film. I didn't know that... How did you know that? Destroy the film-before she sees it.
If it sees you and activates the device, they will literally be fried. Okay, it's a two-person job.... The mind and the arm. Weller, you're the arm, so could you...? Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, now the arm gently lifts the picture off its hook, and moves it forward a couple of inches, to allow the mind, to cut the wires from the back...
- Yes, why? And we are sure it has something to do with her parents. Our friend Spy-ris eavesdropped while she was on the phone with her mom. Yeah, but an old witness immunity agreement is useless. Unless she uses it to set them up, get them here before calling the feds.
One... is stupid. And second -- her presence in my office is inappropriate. I could have you arrested for contempt of court. Well, I'd like to -- why don't you try that? Reggie, come here please. Mr. Castle I know you're close friends with the mayor, so even though you don't deserve it I'm going to let you go.
Roger Masters the host? - Why would he want his glass empty? - He didn't. And it got me all riled up because if I got caught stealing, even something as futile as a goblet, I'd lose my job. But you did it for her anyway, didn't you?
I can't throw all the things away by myself. Wait, what's Chickie doing there? It's broken! Besides Jesus, I mean. When you crush it, it says.
- I know perfectly well that you have already dug in. And you think we missed something? You could check this sand with a fine sieve and find nothing new. I did lose a cufflink in 1907, though. If any of your people find it again, let me know.
Fake. Just staged. Hey. Sorry, I can't remember your name. My boss never uses it.
Look, can you see the larva? It's right there. I'm going to biopsy the tumor - and test the cells. - Okay. Then we'll cut it open.
Well, it's not a tracker. Or at least, that's not its primary purpose. It's too complex. And it has to produce some anesthetic when it attaches, like a leech. That's why it doesn't sense it.
- How did you do that? - Actually, they had invited me. We have a piece of advice for you. Yes, yes, "don't be a moron." If you know what the advice is, why don't you follow it?
Without a condom. Understood. Give me that. What the hell--sign it. We'll bag it on the way to Carmadelle's.
I'm all right, man. But are you sure, Dwight? I just said that at the Pussy Bar happy hour Dwight gets free drinks and you tell me no? Are you cool? I haven't finished the job. I haven't earned it yet.
I'm just happy. Hey, how's the takeaway going? Is it catching on? What happened to the cast? I let the guys cut it.
I feel guilty for not going back to the dinner. It's okay. We heard them leaving. Yeah. I also heard the sound of aluminum foil so I think Jessica wrapped our ham and took it away.
You used to say you had to be five pots tall. Now you are, son. I'm so excited for you. - Are you giving me my apron? - Yes, to wash it by hand, and then you give it back to me.
- Hi. - Hi. That's us. That's right. Not only will we be the reporters of the event, but we will also judge it.

- So. Do you worry that they will understand that you are not here through divine intercession ? - It's not about me. - Is it ? - It is. It's about this office not the man who occupies it.
In previous installments of Awkward... - My article is on the front page. - Honey, that's great. - What if Matty reads it?
What? Why? Matty is angry. Wow, so Matty is involved. Matty is really selfish if he wants you to have him removed.
He said he works on a percentage basis, right? Didn't she say that? For your loyalty, I'm willing to give you a piece of... everything I'm going to transport. And let me make one thing clear. Even the smallest percentage that's going around in your head now, the one that you're hoping I'll accept -- if you split it in half, and then you do it one more time, you'll still be able to not only rent this floor,
I have an idea. Oh, the shed. That's a great idea. No one ever comes down here. We'll turn it into our love nest.
Please. - I'm not leaving you. I'm not going anywhere, okay? There has to be a way to cure this, you understand? There has to be. We just don't know what it is yet, so -- I'll keep you safe until we find out.
I got it. - Okay, so are we agreed? - Only if we can get out of here. Watch and learn. Axel is always changing the code. He writes it on a notepad that nobody knows about.
Almost all of them. We need to know that you have a plan. Now. I've got a truck downstairs, John. I'm just waiting for the valet to bring it to me.
We have everything we need here. You all know what's out there, and Denver is hundreds of miles away. Do you really want to stay here? You better believe it. There is no way to find this place unless they know it.
To change the world. But in your case-this is the truth. You are important. And you will change the world. But you will not save it.
Just as you wanted. That was the goal. But why did you guys stay late if all you got was a hamburger? Well, we were walking around Chinatown and we found this place where you can play "Force Four," against a live chicken. They call it.
You always see beauty and potential in things. Close your eyes. Look at the potential. Okay. No, I don't see it yet.
What about your knife? - I think I lost it during the raid. - Well, that's too bad. I'll tell my people to check again. Maybe we'll find it.
You can keep that one, can I have the other files back? Is everybody in? All right. We believe that. Aleksandre and Ruth Iosava are running a clandestine traffic from Germany to Syria of young girls to be married off to ISIL militants. He finances it through donations from refugees and... she recruits the girls.
Soon after, he is invited to the Warden's parties, hunting trips, and the parole board. When Hamm decides he wants nothing more to do with him Carroll shows him pictures from the parties. He has been blackmailing him ever since. Land records. It's not far from Quitman and Ray bought it the same time you were there.
The grain stored in the hold was a pretext, wasn't it? You are hunting for that cursed sapphire.... - The Eye of the Storm! - Then you've heard of it. Well, every sailor knows of it.
Enough. Tell me what would be your genius plan to get him back. Let's have one of our parties tonight. Those who stole your car will show up! Maybe we won't find the book, but we can follow those who are looking for it.
What the heck is going on? Okay, so, apparently seawater cools the engines. Without water, the engines overheat. So I would say there is something blocking the passage of water. So let's remove what's blocking it and get the hell out.
- Thank you. - You're welcome. I want my backpack. - What do you need it for? - I don't know, but I need it.
I cannot condemn Cindy for what she did. She saved her son's life. Because of her, I got another chance with Owen. I was outside the plant and... I saw a guy hanging around the building, watching him, you know?
- Yes, but if you get bitten you don't survive. Ah, so you don't believe I was bitten? I don't believe in miracles. - I never talked about a miracle. - And what would you call it?
- No. Not until I know where that book is. - Speak. - Release me first. No way. He always carries it with him so the Book is here now.
- Where are you going? - Away. Look, man. I don't want to get into this, it's none of my business, but I have to say I love your sweater. - Can I have it?
- Was he really dead? Yes. Yes, he was dead. I'm sorry, Travis. His neck was kind of crooked, like he had broken it by hitting the glass.
Todd, he's playing. It's him. Oh, no, my phone. Oh, no, I kicked it through the door right into the hallway. Now other people are kicking it and it's sliding on the floor.
Too much Christian charity on your part, Gilfoyle. There is no reason for hate speech, Richard. I can see from the bitter and strained expressions on your faces that... Richard has updated you about the unfortunate circumstances that have forced me to give up my shares in the company. Erlich, you should know that I have...written a press release. - Huh? - I won't publish it just yet. But should I realize that rumors begin to spread unchecked, I will send it to every tech magazine and blog on the face of the earth.
The reason I am calling has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I own half of your blog and nothing to do with the fact that I have been appointed Chief Operating Evangelist of Pied Piper. Feel free to abbreviate it, by whatever acronym is most competitive. And I have a story. If it's like the last one, I'm all ears. I'm getting so many hits on your article. - Everyone is reading it.
The website is a giant database that cross-references every thing ever said on the Internet. It needs people to type in someone else's name and address for it to be added to the database. If we all agree to resist the temptation to check other people's Internet history Maggie... Okay? As long as we all respect each other's privacy, honey -- then our city will not suffer the same fate as Fort Collins. And what will the police do to make sure people don't use it?
None of this matters, Rita. You know it does. So. - Late discovery and no rape kit. - No, but the maid noticed that Abby's dress was...stained. And she showed it to Laura. - Her mother.
We will need a statement from each of you. Also, we need to consult Abby's friends and social networks. We know there is a dress involved. - That's right. - Okay, we'll send it to the lab.
What do you think of Bernard? Bernard. Yes. But who am I? This is a very complicated question, for which I have only -- a simple answer. You are the perfect instrument, the ideal companion, just as every instrument makes a companion to the hand that wields it.
Takagi killed Maru. Joseph Takagi, you are under arrest for the murder and impeccable plating of Kobayashi Maru. What if I offered you appetizers? You were the one who served whale meat. And when Maru found out, she was furious, wasn't she?
- Heart attack. Heart attack? But he will be 26 years old and looks at the top of his game. He has an incredible body. The probability of a man under 30 having a heart attack is 1 in 780,000. Unless-there is something in the body that causes it.
- Ah, it's one of those. Ted, never mind, hand me the drone controls. As we speak, I'm operating the drone in our distribution warehouse in New Hampshire. Is there any detail of the attack that indicates who might have done this? I am now picking his tomato out of the tomato crate and maneuvering it toward this room.
And here is the location of the servers. They hacked us. My mom had her hair fluttering. We don't know much, Mayor. The hacker threatened to reveal the names of all users of the site unless we shut it down for good.
Where is my scalpel? Where is Dr. Stein? Oh, my God. Angie, everything is going to be all right, do you understand? I will find your kidney and I will put it back. And it will be all right because I love you.
We still have to investigate, even if we personally think they are despicable subjects. So, let me guess, we go and catch the killer without caring and when we have caught him we release him on some technicality? "Even though you know your partner is changing, she may not be aware of the change." Go to the graphic designer's apartment. Try to figure out who killed him. And then ... see what the parking lot looks like there and how much they will put it up for sale.
- All right, Stan. Let's assume it was really her. It was a graphic designer. No one was hurt. She didn't do it. Do you think if Tribeca had a rifle, she would use it to hit a guy in the head and then throw him in a dumpster right next to the building?
It takes six weeks for the publisher to get it to bookstores. Who said anything about bookstores? Numerous pages of the former First Lady's autobiography--appeared today on the DC Dish website. - Both the publisher and Senator Grant deny being the source of the leak. Those who have read the book describe it as explosive, revealing and deeply intimate.
He's going to shoot. What makes you think so? Your sixth sense? SWAT has snipers in position. They will shoot that clueless fool you hired. They will take away our hero's moment of glory and give it to a stupid sniper.
A spring covered with fabric painted like a snake? Lisa, our weekend in Capital City will make us friends again. I don't see your saxophone. You'll be glad, I guess. Honey, I want you to bring it.
Copy. Happy, what are the approximate measurements of the aerostat? Length 100, diameter 20. - I still can't figure out how it works. - Okay, the aerostat is 180 meters away. We plug the solar gun panels into it, send it far away, and ... Rahal is decades behind schedule if he wants to create new ones.
We put in the solar gun panels, send it far away, and ... Rahal finds himself decades behind schedule if he wants to create new ones. Remember, he didn't build them, he found them. The solar gun could land anywhere. That's why I'm calculating the exact time and place for the aerostat to land straight in the Mediterranean. Where the Navy SEALs will pick it up and take it to safety.
It will be the best prom invitation ever. Lacey and Sebastian are sure to say yes. - For a fish balloon? - No, for an automated fish drone. It will fly over Sebastian and Lacey, pop it and drop Swedish candy, - because Sebastian is Swedish.
I'm coming to pick you up. Don't... don't leave and... And send me the address. Thank you. I'll send it to you right away.
Great. Hey, where's Jesus? Is he by any chance sick today? So for the student council social outreach project, here's my idea. I think if we take this space in City Heights and turn it into... A park or a public garden....
- Let me take the punishment away from mom! I can't, you broke the rules. - Because of you! - And you have my respect. I don't want it!
And now I have to do everything myself. And a baby you can't abandon. Why do you say that? That was the point, right? You think I'm going to abandon him?
Can you send me some money? "Are you kidding? "I'm waiting for the script! Let's talk about it later, shall we? Good. We'll talk about it when I send it to you.
Staple them together and put them in order in one stack. If you make mistakes or typos, shred the pages with the paper shredder. - Do you have a cell phone? - Yes. Do not bring it to work.
Go, go, go. - He let them all go. - Except for Angie. A set of keys. She still had it.
I used to make deliveries to his family. Along the canals. Once a week, at the same time. She would look out on the balcony.... She would smile at me. She would lower her basket.... And I would fill it.
Once a week, at the same time. She would look out on the balcony.... She would smile at me. She would lower her basket.... And I would fill it. Then, she would pick it up....
That would be a really good collaboration. My grandfather, Jonas Quincannon. Once, the Gormann brothers had a hog problem in Las Cruces. Hoping to move to their territory, they lobbied the wholesalers, or something like that. Anyway, Jonas found out about it.
I am the alpha and omega. No, not at all. I am the bright morning star. I just saw you put your finger in your nose. You are wrong, my son. I was scratching it.
There is my retirement fund! If no one stops this hacker, we risk global economic collapse. Relevant people. My office. National City's entire data processing system has been hacked by a cyber-terrorist attack, and no one knows why they are doing it, or who they are, or when they will strike again.
This and the Pope's support are the only things left for me to fend off Elizabeth and fight the rebels who try to steal my Crown! The rebels I fight have not only stolen my Crown, but they are also beginning to take out my children. Charles has been seduced by Narcisse, and Claude has been sold into marriage. Isn't it possible that Narcisse is just trying to do his job? Do you really think... That once he gains power, Narcisse and his friends will willingly hand him over to my son's eldest?
- He seems to have left weeks ago. - So Curtis Miller is gone and we still don't know who the third Pretorius agent is. - His children are in danger. - Monty, you still haven't told Armand Smit and his wife about Brandon's rescue, have you? - As you requested. - So now we have no choice. The only way to know the name of Pretorius' third agent is for Monty to get it from Smit himself.
What is it. A contract. - For what? - For the mask. I have to sign a contract for a mask? And you have to sign it in blood.
You'll have to apologize to my husband, too, the next time you see him. Oh, is he suffering from it? A little bit. Well, it would be strange the other way around. Anyway... If I want to succeed, then we'll need all the help we can get. Well, I'm sure you are surrounded by good people who will offer it.
Speak. Jaha's backpack. What does that have to do with it? The AI is running around in there. If we destroy it, I'm pretty sure we'll destroy her.
Honey? No! Don't cry. I can... I can keep it if you want. I can't... I can't give it back anyway.
I have seen many such situations. Are you referring to your experience with soldiers wounded in war? Look, emotional recovery can be just as hard as physical recovery, but there is nothing more important than hope. A city worker found a body near the freeway. - It's being taken to the lab.
Okay, on Marvin. On Marvin, can we stop for a moment? "Strawberry." My little strawberry, I like to think about other girls sometimes. The truth is, though, if you ever left me, I'd rip my heart out and never put it back together again.
Maybe that includes saving Hannah. We have to get through this day, see if the Machine takes us back. We tried it your way. What do you think Jennifer really meant? She said -- that time -- she knows that Jones invented time travel, and she needs you to do it.
Against what? The future. This project is massive. That's right. That's why we will call it "Titan," titan.
The report mentions a place called "Titan," and a man called "the Witness." - Here we go. - We go back to 1961, we find Kirschner before Mossad does, we find Titan, we find the Witness. - We cut off the head of the snake. - It won't stop the storm out there. We save the world - by killing the one who destroys it.

Found unconscious, intermittent blindness. See. Facial paralysis. That's a classic sign of a stroke, right? Yes, it could be. If it's a clot, tPA will stop it right away.
- Well, maybe I didn't explain myself well. - This place is a hovel. - How dare you? This is a special building. I mean, many famous African-American authors rented this office for the days when nobody else did.
I don't know what that means, honey. Let me see if I can find Cookie.... Let's take a picture with him for Christmas cards, too. Ma, we're not going to take a picture with the cat. We have to go now. But thank you again for this sweater, I love it.
It is difficult to talk about it. Thank you. Phil. Why don't we remember this last piece? We just did it this morning.
Painted... - What? ! - I don't know! Little Sam's accent is great, don't you think? It would be nice if he could keep it, but he will surely lose it as soon as he goes to school.
‚ô™ ‚ô™ ‚ô™ ‚ô™ When we were kids, we had to learn this sacred song from the heart and understand it. By the end of this weekend, I expect you to know it too.

Is Christy stable enough for transplant? - You mean right now? - Now. Yes, she is. Then do it.
Systolic is at less than 70, with subdiaphragmatic hemorrhage. There are grounds for an angioplasty. I've never done it before. - None of us have ever done it. - It's dangerous. We stick the balloon into the aorta, and we inflate it.... Above the level of the hemorrhage.
Oh my God, that looks horrible. Sir Galavant, it's me, the cook. Thank God! Why do you have Isabella's amulet? She never takes it off.
This is not a cold war, but a direct confrontation, Captain Yoo. Coming from you... Mine is more like an arm wrestle. What is it? Who do you want to throw it at?
Oh, how could we? He even made us ice cream by hand. - How? - Yeah. Oh, you know what we should do? Send her a picture of us eating it.
You met your stepfather instead. Can I assume that your visit had something to do with his book? Do you know about the book? An hour ago, I signed for a package containing almost two hundred copies, but I have known about it for months. An associate brought it to my attention.
It will probably be dismissed. Although, of course, your ex-husband won't end up the same way. I tried to tell you that. Look, if this case stands, although it shouldn't, but if it does -- my orders will not be to discuss the case. It will be about destroying the man who is holding it up.
Yes, please. Hey, will you promise me something? - Sure. - No more secrets. Okay? If you have a problem, come to me and we'll solve it together.
They probably broadcast it as skywave. - It works like ham radio. - He's right. Anyone with an antenna can receive the signal. Let's issue a statement before other radio stations rebroadcast it.
What if we talked about it here, mustache? I'll squash you like a gnat! Enough, enough! Jesus. If you don't stop it, I'll put that baby under lock and key and none of you will ever see it.
Why are you doing this? You are about to become a grandmother. Isn't that something that makes you happy? For how long? Once you take the child into that house, I will never see him again.
I had Samuel put it on, who apparently never sits down. That son of a gun has reached 11 kilometers! That is not a plausible number for you, my friend. Don't you think I'm aware of that? No, that's why I have to send the count back before Molly sees it.
I'm sorry, Craig, I didn't even ask. What... - What do you do for a living? - I'm a musician. I currently play in a jazz quintet, the Quintangibles. I came up with the name, but I hate it.
Tres Pasitos. Three Little Steps. It is a Mexican rodent poison. The rat can only take three steps before it dies. They no longer sell it in the United States. They don't...
I think it would be important for Jesus, just as it was important for me to be able to get to know Ana, or at least have the chance to do so. But. He can't as long as Gabe is on that registry, because, legally, Gabe can't be around minors. Or live within 500 feet of a school. And do you know how hard it is to get a job when you're on that list? He doesn't deserve it, Mom.
- Oh, yeah? Well, that's what I think. No one is saying suicide is sexy. Teen suicide is a real problem, Brandon. And serious too! Gosh, and you're making it hip with your piece.
The publisher sent us the PDF. "The poor fool has no idea I put hemlock in her salad. Here she sits, her molars chewing the leaves into the shape of her fate." "The shape of her fate?" He wants me to send it to my editor, but I can't do that to Lerna.
Mr. Todd confirmed that you had a windowsill vase. The week before Grace's death, you told him to take it off and throw it away. He didn't. He gave it to another one of his patients. We have it.
Hi Liv. How are you doing? Clive didn't tell you.... - About my lottery ticket? - That's the first time I've heard that.
I just care about Gareth and I promised him I wouldn't use him. And he seemed super upset about the vacations. I could... go help him fight. Listen -- can I be direct? You want the power, I'll offer it to you.
Sure. Good story. No. That's not how he got that name. He got it because of the way he took that corner.
Start at the beginning. I work at a grooming center. I took care of this dog two weeks ago, but the guy who brought him to me came back to get him back before I was done. He was all sweaty and quite tense. He told me that he stole the dog from a policeman who was mistreating him and that this policeman wanted to take him back.
It's true. It's okay... I'm weird, too. Did you know that cicadas spend a good 17 years underground, and when they come up to the surface, they immediately lose their shell? They spend all that time building it, and then.... They leave it there.
- Maybe. Or maybe you threw Overson's laptop overboard. And maybe the Coast Guard fished it out a couple of hours ago. And maybe Overson's hard drive was waterproof. Since he was using it on a boat, after all.
The victims all died because Leo did not start the ambulance in time. He orchestrated their deaths. I called the NYPD. They issued a warrant for Leo, and they got the antidote. - They will spread it with AMBER messages.
What if Aguirre is telling the truth? Well, what if he's lying? Either way, I don't like this. You know the story of how your father bought the hotel? I know that... he was finishing his service in the Navy, found a piece of land he liked and bought it.
I will try, but you will not believe me. There can be no good without evil. But evil must be confronted before it can be eliminated. What I do is to take evil from those who come to seek salvation. Where does it take him?
I always knew he had one. Good Lord. She stole the Queen's jewel. I doubt she would care. What on earth would she wear it with?
You were a little embarrassed, you had the "Judge Judy" look on your face. - Really? - Yeah, a little bit. No -- sex was never my.... Well, maybe you were doing it with the wrong people.
I send you to the hospital for a mammogram. Did they ever tell you what really happened in the fire? I couldn't save Warner... but I did save your son. Sex was never my... Well, maybe you were doing it with the wrong people.
Do you have feelings for him? Jackson? There is something between you. It's just that... When my daughter died, he did something for me, he -- he did me a favor, and I'll never forget that.
- Go ahead. - Thank you. Hi, Liz. Sonia told me they found Helen's body. It was supposed to be the breakthrough we've been waiting for -- but according to forensics, there's no clear evidence linking it to Sonia.
A son who lost his mother. An officer who became a murderer. But, I am a man, Beklemis'ev, and I cannot be commanded at will. Remember, I will live until I get my honor back. And how will you get it back?
- Let's talk about wine accessories. - Wait, are we going back to the calendar? - Because if you wanted to do that. - We don't have to. She doesn't like it, forget it, because she'll love this.
Yes. One of your detectives called to get a list of all the people who had access to our house. These are all the ones I could think of. That's going to be very helpful to us. There's also a water delivery guy we had until about six months ago. I didn't have the number, but I'll find it.
So we will need to make sure the gun is calibrated correctly. We'll need a drone to destroy as a test. Oh, no, Birdroni? Yeah, you better dust off your little toy, buddy. Because we're gonna blow it up in the sky.
I mean, think about it. Wait a second. Miss Clemens... you might not agree with this project. Actually, I don't agree with it either. Actually, I don't understand it.
- You're right. I don't understand it. I don't even know what this stuff is. A candlestick? If this is the help you want to give me here, then I don't want it.
Your confirmation is very important to me. Isn't that enough motivation for you? I like going to church with the family, but I also have a mind full of questions and it is hard for me to believe in what I cannot see. That's why I love my work. I know what I do, why I do it and who I work for.
- It's funny. - Not so much. Drawing is done in kindergarten to get out of the box. That's enough now. A lot of people do it for a living.
You wrote a comic book. Yes. Would you believe it? THE HAPPY BLUE BIRDS A big hit. All over the world they are reading it.
If I had known, I would have gone there more often. - Do you want more? - Yes, thank you. You were hungry for some. I haven't had it for a long time, it's so good.
You can use it in your next book. Mark it now before you forget it. Stop. - Where is the notebook? - I will remember it.
- That she could eat it all. And I call her granny because.... come on, just look at her. It's interesting that Leonard and Penny know her nickname and you don't. Well, a-now that I hear it, it sounds familiar.
- Crazy. Crazy, I don't know anyone who likes it. - Don't tell me you also like food. - It's my obsession. Seriously, I eat it three times a day.
Me too. Gevork, what are you doing? I said, "Take the Cahuenga Pass!" He still hasn't answered the question. "Even if I could pull up that wall, who would pay for it?"
So, Henry came over and I asked, "Who wants ice cream?" Dave agreed, but poor Henry had just returned from a trip to a dairy farm, And of course, Molly couldn't leave him alone. So I called Mrs. Pancake to watch him in the meantime. Molly and I got ice cream and ate it.
What if you had been followed? Listen to me -- stay calm. If you don't, you and Ghost will wear the same color suits. How do you pull so well with that glove? By the way, why are you wearing it?
In previous installments of You Me Her. How often do you have sex? If I stuck my tongue in Emma's mouth, she would probably laugh in my face. You do it with someone you don't know.
Something is going on. What is he saying? He's dying. I don't know what else to do. The child needs physical contact, but Finnerman won't allow it.
You got it, sir. Flynn, would you like to say a prayer? - I haven't done that in a while. - Be honest, you'll make it. Lord, thank you for this food, and for the hands that prepared it.
- I did not move you. What... are you saying someone else did? After you went to sleep, Marcus let me know that the missing rug had been found. The one from the video? The police tracked it from the gang's dumpster.
- Amelia, please come with me. - No! I don't want to change! Can't you see? I have to wear it until my heart is healed.
- No! I don't want to change! Can't you see? I have to wear it until my heart is healed. Until then, I will wear it to remind me of my folly.
Based on everything I was learning, Ramos was a person to be admired. There was more to this than just manslaughter. II had a gut feeling, sir. I knew it from day one, and I should have followed my instincts.
Please. Milly, this is a really bad idea. How do you prove that the woman really existed? Grandpa must have hidden the body somewhere. The police will find it.
Please do not approach. Please stand back. I just want to pray for the deceased. The branch obstructed the road at head height. - It hit him at high speed.
What did you bring him? Clothes...books...his watch. May I see it? Where did you find this watch? Mother kept it in her room.
Not now that you know the truth. Mom, I don't care. Why did you take his pocket watch? It was a gift for Alexander's 18th birthday. He loved it; he always carried it with him.
- And we all have jungle fever. Mone, where are the glasses? Here? Oh, found them. Well, it's worth talking about Mom and Dad's wedding. I would describe it as a magnificent GLEN BROTHER random crossbreeding.
- Drop it, Wallace. - I didn't do it! I've known him for 20 years, he wouldn't do that. Then why is he threatening my men with a poker? Please, Mr. Wallace, put it down.
Ten days. It's hard to say. Hard to be sure. You have to be guided by the pain. If you endure it, move on.
Amy, Julio and I can do a thorough research on Calderon's clients and see if there is a match - with our case. - Good. Maybe there is some movement with one of our 10 little Nazis. Chief Howard, what are you doing here? The Los Angeles Housing Authority and Martin Borja announce their plans at noon, and Borja has carved out a small park between the mall and the apartment building that will rise where the Zyklon buildings used to be, and will name it after Chief Taylor.
Let's talk about the weather. Does your giant mole hurt when it's going to rain? Well, here's something you don't see every day. I'm rubbing a pomegranate on my mole. Do you feed it now, too?
It doesn't exist, it never existed. It's here. It's here and I know it. I feel it by instinct, like I felt it when I knew you killed your wife. And I will find that money, and when I find it,
- Hi. What's going on? Engine problems? Apparently, the fuel line is clogged. All under control, guys. I'll fix it. I'll take it to my place to fix it, got it?
- I don't know if it's good, but ... I could use a professional opinion. - Mine? - Well, yes. You're a publishing star for a very good company. You know a good book when you see it.
Nice. It's like, a cross between "The Bonfire of the Vanities" and "The Walking Dead." Are there zombies? Yeah. It's they take over Wall Street. I shouldn't say anything, really, but Scott Rudin loves it. And Paramount is already thinking about a three-picture deal.
Do you want to see my drawer? - Yes. - No, that's okay. I trust it. You know, I'm a little old for small talk. You gave it to me in seventh grade.
Millennial finally has an opportunity -- and I don't want to waste it. It's not for the holidays. It's for ... visibility, and Millennial really needs it. Like Colin? That book is going to be a hit. And I hate the fact that we don't have it.
- See how they are online now. - They are all aces. Everybody is connected. It looks like I'm dying. The electrical hum of the brain is very low because it has to go through the scalp and a layer of hair, and that's where we measure it.
Tell me about it. Does everyone annoy you? And how am I supposed to feel? She looks like she just had an orgasm. How do you feel about sex? I don't think about sex unless a human asks me to.
At one red light, I ran out of ten things to do, that's great!" But then I reflect, and since it is possible for us to do so much, all the time, thanks to cell phones, we are expected to do so much. Which means that as technology advances, we are forced to achieve this level of productivity. My phone is always off, always off. Unless I'm waiting for a call and I turn it on, I always miss calls, because...
But then I reflect, and since it is possible for us to do so much, continuously, thanks to cell phones, we are expected to do so much. Which means that as technology advances, we are forced to achieve this level of productivity. My phone is always off, always off. Unless I'm waiting for a call and I turn it on, I always miss calls, because.... - I used to leave it on...
Was that bad or good? Sometimes it seems to me that there is a tendency to emphasize the negative side. - What is the positive side that they don't talk about? - People were taken care of. What would you do with a new tractor that you just bought, would you tear it apart? Would you mistreat it?
Sometimes it seems to me that we tend to emphasize the negative side. - What is the positive side that they don't talk about? - People were taken care of. What would you do with a new tractor that you just bought, would you tear it apart? Would you mistreat it? No, you would take care of it, because you paid a lot of money for it.
Yeah, see that little piece of metal in there? Let me see if I can pull it out.... It looks like a microchip. Yeah. A lot of new credit cards have it. Let me scan it.
Daddy is home! Look, Daddy, I made you a friendship bracelet. It means we are M.A.P.S., Best Friends Forever. But you can never take it off or else I will know. - Understand? Do you promise you'll never take it off? - I promise.
Dean, wait. Tim. - What do you want from me? - I just want to learn. Don't overthink it. The program is doing well, people love it, critics love it.
Technically it is English, but the language has evolved to include a unique vocabulary and a certain grammatical structure. I can translate it. You threatened Eddie to kill him. He said he sent the message to Eddie because he was furious. He drives a cab illegally and Eddie borrowed it two nights ago.
I should never have fallen asleep in my steering wheel. That's another way of looking at it. As soon as I got out of the academy, they put me with this longtime officer, Perzecki. He kept a pillow in his car. He would put it under his arm when he was driving and under his head when he was taking a nap.
If they are able to talk, don't do it. And, Molly -- before we go in, I want you to have one thing and I don't want any arguments. I told you I don't want to do it until... Oh! Grandma's ring! You two have always had a special bond. And I know she would want you to have it.
I told you I don't want to do it until... Oh! Grandma's ring! You two have always had a special bond. And I know she would want you to have it. Oh--I don't know what to say. Just say you'll keep it.
Like the weather. I have changed. Between my clinic and Nick, I'm already running out of time. I told them I'm not interested, but they don't give up. - They recognize good when they see it.
It was the only way I could get accepted. I will be able to maintain my practice here and spend time with Nick. I've gotten pretty attached to my life here in Middleton. And I have to admit, making that diagnosis to your guest probably did something.... That pushed the committee to get me the job.... The way I wanted it.
Do not delude yourself that our Republic is a true democracy. The lordship lives on bonds of loyalty and mutual protection. - We can buy them. - For Albizzi, our money is "dirty gold." Anyone who accepted it would be the next defendant.
Albizzi will marry his son to Isabella Contarini in secret. Contessina did well to give us this information. Contarini is our client in Mantua. - They got rich with leather. - That money will be Albizzi's. He will use it to pay other mercenaries.
Good morning. - Is Voight there? - Yes. I'll announce. If you lose to a firefighter, I don't care if you do it for charity -- you go home.
I would like to make the right decision. I remember when I thought taking a meningococcal sample was an important thing. Nobody needs that. The Americans have it. Or they test it to make an antidote, in case we used it, as they say at the lab.
Murray, the vacuum cleaner wheels don't fit very well. Can you come over here and look at it? I bought you a new one second-hand nine years ago! I tell you it gets stuck. You see, if you move it.... - Back and forth, see?
I do it for Amy. - What are you doing for me? - Yeah, Karma, what's going on? Amy, please... I don't know what you're doing, but I'm on a date with Felix, and I don't want anyone to ruin it.
Dad had a deal with the mill. Yes, but he didn't have any reeds to squeeze last year, so they terminated the contract. - And you're just telling me this now? - Calm down. - You'll see they'll renew it.
One moment, one moment. Am I the child? I really wanted to be the warrior. You're being a bit of a child. Your bi-gun -- the way the Ancients used it.
When I was out there looking for Deiser, those creatures didn't dare come close. The sensors bother them. And the base is surrounded by them. If we could catch him, we could keep them at bay while we clear the ship. There is only one problem: How do we reach him?
- They gave me an aggression alarm. - Wow, useful when you get shot. They also offered me a bulletproof vest. As if I didn't sweat enough already. - Why didn't you put it on?
Nothing. It's not your problem. - I don't want to drag you into this. - Hey. - And I'm ruining your birthday, too. - Hey, no. You're not ruining it.
Excuse me? Get out. - When Melissa finds out... - Call her. Go call her, tell her whatever you want, but now get out of my fucking box. All right, we'll take it out. But we'll talk about Plouffe's rescue and suicide.
I know you like it. But if you give space to your feelings you lose sight of our project. Here you go, honey. Your passport. Will you put it in your pocket?
- Faster, guys. - But it's heavy, phew. Simon, if you want to play here, you have to work. - Mom gets the food already ready. - Ready-made? She orders it on the Internet.
Got it, come on, explain it. To fully understand, we have to go back to 1924. The Bedfords, a married couple -- they open a monster circus/dwarf sanctuary right where we're going. - Dwarf sanctuary? - They called it The Lilliputians of the Bedfords. An entire miniature city to scale, inhabited by dwarves and Lilliputians.
In any case ... it doesn't change what they did to you. Those who did this to you...will get what they deserve. On this promise, I still need a favor from you. Our website has been offline too much. The good news is that as soon as you get it online ... you will get your money, and ... in time -- God willing -- your health.
Treasures of Art - Have you solved it? - I think so. Python must have noticed this book in your office. He is using it for his tricks.
I mean, what if I did that and I couldn't sleep at night anymore? Abby. You're a nice person. You're just -- too close to the Oval Office. You can feel the power and you want it.
If I die while he's fucking, I'll come back to haunt him. Are you fucking with me? That's why they call him the Castle That's Not There. It's invisible. In fact, the castle had only been built invisible for cost reasons. The royal family had spent all the seasonal dues before they remembered that they had to build the castle. A castle built from scraps is perfectly fine if no one sees it.
No, no! Kady... Run. Run away! Kady, it was my hermit who healed your heart. And now I will taste it.
It doesn't. You can go. - You don't have to stay here. It's okay. - You know -- you can't make me feel guilty for doing my job -- even when I'm barely doing it.
What? Do you want to be buried or cremated? - No, brother. You don't? I will never die. But if I do, I want you to embalm my body and put it in the corner of the gym.
E... has a baby inside... Fly low, Bunch. You won't hurt him. I know... If you don't want it so often, why don't you get her something?
Come here. Okay. This is the safety. If you see the little white dot, it's on. If you pull it down, you take it off.
Bags full of money, the days he was away, the drinking-it was all a scene. A cover. Everything he did -- he did it for you. It goes... like this, "I carry your heart.... "I carry it in my heart.
I don't understand what the problem is. You can't say it, can you? I can say it! I can d-- Listen, people say it all the time.
And then we wait until he calls in tears. Hey, it's for you. Thank you! Hi Mom! Yes, it's a helmet and the girl I'm dating loves it.
Hey, you shouldn't smoke in here. It's very bad for mom. Okay, okay. Did she give you her bracelet? Yes. I still remembered it after so many years.
She was trying to extort money from me. Wow. Can you explain everything from the beginning? Sure. The program works. To prove it, we have to get the kids to finish it.
Those words are his explicit wishes to live on through the most generous gift one can give. So today we will honor. Joy Tanner's wishes. A patient in Lancaster is dying of congestive heart failure. His heart is also on the wrong side of his chest. He needs a miracle, and she has it.
You can't just tell me you had a dream, THE PRESENT-I want all the details. - I don't remember the details. - Yes, fuck... - Enough! There must be a limit, and telling my mother the background of my sexual fantasies definitely crosses it.
Because you are clearly hiding something in your hand. We found the ring. I mean, I was waiting for a special occasion. It's the closest thing to a family heirloom. I want you to have it...
Yes. But the first thing you have to understand is that autism is not ... a one-size-fits-all disorder. And it is not a disease. It is a set of behaviors ... that cause difficulties ... - in social relationships. - Okay, well... you're telling us that autism is difficult to determine, so how can you... say it's definitely autism? I'm sorry, but it won't go away if we call it something different.
Just because you make for two you can't consider yourself a couple. All right... You want it? Come and get it. All right, we'll split it.
Man, I... I can't get enough of those little guys. LOVE OF CHILDREN IsabelAllende "House of Spirits" It's one of my favorite books. One of mine, too! I read it every year.
No, but people who want Kirkin ... they can help me. If you give them Kirkin, what did they promise you in return? Proof-that Arkady is alive. They told me he has a message for me. I will get it if I kidnap Kirkin and put him in that container bound for St. Petersburg.
I don't know if I can do it. You have to come and help me, Clark. I can't leave now. The fun was about to begin. Or as everyone here calls it, the "div-haaay-rtainment."
Alone...boxing on pay-per-view...Irish pride versus Cuban phenomenon. Both in the ring and in my bloodstream. But then Gloria and Mitchell got in the way. Jay, Cam is going to watch the fight, too. Why don't you watch it together?
- What... What are you doing? - I'm getting a lawyer. Yes. There are a lot of ambiguous terms in this contract. I wouldn't sign it.
It's a bank statement from the bank, showing a balance of almost $50,000. Okay. So what? Detective, your brother opened this account in your mother's name after he became a wanted man. We have been monitoring him ever since.
- Nicole also said she smelled sour fruit. Like fermented fruit. - Liquor. - Ethyl is not found in liquor. In my time there was. Smugglers used to use it.
And... and then he... - Lou! - Goddamn it! Do me a fucking favor. All of you! Don't you dare mention that name again--because the next asshole who utters it--will get the same treatment as Levi.
I had an audition. I got an agent. I sent videos. But how can you give up your dream of becoming a golfer? I'm not giving it up.
Where can I leave you feedback? You need to evacuate Old Town. We don't know who or how many people he wants to kill. What if he releases the gas during the evacuation or spreads it throughout Westerley? Or what if the rebels use it to attack Qresh again?
It would suggest another serial killer on the loose. And that can't happen. Because my hard work would be wasted. They would come here, close the hospital, and I would die. Wait-what? I meant to say that I've invested so much in this place that if they shut it down, I'd die from it.
Black Reedy, designer of the "Foil" development team. I designed the home button... With input from Mr. Gross, of course. And you brought the prototype with you to the Deviceroy conference? Yes, I was going to work on it during the breaks. And how can you be sure, that you didn't lose it during one of those breaks?
I mean really to the bail court. Lucca is good. She's smart -- she's bold -- and she's a wunderkind. And, with all due respect -- you shouldn't give her minor jobs. Your advice is appreciated, the partners will consider it.
Paddling! Pay up, Stan! Now! Now! Now! Stan. The hamburger buns were discounted, so I stole 600 of them. When I have a child I will call it "Recycling."
Her husband assaulted an innocent Kiss Cam operator. He deserved a lifetime deportation. - Come on, Francine, let's go. - No, no. I'm staying. - First you buy me a gift that is blatantly for yourself, and now you take it back?
But now she's back, and she's screaming for revenge. So you want to ruin her calendar thing. Yeah. I'll become his assistant, and help him make the calendar thing. That way, when he's satisfied with his work -- I'll destroy it!
I mean, I could certainly pay him in spoons but nowadays a spoon is worth more than sixty dollars. How would he give me change after all? What, a small spoon? Oh my goodness, that sounds great to me! Let's save the little spoon and the boy who owns it.
You can't afford to do that, Virgil. We have a contract. This is literally the worst contract I've ever seen in my life. Do you mind if I make a copy of it? The guys in the office will love it.
The Mountain will control the outside. We will clear the fields and place the flamethrowers here - and here. - What if the fire attracts them? We have never used fire on them. We don't know how they perceive it.
- Sure will make a deal now. - You're taking a chance. I know. If he does what he says, we can make a deal. - Okay. I just want it in writing.
Erik of Sweden is Protestant. An interfaith marriage would perhaps counter Anti-Catholic sentiment It would be seen as a gesture of tolerance. Or the move of a weakened Catholic queen being bent by Knox and his followers. The Vatican would see it as treason.
Another winner. I mean, it's possible that Shady Grady, too, has his non-digital log. Happy and I should poke around. Be careful! If you were found snooping where you shouldn't, they would cut it off.
Yes, do you like the woods? I'm sure you do. Okay, don't smoke joints -- and go to school, all right? Right, don't ever let them tell you--that marriage lasts forever, because, I'll tell you up front, it doesn't! Women rip your heart out of your chest stomp on it and spit on it.
It seems he had been planning this for a long time. Yes, he used you. Didn't you realize that? Thorgrim also wrote a book. The one we found, "The Man Who Fell." I saw him writing it.
As prime minister, I am securing a future for Norwegians. But listen to you -- the Norwegians.... You took them all for a ride, the Norwegians. You have deceived them. You committed a crime, and you've known it for a long time.
Change. If we had secrets that the government didn't want to reveal we could have ... blackmailed it. But instead of money, we would have demanded change. He said we would be patriots. He saw a weakness and used it.
Patrick told authorities that he overcame the violence by "focusing on the sand." His attacker made him stare at an hourglass as he abused him. He told him he would not kill him if he did not cry before the end of the sand. So the trauma of violence is fused with the image of an hourglass. And it created an obsession with time. To the point of going so far as to build devices that measure it with incredible mathematical precision.
You're doing it to me on purpose. The minibar is in the cabinet. You don't need to tell me how to find a minibar. Can you get someone to come up and take all the alcohol out of the minibar? Because I don't want that.
- More suture, please. - You haven't closed enough. You've got one shot left with this bleeding, Dr. Hudson. The problem is that shining structure. It's the vagus nerve. What happens if Dr. Hudson cuts it, Pinkney?
Okay, and I may have gone a little overboard in describing it. It doesn't exactly look like the boat from Jaws. You're still going to buy a speargun, right? Oh, yes. I don't care if we never use it.
- Yes. - No, no, no, no, Molly! - Yes! Yes, yes! Why did you do it without telling me about it? I know it sounds crazy, but it all happened fast and I wanted to grab it before someone else did.
Mol, a real baby takes nine months. We could at least wait two weeks. Two weeks? I thought you wanted a baby. Okay, if you are not convinced tell me now, because I will raise it myself.
And if you have to authenticate something, it can do that too. What is this racket? Oh, this? Don't worry about it. After half an hour you already don't notice it.
You should really finish it. A gift is totally unnecessary. Open it. I got this notebook at an estate sale in England. The woman who sold it to me said the owner was a famous English writer.
Open it. I got this notebook at an estate sale in England. The woman who sold it to me said the owner was a famous English writer. Apparently, it was the only blank notebook in his bookshelf. She said she kept it to remind herself of the dark times in her life.
Apparently, it was the only blank notebook in his library. He said he kept it to remind himself of the dark times in his life. A time when he lost his voice. It's too much. I was just saving it waiting for the right person.
I love them! They are fant... The am--they are beautiful.... They look -- they look like a plate of tomato sauce. If I had roasted cheese I'd dip it in your head. - No!
Don't you understand it at all? - Don't you remember your first meeting? - Of course I do. It was in that very office. I remember it like it was yesterday.
My sister hates me. My father is missing. Maggie can't help me. Blair is a psychopath. I've hit rock bottom. Since when-does one of us need someone else when we have each other? Why don't we do what we always do when we have a problem and solve it? Together.
- Kirsten. - How long can it stay without coming off? I don't know, it's not a Weaving, so there's no time limit. Linus, can you isolate the signal coming from this avatar? - Yes. Do you want me to turn it off?
And I'm sorry. It was a mistake, my idea, not his. And why would you want to do that? Look, you said it yourself -- that -- the right dress can transform the person wearing it, right?
It was a mistake, my idea, not his. And why would you want to do that? Look, you said it yourself -- that -- the right dress can transform the person wearing it, right? Well, I believe that it can also transform the person who admires it....
Another reminder. Anna just caught her colleagues talking about her behind her back. Yeah? Why would that be? Because she was doing her job and doing it well?
All right, officer. And just so you know, the reason I became a policewoman is to catch the bad guys, and make the world a better place. We tried to find him. We didn't know what happened. I mean, surely there must have been a mistake. Ma'am, if there was a mistake, it looks like your husband made it.
Show some respect. - Go, Gunnar! - Whose turn is it? Whose turn is it, huh? Oh, oh, do you remember? This is the moment when he takes off a glove and gives it to a child before the meeting.
Man. We'll never decide anything with that stupid game again. I'm going to draw it here, so ... you -- you will draw it here. So, your seal will block it. Mine will really kill it. All right.
- No, it is not at all. Before I left for Rome, I couldn't help but notice that you were spending so much time together. There seems to be... A connection between you. Are you encouraging me to take a British spy as my mistress? As Francis's mother, if it's my permission you want, you have it.
Okay. I doubt he knows about the Weaving Program. I doubt he knows anything about quantum computers. I learned the adiabatic pattern in fifth grade. If there's a definite pattern, I don't see it.
- Kirsten, detached in four, three... Good morning, this is the captain speaking. We are about to land in Los Ang... I was wrong. Matt had his passport. And he had it in his pocket next to his chest -- when he died.
Which is sweet, delicious and expensive? We keep the cupcake window, but we also turn it into a bar. Those are two great things put together! Like you and me? I was going to say like a fat guy and a tumbler, but yes. We keep the cupcake dream, but we add expensive liquor to it.
Isn't it really the sleeping with him that got me? I could think of another silver lining for Randy. He looks like a man both front and back. That's a rare thing these days. Okay, I'll put him on the list.
That's not a lot. Now, what happens to the restaurant? - I mean, you have to do something. - Like, what? I don't know, but without the money they'll shut it down.
You are right. It was inexcusable. Nathan regrets it too, doesn't he? Why would anyone set fire to a tree? I don't know, but I intend to find out. If it burns down now, you will hardly find it in the dark.
Gibney: How many times have you been to Natanz? Not many, because I left the CIA some years ago but I've been there-a few times. Natanz is exactly in the middle of the desert. What they were secretly building, they called it a desert irrigation plant.
I didn't expect to see her again and I was on a caffeine high, so I ... launched myself at her, but she thought a stranger was jumping on her. - How delicate. - I was so stupid. I scared her, she handed me her wallet. - Did you keep it?
She came back and started again. - It's hard to keep up with her, isn't it? - Yeah. Okay, so it's all pretty simple. We implant an egg into a healthy body, fertilize it, and out comes the baby.
No. Not again. What about the one with the skateboard? He doesn't even use it. - He just carries it around.
- I don't care! - And people want poetry! Just so you know! Hey! What are you guys up to? We are recreating the scene, "I drink your milkshake! I drink it all!"
You have one of the world's female heart transplant surgeons, and I'm not going to tell my patient and her sister that they're not going to get that heart! The reason you raised $150 million today is because I promoted you to IOC, against the strong demands of the Commission and those of every other chief surgeon here, who said I was out of my mind to give you this position, because when it comes to rules and procedures, -you only follow them if it suits you, Alex. - What's the point? I want you to have the heart, and as soon as possible, but I'm not going to let you have it before the legal investigation.
Tell her I know what it's like to sit and wait for them to tell you everything went well. - Tell her that the procedure is called.... - Heterotopic transplantation. Deana's heart will stay in place. We will take Thomas's heart and connect it to Deana's.
Apply pressure. - Be firm. - Here you go, Jesse. Thank you, Dr. Rorish. Foley catheter? So, Dr. Lorenson, insert the catheter into the uterus. We will continue to massage the uterus.... As she inflates it.
Okay, so what's the problem? It's not on the list of devices assigned to employees. So the target faked the MAC address to stay hidden, okay. Look man, you may have to hand check all the devices in the building. I know your device is here somewhere, but I don't see it.
So the target faked the MAC address to stay hidden, okay. Look man, you may have to hand check all the devices in the building. I know his device is here somewhere, but I don't see it. Hold on. Okay, you don't see it, but could you feel it?
It's bullshit. This whole hearing process, you know? I mean, if anybody deserves that position, it's you. - If you really want it. - If I want it? I have to...
No, I'm not done with him yet. Well, he's not guilty, his cousin won't press charges, so send him away. Jay, explain the route again. There's nothing to explain. We changed it every week.
You also had confidence in Szorlok at one time. What makes it different? And even if you had the last piece, then what? You have no plan on what to do with it. I will give it to the gods, they will know how to protect it.
Unless, Ana-Sett, where is the Hammer of Tek? Is it real? The Hammer is real, but it has been lost. You don't want to give Szorlok the last piece, not because of a faint hope on some magic hammer. Gojun Pye wanted me to hand it over to the goddess.
Couldn't you have waited like five minutes? Hey, you said to go gather information. Tell him what you found in Spartax's spy net, Drax. Ronan is performing a Kree purification ritual... In an ancient temple. Ronan only does it once, every celestial cycle.
I had heard of legends about an artifact, a force of good so powerful.... That it would bring peace to the universe. That it would create a golden age for all races. That artifact... It was the Cosmic Seed. My father refused to let a Spartax prince chase a legend. But of course... I went anyway. And I found it.
- You looked at the helmet. - Cece. - No, no! - You had a sex dream about a Bears helmet? Who was wearing it?
Okay, why can't I get it out? - Probably because it's a baby M. - What? Why would you give me a child's helmet? - I didn't think you'd wear it.
All right, yes. I trust you. Thank you. But now my parents are waiting for us, so.... children always come to the hospital with their heads stuck in a lot of things, do you have a screwdriver and a hammer? We can't break it, because -- Nick got it from his father.
Hi! Either I'm at home or I'm having the best hallucination in the world. Is anyone there? Do I smell cilantro? Normal people call it curry.
But I know -- after the two weeks in Thailand, your secret mission for the CIA was over. You were supposed to return home, but instead you came to Los Angeles on your own. In order not to lose you, I borrowed a GPS tracker from a friend, Malcolm. In my watch, it was you. Yes, only you left it in that Korean restaurant.
I'm ready, John. It took me a long time to perfect the Pompadour style. Did it turn out well? You spent so much money on this custom-made dress. Are you sure you want me to take it off?
We will continue to appeal, if necessary. And each time to a higher court. In fact, that would be even better than an immediate victory. A long and tedious trial? In what sense would it be better? We make it a national trial.
Virginia found out that we did the preliminary interview with the Clevermores. She made a scene in front of Masters, and now it's very likely they're going to take us off the case. - Well, we kind of expected that. - Certainly that interview is on the record. Clearly, they haven't listened to it yet or we would have been kicked out by now.
- We will continue to work together. - God, please don't start. - Sarcasm aside... - Okay... I just gave you the Clavermore case because your husband, who loves you, came and fought for me to give it to him so that he could pass it on to you.
Your card? Yes, the note I sent you to the hospital, along with the roses -- the 20 long-stemmed roses. There was no card. And no roses either. No, the roses I left at the hospital. Visiting hours were over, so I gave them to the nurse and... told her to fix the card--so that I could see it right away.
I always use condoms with others. A few weeks ago, however, I woke up one morning and realized that I had not put the diaphragm on with Art--the night before. I don't understand though, you had talked to me about how Art wanted to start a family as soon as you got married. What happened? Nothing. Art still desires it to this day. So ... why don't you keep him?
Again. You are convinced that your life sucks, but it could be so much better. Why don't you get this thing off your chest? Because we are used to it. We simply dodge it, like the rain in my room.
In my dreams, I would buy the building and open a museum of sadness there. Okay, gone. I took care of the owner. Did you kill him? I'll call Oleg; we'll get his friend's truck and get him out of here.
- With me? - Sure. It's ready, Dennis. My new piece. Charlie, my man-you have to play it for Terry. Look, man, if he doesn't record it for you, I will.
Let me talk a little bit about fire. That's how we learned. We set the countryside on fire to create a burned area to go hunting in after the fire is out. We hunt the animals that live in the clearing. It is ... so important to tell stories around fire ... because ... they bring to mind ... so many legends about fire, and remind us of how the heroes of our mythology used it, stole ... and how fire improved the land and people.
Just being outdoors, and walking in the... in one's homeland. For example, Kumpaya looks a little weak. But when she is in the country and goes hunting, she feels better. This goanna is full of shit! To prepare the animal for cooking, we throw it on the fire, burn the tendons... and then bury it in a hole near the fire, and cover it with embers.
To prepare the animal for cooking, we throw it on the fire, burn the tendons ... and then bury it in a hole near the fire, and cover it with embers. It is a rule, it is our tradition. We don't bring animals home unless they are cooked. It has been this way for many thousands of years. We bring home cooked food and share it with our families.
It is a rule, it is our tradition. We do not bring animals home unless they are cooked. It has been this way for many thousands of years. We bring home cooked food and share it with our families. When you put it on the fire it becomes tastier.
Roy called me. He said, "Did you cook this pork?" And I ... I was afraid to say yes, because ... I had put my beak where I shouldn't, however, I finally admitted it. He said, "Come here!" I thought he was going to beat the crap out of me. Instead, he took the flask of distillate and poured a drop into a glass and gave it to me.
They don't. They don't cook at all. They look for the easiest way to eat. He is so right. If I find a nice ready-made roast chicken in the supermarket, I buy it, put it in the microwave for five minutes, and my children eat.
And it continues to work. Omar grows wheat. Then he brings it here to make flour. That's the way it goes. Villagers bring their grain here, grind it here, and afterwards they don't pay me with money, they pay me with 10 percent of the grain.
Omar grows wheat. Then he brings it here to make flour. That's the way it goes. The villagers bring their grain here, grind it here and afterwards they don't pay me with money, they pay me with 10% of the grain. Of this 10 percent we take what we need for the family and the rest we sell in the market.
Today wheat is the most widely grown crop of all, more than 220 million hectares worldwide. And it all began in an area between the Middle East and North Africa, formally known as the Fertile Crescent. Although wheat has its origins here, and bread is still the staple food in these countries, the Fertile Crescent is no longer the granary it once was. The countries that were formed in this region, from Egypt to Iraq, can no longer harvest enough wheat to feed the growing population. So they have to import it from countries that have excess, such as Russia, Ukraine, Australia, and the European Union.
So, you can imagine the process of leavening--as a series of bacteria blowing, or farting, if you prefer, forming bubbles And the more they fart into the bubbles, the more the bubbles grow, leading the bread to double or triple in size. What are these bubbles made of? The best material ever found when talking about bread is something called "gluten." In our lab we take bread dough, freeze it, break it up, and look at it under an electron microscope.
Try something new. All the bad things you said about me -- they're true. I have a plan. And for a second -- I was going to drop everything to leave with you, but it didn't happen that way, so my plan still stands. And I will carry it out.
Lady Lola... I am really impressed. I will take your advice. I heard that Elizabeth sent for you. Is everything all right? Elizabeth asked for my advice, and she will follow it.
Or maybe he just missed the name. Impossible. Nothing escapes Eugene; he is a politician. He weighs every word he utters. Do you really think he's running a prostitution ring? Maybe he's protecting it, I don't know.
All the emails you sent, all the text messages you sent, all your contacts. If I were you, I wouldn't use that phone. I knew something was wrong. That's why the phone was in my left pocket. I usually put it in the right.
You look like a broken puppet. I was just having fun with my friends. Where are they? Behind the people pointing and laughing? You don't know fun when you see it.
What could possibly go wrong? It's great. There is literally nothing that could go wrong with this plan. Nothing. Right. Let's keep it to ourselves. We don't want anyone else to do it.
Previous episodes of Wayward Pines. We're going to protect the reapers. - How do we do that with the Abbies? - We've never used fire on them. We don't know how they perceive it.
Even if he picks a card, he cannot tell me that it is more - than mere luck. - She will be the one to prove it. Give her some food. She will understand that it is her reward. She wants me to give it to them.
- How do you know? Pilcher told me! What's going on, Jason? I'm your partner in everything, talk to me! The past, you carry it with you wherever you go,
Kudos for analyzing first the B and then the A. - Cool! - Cheers. - Hey, Donna... - Last time, you went away. This is my bed now, you won't get it back.
I'm not hiding, come here. Vira... Boyko. They are both Ukrainian. Maybe they remind me of my grandmother. She wants the accident report so she can collect the annual California life insurance, but I don't have it and I have to check because the coroner didn't sign it, - because I have nothing else to do today.
No. Ed was having an affair with Opal. Did you know that? I bet I did. I know Ed made a mistake, and I know he is sorry. I know it doesn't excuse him. I know you are a saint, I know he doesn't deserve you, and I know you don't deserve this.
It seems that framing Bunchy was part of your job. If I wanted him dead, why would I ask you to stop the A.U. from killing the Panthers? That doesn't make sense. You wanted to clear your conscience. You didn't know they were going to kill him. Listen to me Charmain, your work, whether you wanted it or not, allowed two people to be killed.
What did you decide to do with it? What do you mean? It stays in the drawer. Are you going to take it back to the store? Do you want me to take it back to the store?
If he doesn't want to get married, what does he care about the ring? Because it sits in that drawer like a loaded gun. And every time we have sex or fight, he might pull it out and point it at me. But do you want it, the ring? I don't want it -- at the moment.
Because that would really be hell. No offense, but your timing sucks. You know why I brought Jen here. What do you want me to do? I want you to pull that ring out of your pocket and gently toss it out the window.
- Not now. Already? - I take it that's the job? They find a body in the woods outside Richmond. They take it to the lab with a potential witness.
- Hi, Tommy. Listen... I'm sorry to bother you... - But I'll be quick. Remember I told you that my sister has a restaurant? Well, let's say we both do.
- A prepaid, so no GPS. - Technicians triangulated the signal. The last call came from the woods in Saxon. I have an emergency warrant to intercept his cell phone. If it's on, we'll find it.
I need protection, I want cops outside the house. Sure. You have bodyguards, right? My number is on the back. Tell them to call me anytime. - I'll make sure they have it.
In any case, gossip makes people irritable. Whoever beat up Vigus must have strong suspicions about his involvement in the trade. And were you able to find out who did it? No, that is not my intention at this stage. I hope the attacker will realize his mistake and not repeat it.
When can I go down the mine, mother? How soon will they find the copper. Are they going to find it? I've never seen Francis more convinced of anything. Or more determined to be the one to find it.
If I end up in prison for my debts, that will mean more income. The sooner I pay the debt, the sooner I can get out. Unless they find the goods in our house, in which case - you'll be in for even longer! - The warehouse will be in the library, and it takes one night. Four or five men to build it, six or eight will use it in the future.
It will be a huge help to your situation. I'm just I'm grateful for your hesitation and your loyalty all these months. Loyalty is not all on one side, Ross, nor has it ever been. I regret having to decline your invitation for Christmas. I think Francis would want you to spend it at his house.
Here you go. - I have some potatoes. - Mrs. Demelza! Rosina! Is it the knee? It seems to be back the way it was before Dr. Enys healed it,-only now it's worse.
- Do you think I would have said those words if I had known what would happen to Francis? Yet, they cannot be erased. I felt that you should know that if you were unhappy in those days, so was I. That the mistake was not yours, but mine. That mistake, as you call it -- it was paid for dearly by many people.
Do you have their contact information? Do you know where they work? I have everything on the phone I dropped when I thought I was going to die. It's at my house. I will retrieve it when I examine the scene.
Oh, it was a light effort I made not to put my hands around your neck. - Okay, hey, look, look. - Okay, okay, okay. No brute force is needed here. The Raven responds to the gentlest finger movements when it's handled properly. All right, relax your thumb when you move it.
Sal, you know me. My personal life doesn't affect my professional skills. You need the surgery. - It's the only way to fix the valve. - I know, I know... But I want Dr. Shane to do it.
- lively and did not want to sleep at night. - Okay. So, he went to see what was going on and found that his flock was eating the fruit of the coffee tree. - I thought coffee came from the beans. - Sure, but the bean is the seed in the fruit. So. Kaldi went to the local monastery, and he told them about his goats, and then they collected the fruit, made it into a drink, go ahead one thousand two hundred years, and you get...
No. It was a completely mutual decision, like with the abortion. Like -- a blood contract that Hazel and I had made secretly. A big secret, a strong bond -- meaning that when I thought about killing Lesley and Trevor together with her, we had signed a contract that it was okay to kill a human being. Hazel wanted it and I facilitated it.

I would be at the beach right now. My future ex-wife is here. Hey, doll, how about a sponge bath? And if it's okay, you can give me one too. What happens when you take some cookie dough, put it in a cheap suit, and add some chlamydia?
Neither are you. It's irrelevant. This place is not a brothel. Stop this respectability. It would be the same even if you did.
Give it back to me when you're done. Now that we are starting over, can we throw away that awful painting with the duck? - No, Louis, we can't. - Why not? Because it's like you. I can't stand him, but he's part of the family.
All right, I'm done washing people's underwear. You're at the garbage disposal. At least let me finish my... - whatever it is. - We'll wrap it up for you.
- You changed the code. - I don't know what you're talking about. The vault password. Stand back. - Yes, actually we've done it together, several times. Now come with me and open it.
Holy shit! Good evening! - What can I get you? - I need to use your phone, please. They're already using it.
- What. Deer hunting. Just a couple, as usual. - I really need to use the phone. - I already said your friend is using it.
Do I give him away? Do I give it to his wife? Do I keep it? Then I heard about the shooting last night and I thought. "God, they killed him for this money and they still want it and I have it and ... And I have to get out of this mess."
- Yes. Ash's sister will take me to court on the last frozen embryo. Awkward. I have to file an affidavit before mediation, which I just found out is after tomorrow. Deb wants a court order to give it to her and I -- I don't want it.
Ms. King, the first respondent, is looking for the same. What is your position, Mr. Dolan? I am not allowing either of us to have it. Do you want it to stay in storage? Or do you want it for yourself?
Todd got the money by exporting the car. Well, obviously, Simon came into a different kind of income. And I doubt it has anything to do with cars. The transport document says "refrigerators." I'll believe it when I see it.
Okay, there is a container coming to the dock tonight. - Imported by Simon Hamilton. - Coming? The shipping document says refrigerators. I'll believe it when I see it.
If not, it would be nice if you trusted it. Did you write down the security code somewhere? - Did you tell anyone about it? Showed it to anyone? Someone used it to get in here last night.
Evergreen grass and a pool that would not disfigure Bel Air. The place is perfect. Not even two miles from Sharon, not even two miles from my daughter, and I think I saw just a little deterrent. - Lieutenant? - See if you can find it.
Soto and his team got lucky yesterday. Despite the absence of specific geographic cues, our image analyst has a lead. That little dot in the sky turns out to be a police helicopter. If we trace the helicopter's flight plan from four days ago and compare it with the ISIS video, we can find out where the image was taken.
And then they say people never change. What it means, Mike, is that -- these bills -- were never given to the Sunnis? No. According to the records, army personnel intended for economic aid were caught in an ambush, and they were ordered to burn the money. Then it reappears here, where our victim uses it -- to tip a girl at a strip club.
Well, our killer might, but I don't see how Adrian could be in Thailand and at a barbecue at the same time. Mike, do we have a margin of error? The footprint is just an approximation, so yes. Look, the killer is crazy. So who's to say that this Adrian didn't cut off his thumb, leave it with the victim, and run off to Asia?
- For one thing, she already had children. I'm a single mother working in homicide. But, as a captain, you have much more control over your hours. And, as you know, in this job, hours control you, and as captain, I would keep Julio's needs in mind. I'm more concerned about how he spends his time here than how he spends it at home.
Now all we have to do is find who it belongs to. It's your mother. I don't feel like being manipulated today. I will have said this a million times. As soon as this baby is born, you have to give it up for adoption.
No, this is the first time. - Did you work with Jeff Dellinger? - For five years, in the cubicle next door. And you worked with him -- next door to him -- when did this alleged espionage take place? I don't know why they call it espionage.
- In his True Vanilla smoothie! True Vanilla. What difference does it make how vanilla the shake is? Look, that oxycodone costs me a lot of money. I would never share it with that bumptious bastard. Never.
Oh my God, you kind of... Where is the remote control? Put the remote back on the table right now, or I'll arrest you for theft. I'm serious. I don't want it anyway.
Where is the remote control? Put the remote back on the table right now, or I'll arrest you for theft. I'm serious. I don't want it anyway. You probably touched it.
He is in the military. And where does he live? It's nice that he gave you this gift. Can I see him for a moment? I will give it back to you, I promise.
I-I know. But look at this. What does this mean for our kids? We're going to have a shortage of workers, so we're going to hire more. Make sure they know that when they come back they can have jobs again if they want them.
And now it's late to turn it in again by the deadline at the end of the day -- and I'm -- I'm so sorry. - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. You just need to call Principal Ward. Tell her that I would personally ask her for an exception to the rule. I mean, I would do it myself, but you know. There's a lot going on here and... given our history...
Sure. Why would you print an inventory of the evidence? I couldn't find pictures of the alley the night of the shooting, so I thought I'd check the log if someone mislabeled the files. But the alley was not part of the crime scene. The police closed it down to do a quick search, but ...
I forget things. Little things. Words. Like, uh, mass spectrometer. But, of course, I remember it now,though,because before I... Used a memory palace technique, where I put the mass spectrometer in another room,
From the lividity, it is clear that it was put there later. Thank you. Sure, you're welcome. You told Detective Rizzoli that you were alone in the house when you killed Robert. Yes. Come here, get the mannequin -- and move it -- there.
I called Miami to confirm. Another one is definitely on the way. With Jack dead, someone else has to pick up those packages from the basket. We have to guard the mail and get that package. And how do we do that without alarming whoever has to pick it up?
- Hi. - Jane Rizzoli. She's a detective with the Boston Police Department. And is that outfit from the police? Yes. You should see when my brother wears it.
I'm sorry Maura -- they are by fat bomb. Finally. I have two surgeries this afternoon and would much rather not skip either one. No one needs Botox that much. I don't inject poison into the body--I rid it of excess.
I wouldn't even know where to start. Then you won't mind if we check your records, to see if you bought controlled substances with your medical credentials? Sure. I mean, it's no problem. The fat is decanted into special containers and I don't see it anymore.
Sure. I mean, there's no problem. The fat is decanted into special containers and I don't see it anymore. It's Sunland Medical Waste that takes it away. But they immediately reduce it to ashes.
This really sucks. Do you carry grease in your trunk? Well, I wouldn't want it on the leather seats. Wait. Maybe he doesn't carry it anywhere.
- I don't know. - I tell you, the same thing. You didn't shoot anybody. You protected me -- just like you wanted to protect Marcus. You were just doing your job, and while you were doing it, you realized that ... you can still feel an emotion -- after a long time of being too scared to feel it.
No, but he may not be heard from for weeks. You gave him three chapters of your mystery novel, how long does it take? He's very busy. I'm certainly not at the top of his priority list. You'll be there when he reads it.
- Oh, hi. I guess you want to cancel dinner. Yes. I just got a call to help on a case. I'm flying to Philadelphia in an hour. Yeah, the formal dress foreshadowed that, so.... Excuse me.
I have been bandaging his wounds for the last two days. Yeah. And I re-dressed them. Coconut oil. We used it on everything at the community.
- I have encountered worse problems. - Yes, now what does Champ have to do with it? We need all the help we can get. That's fine. But let's create a plan and stick to it. Are we in agreement?
Go. We need a sample of Bobo's venom, maybe Black Badge can create a cure. There's a truckload of it in the basement. How do you know that? Because I was there while Bobo's minion was making it.
For all of us. I know. But I... You asked him for help. He is giving it to you.
Vernon, it's Spence. Really? Sorry, I was just doing what Vern asked me to do. Make some coffee, please. How do you take it?
NATO's founding principle is based on an open door policy, for any nation that qualifies for membership. A moratorium is impossible. Admission must be voted unanimously. And the United States has veto power. All we are asking for is a guarantee that you will use it.
It's not part of me. How long have you felt this way? Since I was a child. Four or five years old. I used to look at him and feel strange.
Okay, bye. Tito stayed in Morocco for two days. Meanwhile, all the containers had to be unloaded from our cargo ships. Not in Casablanca but at an American military base a few kilometers away. The Americans secretly transferred the cargo to their fleet and transferred it to the US.
- Maybe they found your sex tape. - I don't have a sex tape. Wait, really? You don't have a sex tape... Even I have a sex tape, man. I mean, don't get me wrong. It's a really bad sex tape. If somebody found it, they definitely wouldn't want to see it.
- I don't have a sex tape. Wait, really? You don't have a sex tape... Even I have a sex tape, man. I mean, don't get me wrong. It's a really bad sex tape. If somebody found it, they definitely wouldn't want to see it. If they saw it, they wouldn't want to talk about it.
They need it more than I do. Is that one of the points that will lead to the final debate? The. final debate was last week. Becks' secretary told us there's another debate scheduled, just before the election. This is the first I've heard of it.
Which is not good! You should be angry! And you should be shouting. But the fact that you're not doing that.... Maybe we're both so messed up, or? the sex is so great that we don't see it, but this is not a healthy relationship.
How does he know this? Did you read my diary? No, I saw your pictures on the... Wait, you keep a diary? Since you're an adult, call it a diary.
- Would you like? - No, thanks, I'm full of the fermented fish from dinner. Oh, me too. I'm really getting a taste for it. Do you know that the Indonesians call it Bunga Bangkai?
You need to bring it back here! Are you sure it's on a pressure plane? Do you see that the edges are outside the frame? It's because the springs are compressed by the weight of the scepter. Okay-if we lift it, a mess happens.
Let's scatter! Let's scatter! Here is your exit permit. Don't let the boss get you. I swear I had it.
If there is even a chance that he has the same mutation, Mitch needs to know-that there is another subject to study. - Jackson. - You know there is. - If they hear about it in Washington,
Just that. Take care of them. They are lucky to have you. Well ... I could count myself lucky once. I found some wild dill. My mother used it to make okroshka when we were in Vladivostok.
I don't... - I don't even accidentally follow you. - So, the killer is somebody from the hospital who is the baby who was still to be born in 1985, right? And we just said that the blood type is inherited from the parents. So if we identify Jane Hollis's blood type and compare it with the blood type of every staff member, we could see if there's a connection.
Yes. It's too large an area for volunteers to monitor. So the drone makes it easier to monitor. Have any of the other neighbors complained about your drone? Or just Dr. Nachmann? No. People love it.
- To potentially carry every weapon. - Okay, that's -- that's interesting, but I'm not sure why it's relevant. - The problems that drones can cause are not limited to weapons, are they, Doc? It's almost impossible to tell unless you take it apart, but this drone has a camera that takes thermal images. And this drone looks like a simple amateur's toy, but, instead, it's equipped with a Wi-Fi router that makes it connect your computer.
- Peter, you are always about to be indicted. If it's not today, it will be tomorrow. I'll have my lawyer call you. Thank you. He told Dr. Nachmann not to shoot the drone, so he brought it down safely and returned it to him.
Yes, of course, excuse me. Can I confess something to you? Sure. I never liked wine. I only drank it because you liked it.
And I'm Seeley Booth, a special agent with the FBI, homicide division. When I'm called to a scene and the remains are severely burned or decomposed-I call Bones. He calls me "Bones." Even though I'm his wife and the mother of two of his children, he still calls me by a nickname I detest. Well, you hated it, but now I think you like it.
Where, outside a bar? Stoker. Inside a platform that recycles glass. Yes, there is a machine that crushes glass and spits it out 20 feet away.
Therefore. - more jolts? - No, but also no ghosts. Well, I guess we'll never know. You know, I wouldn't have believed it either -- but after Lance died, I saw him -- and he told me to move on. He helped me a lot ... so I wasn't trying to be funny or crazy, just ... if somebody has a message for you, I don't want you to miss it.
Have you heard about the Midnight Ranger murder? Yes, the guy with the cape. He was shot last night. This is his phone. He used it to call the police when he couldn't make it on his own.
- No. No need for a surgeon. Only blood can save me now. I don't have the courage to take their blood. No, mistress. You won't have to take it. We give it to you... of our own free will.
- And miss out on all this? I'm still part of this exclusive club, Mellie. Alone, without voting power. There is a way out. No one has said it yet, but surely you've all thought so.
If not? What are you going to do? Ah, for the record. I was kidnapped against my will. I know you didn't really transfer that money to my account, and that's okay. I don't want it.
Sir. - Yes. - Lord, we are lost. We keep looking for exits, and instead, we keep finding ... Gift stores. The only reason I wear this hat is because my grandchildren made me get it, and you know, the ears protect my neck.
Of course. You need to assemble your equipment. - Where? - What do you mean where? Above the roof! He puts the antenna on the roof, attaches a cable to the antenna sticks it behind the TV and so we have BBC1, BBC2, UTV and that other one.
I want to look at it in peace. I don't want half the country in here. I haven't told anyone! This humble cable is going to change your lives. - Do you want to put it in?
We will escort these ladies to their ward, thank you, sergeant. So you can get back to your work. The van is abandoned on the road. It's obstructing traffic. Come on, sergeant, it's 10:30 p.m., there's no traffic. There will be traffic at dawn -- then it will obstruct it.
Hey! Hey! - I got you a coffee. - Thank you. I don't know if you take it black, with milk, or with soy.
Yes. Had to put out an article about a new nest opening on the base. Started at home, but only got halfway through, so ... Got to finish it. Good thing he put it in the cloud.
- Basically all he does is sleep. And although Primus is very kind and has a lovely quinquiremi, I need him to take the bull by the horns before I vent my cravings on the employees! Joking aside, if you want someone to take care of you.... Oh, God, no! You have the arm of a titan. - You pulled that record like you hated it.
That's right. I will tell you, my husband wanted to talk to you about the rent. Well, he wouldn't be wrong, because guests pay extra. - I think he was looking for a discount. - I'll put it on the bill.
And by the way, he has already told me flat out that he cannot save me. So I'll try not to get my expectations too high. What do you say? Eh, it will be better. She is carrying the child of someone else who is no longer in her life now, but she will soon be going to stay with her sister in Ohio, where she will then give birth and raise her son -- or give him up for adoption.
Afterwards, I walked you to your apartment so I could tell you about the job. But there was that violinist playing on Kenyon, so we sat on the steps for a minute listening--and I thought, And when we finally got to your door, I started to tell you about the job, but you were distracted, because you were looking for your keys. I couldn't stop staring at that little dimple on your chin, thinking how much I wanted to stroke it with my fingers -- and kiss you. So I didn't tell you about work. And I called them the next morning to tell them I didn't want it anymore.
It is a noble gesture. But you can't keep it a secret, because sooner or later people will expect, I mean, a wedding. Oh, God, my bracelet! I used to wear a gold bracelet, but now it has disappeared. - When did you last wear it?
It's very unique and elaborate. Something like that you can't buy in a store, which means. That the killer is a very good costume expert-or that he had a tailor make it. - I was thinking of the second option. Okay, so we just have to ... bait the Green Beast's attention and then figure out a way to take a piece of fabric from the costume and take it around to all the tailors to see if they recognize it, like they do in "C.S.I."
And then they disappear, never to be heard from again. It would certainly explain what happened to Pete. I had never-really to what he was saying, but-now people started disappearing again. He always said he was burning sage for protection. So why did he call it "the buzzer"?
- However, I would just like a reprieve. - What if I don't want to? Please don't make me go to your father. What would he think of your refusal? I imagine he will see it as the act of a petulant child.
We have a problem. Let me out! Now what do we do? We have his number. We go back to the bunker and track him down.
Why did you release him? I did not release it. This is an attack, a warning. Someone stole my work to use it against my family. No one is going to help us. But the Alpha Shield will keep him here.
No power, no shield, and we will be free to go. - If the pathogen spreads. - I thought about it. We are 300 kilometers from the nearest piece of land. - The water and air will make it disperse.
They are like reverse divorces. How's the heart? Ah, that. They took care of your little gift, thank you. Do you want me to give it back?
Okay, now pretend you're not talking to Johnny. It blocks fear and stimulates euphoria. The wall acts as a peacemaker. No one reacts, no one runs away, total passivity. When they activate it, everyone in Old Town becomes ... a happy, helpless drone.
I'd like to ask you where I can park and other things, but that's okay, I'll -- I'll text you! What if that big letter comes back? There's no way a high fever is enough to make me like this program. Not if we keep quiet! I hate it.
Come on, now! Out! Keep your hands up! Do it, Sam. Do it. You'll hear the sound the hammer made... - as I sank it into that pretty little face of hers.
And the last one. We have to recover the body. I have to bury it. I have to see her. Molly, I'd like to get her body back too, but they won't give it to us.
Then Jamal Al Fayeed. And now President Bassam Al Fayeed. I am no longer an Al Fayeed. I am Leila Haddad. And if I am elected president, I will close that building and make it a park for people again.
The result was a cross-section of the pain, rejection ... and coveted triumph ... of globe sellers. So this is ... a globe. It's got all the different countries and even continents on it. They made the blue oceans. The... globe is tilted like this when you look at it....
Stop whining about who you are not and try to be yourself. The boy in love with Caroline Forbes. You just filled her with vervain, Stefan. In my guide it's a step above flowers and chocolates, because when you love someone sometimes you have to resort to those means. Look, I know you've been stuck in a coffin for the last three years of civilization, but this is unquestionably terrible advice. Actually, bro. it's such good advice that I'm going to take it.
They are three years old. They shouldn't have to deal with these things, not yet. Lizzie absorbed my magic the other day. The girls had to go to a little friend's birthday party and Lizzie took Josie's backpack. I took it back and she grabbed my arm and . I know she didn't do it on purpose.
Cabe, Homeland Security must cut off all L.A. blood supply until it is tested. No surgery, no transfusion, nothing. Can we get clean blood from a blood donation? We cannot replace 25,000 units of blood with a donation. And if the hospital bought it from a national blood bank, - it would take a day to arrive.
There have been threats of infiltration into the U.S. health care system for years. It's terrorism. Is there a vaccine for Nibori so that patients can be treated? There is, but it takes two weeks for it to take effect. - That's too long. - I just learned that the FBI is following the case. Homeland Security wants us to follow it too.
- Now we're going to go to the next level, okay? - Look, I told you, I can't give you what you want. And now you want more. Jesus, look, what is wrong with all of you? Do you make a deal and then change it at the expense of others?
- Well, you know what to do. I'm going to the press conference. - Mette. - The divers found a phone. - Is it still working? - Not yet. They are taking it to the technicians.
- Tony. - Tony. He's still in custody. He stole Hank's phone, we know they assigned it to him. - I will force him to talk. - But you can't kill him.
Josef Nebojsa in Prague. We followed the trail...to an antique book dealer in Leipzig...and finally all the way here...to Portland. Here we found out that the book dealer who bought it...is related to a friend of his. The book dealer...was a Blutbaden, yet he decided to give the book to a Grimm. I have reason to believe...that she is now in possession of that book...and will now hand it over to me.
- No. But-we can track his car from the office. There! That's what I was talking about! "Chapter 10: Why I never answer prayers, and you should be glad I don't." And Chapter 11: "The truth about divine intervention and why I avoid it at all costs."
You created whole worlds! I was stupid. Naive. I thought that if I could ... show my sister that there was something more than our existence, something better than us, maybe she would change. Maybe she would stop ... being ... herself. But ... every time I created a new world ... she would destroy it.
She won. Okay, and then what? We need someone to get close to her, someone with a... personal connection. So what are we waiting for? How do I hide this thing on me?
As usual, he speaks in riddles. And who is this Mr. Yochebed? Ma'am. Moses' mother. Who put the child in a basket and hid him in the reeds.
They called me yesterday. There was a small inheritance from my father, so they did a DNA test. Turns out he's not my father, so I'm not even Jewish. - Hey, is this seat taken? - Well, I was saving it for Adam Lambert, but-I'm starting to think he's going to stand me up.
Gray Pharma. They actually have a warehouse here in Gotham. - Do you think it could be a target? - They are the only ones who import the drug. If anyone wants it, they will have to go to the source.
They hid him in a secret place. Getting him to set me up is just the beginning. I want an army. I want an army of others like me! And he will give it to me.
Victims of domestic abuse are much more protected now, so you have to create a story for the parole board that emphasizes her psychological trauma that led her to... - That episode with her husband. - That was not an episode. You're right, bad choice of words. You call it whatever you want... I call it my moment of glory.
She is asking my client what is wrong with her when she should be asking what was wrong with the man - who mistreated her, instead... - Connor, stop. - Put all the blame on the victim! - Young man, you need to restrain yourself. My client ... has suffered a lifetime of horrors, and you continue to keep the cycle of abuse alive. And I will not allow it!
You said you loved me, right? Then go back inside. Subspedia Our subtitles for your TV shows It was the fastest escapade in history. And you had to do it on my $400 comforter. - I'll wash it for you tonight.
After? Add a tablespoon of curry. Even a tablespoon? Do you trust me? All right. Then I'll put it in.
Should that electromagnet make me let go of the Crypto-Cube? No. It's to get me into the capsule. This will make you let go of your grip on the Crypto-Cube. Freezing this device will not destroy it, Star-Lord.
I want to talk about the future. I think we all agree that the only problem with bicycles is ... pedaling. We offer the perfect solution. A small, powerful gasoline engine not much bigger than a woman's foot. My partner, Bill Harley, created it by improving a European project.
Let's try it! Perfect!!! - The frame doesn't fit. It needs to be modified. - Yes, I see. Maybe we bend it.
What is that? A shattered windshield. I don't understand. She was lying when she said she sold her engagement ring because she couldn't make ends meet. She only damaged it by getting into her husband's car to shoot his gun....
- Then. Check-out is at 11 a.m... And rental bikes are free, but they run out fast. - Out. - Okay. Yes, thank you. Don't turn around. I signed the apartment over to you-so Ruby wouldn't take it!
- Hey. I worked hard to get where I am in the advertising field. As soon as I got there, I had to fight for any opportunity. And that struggle made me appreciate the work more. I think that's all I wanted for you. Do you think I don't appreciate this job because you got it for me?
Especially for Mette. But I noticed that she was relieved when you came to visit. Here's Mette. - I need some wine. - And I'll go get it for you.
If you were in danger, it was my fault. I was just being responsible. And now-I'm doing that, too. I'm taking responsibility for saying "no" to a date with a great guy. Unless you want to call it a "joint social endeavor," in which case, could we go on one?
You have nothing to do with this. Your battle, my battle -- we are one crew, that's how it should be. Am I wrong? Do you know how to use one of these? The quick release resists-I'll fix it for you when we're done.
- Where are you from? I haven't seen you around. - Orange Country. Dave has a fishing boat in the harbor. It's my uncle's; I run it for him.
I didn't... I made it out. You weren't in the office so don't even try. That's enough. How do you turn this thing off? - I turn it off when it finishes.
Julius Burton has officially given all his financial support to Sam Evans. I am tired of worrying about how men like Burton spend money. I will not renew the Defensive Cooperation Agreement with Bahrain. But we will aim to build a new base in Tunisia. We will give our economic and military support to a country that deserves it. What about the next government?
Okay, what about his cell phone? Do you think you can get into it? Yes. No. Maybe. Assuming that I don't have any anti-hacker system installed, which resets it after any unauthorized use.
The last thing we need is someone to do more speculation. - Get Callen and Sam on the line. - All right. Where are we on that? - We're working on it. - They would steal the cesium and send it to other bomb makers.
They tend not to trust. Christina Farnborough. Your nanny. Two children, few details. Apparently, she owns a diary. She didn't write anything down for fear her mother would read it, but she wrote down important dates.
Look, I've been doing these time travels for a while now. And if there's one thing I've learned -- it's that you never know what's going to change the course of History with disastrous consequences. You think it doesn't make me angry, too? But we have a task. And if we don't complete it, we could make things worse.
Saving History can be ... extremely exhausting. I believe the amulet dates back to late antiquity, and is Judeo-Christian in origin. Excellent. Isn't that great? Well, I haven't found a single document to certify that.
Capone's men are taking over the ship. We have a bigger problem, honey. Rex's killer? He's turning the ship upside down looking for the amulet. It's only a matter of time before he finds it.
That guy should become the living example of what not to do against Flash. What do we want to call him? - You mean a nickname? - Yes. Cisco does it for everybody, he's kind of an expert.
I realized that I don't want to be afraid anymore. - I don't think it's going to work. - What do you mean it won't work? I built it to get to absolute zero. I know, but we need the mirror to hold the zero point long enough for Barry's molecules to go through it.
All right, get out of here. I'm going to try to stop that thing. Come on, come on, come on. - Cisco, where did he go? - I can't find him if I don't see him.
What about the message "Come to this Earth, start a new life"? Well, what about your record as a world-renowned scientific genius? You're right. I would say we are even. If a lace is knotted, patience will release it.
Okay, well, if more come, then we will stop them. But Alchemy can't get Wally if he stays in the cell. Barry, we can't just leave Wally to suffer in there. And besides, sticking our heads in the sand will not make Alchemy go away. Ignoring the problem will not solve it.
She's -- she's just being... - protective. - To tell you the truth, - I didn't make a good impression. - Well, I of all people understand that sometimes doing a job means pissing people off. It means you're doing it right.
And in this case, it could get you killed. Right now, I could use a genie. To wish that my son had already been born and already slept through the night. Brother, fatherhood really makes you boring. If I had a wish, I would use it to become the strongest wrestler in MMA and bring home a beautiful girl every night.
- Drop it! Take it easy! Let's be calm. - I told you we couldn't trust you. - I don't want to shoot--but if I have to I will, now drop it!
I did three tours under Ronald Reagan. One fire drill a week, but never a fire. The SCIF is my first command, and look what happened. Commander, in the building where the SCIF is located there is also a bottling plant with 30 employees. An unusual choice for a super-secret shelter, so why did you put it there?
I talked to Rebecca's commander. She said she arrived at work yesterday at 6:46 a.m. and left at 12 p.m. Which means she ingested the arsenic while she was there. Go to Rebecca's office... Find the poison. We link it to the suspect, whoever he is.... And we arrest him.
- That... It's coming from here. - A coffee wafer? - One coffee pod. Delivered in batches. Anyone in Rebecca's building could have done that. All it takes is. Put arsenic on the edge of the wafer, make sure it gets taken to the right office, and then... Anyone who drinks it dies.
So General Matthews was in the office -of Rebecca the morning she died. - Yes, and that would explain the poisoning. If she made him coffee after using a poisoned wafer, then traces of arsenic would have seeped into his drink. I have seen many kinds of murder weapons, this one is.... Freshly brewed hot coffee... How do you prefer it...
I'm not sure. We have to find out for Danielle. But we have her fingerprints. On part of a package. It's still not much evidence, until Sebastian tells us what was in the package. And we need to find out who delivered it.
I was able to confirm that this morning's bomb was triggered by a cell phone. I also tracked the signal, but did not get any data. The phone is encrypted. - Russo's second phone? - We don't know unless we analyze it.
If you tell us what you know about Figgis, it will all work out for you. Do you still have the file with the evidence on him? - Does it say what she gave me? - Then it was a good idea, - we all agreed. - Yes, that file is safe - and you will never have it. - It's silly, you're outnumbered.
- Yes, I know, but ... it's not a big deal. Just some savings I put aside. We are moved, we should share everything. Like. Like your huge credit card debt? I say.
This man we are chasing wears indestructible armor that not even your big, dumb head could dent. Right. Do you have a plan? And would you like to explain what kind of plan it is? As soon as I figure it out, you'll be the first to know.
I'm listening. Do you still have that truck you used to use to haul slushies? Maybe. Well, a friend of mine has to tow a catamaran down to the harbor, and I was hoping to borrow it. I'll return it to you in the morning.
It's very nice. And you also have a bunny bracelet. You must really like them. Mother gave it to me. She said I must never take it off.
If you had to. I would like you to rank them in the order you would eat them. Follow your instincts. My gut says loud and clear not to play this game. I guess I could take the mold off the core, wash it very well and technically -- the beetle is edible, if you cook it....
This ring belonged to my mother. I always found it strange that she kept it. He never struck me as the sentimental type. And apparently, he isn't. He was holding onto it in case he needed it.
Power suits you, Seyah. They want to know what the wall is for? Show them. The wall acts as a peacemaker. When they activate it, everyone in Old Town becomes -- a happy, helpless drone.
We request permission to withdraw. Granted. Return--The crystal will not help you. Nor will it help you once I take it out of this cursed city.
I could not save her. I was as helpless as I am now. I could not give her the future she wanted. True power is not something you find by looking for it. But something you get from those who deserve it.
Maxine? It took me -- until today, to... see you as a woman. Wow. So, did Gary do me a favor? I want to make it up to you -- offer you my help, when and if you want it.
Not being invited to my son's wedding is hard to ignore. I know how he feels. He didn't invite us either. We decided it at the last second. But at least we saw it in an Internet stream.
Unfortunately, our clients have stipulated that they do not want to adopt a premature baby. - It is their baby. - According to the law, my clients have no obligation to adopt the baby. Wait-then who is responsible for this baby? If the biological parents do not adopt it, Desai is free to keep the baby
- We will never know for sure. - I want to know who did it. It doesn't matter who did it. Someone gave her a box of money so that Al would nail her in the investigation. The alarm has already gone off. What matters now is that we defuse it.
- I tried to talk to her. - Here's where you're wrong. Talk. Either go get her and fix things, or leave her alone. If you want to intimidate somebody, Antonio, go back to the 21st precinct. If you're just giving me advice, then I can tell you, I don't want it.
All the cynicism and hypocrisy, which is part of the game, slips right off you. It's a very attractive quality. I mean when you have to build political alliances. How about running for senate? A seat will open up, in the fall, and I wouldn't tell you if I didn't think it was possible.
- Who is Clive? - Remember the older gentleman from the casino? He just told me he is seeing your mother. He came in today with chest pain and the reason is that his patch fell off. So it must have stuck on your mother while they were doing it.
We need to get you to the operating room, okay? Get that gurney closer to me now. Hold on, I have a backpack. - A red backpack... - The paramedics will get it, don't worry.
At your place, Chasseron. - What do you want? - Your place. There are two solutions: either I give it to you or you take it.
- Your place. There are two solutions: either I give it to you or you take it. Let's put it another way. I'll take it, but it will look like you gave it to me.
Hey, excuse me! Hi. Hi. We're looking for Lake High Trail. Oh, you-you're on it. The drought dried it up.
Yeah, actually... I was thinking of changing it and making it about Kyle's case.... Like juvenile justice. No, Callie, you're not changing your project again! - Why not? - Because you've already done it three times!
10 to 1 that that will be their local center of gravity. - Sir? - Von Clausewitz. A center of gravity is a point of strength, like communications, transportation, ammunition. We will not only disrupt it, we will destroy it, bring Castillo out into the open, capture him and use him to flush out the others.
Where are we? Bob from the store said they loaded his food into containers. Maybe that's what it is-a warehouse, a distribution center. Judging by the look of those so-called peace corps, I'd say he's right. Castillo is amassing his loot and distributing it to the people as a reward for their hard work.
Bob from the store said they loaded his food into containers. Maybe that's what it is -- a warehouse, a distribution center. Judging by the look of those so-called peace corps, I'd say he's right. Castillo is amassing his loot and distributing it to the people as a reward for their hard work. - So why don't we take it back?
- Are you getting that signal? - Yes, ma'am. There's a lot of static, but I'll do what I can. I am recording. I will run it through the filter as soon as they are done.
You are a man like all of us. I have to be able to keep control. Shaw was right about one thing. This country has lost its moral compass. It needs someone to lead it.
I have to be able to maintain control. Shaw was right about one thing. This country has lost its moral compass. It needs someone to guide it. To bring it back to its founding values.
I know he's your cousin, but man, what's wrong with him? He's always exaggerating. When we were kids, he borrowed a neighbor's dog. "Borrowed" as in kidnapped? Everybody was looking for him.
Thank you. I'll take two. What? That's just weird. Wow, this condom has holes in it. Wow, and... oh, my God, guys, here we all are together finding out for the very first time.
- Excuse me... - Who is that? - Are you wearing my hat? I don't wear hats, me. Would you mind giving it to me? - The doctor put it on me.
The Province... - It's all there. - The doctor's contract is missing. - But it is there. We sent it to you by registered mail.
- Why the rush? - Why the wait? Well, Kyle still has three tour dates left. He's worried about missing them because of the surgery. Kyle, the tremor will only get worse if we don't treat it right away.
- Findings. - How late are you planning to be? I'd like to know. I made some chicken earlier. I'll--I'll leave it in the refrigerator for you.
- No. Cyrus. He just took over my campaign. Jake? He wants to force him to run as Frankie's deputy. I was this close. From giving the job to David Rosen, and now I'm giving it to my husband's killer.
I've seen a lot of guards these days, is everything okay? No, Allison, everything is not all right. I had asked you to provide me with bids on all the projects Emil Kurtz was working on. - Yet I still don't have the report. - You will have it tomorrow morning.
- Erkki... Then we found the car again. On the road to Svartsj√∂dammen, but it was empty. There were footprints from the car to the water. We thought he had fallen into the water and the body was stuck in the dam. But we never found him.
Good. Now back away. Like this. Hanne, come. - No, don't take it.
Your father was up to his neck in this stuff. Maybe -- maybe he knew about it, maybe he showed it to you. But when we talked about the gene before, it triggered something in you, some kind of memory. Whatever was triggered is gone now. If both animals and I have the ghost gene, why don't you take it from our DNA?
You know, I think I should just focus on one thing at a time. You know, work first, then sex. 8. On the dot. I've got to go. Ash, listen to me. You're never going to have great sex if all you do is stand there and watch other people have it.
Elliott was kind enough to lend me you. Stand right here. Are you deaf? Stand right here. When I give you a command, you execute it as soon as I ask.
About -- half the city. L.S. is a 46-year-old man raised by an abusive mother. He claims that as a child he learned everything backwards. He would not only read individual words backwards but entire pages. If forced to read a book from the beginning, he could not understand the story until he reread it from the end.
Hey, genius. What's this thing for, besides frying people? Right, you were a military engineer at Torus. So is it some kind of weapon or what? We carry it with us.
Let's see how far we go before the girls come back. If only we could ... jump the world underwater. I hate the world underwater. "The princess is in another castle." If we don't beat it this time, I think I'll give it up for today.
So. 10 minutes and I go bowling -- and I don't even like bowling -- but -- anyway, there's a knock on the door. And... I open it. I think it's that weird neighbor ... asking me if his Burmese python is lost in my yard. But no, it's... Cameron... e... he has a certain look about him. I'll never forget it.
Oh, look, Donna and I have the same vase. - Pier 1, right? - It's not a vase. I commissioned it from Kayako Sakaniwa, an artist in Tokyo. She calls it "Serenity."
Wow, I can't wait to hear about that. Let me guess, you traffic human beings. No, no, no, you're a killer. I lost a lot of money in a very bad business, okay? Back in the days when Andre was running it.
Let me guess, you traffic human beings. No, no, no, you're a killer. I lost a lot of money in a very bad business, okay? Back in the days when Andre was running it. I tried to hide it, but he's been rubbing it in my face ever since we got Sizzle.
I will need a lot of help... - teamwork. - But I like -- working at the switchboard. It's never been a matter of what you like or don't like, Pat. It's always been a matter of necessity. Your employment at the switchboard is no longer necessary ... so ... you won't do it anymore.
Okay, all right, slow us down--how do I do that? Between you and Pilot Steve. there are three levers up. The furthest to the left is your throttle Push it down to 25 percent.
Um, so just use mine. But doesn't my daddy need his liver? You know, I didn't know this before, but the liver is a really amazing organ. You can regenerate it completely. So if they take half of your dad's liver and give it to Uncle Steve, then over time both organs will grow back to their normal size.
And do me a favor, please. Try to take care of my liver. I've had it for 39 years. It means a lot to me, okay? You'll probably destroy it in a couple of weeks.
Are you implying that I am not generous? No, you are not generous at all. I've never even seen you take your wallet out of your pocket. Imagine if you would ever give me one of your vital organs. Ohi--if this liver also carries your negative attitude, I swear to God I will take it away with my own hands.
Did you hear it? - Hear what? - It's like there are mice in the wall. It sounds like a crackling sound. You should go see that Dr. White, because that sound-I don't hear it.
- Okay, it takes about 45 minutes to take effect. - I remember. It's going to be fine, okay? So just stay here and relax. The record will keep going. Unless you stop it, the arm goes up and back to the beginning and the concert starts again.
Mom, I have to summarize a book. Is it okay if I get to work? Well ... it's 4 o'clock in the morning. Maybe you should go to sleep. But if I don't turn it in on time, I'll get a bad grade.
If we wait there will be no ships left. Our orders are to patrol the station, not to steal ships. We should ask Captain Syndulla. What if the Empire takes over the transmission? I have been given command of this assignment. I am aware of the original objective and am now modifying it.
- Are we no longer together...? (LUCIA LAUGHS) Here is Mongolia, then here is Shanxi, here is Qinghai... (PAOLINO CORRECTS LUCIA'S PRONCEPTION OF "QINGHAI") - Ah, here... (ALLEGRA MUSIC) If you paid one euro for your rifle, and you sell it to me for one and a half euros,... ..how much did you make?
This is my coat. No, it's my mom's. I told you it's my coat! No, it's my mom's! She had it on.
- Who drew it? - Rembrandt. - And where is the earring now? - In the central archive in Gothenburg, I think. Then we'll have it sent to us.
Why? - Before Nordkoster's murder? - Yes. That's you with your brother Sverker. Nice earring. Where did you get it from?
Forensics took blood traces thinking they belonged to the attacker. She released a sample of his DNA, and it turned out that the blood belonged to her. - Is that correct? - Yes. We took DNA from the stamp of the letter sent to Adelita. And then we compared it with hers.
We have to cross it with a rope. I am trained for this. You give me the key you found and I retrieve the object. But you still don't know what the object is, do you? Only that the Court protects it-and fears it.
- You're welcome. - I must have some problems with my vision. I'm seeing double. Flash hit me too hard! I'm going to sue you, flathead! Someday, that helmet will be mine, and I'll use it as an ashtray -- or a candy dish.
It doesn't matter, Stefan. That stain will forever be on your soul, no matter how hard you work to wash it away. So stop struggling. It's easier that way. Maybe I deserve it, but not Damon, because I made him what he is.
- Well, let's take it back. How? For all we know he could keep it in the trunk of the car. It blocks his psychic powers and hurts like hell. He won't take it with him.
The detective will be happy. And, you know, you make it look so easy. Again, where did you say you stopped that truck? Between Spring and College. We found it on the Hill.
Like -- like this, here. See, and that's here -- that attacked victim number three. But victim number three has defensive wounds, which correspond to the remnants of skin under the fingernails of number four. So I'm thinking Duncan dropped the knife, okay? Number four picks it up, right?
I don't know how else to save this place. Then we have to try harder, Detective. It's not just about me. I mean, do you know the sinful past of this place? It was an institution decades before I ran it.
- Oh, me, right? - Yes. - Undo it. - You know, how many guys would kill to get a contract with Empire? Yes, I know, because I see it every day.
You know I support you hand over fist, honey! - Yo! Yes! - You'll always get what you want with me! "I asked for bread, in the name ... Of love and mercy, but...mankind did not listen to me. I will therefore take it now ... in the name of evil."
Thank you, thank you all. Out of the way. Lucious and Anika. Have a seat. Hakeem... fetch me the peach cobbler from the kitchen. And send it down with a big swig of Cold Duck.
Apparently, Mrs. Scrooge enjoyed collecting Nazi shit. Yeah, apparently so. According to Marv's log, the watch belonged to one of Hitler's elite men. - And where is it now? - I don't know. According to the police report, they haven't found it and, I'm guessing -- my guess is it's not out there and probably not in here either.
Okay? We are not going to save the world. Why do you say that? Because it doesn't want to be saved. Then we will save it anyway.
It doesn't matter, Philip. It takes time to adjust in a new school. It's not just new to you. I mean, I-I've never been a parent before. Why are you doing it now?
However, yes. I'll take them all. Anybody else? Man, I have a garage full of stuff. You'd be doing me a big favor if you'd clear it out.
- What's going on? - Wait... Let me put that down. - Where did you get that thing? - From Jill's garage. She gave it to me to sell.
I know Lukas has identified the killer. - What's that racket? - The Larsons' dog, he has to get vaccines. - The case is more complex than it looks. - Why don't you explain it to me?
I advise you not to get in the way of achieving our main goals. This place is getting very nice. This place will be a safe haven for people like us. For everyone who wakes up scared and lonely. Everyone will be welcome. And we will build it together.
Obviously this must not go out of this room. It didn't go well. Forty-eight percent view the exchange unfavorably. That's less than fifty percent. Thirty-two percent see it as "extremely disadvantageous."
They work perfectly. How are they useful to us? We drag the Nixie behind us to fool the torpedoes. That way we avoid the mines. We attach the Nixie's tube to the helicopter's batteries, operate the sound generator, and tow it into the minefield ahead.
- On the mirrors! They killed Clara and almost beat me to death. And they were about to impale you.... - Yes, but all this happened only because of him! All this would not have happened if he had never stolen the skull! We barely saved ourselves, and she has no qualms and steals it again!
One last thing. I told the child's family. You had no right to do that. Regina found a codicil in my will. I didn't want them to hear it from her.
It's in his room if you want to take it back. Thank you, Rose. - Not in front of her. - She doesn't realize. We have to keep Regina from knowing.
Go ahead, smoke. Smoke. Most Spaniards cannot read, however, they know that Cortez conquered Mexico. They know it from paintings, from prints, from drawings. What does Mexico have to do with it? Son, that's where the empire was born and that's where we might bury it.
You don't mess with coffee. All right, let's do it. This is the first one. Oh, okay. Okay, so... don't touch it yet.
Inside is a microchip with the numbers of a con in the Caymans for. It's worth killing for. Take it easy. Clearly... I don't have the watch, or I wouldn't be here. True, but you know who does. And you're going to get it for me or I'm going to shoot the redhead I saw you hugging this morning.
Who is the buyer? Who? His name is Kane. He wants the jewel more than he wanted the Faberg√© egg. If I find him first, I can get rid of him and get what I want in return.
Like, when did you take out the garbage? You don't do it because you're a man, you do it because you want to. Yeah, it's not a complaint, but it's what you do. I throw out the garbage and you do the laundry. Yes, I do the laundry, but only because if I did it you would put all the colors together and it would all shrink in the dryer.
Who is the buyer? Who. He wants the jewel more than he wanted the Faberg√© egg. Is it him? If I find him first, I can get what I want in return.
What did you need when you came to my office? I needed your constituency list. We have a bug. Do we? - How did you get it?
Do you know anything about it? No. You see, it's not just what they stole. All the leftover food will be destroyed. No one wants to eat it.
What the fuck are you talking about? It's that installation. The army facility. The Mass system? They install it in your head to make you fight better, and when it's in operation ... you see us as something else.
The tests show that. Is this what you want, for the future generation? Don't feel guilty about doing your job. The villagers won't do it. The kids back home won't do it.
Not ordinary, but, yes, imperfect. Human. Real. That night with Elizabeth taught me ... and God knows there could have been other ways to regain my wits, but my arrogance ... my ... stupidity ... was impressive. What I can say is... that after that night ... because of it ... I realized that if you take an idealized love ... and bring it on the same plane as an imperfect one ... it is not the imperfect one that comes out the loser.
So why are we here? Officer, do you know the story of the snake and the cat? If the snake has the chance, it kills the cat. And if the cat has the chance, it kills the snake. But sometimes, snake and cat see a huge mouse and both want to eat it.
Oh, you haven't seen Davus, have you? I reserved a seat for him on the wagon. No. I guess you'll have to go without the big jerk. You don't want him, do you?
Oh, yes, I'm loving it. [Laughs] I'm going to do it one more time, actually, to make sure- make sure I was right. There's almost no understeer. brings the rear u out and keeps it there.
Really? - Oh, my goodness. - Yeah. Yes. Mom, but why do you set it?
Jews... Veterans... The gays... They all rejected it, saying it was too big for their--showrooms or their stores. The divorce table. He had to take it. I didn't want it, but I paid for it. And guess who can't get rid of it anymore?
- Then I'll give you some advice. - Okay. Why don't you stop being a bitch? Count on it. I'm writing it on my list now, right under "start going to the gym."
You're welcome. Okay, I want to start this show with someone being shot in a cannon. You're kidding, right? Because, I mean, that's impossible. Guys, Miss Pedantic hates the show, so we're not going to do it anymore.
No. Why not? You installed an illegal software update. That's the only way you could have gotten on board without anyone noticing. Nieman gave it to me.
You know, his cousin is in jail for a hit-and-run accident. Look -- listen to me, okay? This dinner is really important to Maxine, so when we get to the restaurant, we don't comment on whether the menu is expensive, nobody's going to share a steak to save money, and nobody's going to order red wine with Coke in it. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll tell you what, Jerrod. It's called Calimocho and they drink it in Spain.
Do you think you are better than the Spanish, Jerrod? Yes. I don't like this special effort -- that we're doing for this man just because he's rich. Well, of course rich people get special treatment. They've earned it.
What is it? - I think I felt something. You can feel the pain in this place. These are residual memories. All the dark energy surrounding it.
Really? I left a branch in the window when I put the recorder in. Put it back once inside. As long as the window is leaning, the alarm is off. The window closes and the alarm is on again until someone turns it off.
Where were you? I looked everywhere for you. Davies must have activated an encryption device. There's nothing we can do. Unless we deactivate it.
Rakuunantie. You are doing well. It's a few miles up the road. How did Mitch get Jackson a tracker? - No, Jackson put it on himself.
What's in those suitcases? You've changed the subject. Something suspicious, but I understand you. This is a HiSeq DNA sequencer. It's my gift to the lab, even though Rosie paid for it and he doesn't know it.
So. - We would like the bill, please. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. I usually don't like risotto, but if you make it in a ball and fry it, I can eat like a thousand.
- Who can say what else he pays them? - According to the feds, yes-he's sticking to the part he's already played.... His brother is a lame clown. He doesn't know why there are guns in Luka's house. Okay, so Luka realizes it's not his brother calling, throws the phone down and smashes it.
He hated everybody... The rich, the Jews... the gays, the blacks... And then he started beating me. And making me have sex with him even though I didn't want to. Even his brother. They used to do it together.
Let's go! - Children! Let's leave the party while we still can! Yeah, come on, kids! - What about dessert? - We'll eat it at home.
I will leave in my own way. I did it. I hit myself. Do you mind if I have lunch here? My husband makes me a tuna sandwich every day, and I usually eat it in the car, since tuna has a strong smell.
Yarelwood females. I don't want that thing to bite me. Funny. It's a funny detail. Basically Bullock sets up a plan and you follow it.
It's a funny detail. Basically Bullock sets up a plan and you follow it. What is the plan? This one. We'll open it up at the meeting point.
- Yes, but now he's back. - What? Is it still there? Are you not well? - I beat him once, I'll beat him again.
- Sorry, I had forgotten it before. - Jerrod. Why is it such a problem for you that I watch porn? Well, because women watch porn because they're not fulfilled. We men watch it because we are monsters.
Women's sexual appetites are no different from men's. It's the classic example of society creating-double standards to control women. - Okay, Maxine, please don't make porn boring. I don't want to lie. It's kind of weird to me that you watch it.
It's the classic example of society creating-double standards to control women. - Okay, Maxine, please don't make porn boring. I don't want to lie. It's kind of weird for me that you watch it. I think it's weird that you watch it.
- Okay, Maxine, please don't make porn boring. I don't want to lie. I think it's a little weird that you watch it. I think it's weird that you watch it. I think it's weird that everybody watches it.
I know what it is like not to be respected and not to be understood. Here, have a baguette. Please have some bread. She is glutinophobic. She doesn't want it.
We leave at 8:30 at the latest. Do you think I would forget the most important day of my little girl's life? I love you, mom. Will you hang the dress in my closet? Actually--do you mind if I wear it tonight?
- walk. - You can walk in the block, can't you? In the neighborhood. It's nice, you should walk around it. Yeah, I know, it's really ...
Lip, please! - I'm sorry. - I already have one out-of-control junkie in my life. I don't need another one. You steal my truck, which I love, and sell it by spending my money on it?
We want you as a bridesmaid. - What are you talking about? - You're going to love this one. Show her. You stole a ring. So what? - How we got it is irrelevant.
Did you record it? Yes. Good, broadcast it. - What do you mean? - Instead of tracking the emitter, can you transmit the signal as your own?
- Here it is. - No, that's my ring! Well, since the ceremony failed, I am the rightful heir to all of Laverne's estate. So, technically, the ring is mine. But really, the ring is Hortense's, - if she will accept it.
My son would have my mud-brown hair, a straight spine, his name would be Tiberius, and he would communicate only through dance. Tiberius, what a beautiful name. He was the proud Roman emperor who ran the administrative apparatus that killed Christ. I have a great idea. We will take his son and raise him as our own.
Oh, careful. - I -- okay. - I've got to go. Does April grind the coffee? And then she brews it.
No. Zack was a jerk, but we always knew that. And then he was doing better lately. How so? For the past few months, an hour before opening night, a red van would arrive. We called it the "Ninja-mobile" because of the ninja star on the door.
- Drea may have witnessed the murder. The murderer might know. - What? - First, you don't tell Nolan why we're there. Then you take Drea's hat from the crime scene and give it to Dex.
I thought I was crazy. - So did I! - Damon Avery did not fall down. He was attacked. And a few weeks ago, a girl reported a rape, but the administration covered it up.
Patrick Spring very seldom entrusted important matters to chance. When Patrick asked me to track you down, he knew. He knew he was going to die. You know, I'm beginning to believe that he didn't hire me to prevent his murder. But to find out who committed it.
- Sweet and sour pork. - Pork? Yes, pork. You know. It's pork. Why do they call it "pork"?
Everyone feared that the restaurant would lose its rhythm. I felt I had to prove that I was still in the game. I think my determination came out. We have to keep showing everyone that we can still be innovative. He would sketch out a dish on a pad, take a picture of it and send it to us.
Things like, "Burnt mashed bread. Make it really burnt." "Season it with this acid, but don't make it too sour." We would adjust on scales like, "If the pickles are 5 and the bread is 1, how sour do you want it?"
But he draws inspiration mainly from street food. One can understand the origin of his dishes. Regardless of how sophisticated or bizarre they are, they all have ... a connection to local, indigenous traditions. Gaggan has completely revolutionized the concept...of traditional or classic Indian food. He is taking it in a whole other direction.
Teresa and Simonetta? They are back, they are here. At their home with relatives. Go, go! {I like this color! Do you want to put it on?
It is a psychological syndrome, in which one confused person transmits a fixation to another person. Creating a shared psychosis, which might even be stronger than the one developed on its own. The second person could push the first person over the edge, and this could cause a psychotic break. Do you really think Emma and Audrey suffer from this "two-person madness"? After watching the news reports and videos posted online, suddenly it all made sense. I think they couldn't get over their trauma, so.... They are replicating it.
It's really amazing when you think about it. I mean, they went in there with the weight of the universe on their shoulders, and when they came out--they didn't even have a worry anymore. I doubt it. They may have lost their memories, but their past continues to exist. And the past sooner or later comes back to present you with a bill, whether you remember it or not.
Also, there is no danger in keeping them there. How are you feeling? Not good. I think my foot fell asleep. Well, - let me wake it up for you.
I couldn't risk them tracing it back to me. The police have to see it. When they see the messages, they'll know it was Finch who killed Molly. If we turned that phone in, they would take us out without batting an eye. We don't turn it in.
The police need to see this. When they see the messages, they will know it was Finch who killed Molly. If we turned that phone in, they would take us out without batting an eye. We don't turn it in. We put it on Finch and turn it on.
- Because he also runs this club. Where do you think he finds all the girls? The man killed my best friend and will remain free while I spend the rest of my life in jail. The phone is in his car. The police are definitely looking for him.
I'm here ... to ask you ... just one thing. Are you sure -- was it really an accident? Mommy's coming, my darling. You like this rattle, don't you, little one? My mother used it to calm me down.
No one forced her. She's just one of the many people who want to squeeze money out of me. You don't seem very concerned about finding who stole her kidney. It's done. I certainly wouldn't get it back anyway.
- Tell me again what it's called. - Sweat. Right, right. I haven't gotten used to my human body yet. And what do you do with sweat? Do you lick it, like this?
- Sweat. Right, right. I haven't gotten used to my human body yet. And what do you do with sweat? Do you lick it, like this? No, you dab it with a cloth.
- And maybe it's better if you don't listen to me. - I'd like to not listen to you. - Wait, what? - Basically. My life's work is 3600 pages of garbage. Even Michael doesn't understand that.
He knows we were exchanging messages. We have to contain it. We need to find Molly's cell phone before the others do. Don't worry, I'm taking care of it. If the cell phone is turned on, we'll find it.
What a surprise. We found Molly Ryan's cell phone in her car this morning. - What? - She had turned it on. We had been tracking it since the day she died.
Sure, by tomorrow. The bets take a day. How long do you need? No kidding? the "Reference Range" states that the speed of a moving object is dictated in relation to where you observe it.
In America, I was free only in war, never free to rest, and he who cannot find a way to rest cannot survive long in war. And the young white revolutionary remains, in general, much more romantic than a black one. Whites have passed whole existences in this state of euphoria, but blacks have not been so fortunate. A black who sees the world as, for example, John Wayne sees it, Remember Medgar Evers, a true American hero would not be an eccentric patriot, Negro, wouldn't you want to be white?
And until that time, until that time comes, when we, Americans, we, American citizens, are able to accept the fact, that I have to accept, for example, that I have both black and white ancestors, that on that continent we are trying to create a new identity for which there is a need for each other, and that I am not under the tutelage of America. That I am not a target of charitable organizations, I am one of the people who built this country. Until then, there's not much hope for the American dream, because the people who are forbidden to participate in it, by their very presence, will destroy it.
Well, you would make a good policeman, you know? Do you want to try the bounty? Okay. So, you take the rascal -- and you position him up here like this. Then, you take the noose and you wrap it tightly around his head, and you make sure that it's tightened just right.
Now it gets interesting. What's interesting? - What is that thing? - It's a displacement gun. One of those few things that can kill a Shadow Kin. It's both target and shooter, rips through the body, disperses it to the farthest corners of the universe, taking the Shadow Kin with it.
The seat belt sign is on, sir! Don't try to stop me, please. Let's go now. I'm not going anywhere with you. Every other person on this plane is going to die today, but you, for some reason, are going to live, so be humble and grateful and get your ass out of that seat before I rip it off.
- She is the director's favorite. - When you're not around. - How can you save a life with the code? - You'll see. Don't worry, I'll destroy it as soon as I'm done.
- Have you heard from him again? - No. I miss my baby. # And temptation strong But what about your daughter being able to keep her baby? Maggie said she will keep him.
I haven't told Brady yet. He doesn't have time for me, let alone.... And I haven't felt a pulse. I have to go back to the doctor for a checkup. If I don't hear it, then ...
Yes, it is. But what's wrong with you? Are you out of your mind? This is our house. What's the plan? I finally realize I love this place and you take it away from me?
What about Carthage? We will reward you. With. The riches of a Republica whose wealth is beyond imagination. When you pay tribute in our honor, understand this, you are not buying it.
I have it. And its name is Cumelium. The empire that will one day rule the ancient world begins as a small but ambitious republic, with plans for absolute power. Power can be good or bad. What really matters is who holds that power, what motivates them and how they use it.
When you look at these examples of strong leadership, it is not just about them, but from the people they lead. It is something bigger than each of them as an individual. Mago was right. Who was I to believe that I could accomplish the impossible? You will not find the courage to lead in yourself, you will find it in the confidence of those who follow you.
I am already sharpening my sword. - You don't know what you are doing. - I know what needs to be done! Don't let vengeance blind you! If I need your advice, Cathbad, I will ask for it.
- You don't know what you are doing. - I know what needs to be done! Don't let vengeance blind you! If I need your advice, Cathbad, I will ask you. And when you ask me, I will tell you this....
- The Iron Hill murders. The last victim, whose body was never found, was Eddie. Do you guys remember "Candle Cove?" I had certain nightmares because of that show.... Katie was watching it.
After you hear the truth. Please. It is important. In fact, more important to you -- than to me. What is this place? Jews built it as a rest home before the war.
I remembered it while I was in withdrawal. My mind must have pulled it away to protect me. - Wait, who was dragging what? - A dead body. I don't know who was dragging it.
There is no one there. - That doesn't mean she's in danger, Brady. - Yeah, well, let's find her first, okay? Where's the dog? Maybe she took it with her.
Do you guys remember "Candle Cove?" I had certain nightmares because of that program.... It's being rebroadcast. And the children will watch it, just like we watched it.
Be more careful. Wouldn't you do better with some support? Yes, maybe. Perfect. I'll get it for you.
- It's a great moment for me. - What, comedy trio? No. I'm a soloist. No, we don't take your check, okay? We don't want it.
I think I like bread. You love bread. I do. I like it in sandwiches, in toast. Sometimes I eat it without anything.
- It is difficult to reach him. - Does your phone still work? Sometimes. For example, it doesn't get reception right now. You know how it is. I keep it off most of the time, to save battery power.
- E'... It's a long way from here. - He's not here? - He's paranoid. He's afraid the tower will fry his brain. He sends me the signal, I transmit it.
Shit... it's okay. - It's okay. - It's okay, it's okay. And here's your bullet. Would you take it, please?
- Hi. - I think it went very well. I'm glad you had such a good time. Well, you would have had fun too if you took that big stick out of your ass. I'm going to give it and then use it to hit you on the head.
Why do you say something like that? How am I going to get someone to play this for me? It's not enough for someone who is in an orchestra. Never underestimate the power of free pizza and beer. I'm using it to make a cabaret.
- Program? I don't want to do a TV program. No, no, no, the music program. Oh, yes. I just don't call it a music program.
I don't want to do a TV program. No, no, no, the music program. Oh, yeah. I just don't call it a music program. I call it. "The music... And the sounds that create a family."
The Children of the Shadow think they are an evolutionary mistake. Like -- a glimpse into the dark part of the universe that was never intended, so they were kicked out here to live in our shadows and be forgotten. - It kind of pisses them off. - Yes...I've noticed. These are here to remind them -- that the universe will annihilate them if they don't defeat it.
Honey, honey... Honey, listen... Listen, do you remember her eighth birthday? Remember? And that beautiful blue dress you bought her. It was her favorite, she loved it.
Are you reading "The Darkness of Tarynsville?" I picked it up just to understand all the hoopla. - And? - I agree with all the hoopla. Okay, I think Desiree knows where the amulet is, and she's the one who will eventually find it.
You have to learn to read between the lines. - I didn't expect to see you at noon. - I'm not really here. I have to get some clean clothes for my appointment with Cassie. You have time off for the first time in, ever and you don't spend it with your son?
I'm the only one who can call the train and it needs me to work. Just one more question, and it's kind of a weird one, but can we -- can we turn you off? Yeah, good question. There's an emergency switch in a secluded part of the neighborhood in case, because of a malfunction, you try to harm the residents. If you press it, I will be destroyed.
Eleanor, I have children. I have three... beautiful children. Tyler... Emma and sweet little Phillip. Look at Tyler. Tyler has asthma, but he faces it like a true champion.
What are you talking about? The dress -- that you had made to celebrate the 25th year of my father's reign. I find it hard for you to forget that. You loved that dress. The last time I saw you wearing it ... was the night I was removed from the palace. The night my father died.
Can I help you, dear? Yes, I'm Deputy Moretti with the sheriff's office. Did you find my social security check? My granddaughter called you last week to inquire about it. No, ma'am, I'm sorry, but we haven't found it yet.
What does it say? Don't worry about it. What did you write? I'm sorry. It's a secret between me and everyone who sees it.
If only I were free to move. If only... It is never pleasant to see this kind of activity, Lisa, especially on a cell phone that is much nicer than the one I have. All the fights seem to be caused by the seats on the bus. Lisa, you seem to be clear on this problem, why don't you solve it?
His numbers are better than you think, and he and Jones came together from Deutsche, so... "Continuity of client relationship." - The thing is tragic. - Did you call Campbell? They will take the body as soon as the coroner releases it.
- A girl will never be able to throw hard enough to compete with boys, not when they grow up. It's natural and we can't change it. That's why we need a secret weapon. At the end of my career, a Latino guy showed me a pitch. It was too late for me, but you will learn it now.
Can you identify yourself, sir? If you can step out of the car. Leave it on. If you can give me the phone, sir. You'll get it back later, along with the car.
And now it's going to happen. You see, he's a changed man. Asha, Alcoholics Anonymous doesn't give you your first-year chip as soon as you show up. They give it to you if you stay sober for a whole year.
What, now in addition to being Hector you want to be a lawyer? I've done you many favors, Mathias. And now I'm asking you for one. What do you intend to do with it? I'm going to return it to its owner.
I have done you many favors, Mathias. And now I'm asking you for one. What do you intend to do with it? I'm returning it to its owner. You might want to keep it.
Start small, something simple. Are you going to eat those chips? Continue. They look delicious, don't they? I might... Taste the sandwich now, unless you eat it.
Lysergic acid. Has he ever tried it? He would remember. One of my father's biggest dealers. He only supplies it to the military. I have my connections.
Has he ever tried it? He would remember. One of my father's biggest dealers. He only supplies it to the military. I have my connections. Our parents' generation uses it for mind control....
One of my father's biggest dealers. He only supplies it to the military. I have my connections. Our parents' generation uses it for mind control.... To interrogate prisoners, for example. But we use it... To expand the mind, as you will see.
I'm not talking about those proceeds, I mean everything we have. - What? - Yeah, including the money she had earned before she got involved in that mess. - They can't do that. - Well, they are doing it.
- Excuse me? - Why hasn't it emerged yet? - There must be confusion among the papers. Bullshit. You're holding him because he's threatening to sue you.
I guess you don't understand. I'm not doing this just to stay alive. I'm doing this so that I can knock on my children's door someday and let them know that their father is an innocent man. If I accept this deal, I may never do it. If he doesn't accept it, he might not do it anyway.
I went to those meetings only because they forced me to go to those meetings. I understood. That asshole wants his job. He doesn't just want it. If I don't fire you he will get it.
Without help, you will not make it back up again. I'm extending a helping hand. I thank you for the offer -- more than you know, Robert. But it's been too long since I've had my last name written first, I can't go back and see it in the queue. Jessica, if you refuse, you won't see it anywhere.
Don't worry, Tina. You're with us now. And we'll never leave you, baby. But since you mentioned it, I actually have a program. And everybody's going to love it because it's a big improvement -- over my opponent's failed wall project.
I hope for your sake it is not a trap. What is this place? Welcome to underground Seattle. When they built the new Seattle over the old city, they left these catacombs down here. It was a real cesspool of humanity before the Red Hand cleaned it up.
I will tell him about it during our weekly brunch. - What would you like me to tell him? - I'm serious. I don't care. If you want to get a message to the director follow the proper procedure and do it on your own.
- I'll make it your problem. Either we represent your whole business, or we don't deal with anything. Bullshit. If you quit, you won't have the income, and you can't afford it. It will look like we realized the case was lost at the start, and we wanted to distance ourselves, and you can't afford it.
- Let him convince her that this is it. This is your chance to get immunity if you turn in your father. How the hell do you know he would do that? I know when Cahill wants Sutter. And the solution is to offer Jill a deal. Or he promises her a deal and takes it back.
Hi! Thanks for coming! Boy, two customers! The car wash hasn't been this busy since that mud tornado 15 years ago. They nicknamed it "The mud-nado."
But as soon as you find the monster, contact me immediately. I don't want you to fight this alone. One more time, what are you looking for? A monster. What will you do when you find it?
He seemed to be stalking her. We found some things on her roof.... Women's jewelry, underwear, etc. So it would help if you could identify anything that... that might have belonged to Ashley. Have you found the engagement ring? No, but we're looking for it.
Tyler wanted a higher percentage, right? So you took a baseball bat and smashed it over his head. Geez. Officers, do you mind if I, uh, take the wallet? I wouldn't want you to, you know, shoot me while I'm taking it.
Was he an AllStar third baseman? No, man. Look, McCoy gave it to Maya and Maya gave it to me. People give me a lot of stuff all the time. I didn't want it, but I didn't want to hurt her so. - It's yours if you want it.
It could be in there. Get the van started. Audrey and I are going to look for Monet. Okay. Make it quick. But when you hear the van start they will hear it too, so you will have about three minutes.
I want to go home. I'm so sorry. You guys are fucking crazy! She is the queen of every hive. She is both the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
Our victim/suspect... The principal is a question mark. Who is the phantom? He is the invisible man pulling the strings. If you would tell me his name, I would write it down, but since you won't tell me, I will call him "the Phantom."
- Go for the hard stuff. - Fuck you. I'll show you my dick! Hey, leave him alone! - I want them to see it!
And I felt a connection with her from the first moment I auditioned. I am the queen of all hives. I am the shield above every head. I am the spear of battle! Who but I am both the tree and the lightning that strikes it?
Sidney? Sidney, are you okay? Holy fucking shit. Oh, shit... Oh, shit... Oh, shit. I am both the tree and the lightning that thunders it.
Those savages are still out there. Audrey, we killed people last night. Both of them. There's a tape of what happened, on that farm. I want that tape before someone else finds it.
- Okay. What's going on? Come with me. It's okay. I can't insert the tube. It's like something is blocking it.
I was proud of you, but now you're being a jerk. Bye-bye! Nothing, Mom, I just -- just wanted to thank you for the check. No, I -- I appreciate it, Mom, I appreciate everything.
No big deal. Basic science. But it could fix it. Imagine your brain as a computer that has been ruined by errors and viruses. If we shut it down and restart it, then the parts of the brain that have been overactivated should reset to their default state.
I don't want to be kept in the dark. I demand to see the book. I don't have it, Joseph has it. And now it's not here. And anyway, you'll never get it.
No, no, no. Eli, no, please, it's not ready yet. Don't kill me. You weren't afraid of Joseph getting power. You actually just wanted it for yourself.
We hear that your colleague, Mr. Holmes, is looking for a certain ... object. An object that may be at the center of some obscene murders of criminals. Was this object by any chance in a metal box? If you could arrange for it to end up in our hands we would gladly give you a reward. Fine. But perhaps first you should tell me what this object is and why you want it.
They were going to put him in a diplomatic pouch, send him home. So somebody else wanted the Chinese to get him, but in a way that couldn't be traced. Why? There is a saying in Chinese, "Wanbi guizhao." Return the seal intact to Zhao. It means to return something to the owner. It is based on a story in which the Seal was stolen, and a hero brings it back home without any damage.
If you insist. Do you like it? - It's a moon... - Our song. Yeah. I'll never take it off.
That's where you were. It looks like you got what you wanted. Now we know the serum works. It wasn't the serum. Hyde destroyed it.
- You and Becca are bad people. - Are we bad people? Your wife stabbed you. I stepped back on the knife. Then why was she pointing it at you, huh?
- Make sure it is... - Soft--in the middle. So your phone is not broken? You know what? Screw Kent. You deserve the chocolate brownie. Tell the kitchen we'll eat it here!
For the illusion of prosperity? It makes me cry. I'll draw you a bath. Opium is the only thing people talk about in the market. The merchants are worried that you will seize it all.
I can't do that, Meredith. A schoolmate of mine... she died. They made him look like a smurf; that's sick. It's in your best interest to make sure I don't get arrested. But if I get caught. You're going with me to jail. We found him, Rob.
His voicemail is, "You've reached Nosferatu..." Tonight's guest is Tomasz Beksinski! I am used to a certain order. Every day has its own agenda. If someone interrupts it, I get very angry and deconcentrate immediately.
A little bit of fun. - Do you see it? - What should I see? The one with round eyes, a mustache and a long tail. The mouse? I want you to catch it.
- How many crises have you already had? - You can't understand. If things are bad and there's no money ... I eat first. Then Theo, and then my father. And I can have the best bed, even if I don't enjoy it fully.
Do you think the Malaysia flight simply disappeared? Statistically? The plane is the safest way to travel. It's a business, right? - Everyone has to be responsible. - You have to trust the pilot. But it's like a leap of faith. You get on the plane without thinking about it, but you have no idea who is flying it.
A fifth bullet has been found. Fifty percent of the DNA is shared with Le Saux, our missing witness is his daughter. Was Frank my father? I would have liked to know. There was an agreement, Frank called it his gold mine.
So, from now on -- you and I, we'll have each other's backs. Understand? Yes, that's me. It was a big load. You didn't find it, did you?
It had a strong impact on you. It beat you to a pulp. Enough. You've been busy, Tomas. The problem manifested itself, I didn't seek it out.
Let's start. Remember that it is cricket. The arm has to stay straight. In a moment, I'm still trying to imagine you speaking in favor of marriage. Yes, I know, I've always been against it. Only if we consider that you have called it a diabolical plan to subvert biology, independence and human happiness.
I don't believe that. Unfortunately, Bendu, there is no time for chit-chat. We are here for the holocron. Ah, yes, the keeper of dark knowledge. What do you want it for?
- That's what he's saying, Ezra. But still we need it to save our friends, Kanan. So are you going to give it back to us or not? The artifact you seek is a source of imbalance between you and your master. If you want it, you must seek it together with him.
This may be the coolest operation you'll ever have here. And here I am worrying about Barry. The patient. So you're going to take all the blood from my body - and put it in the machine?
And in no uncertain terms. - Then he put my phone down. - He can't do that. - He has a constitutional obligation.... - Don't you understand that, Alex?
- Dr. Hamza? - Go. We have a problem with the bone bank. Apparently, we are still waiting for it to be up and running. The skull bone may be unusable if we don't freeze it.
But as long as I'm there and one of our people is missing, we're not going to do anything.... That would put his safety even more at risk. I agreed to 12 hours. These terrorists came to our house. They killed our people. All the sacrifices we make to make them disappear from the face of the earth are sacrifices worth making. When there's a snake in the kitchen, you don't invite it to dinner, you cut off its head.
- This time will be different. - Okay. Does Rosie know about this favor? No, she doesn't. And I wish she didn't know.
Are you sure? I have been ready to do this since I have known the truth about Clark Kent. This is who I am. I can't hide behind a camera anymore. If there is a price, I will pay it.
It's all right. To what do I owe this unexpected visit? I just wanted to see how you were doing. Thanks to you and your Martian blood, I have recovered almost completely. I hope you don't want it back.
Apartment B. Sounds familiar... I figured as much. I know who has the maintenance contract. I'll pay you double if you bring it to me as soon as possible.
Unconditional love. It's right there on the other side of the door. But you keep looking at people like you don't deserve it. I have a hammer in my pocket. I'm going to lift it up... And I'm going to lower it.
- Mother, you should use the wooden man. It took me four hours, but I unloaded all the anger. - Look, you are just like me. - Me, stubborn? When Adam gets a bad grade, who rushes to school and threatens not to leave until they change it?
Couldn't give up your ego for a game? - For the all-star game! - There will always be another game, and then another, and another, since you were 12 years old. When have you ever thought of me? You never liked baseball. You always connected it with Dad's death.
- Marcus, check it out! - See if your thumb is on your hand. I need this thumb, for working and driving. And for knobs! We just have to put it in a cold sealed container, we'll take it to the hospital and they'll reattach it.
Promise? Here. This will do. No, come on, not the guacamole. It's slimy. You won't feel it.
Rufus, it's your turn. My knife is in my pocket, you'll have to sterilize it on the lamp. What? The bullet didn't come out. It's under the skin so you have to take it out.
It's ugly. It shoots 17 bullets, you won't need the knife. I like the knife. Take it. The Derringer is more theatrical. Now, I appreciate the armaments you've provided us with, sir, but I've staked my fortune and my fame on this show--and I'm going to see it exactly as I imagined it.
In our hearts? In the objects dear to us. The pendant you gave her that she wears around her neck. That's right. She said she never takes it off.
Oh, thank you, and sorry I lied. Anyway, apart from anything else, you're a very good liar. Oh, Amy said the same thing. How are you doing with the research project? Are they going to let you lead it?
You would never say it. That's the point. These spies come from an invented country. It's totalitarian, and murderous.... But we won't call it Germany.
Damn double foods. But we have a lot of fun! Think I haven't told you about the holidays yet. We make a great turkey for Thanksgiving dinner. We serve it in the gym.
No, a mallard! Where did you get that cocoa from? Clint gave me a few ounces before he left last night. I've been dosing it carefully all day. Why are you rubbing it on your gums?
Clint gave me a few ounces before he left last night. I carefully dosed myself with it all day. Why are you rubbing it on your gums? Are you teething? Clint says the effect is stronger if I take it directly.
We did great last night, huh? Me more than you did. Do you want the stuff or not? I have to go do my podcast. I'm interviewing myself. I know a drug dealer when I see one.
Back and biceps, right? Well, you should know, you set my iCal. Hey, Max, did you see the message for tonight? No, it didn't get there, am I wrong? I think he only sent it to me, since he's my boyfriend.
He's joking. Nothing has changed, has it? I think there's more choking, but it's not for me. So my phone is at 23 percent. I go steal a car and put it back on charge.
- Why waste so many resources? - Because I owe it to him, Helen. I see what the real reason is. You feel guilty. It's because of the deal with Trouvier... you almost feel like you don't deserve it.
During his stay... Did you discover anything to suggest that a stranger had entered the house? We had to climb over a rotting carcass to get in. It wasn't an Easter bunny, inspector. That animal was savagely killed and left there as a warning. - Who do you think left it there?
It's just like parsley, you know? - Who do you work for now? Yeah, I know which one. - I'm writing a piece. - Who wants it that bad?
Here. Sit down. - I don't want to sit down. - Okay, you stay standing. Use my bed if you want. I haven't seen it since Monday.
- I mean, your work is important. - But it's not! Man, it's just-it's just what I do literally all the time. - I don't look good at it, do I? - Only if you don't admit it.
- Did you call him a stamper? - It was a nickname we gave him, considering that he was always talking about his work. Wait a minute, does he work? I don't know where he was going, but ... it wasn't a real job. He did it every day, though.
And then someone found him. It was someone Dave knew. But Dave soon realized that this was not a social visit. The man was there to get the treasure. So Dave hid it in the one place where no one would find it.
The sun can be bitchy. As much as you are. You want to put some damn clothes on? I am dressed. Get your little ass upstairs and put on something to cover it, we have guests tonight.
- I'm surprised you know what day it is, since you're not wearing a watch. - I must have dropped it. You know, they're weak... - Roger. Okay, I took it off.
You seem like a good man. You really do. I want to think it happened like you said two little girls just talking. So... you found the building? That's right. And now they're searching it for evidence.
You had the burning bush, it was a sign. Sex is all about intimacy between two married people, and that's why I exposed your grandmother. Don't lose your way now. Sexual pleasure is not the most important thing. That's why they call it la petit mort, the little death.
Keep it up and I'll have you eating a pack of Oreos for breakfast. It's legal! I checked. Today is my art show! Honey, I'm so excited for you, but Dad is working and Dad has this ritual and when someone interrupts it, well, he has to start all over again.
Stop dressing like that. - Otherwise... - Or else what? Otherwise I'll put you at the top of my naughty list. You know what? I'm not a kid anymore, so get lost, Santa Claus. I like the costume and I'm keeping it.
- No, but we have to be ready. The burly man, the man in the gray hat, and the sailor. Any one of them could be the recipient of the diamond. We have to be ready to follow them. Whoever receives the jewel from Mr. Luker is, most likely, a middleman and will pass it on to our thief.
My estimate, leaving out the flaw in the stone, was 20,000 pounds. How did you come into possession of it? It's a family possession. Come on, Mr. Ablewhite, I don't believe that. My cousin inherited it.
But what...? The -- my head is heavy and I can't feel my feet. The next morning, from the way you were talking and your behavior, I could tell that you completely ignored what you had said and done, during the night. And you-you were absolutely determined not to utter a word. The Moonstone belonged to Godfrey Ablewhite, and he could do what he wanted with it. So, I managed to persuade him to pawn the diamond for a sum far below its value, threatening to tell the truth if he took it somewhere else.
Would you like to talk to me? Yes... if I dare. It's a strange business, that diamond business, sir. Of course it is. They'll never find it, sir, will they?
And faster. My father died much slower. And after a lot of years of pain. When my brother was 25, they removed a baseball-sized tumor from his lung. We thought he had beaten it.
I ran out of it. But maybe you have some in your pantry. Yes, I do. In fact, I was thinking of making a shepherd's pie tonight. If you want you can stop by my place, we'll make it together.
The fastest way... To get Gregorio back... And the FBI... Is by uprooting the cartel. And to do that quickly... We have to work together. Sorry, I have to get used to it. When you close a case, does anyone review it? Pride does.
Capturen a Martinez... lo quiero vivo. Comprende? I don't comprendo. - No? - Well, Spanish is good, but you'll have to hablar ingles for the piano if you want me to understand it.
We thought it was still there after the curse, but maybe it is here somewhere. We can find it with magic, right? There is...a spell that can show us the way with some kind of light signal. However...it would not be visible only to us. If Gold, the Queen or Zelena saw it, they would instantly know what it is.
We will call you when we need you. Raise your arm. Here we go. Good. Now, don't let me lower it.
No, I hate riddles. It pushes you to ask yourself -- whether the burden you're carrying is really indispensable. Or-if it can be set aside, with a little willpower. That girl you molested. Was she a patient of yours? Raymond showed me the file on her. He wanted me to see it.
I have to talk to Elvis. He is the only one who can understand this violation. Patton, please tell me you've tracked down Elvis. Oh--your friend Elvis is frighteningly good. He turns his phone on to make short calls and then turns it off.
- We cannot give you the police escort. - I wasn't asking for that. - You were. - Yes, you were. - But keep... My lunch. It's not Da Schmaegalman's, but take it.
Wait! Wait! Hey, McGee. Look who I found in the elevator. Well, I get him every morning.
And they dragged me here to find out what I knew. Where did you find the disposable phone? One of them threw it away. It took me forever to grab it, and send the message. Praying that I would get it.
Maybe. On my mother? Definitely. I got your message. Did you solve it? We have solved it.
You see, you are a technician. An agent. The tool -- of a bigger project. I, on the other hand, am a strategist. You throw that can at me and I'll catch it, but only because I first calculated the possibility that someone might throw it.
Give the order Harold, or the countdown will mark what's left of your career. - I will not put my men in harm's way. - Sir, I have an alternative! Fire alarm? Yes, if you turn it off manually, the security lock should automatically open the doors.
Sabine came to take us away. We owe it to her. We have to try. So what is your plan? I'll tell you as soon as I know.
Are you comfortable? These are not comfortable. Let's take them off. All right. I'm going to get a nurse for that cut. And we'll disinfect it.
Couldn't you do it at school? No. I wrote code that doesn't run on their computers. Solar-powered aircraft, for the military? It's a civilian project. All right, so why is Chapman keeping it in a secure lab?
That's cool. I control a machine with my mind. Can we go one step further and control a human being? My brain sends an order to my arm. We take that signal and send it to your arm.
Aron often plays with lightning for work with the "Tesla coil." What is a Tesla coil? It is a high-frequency resonant transformer with an air core. Now in simple terms. It is a system that takes a low voltage and turns it into a very high voltage.
If I put my hand in the right position, it becomes invisible. Let's try it. My fingers disappeared at the sides. Because there is a cylindrical area where the light is bent around my fingers, creating invisibility. But if an object goes through the center, the light shines through and makes it visible.
So our hands are tied. Someday ... Bunker Hill will be so established that the Ministry will trust us on the fly. But, in the meantime... James, what are you doing? Scott, I want you to know that hacking is illegal, totally unethical, and Bunker Hill does not approve of it, under any circumstances.
I'm just writing, bringing the story to life. I know you went outside, mister. No, I've been here the whole time. Love, the cube with the pictures has been moved. I proudly arrange it so that your face can be seen.
I... This is heavy. It was Halloween night and I had finished rewriting my story. How is Adam's masterpiece? Oh my God, you are sighing deeply because you love it!
What do you mean? The sale of the transportation depot, service contracts... The depot is for sale? Well, yes, what is Frank's wife supposed to do with it? What does she do with it, turn it into a dance school?
Don't be so impatient. How close did Bruno have to be to trigger the explosive? Well, it's a long-range transmitter, so he wasn't trying to commit suicide, if that's what you're thinking. Actually, he was trying to quit smoking, and that's what actually killed him. The killer laced his nicotine patch with something like cyanide about 20 minutes before he put it on, based on the oxidation of the adhesive.
Yes, but afterwards, - because Gibbs wants me to ... - He wants to find out where the earring came from. Of course he does. For now all I can tell you is that - the previous owner was a woman. - All right, so do you know how long Bruno had it in his ear?
Listen. I've already listened, now I'm talking. I've had my own heart problems, too. I don't have kids, but I'm good with kids. And -- my job gets me down regularly, but, like you, I love it.
Thanks for coming, guys. I look forward to catching up with you when it's all over. - My father is dead and ... - I repeat, when it's all over Hitchcock. Gina, you sound like a warlock and I love it.
Broccoli, what have you seen? It's busy. How many was the Vito la Bella? All matro the lover? - At least bring him back when he's done.
Just because of the tracker? - Well, yes, because... - What is it made of? - Leather, I guess. - A little leather pouch. Did you make that yourself?
Yes, for the most part they are still made of sheet metal and plastic, and that consumes a lot of energy. We had an idea. Are there more eco-friendly materials to use? Well, to find out, we each bought a Land Rover Discovery. We removed the metal frame ... and replaced it with what we felt ... was the best solution for the future of the planet.
Earlier I was in the right-hand drive Ford Mustang showing her the beauty of our country. Unfortunately, he appeared and tried to argue that the Ford Focus, for a similar price, was a better investment. - Yes, it was. - And I responded by walking away and refusing to talk to you. And I thought that was a little rude. I'm sorry, it's my film. My tour of England and I didn't want him to ruin it for me.
- Look, I have the reeds in the back. - It's stationary. - What is that? - The grill. So, we hold it with the pliers on my multi-purpose, cut the fish, fillet it....
Oh! How much I don't like this feeling. Ladies and gentlemen, here comes Richard Hammond. No! I find comfort in the fact that this system has already worked twice, with their cars, and it has not failed. It has been tested. Or I can be more realistic, and think that those two outsized butts have weakened it.
I have an idea for another Thanksgiving tradition before bedtime. - Come here. - What is it? So we'll take turns saying what we're thankful for. And then the person whose turn it is will pull the string -- and then toss it to the next person.
That's what happened. Why are you trying to run away from this? You cannot stifle your feelings as if they were creatures you are afraid of. The pain is part of you. I can see it now.
Otherwise you will regret it. I assure you. Kate, will you cooperate, please? No, I hate this dress! I know, but I don't care if you hate it.
- Where did he get the footage? - I have no idea. We're going to air it, aren't we? Get a forensic expert to verify that it is not a fake, and consult a neurologist to confirm that the woman is indeed unconscious. If we verify both of these things-we will air it tonight.
- I can still do it! I played along in front of the recruits, but are you really going to reveal your pseudonym? I'm depriving them of something-even if they don't realize it. If I don't give them something concrete in return, they will never trust me or the CIA. Besides, it's not like I'm going to use it again.
What, he never told you about it? - What are you saying? - I didn't write it down. Well, it's complicated. You see, he will write it in a few years.
- It's complicated. - No. The truth is not complicated. - I don't know what the truth is anymore. - Okay. The truth is that he didn't believe in Rittenhouse until President Nixon confirmed it. But for now, if Rittenhouse wants this document so badly, whatever it is, I want it first.
He's on his way. And he looks angry. I thought you said Levi didn't kill Sarah. She did. So, I interview her after the suicide, she doesn't tell me about the video, but then she airs it live.
And be sure to try one of my famous "Dora's Apple Cookies." No thanks, I never liked them. Excuse me? The boiling water turned his sock into a blast furnace. When she took it off, the skin came off, too.
So I get a sample labeled "synovial fluid, left hip." I look at it and it's not that thick. I think maybe it's gout, but under the microscope there are no crystals, just cells, so I call the intern who took it, and he tells me he's trying to rule out cirrhosis,
- No problem. - I want to get out of here. - When did the pain start? About half an hour ago? I would have ignored it, but my neighbor, he's a nurse, and he said I should check it out.
Mi. Chicken salad, chicken wings, chicken nuggets. Do you have anything without chicken? Man, can you read the sign? We only make chicken, and we make it "clucking" well.
I just found this phone on the street. - What? - I'm the delivery man, I just found this phone. It's my friend's phone! I'll take it for him.
- What is this smell, dad? This smell? Just trouble. Okay? Whenever you smell this smell, you go to the opposite side. - But I always smell it in the hallway.
Explain the indications for emergency traumatic liver transplants. Ins... Acute liver sufficiency, portal vein thrombosis, uncontrollable hemorrhage. - That's right. - And I don't recall many - cases where the surgery went well. - Reason why we won't do it.
- Nothing. Stop it. - I'm not doing anything. - You look at me like that and I don't like it. Mother does it too.
- Not really. - I did the best for the patient. - No, he lost his mind. This tissue is falling apart in my hands. I will clamp it and then stop it with a ligature.
Okay. Negative pressure therapy. He still gave music lessons every day, yelled at us to do our homework, made us dinner. We grew up listening to that damn cello all day, every day. He would play it for hours.
You use a scuba tank. It's not for me. It's not for me either, since I won't be there. I can think of a thousand other things to do on Sunday than go spearfishing. You get to eat the fish, though, if I catch them.
And it's on a pedestal. So, as a precaution, we should not drive over 40 kilometers per hour with the reactor in the van. Palos Verdes is only 18 kilometers away, so we'll get there well before the van's battery is no longer able to keep the cooling system operational. I have a question. This thing weighs several hundred pounds. How are we going to get it out of here and load it onto the van without banging it around too much so we don't all end up roasted?
Won't it end up causing an environmental disaster in the ocean? No, not at all. Every seven centimeters that the reactor sinks, the radioactivity of the waste is halved. You could swim ten feet in it without any repercussions. It will be safe until the Department of Energy picks it up in the next twenty-four hours.
Every seven centimeters that the reactor sinks, the radioactivity of the waste is halved. You could swim ten feet in it without any repercussions. It will be safe until the Department of Energy picks it up in the next twenty-four hours. Can you give me your phone? Okay. I'll put it in so they can track our exact location.
McGee's ring causes him nightmares and is turning me into a... nerd. Well, you're not going to like my plan for the ring. Oh, no, Bishop. You can't keep that ring here. - I'm going to keep it here.
Should I talk about Charlie Rose? No. Why should you? Well, I like his interview style. How he takes a topic and goes into it.
Your mother is so ugly that when she goes to the zoo she has to buy two tickets: one to enter and one to leave. I didn't understand her. Well, she says she's so ugly that they mistake her for an animal. So she needs a ticket to get out of the zoo. Are you saying that if an animal had a ticket, they would let it out?
Anyway, because of the triple A, I know I have to stay here in the monitor zone, where I can keep busy with work until they separate. Now, this map identifies 36 critical zones. You know, some world-renowned behaviorists, like myself, might say this is going to drive you crazy, if you're not already. You're doing all the talking. You're avoiding the problem with Happy. Just because I stopped nagging her doesn't mean I'm avoiding it.
After you generously granted your rocket research, my team adapted some of your brilliant ideas to our project. - Walt's accelerator is revolutionary. - I thought so too, but it doesn't work. I assure you we have empirical evidence that it works. I know your private launch on the beach at Christmas was successful. But when we adapted it to a much larger rocket, we ran into some instability problems.
Let's do a chest X-ray. Let's see the lungs. - Right away. - And do ten milligrams of lidocaine. Keigan. I'm going to anesthetize your wrist so we can get it fixed, okay baby?
Are you sure about that? Do you remember things in the afterlife? I know grief... Better than anyone else. And I assure you of one thing. You can't go around it. Sooner or later, you have to face it.
Do we remember things in the afterlife? I know grief... Better than anyone else. And I assure you of one thing. You can't go around it. Sooner or later, you have to face it. But you get over it.
I know grief... Better than anyone else. And I assure you of one thing. There is no getting around it. Sooner or later, you have to face it. But you get through it. Somehow... You always get over it.
I mean, I agreed to go out with you because you were going to lose weight ... - for me. - I did. I lost some weight. And if I were to gain it back, I will lose it again.
Step back... - All right. - We're good. Hey, wait. Let him take a look at it. Oh, yeah? Come on, I know you want it. Otherwise you'd slurp up a dessert at home and then hide it from me.
In faith. "Dear Nick, Thank you for the tattoo. Sincerely, S. and Cece." Don't you like my gift? We like it, I see it every time I close my eyes.
- You ruined your leg. It's as if you stole our souls. You represented my wife as a street prostitute. Well, don't you want it? You can't have it.
He needs you. You're playing dirty, Clarke. I always have. You may not be a match, but, if you are, donating spinal cord hurts like hell. You'll feel it for months.
If not, we will take our chances with Reynolds. I will give my support to Reynolds, and I will fight the old system of Evans and Dalton until we get the government we deserve! Yes! Well, at least he finally thinks government should exist. He took it out, but not before he got thousands of clicks.
- No. No. No. No. Rufus, quick! The patch is not so strong, if they hit him....
And, by the way, if you hear God's voice, it's just Mom. And if you see a blinding white light. It's your father. Evan, bring the casserole! Maybe the homeless will eat it!
It is that. Base jumping parachutes do not have an opening handle. Instead, they have a pilot parachute. You hold it around your wrist. You deploy it, the wind fills it, makes it inflate, and that's how the main parachute comes out.
He apologized in person, promised to pay for Arturo's children's college. And did Trenchman tell you about Arturo's memoirs? We know his brother was writing a book. What did Bennett Nealy have to do with it? Arturo sold it to a big publishing house.
They used to be plastic, not metal. - You had a hood like this, right? - Sure. As per the regulations in 2001 and as it still is today. If the fire started from the fryer such a hood would have slowed it down if not stopped it altogether.
Vince lit the fire and Leo took the blame? - The compensation had many zeros. - I discovered something strange. Vince did not take the insurance check. He gave it to Powell Associates.
Why? Why? We have a code red. Prophecy. Actually, I'm surprised the kids didn't figure it out sooner.
I say let's clean everything up so Don and I can have our own place and.... I don't know, maybe rebuild an old motorcycle. Are you kidding me? You want me to throw all my stuff away so you and your brother can have -- a motorcycle fort? Well, we won't call it that.
Stimulus. Andi, I'm asking you to do this for me. All right. Let's get this place cleaned up, so--. You can have your idiot fort. Great, but we're not even going to call it that anyway.
Very, very bad. That dress is not here. Then it will be at the store. Of course! Let's go there before someone buys it.
- We're separated, Frank. - It's been what, two weeks? We both know it was long before that. You asked me if I believe in fate. Yes, fate, destiny, call it what you will.
Apparently, there was a youth group associated with the camp. They took in juvenile delinquents from bad neighborhoods every summer for two weeks. St. Abigail's Angels. Promising, right? Well, the guy who ran it works in town, and I asked him to come right away.
Denise, I do not doubt your judgment. On the contrary, I am worried about you. I'm fine. Officer Denise, sadly, suicide is not unusual among candidates. They commit it without shame.
Time is up. Who will confess? Why do you want to pass? I have much to offer the Offshore. If I have enough merit, you will see it in me.
Trust you? How, Ezequiel? If you abandon the Process and get caught with an Inland child? - Then you know. - Of course I do. You ask me to change Aline's report and you don't think you look at it first?
Is there any problem with that? Technically, he is the boss of the captain's boss, which means he is the boss of my boss's boss. Which means I have to mind my own business. But thanks, now that I know there's some problem I'll worry too. I'm going to throw this out. You should unplug your "ice cream" before Prosky sees it.
When you called you were talking about strange behavior. Can you explain what you meant? It could be nothing, but I saw that he was killed. And you know what they always say on television, "if you see something, say it." He always had a laptop, but he never used it in here.
Can you explain what you meant? It may be nothing, but I saw that he was killed. And you know what they always say on television, "if you see something, say it." He always had a laptop, but he never used it in here. After eating, he would take it out to the parking lot.
- Yes. - She has been here. - Yes. Is that all you found on the flash drive? These messages and various drafts of Russell Cole's article. He didn't write it himself; he had a partner who helped him.
Does this partner have a name? They weren't using names in communications, and it makes sense, they were using an exchange point to keep their partnership secret. I don't understand one thing. You talked to a person who says the article is full of jibes. Now we find out that two people had examined it very carefully.
No, I can't do it. I can't walk anymore. I have to stop, let's light a fire. No, no. We can't, they would see it.
I don't think they can continue. It wouldn't make a difference anyway. Okay, if you can't get away from the cloud then you have to neutralize it. If we had magnesium. It would react with the carbon dioxide and turn it into oxygen.
- Tim is here. I'm going to bring him up to speed. - I'm going to go talk to Toby. We have to pull the car out gently. We send the cable down, wrap it around the frame and move it slowly.
We had an agreement! You promised to help me with the campaign. - No! - I did my part. Toby's gift is ready, but if you want it, you have to keep your promise!
You can't give him a knife, he's 12 years old. I've had that knife since I was younger than Ralph. And he uses it much better than I did. You saw how he used it today. My grandfather gave it to me.
Heck, yes. You're waiting for me to say you did good, aren't you? Well, I'd be lying to you if I said no. Do you have any idea how hard it was to track down all those pieces? Look, I know you're the kind of guy who needs encouragement, but I'm not the kind of girl who can give it to you.
- At least tell me why you do it. - Why do I do what, Tandy? Why do you want to ruin this place, Lewis. Why in the world would I do that? You can't stand the idea that we've moved into the directional building, so you want us all to hate it so we can move anywhere you want.
Will I be all right? It would seem so. How much did he eat? Just one bite. Chef Joe didn't usually share it with us.
I found this in Harry's wallet. We should check it out. You and Tyler, huh? These lies will spread through your relationship like a disease -- until there is nothing left but an empty, deformed shell. I will take that deformed shell -- and turn it into a beautiful butterfly.
Well, then. Opening arguments. Patent infringement. Now--this sounds complicated. It's a very simple case. If you leave the van in your backyard and someone takes it away.... Well--whose van is it now? It still remains yours.
Initial Arraignments. Patent infringement. Now--this sounds complicated. It's a very simple case. If you leave the van in your backyard and someone takes it away.... Well--whose van is it now? It still remains yours. Even if you are not driving it....
I don't want a weapon and I won't take it. I will not take it. You don't believe in abortion. Okay, sir? Don't perform an abortion. No, if you're against it, don't do it.
Okay, we need to remove the kidney before it bleeds out. Wait. What if we do an autotransplant? We look for another usable artery, save the kidney. - Where would you put it?
Or perhaps, the best? The bad people have all the help they need, but the normal people who need it? They have to make do with who they can find, and usually there's no one and... Okay. I'm going to give you some advice... And I want you to listen carefully... Because your people won't tell you,
Be cunning, vigilant and mean, so when the bad guys come, you know exactly where to strike. Because it's a fight to the death. And that's the only language they understand. I don't believe that. You're going to get there. Well... Thank you for your time, I... I appreciate it very much.
- Right. Why do analysis when you can guess? I've seen something like this before. It's a message. You don't leave a body like that unless you want someone to see it, right?
Happy? I'm not doing this to upset you. Okay, I just wish you to be well. I don't wish to be well. Where did you put it?
I don't want to be well. Where did you put it? What? Don't make fun of me, where is it? Sarah, I don't know what you're talking about. The truck, Brodie, where is it? I don't know where you put it.
I remember seeing it until I was 15 years old. My mother tried to get rid of it a bunch of times, but it always came back to us. And do you find it strange what happened? Well, I think it's pretty strange. You know, I bet if I looked hard enough, I would find it again.
Well, I think it's quite strange. You know, I bet if I looked hard enough, I'd still find it. Okay, that's really creepy. It's been something like...seven years? Well, maybe it can be found for the next podcast.
What is this all about? Do you own a dark blue van with a white roof? - Yes. - Where is... where is the van now? I keep it in my summer cottage in the Catskills. I haven't been there for more than two years.
They are monsters. That's why the three of us have formed ... a secret alliance to help each other fix - our little mistakes. - Like in December, when I hastily bought an expensive accessory to show a house. Thank you so much for hiding it, Claire would kill me. It's only until Monday, then I'll return it.
- Nobody calls it that! The song is bad and I'm tired of singing it every year. Well, go ahead and tell your grandfather and break his heart. He lives for the Hanukkah solo. If you don't sing it you will literally end up killing him.
And then he built a desert for him, and filled it with material pleasures and... Sensual. Pleasures that we would never experience.... Or savored, or experienced. He created paradise and delivered it to... A pack of primates in heat in the dirt. This world was created for us. And we will take it back.
When he comes here, tell me if I am wrong. I can tell you even now: you are wrong. - I hope it serves the purpose. - My father loves guacamole. - He eats it like pudding.
The universe is sending me a sign, and, when the universe speaks, I listen. Well, personally, I don't even believe in signs, so.... What? Then you deserve to die! The sign was true, if I ignored it and married Rosa anyway, it would be like asking the universe to hop on my balls.
Time is up, Dr. Bull, where is Mr. Colon? Your Honor -- I was wondering if we could.... - Ask for another extension? - That's not possible, that's not how we work here. We set a time and we stick to it.
- Thank you, Mr. Pidgen. Dr. Bull, it's your turn. Interesting... So isn't it true that... The restaurant had an incinerator, in the back, used to burn waste, and that flammable liquid was often used to ignite the fire? The flaming liquid was on hand, so it's easy to see why Mr. Walsh used it to start the fire.
It's huge! It is almost like a human footprint. You can make out the back and front legs. We've been here two weeks now, and it's really frustrating. I've never been in a place where animals look for your equipment and destroy it, more than here.
Tell me everything. - Malik kissed me. - No. - I was tired, I wasn't paying attention.... - Okay, you don't have to-. I don't date colleagues, so you have to find that footage and you have to delete it.
All my life I always thought my weight was my fault. And now, after all this time, you tell me that? that it's not my fault at all, but a stupid tumor that makes me hungry, even when I don't have any? It's simple. I want you to take it away from me. And if you can't, I'll find another hospital that will.
These prions join together in oligomeric aggregates that are toxic to brain cells. We are working on a new drug, called PAI 120B. PAI-120B AN INNOVATIVE AND PROMISING MOLECLE It is an inhibitor for prion aggregates. This drug attacks abnormal prions so that they cannot form these toxic aggregates. We are producing it right here in our drug laboratory.
He's playing tough, but I know he's trying to hide the pain, both dental and mental. To me he seems to be doing well. He took it better than I would have. I cry when my cell phone goes dead. You don't sense it but, as his best friend, I tell you he is begging for help.
Then, finally, she ... knelt down by my side. She placed her hand on my cheek ... and simply said. "Yes." And she gave me a kiss I will never forget. And we went looking for the ring together until we found it.
And then he destroyed them after they turned their backs on him. We entered Mexican airspace. I thought you would want to know. Is it true they called him El Toro because he was crushed by a bull when he was eight years old? The next day he butchered him with a machete.
Like details, secrets are things we want to keep to ourselves. Shall we open the wine? Oh, we can't drink. But we have some delicious sparkling cider. Honey, have we refrigerated it? I was saving it for seconds, but.... What the hell! Gotta live dangerously, right?
Like every married couple in this world. Dr. Bull, you don't understand. - We yelled in a way that-. - This wasn't the first time you argued about whether or not to tell someone about Carter's problem, right? I know it's not easy, but neither is hiding it.
The prosecution argues it is not relevant that the cartel... The prosecution argues it is not relevant that the cartel was hacked. Because John didn't see it. Because John didn't see it. And, if he had seen it, well, of course, he would have remembered it.
And he thinks the cell phone might contain information to find Flaco. I think that now. It's a wonderful theory. But the backpack is not there -- so.... Hey, how bad would it be if ... - If I never found it again.
I just realized how important my duty as a police officer is to me, you know? The sacred oath I took. Your speech inspired me. It is one of the most successful ones. I felt really good while saying it.
- He asked me if I wanted to look gay. - Oh, that's remarkable. So...I guess high school hasn't changed that much, has it? Look, you need to put it back on -- and wear it proudly. It was already wet before you threw it in there, wasn't it?
- No, I mean literally. You... complete it. You are the back target of this joke. Give me that sweater. Marjorie is smart and organized. And if you ever need hand antibacterial or a band-aid she will always have it.
Those turned on the Colts logo. We can do that one. Well, that's nice-all in the car, together. How about a game? We'll call it "What's New in Your Life?"
But, oh, no. How is JJ going to move? Don't worry. We have started the paperwork. They will buy it back from us or the insurance company will.
- ...for a lesson on the four elements: basket, fan, casing, and first of all, burner. - It is a modern burner. - It is current technology. We extract the liquid fuel and vaporize it in the tubes before shooting it with a jet engine through the pilot flame.
- Go for the liquid burner. - Do we light both of them? But that's only half the story. When you inflate a hot air balloon, isn't it enough to shoot hot air into the envelope? First you fill it with cold air with this fan.
We already have officers ready for the plan. This is one of our men. Secret Agent Benson. He is to add doses of estrogen to Hitler's food. Will the tasters notice?
How did he do it? To help find out, animal psychologist Dr. Aaron Blaisdell. Was Skinner completely crazy or had he sensed something? A little of both. He was crazy in the sense that the idea was to put a pigeon in a rocket.... ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGIST ...so that he would guide it against a ship.
- Can I open it? - Please. Put the bottle - on the table and remove the cap. - Got it. So I won't spill it.
It covered postage. You would take it to the post office, exchange it for a stamp, and that's how others would send the letter back to the U.S. Charles realized that vouchers could not only be exchanged but also sold for money. He could buy a voucher in Italy, say for a dollar. He would send it to the U.S. and sell it for $6.
D.B. looks in the bag for the GPS sensor he knows he will find there. As I said, this man prepared. For an amateur, he had a well-thought-out plan. Yeah. You're telling me.
I don't know if he will catch the drone, but he will do some damage. Seeking safety in the corners of the city, he comes here at nightfall to rest. But a great predator lurks. Her mortal enemy. Armed with a sticky net, she makes him approach.
Okay, let's see how to classify them. One, how long have they been irritating us? The first traffic light was installed 150 years ago in London and was gas-powered. How long could it irritate if it was only one? A month later it exploded, injuring the policemen who ran it.
It's like a bicycle inner tube. But this one is filled with poop. First they insert a balloon and inflate it to give the colon a realistic shape. You don't see that every day. They patch the hole with stem cells, coat it with dye and bombard it with lasers.
Hashtag "selfie Saturday!" Brilliant. We were promised jetpacks. We were given selfie sticks. The million dollar question, what is the original selfie stick, who invented it and when?
And that patent is from 1985. That's 20 years earlier. It was the work of this man, Hiroshi Ueda. He was a photography enthusiast who was an engineer for Minolta. He invented it after he asked someone to take a picture of him at the Louvre.
As the fiber settles, Tim lectures me on what's under the hood. - I see a brushless motor. - That's right. Powering this motor with one volt, I would get 2400 rpm. We are going to power it at 33 volts.
- Okay. # ¬∂ Then you showed symptoms of brain damage ¬∂ I convinced myself that you hit your head ¬∂ Let my heart slip out of your hand ¬∂ Why do you always forget?
I don't have any. don't I? Who says I'm two short? Everyone says you are two short. - I will introduce it right away.
Me. What are you doing? - Hey, let me look at the bracelet. Just one time. - Are you doing it again?
However, if it is the same person it would be more than $6 million! Let's at least have him evaluated. Hyung, do you know why I keep keeping the bracelet? I will give it back to Cheong when she leaves. If I give it to her now, people like you won't leave her alone.
I can do it. It's my house. I'll have whoever I want to do it. Also, you will see a fan in the closet. It will be dusty. We wouldn't use it until next summer.
Hey! Hey, you fucking bastard! - I'll give it to you. - All right, all right. I'll give it to you.
Hey, you fucking bastard! - I'll give it to you. - All right, all right. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you.
Veronica was offered the lead part for her debut. The story was a parody of the Hollywood movie Wall Street. Do you want to work for me? The reason I was interested in this deal was knowing that it was absolutely new what they were doing. Even though it wasn't necessarily the best way to approach it at the time, the fact that they were doing it and that it was a well-known brand...
Why do you think Noel is so smart about this? Speaking as an entrepreneur myself, many entrepreneurs, when they have an idea, it's because they see a market demand for something. Most entrepreneurs don't say, "Oh, people want this, but I don't." Entrepreneurs, to begin with, want the product. That's why they create it.
What I find most unethical is the way they relate to reporters and journalists, misleading them into thinking that I company is something it is not. But it is also not illegal. They are a private company and they can say whatever they want about their business. Ashley Madison was brilliant at marketing. They seemed to know what the newspapers wanted. And they would take this little seed of truth, inflate it, and that's perhaps what made them successful in the media.
I meant in not playing the way the other guys play? The coach says I play in a primitive way. Yes, indeed it is primitive! And it has a long and rich history. Then why does he hate it?
Scary. Perfect. Rodents. I'll set a trap tomorrow. And after that you'll let him loose in the woods?
I don't know. Can you show me how this thing flies? All right. It's a little complicated. Do you want me to fly it?
It's from my new men's collection. - Oh! - Look at that! Fantastic! It's one-of-a-kind, so there won't be anyone else in that hat. Yeah, no, I guess, anybody would want it.
No, I deduced it from that nice hat you have on. Oh, no. This... No. This... Actually, it's a gift from my aunt. It's also a gift for me and for anyone who sees you wearing it.
Just watch and see. What do you think? It's not what I expected. What-what is this place? Well, they built it years ago, but then they ran out of money.
Yes, his mom worked in the library. Of course you remember her mom! Yes, she was nice. And she didn't even have a bra! Well, if she did, she never wore one.
On this holy day, may I call you my daughter? Have I seen you speak to her on my behalf? She needs to feel loved, convince her. They did not bring me the speech of royal proclamation. And they will not bring it.
And they won't carry it. Why? Because that's what I decided. Do you understand the importance of this speech? Yes!!! And I have been preparing it since childhood.
Did I send a dress? To Cristina? Several dresses. To Cristina? 18, to be honest. - Why is the countess wearing it?
Time travel gives me a migraine. Alternate timelines are simple. You just plot the possible futures, using an exponential growth and decay algorithm. Right. There must be a switch and I will find it.
To the left! To the left! And you will have all the foods you want, chicken, beef, fruits and vegetables.... And any kind of fish you want. The fisherman brings it to you from the sea.
Essex was not lost because of your mistake. I am just as guilty... You are not the captain! But you were born to do this job. I do it only by birth.
So it was decided. We prepared the body. We removed the organs, separated the arms and legs from the body, Done this, we closed the body, and sewed it up, as decently as possible, and entrusted it to the sea.
Rudimentary. Elementary. It's basically a child's drawing. You know what Albert Einstein said. If you can't explain it simply, you haven't understood it.
Pete, what have you done? Dad! - What are you doing here? - I'm here for your birthday. Did you think I'd miss it?
This place makes me sick. - I don't want to be here. - All right. Angela, you were in a car accident. - Do you remember that?
Can we go home ? My social interactions are awkward for me and for others. Even when I want to pay a compliment, it comes out wrong. You have a nice haircut. Did you do it yourself ?
Um, I heard that I was one of 121 women, nationwide -- but that was a while ago, now some... Come here. She has a scratch on her left arm. It's nothing. I got it this morning.
You don't want the job? I'll pass it on, to Gleb's team. Ah, well. Thank you. We'll take it.
- Well, are you finished? - Yes, I'm done. Okay. I'm just telling you. And I'm just listening to you. Sully, call me when you find another body, because you will.
Are you here? Douglass? Sully, I'm going to blow your head off any minute. Listen, Douglass, if you're still willing, I want you to kill that bear. I thought Beckett adopted him or something.
- It's going to come out. - Yeah, right. And then Marzin will show up, in a stolen gray van, with Carolyn's DNA under his fingernails, and everybody's happy. You can leave out the van. We'll never find it.
We will never find him. You know what I like about you, Ray? Let's not even pretend it's legal. Go to the detective who's in charge of it? Fuck that. Let's not cross the line: we'll jump it with both feet.
You can't afford it. - Steve, can you mind your own business ? - Yes. I'm sorry, did I get that right? We have an interview... ..in two hours at New Compass? - People wait two years for an interview like this. Two years. You have it in two hours.
I don't like noodles. They make me think of worms. Surprise. (Tom)Miozio took me fishing once. He caught a worm and ate it just to disgust me.
I said it was a bad business. - I had said it over and over again. - Guys, take it easy! Yes, we have a problem. And, yes, we will solve it!
The trick, is to find them. Take each other by the hand. Now we will communicate with the spirits, not conjure. Don't move and don't interrupt the circle. Because if there is a spirit, our energy will attract it.
Now-let's take a look at your arm. The point of origin is expanding. Maggie, what did you do to yourself here? - He broke it. - I cut it off.
- I need a volunteer. - I just had an exorcism. Come on, Brad. No, I'm all right. I'll do it then.
- I never was, you were. When I saw you die, something came back to me. The bread thing. I remember--of you in the rain. I had burned it on purpose--to give it to you.
Here. Happy birthday. - What is it? - A book. - Where did you find it? - In a market.
Excuse me, I... You. I think she can fix it, David. Wait, what? I hacked your signal. When you turn it on here, I see it there.
Those televisions, the "anti-catastrophe" room. You would amplify the signal from that monitor. How? It doesn't take anything. So much energy goes through it, a little radio would pick it up.
But it looks like a nice place to spend your last days. The monitor acts as an antenna. It doesn't just receive tachyons. It takes a possible future and. It amplifies it, transmitting it as continuous feedback.
- What can be done? Nothing, I'm afraid. I don't have the tools to reset the bone. - Come on Do you have a pocket watch? Give it to me.
- Yes. - Thank you, my good man. Why couldn't it move to an egg in, say, a bucket? What does the mother have to do with this? That's right! You are educating yourself! Since we need you -- we suck the fertilized egg with a funnel, and shoot it up the...
But your diary said. What diary? - Where did you get it? - In my jacket pocket - when you came by. - Did you keep it all the time? I was going through it as a data set.
- It's not like that, George. Has there ever been a British attack, launched with drones on a city, in a friendly country that is not at war? General? I don't think so, no. So how can it be authorized?
- How come I don't know you? - The world is big. A surfer like you? I watch YouTube, but I've never seen you. A tree falling in the forest, no one posts it on YouTube. Did it really happen?
Maybe it will be easier for him to understand the kind of world, which she is trying to make us imagine. The biggest difference is that when he grows up, if we think back to the year 2001, is that he will have, at home, not exactly a computer as big as this one, but at least a console, with which he will be able to communicate with nearby computers and get the information for everyday life, such as his bank statement or theater reservations. All the. necessary to live within a complex modern society. It will all be in compact form at home. He'll have a television screen, like this one, a keyboard, and he'll talk to the computer for information, and he'll take it for granted, like we do with the telephone.
- My name? Yes, I realized it was fun not knowing it, but now more than nice, it's weird. It's hot here. I don't really like my name. I actually... I kind of hate it and it makes me angry.
We will not walk. We will take the Train of Thoughts! The train! Of course! It's much faster! But how are we going to take it?
I guess it is not as beautiful as the libraries you are used to, but ... - It is wonderful. - Beautiful! Do you really think so? Magnificent. That means she likes it.
We extracted it from a torpedo long ago. A self-respecting Centurian doesn't throw anything away. We will carry it along the hull until we are close to the hold. After that, I will remove the shielding and you will launch it away from the ship. If all goes well and you are right, the creature will run after her.
Then. We can... Begin. Joe? I didn't know he could draw. Well, that's the thing, actually everybody can draw, it's just that some people have a more developed primary visual cortex and manual dexterity as you know. And right now these magnets are taking that part of her brain and empowering her.
I think I found the rope used to tie Trish Winterman up. Stop. - Don't. - Stop the car. These are just things left in the cab. Why do you keep them?
Stop. - Don't. - Stop the car. These are just things left in the cab. Why do you keep them? Why didn't you give them back?
Prophet Abraham -- and the one who ordered that sacrifice. The captain spoke... about the conspiracy of slaveholders. Like me, he despised ... the abolitionists who are unable to take concrete action. That feeling, like dust that does not settle, he felt it too. But unlike me, he had given it a name.
But triangulation of Michael's cell phone signal places him in the vicinity of his grandmother's nursing home, and not where Hana Reznikova was abducted. Good. We all know how it works, there is a chain of evidence that starts with the investigative team, then it goes to the investigator in charge of the investigation, who presents it to the prosecutor. The prosecutor can only consider the evidence that is presented to her. But who knows how Huntley presented it.
But what manners. Hey Hap, help yourself, too. You got it. I was just refreshing Leonard's memory about the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Are you familiar with it? Oh, but Hap the faggot allegories that Baptists are crazy about knows it very well, don't you, Hap?
But I wasn't very angry, you know? He was vomiting and stumbling all the time. I wasn't very angry because he was -- he was wearing a suit and tie. I don't know where they had come from. I haven't even seen them again, but ... that day ... he was wearing a suit and tie. For me.
So you want me to review it. Would you do that? I'm not saying I have fucking dyscalculia, but if I'm going to put my ass on the scaffold I want to make sure I don't miss anything. Send me the documentation. I'll take a look at it.
I'm just a big fat loser with no talent. Even your magic pills didn't work. - What magic pills? - The ones in your bag. I replaced them with other pills so I wouldn't get into trouble.
I understand. In your eyes I will always remain -- a criminal. This is all fascinating. Apparently the spear emits a glow in the presence of divine blood. Yes, it also revealed a message when Mick set it on fire.
It feeds on light, but approaches when it hears noises. - What do we do, then? - Simple. We make some noise, luring the beast here, and then we send it back into the portal. And how do we keep it from getting out?
Hey, do you want to talk to Liz? - No, no, no... - I'll get some cake in the back. Why? They're bringing them to us.
Okay, have a good time. I'm going to go be the host. How are you doing? What happened to your suit? Ah, look, I was feeling really uncomfortable. So I took off my shirt and ... jacket and hid them under the sink.
Is it the pro forma talk for the thugs? - I'm just talking, Sam. - Yeah, just because you like Mommy. Because I don't want my daughter to have anything to do with a thief. The necklace you gave her, you stole it, didn't you?
He would have this view, but also this other view. Ford always knew where to place the camera. Suddenly, from above the clouds, Japan attacks! THE BATTLE OF THE MIDWAY His reaction was purely cinematic. At that moment, reality was catching up with him, and he went towards it.
Interweaving pathological and forensic examination, Niall Swift met his murderer at Carn Mhor. His wrists were tied with a rope similar to this one. In what store are they sold? Could they remember someone who bought them?
Uncle Leo! - Peter! - Gotcha! Be careful! The gun drives me crazy, but... Peter and his friends love them.
When he saw what we were spending on, he said. 'Your vain little project, 'will bankrupt the federal government.' People need their history. They need to know that real people have lived here. Not ghosts or legends. But people who faced adversity and overcame it.
What's going on here, Mr. Day? He threw a lit cigarette near the gas pump where I was standing. I put it out. Is this usually how people throw cigarettes away, out a car window? Some people put them out in their mouths.
Look, that's all I ask. I can't think of living up here. It's like a bird's nest. Look. Hot water whenever you need it.
- the lab is sealed! - There must be a way! We have to escape! We have to go now! Tell me how to get to the bomb or I'll give it to you until I kill you!
- I'm-that's two months I haven't had to worry about losing my job. - Do you understand that? - I know, but we can't ignore it. - It's a big thing. - He's a blogger! Not just any blogger. A celebrity blogger. And one who claims to have evidence. Listen. What if he collected all the. Exposure threats from the past year and somehow put them together?
They come here because they want a taste--of what they could be. Billy. Let's go. The only thing your story tells me -- Mr. Sizemore -- is who you are. Well, isn't there anything you like?
Nurse Mary. Private Starks. The boy came with the mail. I can't, uh, read the words right. Would you like me to read them to you?
She died for her beliefs and her God, honest with herself despite the darkness that surrounded her. It is said that she sang at the stake as she was about to die. A tragic end. I don't think so. She heard a voice and believed her.
We know that Ellie Connock blamed Tommy for the fish market fire. - And we think Jack played along. - No. No, she's out of her mind, no. Anyway, we think they used her boat to get rid of Tommy's body, and set her on fire to cover their tracks.
Apparently it was not a dream. Damn crickets. So much for my deposit. And to my pizza. Great. And now we put them in the ready-made grill.
I guess it's about the opportunity proposed to her Donna. It would have been an opportunity if the numbers add up, Jim. I don't understand. I thought you were the kind of man willing to take the risk. They are. But not if it puts people I care about at risk. That's why I'm here to tell you that when Donna offers you her company pension, you'll have to tell her you don't need it anymore.
What criminal activity? The crate was delivered to his trailer. - I took the picture this morning. - It could be anything. Then why are your cronies guarding it with guns?
- Screw the courts! Why don't we send it to the press? Let's show what this man did. The Director was smart, he's not in any of these photos, and we can't prove he took them. If we release them, there is a risk that he will cover his tracks.
The only way out is through the main gate. Then can we leave it where it is, covered by the tarp? But what if the police come back? What if they take a look around? I don't know. What if we set her on fire?
No. There are no surprises waiting for them. I promise. For what it's worth, I believe you. It would be ironic if the evidence to exonerate Josh were in this house. A bomb from Susan would blow them up.
It's a meeting about your family, Majesty. I thought it would be better to have some suggestions - before informing you. - Good. I wanted to discuss my family and what you have done to them.
There is method I examined in my book, but it is a gamble. We have to -- calm him down, bring him back. I have conducted several experiments that show that classical music can make a patient with this kind of psychiatric breakdown become lucid again. It may be enough to get a confession. What do you need?
No. Why? Because it was one of our patrol cars that hit him. One of ours? Luana practically ran into her.
I need to find a shoebox. - What? - Our Gail? The one without friends? She was from the Lonely Hearts, kept her letters in a shoebox. - That's great. - They've been turned over to the Missing Persons Unit, which can't find them.
You ... stay exactly where you are. - What is this all about? - She has a dose of smallpox. She got it from the lab. Is she so protective of this town that she doesn't want anything to happen to her?
- Who is missing? - Dan Curnow, Ted Carkeek. We're not stopping until they're found. Forgive my intrusion. I thought I'd bring you the news before you heard them elsewhere.
Do you understand what I mean? I've never heard you say anything more confusing than this. 'Morning. The complete genome analysis of George and Ash's killer has finally arrived. Do you want me to explain them to you?
More like an operations room than a house. - Yes. - Jane, you need a break. The house is a refuge, a place to disconnect from your problems. Until a psychopath sets it on fire.
I think it's time to talk. Tell me everything. Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking. I've taken some time to forget what you put me and our family through, and I'm ready to consider letting you come home. Look, Brooke, I've had a lot of time to think, too. At Burning Man. We wrote our regrets on... Pieces of parchment with an inkwell and we put them in a little house made of twigs, and we set it on fire.
- No, I just -- I can't find the right job for me. My only friend doesn't talk to me anymore.... The only one? What's all this stuff? My father's papers, when he died the department put his stuff in boxes and sent them to us.
- 28 dollars... Is there nothing else? - No, that's the only soup. - It looks really good. - It's great, you'll see you'll like it.
If he stopped, he stopped. Let's not argue with Mr. Sharp Little Hands. Let's keep looking for the door. Find irregularities. If Cassandra were here, she would notice them.
We are the best thing that ever happened to him. Sorry. I think I got what you wanted. Yes, except for the popcorn in the Danny Wheeler collector's box. I accidentally dropped them on the floor and threw them in the doorway.
- If I'm boring, how come I have a lead? Take a look. This is a security shot from the day the backpack disappeared. 11 o'clock, the bag is on a chair. Now we send ahead to see what happens to it.
I don't know where to start. Start with the hydrangeas. And for the record, no. It's not my life's dream to water these things. I put animal flour on them so they grow. She loves them, so.
And then, with an American citizen involved! May I, minister? In such a situation, where the mission changes, becoming a missile attack against a British subject, two British subjects and a U.S. citizen, and in a friendly country ... I think it is right and proper that I consult with the foreign minister. Minister -- you've heard the arguments, he hasn't. And the rules of engagement imply that the premier -- has already approved them.
I appeal to your sense of humanity now. There is a maniac who wants to kill me, and... I ask you to be the best machine and help me. I'm just a man looking at a machine and asking it to love me.
- Aunt Alice. She has to leave now. Okay. I'm still waiting for the updated guest list. I'm working on it. She could have told me that she had read it! That she had liked it!
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Often, when I speak to the film community, there is an elephant in the room. Me. So I thought I would talk to you about something. That list marked a wretched time. No one who survived it was saved from evil.
Not necessarily. Excuse me? The Navy has not expressed itself yet. The Navy will not express itself at all. The Navy will do what Parliament tells it to do.
I turn you on your side, Mr. Mills. I'm sorry, I know I'm bothering you. No, not at all. It looks much better. I'll put some egg white on it.
What? What did Pettigrew find under the ice? His buried treasure? I know what a GPR scan looks like. We use them all the time to find things.
It was also a catastrophe for the Targaryens. They never fully recovered. "The Dance of Dragons." Why on earth is it a dance? That's the name they gave it.
In previous episodes... The energy, the connection, I know you felt them too.
Thank you, Mr. Hubble. Most valuable research for my latest novel. The pleasure was mine, Lady Felicia. The Beresford collection is the only private museum to have a complete set of 12th dynasty embalming irons. Has Father Brown told you the title yet?
It was a relief to wake up. But it became difficult to forget the dreams. And still -- night fell. And they took her to the stake. And as her skin split open and filled with bubbles...and the stench filled her nostrils...she realized...that the dream was her other life.
I will prove to him that I am the best grandmother in the world. "Grandma," "granny," "granny." It didn't matter what she called herself. My mother wanted to be the best. She would change the doll, feed her.
I lie exclusively when someone's safety is at risk. Or if a minor, age eight and under, asks me about Santa Claus. In which case. They ski some reassuring nonsense about the logical impossibility of proving a denial. It's sentimental nonsense but -- they buy it.
It was too dark to see. Everything was black. It was always-all black in the hole. I know it was small... The walls on the east and west measured 1 meter 45, 1 meter 90 the north and south ones. I measured them every day.
Yes, what? Yes, Agent Keen was on that boat, the Phoenix, as part of the official duties of our task force. You're going down a very dangerous road, Director. You understand that if he perjures himself. You asked me a question, and I answered it.
- You're welcome. I found something else. And here's the murder weapon. Prints? I put them in AFIS, but nothing, which normally would have made me say, like, five swear words in a row, but this frame pulled me out of the darkness.
- They are not ghosts! ...they tried to kill you, why didn't you leave the base? That was my decision. We have a trillion worth of mining equipment here. We are not going to abandon them....
"Let's put it on the sliding rollers and weigh it." Why don't they just make up the numbers? That's what the Italians always do. - Really! - Okay. When Alfa finally gives us the convertible version, we'll compare them to determine which is the best.
Yes. Go to the Lake Pub. Don't tell Pierre. No one. Warn Yan and come to me to see your daughter. Then leave town right away. I promise you that when you are in front of her.
I can barely scramble an egg. What can I cook for 9 people? Lasagna tex-mex. Okay, I have no idea what that is, but it sounds great. It's super easy, 20 minutes of prep and you put it in the oven.
Who's hungry? Have you had lunch? I have a cow in the freezer. - Fascinating. - Is she one of yours? - Yes, I shot her in the back fence.
So, I thought about it, and I talked to Peggy. I think we should send our information to the agency, and if she still wants to meet with us, then we'll go from there. Why are you laughing? I guess I'm relieved. I sent them a couple of days ago.
Cleveland wants to set me up. He has my miniature photographs of cool guys. Peter, they're baseball cards. Whatever. He's using them to frame me for murder.
Remember I told you? Each room returns to its original condition. According to logic, teleportation should do the same thing. "Teleportation" - fancy word. It's actually like 3D printers, only they break down matter and living information and transmit it.
How was the first day? It was great. I attended all the classes in the right order.... And at the pre-game afternoon gathering I was able to say, "Eighth grade. "A little bit stronger now. Eighth grade." And I didn't think the pizza bag could get any better, but Aunt Edie's pizza trolley took it to a new level of portability.
- Freedom of the press, officer. - Detective. A little respect? The kid's got a family. I'm not putting them on Instagram.
Unless it's with your car. Tomorrow I'm going to an exclusive sale at one of my favorite boutiques. Do you want to be my date? I can't remember the last time I chaperoned someone. That sale doesn't know what she's in for.
So you know what I'm going to do? I'm not going to tear up the check you gave me, and.... This check was for a new car. That car was used. Yes, by you. We don't know what happened to it in these five minutes.
- That's right. - All right, apparently Clark wants to play. We want to take the car for a test drive. - But you just came here. - Yes, when it was a new car, we don't know what happened to it in these...
I told you I was coming with a lot of baggage. Yeah, but I had thought more about emotional baggage. What is it? Everything I've ever recorded in my life. I keep them handy in case I need to consult them.
Everything seems to connect to the illegal sale of weapons. Four containers of 48 feet each. That's a lot of weapons. Yeah. Whoever is interested in that much firepower or will sell them....
The police don't know what to do with it and the ROC doesn't give me any help. She helps me-and the battery is hers. That kernel is burned out. That unit was shot. The policeman who shot it swears that it ... was repairing itself.
- You're welcome. Hi. Hey. So, Christine, how do you like your new house? She says she really likes it.
You say he tried to cut you? No, he tried to devour me! - Devour you? - Like in the Book of Wailing. So I grabbed the verbena and burned her face.
I didn't mean to disrespect you. It's just that ... so many things are going on - and ... And I can't talk to you about it. - It's okay, I believe you. I really hope you work them out.
# But now you're not what you were # # Let me wipe away your tears # # And heal your pain # # If you let me, baby # # I've got a pocket full of promises, # # I've got them if you want them #
You gave me free will, you created whores, you created me as an ass in math, and you didn't think it could all go to hell? You built me to fail, and now you even have the balls to question your fucking job? If I built a machine that didn't work, I wouldn't condemn it to eternal flames. "You diabolical shit!" And I would set it on fire.
What is all this stuff? It weighs a ton. Gifts from the children for the end of the semester, mostly candles and mugs - from the "World's Best Teacher." - Can't we throw them away? - No, and then what if someone finds them?
Because you know. - Yes, model 28-135 p-class ultrasonic. That's right. You know what it is. I'm aware of its rarity, cost, and what seawater would do to you.
It's true. These are not the usual HYDRA attack patterns. What is this stuff? It will never come off in the washing machine. I've never seen them before.
I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good assistance? This call could be recorded! Now you get them! Yes!
I repaired it. Bonnie and I used to come here every day. It's the closest thing I had to a photograph of you, and I needed every memory I could get. It's funny. I had so many good memories of this house, and because of one bad memory, I set it on fire.
Listen to me for a moment. This room is really small. If you start getting on each other's nerves, do what I do with my little girls. You each go to a corner. We call them "lonely areas."
Do you remember? Hey! Give it to me! Yeol Moo. Give me the bag I told you I only keep it one more day, then I give it to you again.
That day I... I was intent on throwing away Han Byeul's things. I was packing her things to move them, and when I saw Mom packing her things, I had to throw them away. So I grabbed them and ran away.
Good. Come on, I'll show you the main set. Oh! What's that smell? Oh! They don't call them the bowels of the 'building for nothing, eh?
Ta-da! Is it inside that box? No. That's the spacecraft. The box shape keeps it from going too fast.
The past and the future turn into a noose. I live eternity as if it were nothing. I can no longer understand the meaning of things, they no longer seem the same or so it seems to me. Everything becomes knotted... Existence appears as reality, consciousness opposes it.
Watch out, there's a camera up there. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Okay, so after they're done up here, we leave them here, set them up until it fills up. Half the time the drivers don't bring them up first.
It is very inspiring. I like to record in analog at the highest level and then listen that way. But that's not what's happening on the streets Isn't that where our audience You want them to live their lives the way they want to live them.
- What kind of car is this? - A BMW. It's German. - One tire, Martin? - No, it has all four.
We got stuck between doing things. Or between doing nothing. Okay, Manny is coming soon, so let's revise the plan. When we hear him coming, we turn off the lights. Then when he comes in and turns them on, we all yell, "Surprise!"
Wow. Do you want to see why? The EMG is getting a myoelectric response. Your brain is talking to it.
Great news. Chloe is going to be fine. Thank God. The surgery took longer than expected. There were complications, but Chloe came through it great.
You have to harden your heart. But the crown,like everything else, has its price. I only hope you are ready for it. Your grace? I think you will like it.
Like a trophy, to put on airs and show that you've managed to pull off the heist of the century? No, for a much more concrete reason. I couldn't leave them in the plane, nor could I throw it out, risk them finding it. So you put them in a bag and that bag you entrusted to Arlo? He told me he was going to set it on fire.
Castle will not die. We are not dealing with an evil spirit, but with a guy who has an address in the sender's field. Why does everyone keep asking me about P.O. Box 1135? Wait. Who else has asked you anything?
- Is it a special occasion? Have you taken out your credit card? - Yes, but I'm afraid... - We'd like two steaks and side dishes. Charge them to this guy.
- Get it, kids? - Fuck off, Peppino! You're just a bullshitter like all fishermen! Your story is more false than the tobacconist's tits. What are you talking about? First, Rosa's tits leave them alone.
- Dad. - What's going on here? We were about to have dinner, I'm surprised to see you. Maddie had forgotten her soccer bag in the car. I thought she needed it for the game tomorrow.
He was buying up all the phones in Manhattan in bulk, but they stopped him. I don't know about you, but I have no desire at all to know what will happen when an evil multinational corporation becomes omniscient. But why did you make it so vulnerable? You created the Machine to protect everyone. What have you done to it so that it cannot protect itself?
There's the control unit there, Harold. I'll take it from here, please. Be careful what you wish for, Ms. Groves. This union you yearn for may not be what you imagine. This isn't about me-it's about saving the Machine, not just from Decima, but from what you've done to her.
Yes, sir. Really? Miriam denied it. She was probably ashamed, sir. I was checking to see if she had any fuzes on her. Some of them hide them under their skirts.
How do we educate people to fight this epidemic? Do you know that Obama has it too? He doesn't talk about it often, but he has it. Do you Google them? You won't find them on the regular Internet. But the secret one is full of information.
- Really? Ah... A moon cake? I thought the government banned the ones with only one yolk. Social Security gives them away.
He was about to leave the police force because his construction business was performing so well. Then Tammany Hall took notice of him and climbed the ranks, one after another. But he started at the bottom-knowing only that he wanted to rise to the top. The truth is this... Greatness begins with... the boring things of everyday life. What matters is how you deal with them.
And Dad was hurt, so I was worried about him. Dad. I'll take care of it. So Sean put the box up. We didn't want anybody to find them and be able to come in and take my weapons.
Mr. Cameron has decided to censor pornography on the Internet. How are you going to do that now? ! That means we won't be able to look at images like this anymore. Wait a minute, is that a wise thing to do? He hasn't banned them yet.
I don't drink -- not because I don't want to, but because I can't. It ruined my life, it destroyed my relationships, and I'm still picking up the pieces, but if you want a glass of wine, go ahead. It won't bother me at all. So once I stopped drinking, I had all these emotions coming up, and I didn't know how to deal with them, so I started eating. Every night after work, I'd come home, and I'd take a bag of chips, and I'd hit it with a book, so there were just the crumbs, and I'd mix it with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.
I don't want her magazines. "Ghetto girls" style stuff? Is that what you want? Look, if I see something, I'll have to say it. If you see an interracial gang bang, you might say you want them.
What's up. We're jacuzzi buddies. Look, in our state, it's not safe to come in here alone. Where's the key? I think the idiot cop stripper we stole the handcuffs from still has them.
Don't you pick and refuse me. 'Cause the things people refuse are the things they should use. Do you hear me? Hear what I say. Avevo gi√† sentito questa canzone, ma non le avevo mai dato importanza.
- Illuminati. - The Illuminati. And they say Hilary Clinton is a lizard. The thing is, if you see the sky enough, you'll see lasers coming out of the moon. If you look very, very closely because I've seen them.
Do you want to take a look? - Yes. - I'll go get my jacket. It's fine. It has a lot of miles on it, but I've always maintained it.
I learned English just by watching reruns of "Solid Gold." - Really? Are you serious about that? - Yes. They've even done studies on it. The brain acquires new information, such as a new language, or a mathematical equation, much faster and retains it better if that information is conveyed through music.
Is this where he did it? It would appear so, Silas, but you can't be here. So what about this rope thing? Did he get the impression that they were part of his private life? He proposed them as a setting, and we tried.
Behave yourself. - I think you haven't read the letter. - Oh no, I read it. Both sentences. So concise I thought you wrote them at gunpoint.
It is. Mrs. Florrick, do you have any evidence - in this regard? And before the hearing on the obstruction of justice charge, there will be the hearing on the legality of the audit. Then gather them.
You can stop it now, Henry. Regardless of how good a friend you may be, I don't think -- you can justify this stupid and irresponsible thing I did. - At least, I can't. - Did you burn it on purpose? No, I -- we, Dylan and I, accidentally set her on fire.
And we think it might belong to the killer. Okay. Does it look familiar to you? Offhand, no. Would you mind taking another look?
In previous episodes. Police! Freeze! My suit is damaged. What did you do to it?
Gee, Alec, where are you? Living large. What can I do for you? My suit's damaged. What? Well, I wouldn't know where to start. What did you do to it?
Helmut Torben. To my knowledge Mr. Torben had no involvement, financial or otherwise, with McClarenTruth.org. So what you know is very little, isn't it? Well, it doesn't matter. I'm going to submit a request for all information pertaining to donations made by Mr. Torben to your client. If you don't provide it -- I'll have you thrown in jail for contempt of court.
So, we need to discuss his options. One is the Van Ness rotoplasty. I amputate her leg, rotate it 180 degrees, and reattach it. Basically, the functioning ankle will become her knee. After that, she'll need a small prosthesis, and she'll be able to ... run and jump -- keep working.
A really, really big bird. He alerts Evan to the sighting. No one responds. Maybe the anomaly ... creates interference. Or it creates them whatever came out of it.
This explains the bizarre behavior. But why did he have the sudden urge to jump into the lake? Hydatid cyst? Tapeworms are in the larval stage. That thing is full of eggs. And if we don't get them out before they hatch, this young woman will die.
It's our company's hotel. I'm headed there now. Don't you need to examine your car a little? It's not a big deal. I'll take a look at it now.
Raffi tried it, but he says this foam squeezed his clapper too tightly. But I want to go much further-I'm going to keep tinkering with these bad boys until they produce the mythical... - "Brown Note." - What's that? An infrasound frequency that is so low ... that it causes humans to lose control of their intestines. I will sell them to the military.
Milly wants her things. What the fuck do you think you're doing coming here? If you want something from us, you send us a fucking letter! I'll let you go this time, but if you come back, I swear I'll kill you. I'll put his things in a box so you won't see them anymore.
- Yes! They are here. Go to the dock. What happened? Where is your boat? Did something happen to it?
Holy shit! They got it right. Yeah, I'm afraid so. - Well, I have another idea. - What? Well, she's not going to like it.
Lab sensors report nothing. - Signs of a struggle. - I'll keep looking. Thank you, Eric. NEST teams find nothing. A nuclear trail has to be more radioactive than everything around it, or the equipment won't detect it.
I think party planning can get pretty confusing. It depends on the party. Anyway, I've got to get going. - The center camera? - The robber shot at her, so I lined up the recordings of the two side cameras.
I can't believe my little southern town has a sad history of racial injustice. Man, I hate stupid, dull, smelly old Stoolbend. Cleveland, I know that's not true. You love this town. You dedicated that stupid song to her.
There are us and two other companies. Linda said someone upstairs knew who the other two bidders were. - Were there bribes involved? - That's right. She told me she could have tipped off someone at city hall. She did the right thing; I was grateful.
If I give you information about this man and someone finds out-I will lose my job. I will be branded a traitor and most likely go to jail. I will not make the information public. - I can't even use it in court. - Then what do you need it for?
I am given to understand that there is a problem with the Jedi prisoner. A raiding party tried to rescue them, but we have already taken care of that. Do you have the information that the prisoner is aware of? Not yet, but we will have it soon. Are you aware that the information will shift the balance of this war in favor of whoever possesses it?
- XIII is moving, Mr. President. - The latest update? My people have tracked the purchase of 2 tickets to Denver. Traffic cameras report a car rented by Samantha Taylor traveling to Green Falls, Colorado. The information got to NSA before I could divert it.
We all want the same thing, even if we give it different names.
Good luck, Officer LaRoche. - The information on Montero. - What do we know. Single, self-employed, often imported antique works of art from abroad. - He sold them in a warehouse in San Francisco.
Then there it is. He disappears into the bathroom. But then something else happens. Something the Judge didn't know, because he wasn't there when it happened. The police must have known, because they were watching the monitor. Here, she fills her hand with pills and takes them all. And then she swallows them down with whiskey.
Antecedent to rape. She was really pretty. She had long blond hair. She was very pretty. She had ... a life. And she liked it.
- Sir, please calm down. - No, no, let me talk! I don't care what seats you have left, do you see this? I'm a Vista Atlantic platinum flyer. Does this look like a Gold card to you?
Yes, sir. You think this story between Mary and Nugent is unfounded, don't you? I'm sure it is. Look, we all know these things happen. The tabloid magazines report them every Sunday.
How? He didn't mean it. Honey, don't be stupid. I'm not mad at you. I put toilet paper in the windows and set it on fire.
I have the love of an exceptional woman--and the joy of raising two wonderful children with her. I have enough money to retire-or at least I will once I sell some property. And when my legal problems are over, that's what I intend to do. You built this city--now you can take it back. Atlantic City and everything around it....
I mean, she used to call me a lot, telling me about some crazy dream that she was sure represented a sign or something, but ... Is it true that Nikolai had a premonition of his own death? So we were told. Well, so did she... the day she died. What did she tell you? Well, if you want you can listen for yourself.
What is the title? "Daddy, say yes." Yes. I wrote it. Thank you. I'm glad you liked it.
Armenians. Really unstable people. Well, I really appreciate the cooperation, but -- we still have to do a full investigation. Enjoy yourself. I really hope this attack has nothing to do with the, uh, threats to Dr. Knowles. The hospital has confirmed them.
Oh, I forgot: you can't! Because all our money is in this house that we decided to resell at a higher price, but now there's this shitty crisis. You think I like to carve twenty pumpkins.... and have the pulp stuck under my fingernails? I'm trying! I'm trying...to make this place cozy, comforting, and spectacular, and make sure that the pictures of the party end up in Elle Decor so someone will see them, swoop in here, and take this house away from us,
- No Fred! You have to be strong! - Why? Do you remember what you felt watching her kiss another man right in front of you? Her lips against his--the lies, the betrayal, the way she took your trust, doused it with gasoline and set it on fire?
And sometimes some things are are even better when they are ripe. - Is this potato soup good or shall I throw it away? - Save it. At the risk of sounding cruel, I think it's ready for the trash. How can you say such a thing? If you knew this soup as well as I do, you would know that it still has some good sips.
I ruined it because I thought I was better than Greendale. You see, I went to a university, so I thought it was my duty to improve this place. But in the end the only thing wrong with Greendale was that it's run by an insecure disaster, who gives five dances and two talent shows a year because he's afraid the school isn't doing well enough. But Greendale is doing well enough because it accepts me for what I am not. Greendale -- it's the best school in the world. And I'm so sorry for what I did to her.
This is my city. It will lose its office and its home. I can reduce it to the size of a tiny little creature and this--this will be the only roof over his damn head. What do you want me to do? Get those ramblings out of my son's head -- and destroy them.
You were wrong. Don't feel too bad about it. We were all wrong. She didn't have a swollen trachea. It was blocked by a pseudomembrane growing around it.
Please wait. Wait. Let me say it again. I'm not going to eliminate football or any other sport. I'm just going to change the rules for eligibility so kids who need extra hours in the classroom don't lose them on the field.
It's my fault, it's my fault. I fixed them wrong. I got distracted with Ainhoa, and I went to find something to strengthen them, but then I forgot. I'm sorry. I didn't check them!
I don't care what you will do to me. I want to know what you did to Gaius. Gaius had some information I needed. The location of the sorcerer Emrys. If he had given them to me willingly, his suffering would not have been prolonged.
A party at the German embassy could make a night worth a thousand years. Laughing at all their jokes was like eating breakfast in the sewer. The way I see it, going to war for America would be like a man who has never had an affair intruding on a 50-year-long marriage. Thank you for a wonderful party, Your Excellency. I'm glad you enjoyed it, Mr. Lan-Ting.
Unsure of which direction to take, he decided to spend the night there, where the four roads intersected. When he was about to fall asleep, night birds and a cool breeze woke him up. He saw a shadow appear in the sky with a black cloak and a large hat. A human form swooped down upon him. The creature grabbed Robert's guitar, and with its long terrifying fingers made it make a sound no one had ever imagined before. Then it threw the guitar beside Robert.
And excuse the appearance. I don't forget this house. It was the dirtiest house I ever lived in. Why are they so cold? Henry kept them in the freezer.
She overloaded herself. And that's a bad thing, huh? No--because all the excess radiation gets vented in there. Vinvocci glass. It contains them.
When he finds a tunnel, he goes into it like it's a fucking creek. We have 60 guys pumping day and night to keep the water level down. If we lose even a couple of those guys, this fucking mine will be unusable. Where are they getting this stuff? The hoesmen are getting them wherever they happen to be, sir.
Only its appearance leaves a little to be desired. You're welcome, judge. So. Why don't you write to her? Because if I write to her first, I lose the chance that she will write to me first.
- Cut off? Yes! They weren't working! Maybe the line went down. Probably they are being fixed.
One word and I will provide you with a list of students who I believe should be boarded immediately. I'm sorry, Sue. This is insanity! What you call madness, I call inspiration. Let me explain.
Thanks to this computer equipped with writing software connected with this cable to a printer that is also a computer printer. If this is a ploy to swipe my carbon paper, I'm making a mess. Ah, no, boss, I threw away the carbon paper. - Huh? You did what? - But she doesn't need it anymore.
Well, here I am. Tell me about this new weapon. It's in front of you. In front of-where? Two more steps and you'd give her a kiss.
Just like half the population of this city, right? Yes. But how did he come into possession of the Davis medal? I don't know. Borrowed, stolen. And maybe this Shelly Davis wanted it returned to her.
We are doing some work on the side and need to shut off the water. Oh, okay. No problem. Yeah, it won't take long. If you need it, there's a porta-potty out front.
If a crime happens please solve it! What do you mean by 'crime'? The one who solves the crime is the investigator. Any of you can be the investigator. Once the solution is proposed, you will all give it a grade.
- You gave it to me... - Yesterday. The box I brought from the landlady's house. She said that -- the tenant left things behind. What if he left them because he died?
That's perfect, Olivia. Make sure they're tightened just right. Walter, do you really think this is going to work? There's no reason it shouldn't. Something has prevented this creature from developing, and since it's partly mechanical, if we supply it with enough power we should be able to start it up again. Like starting a car with wires.
You see, when I went to look for food, I actually found the smoldering wreckage of the spacecraft. Contemptuous of the danger, I rushed inside to pick up our supplies. So this is the dried fruit that Fry gave me! Yes. I exaggerated when I said I picked them from the trees.
Devries, get out of the car! Get away from the car. Information is money. Or so they say. And you have turned them into hard currency.
I'm going to get an infection at the elastic line again. Are you really not bringing anyone to Cerie's wedding? I don't mind not having a date. What about Floyd's wedding? Rather than come alone to that, I'll rent a car, set it on fire, and drive it off a waterfall.
Do you think my hands smell like dog? Okay. I assume it's because we share a room, not because she smelled my hand. I'm perfectly fine with the arrangement, Hoyt. I'm sorry about you. I'm glad you're okay with it, sir.
Do you know how embarrassed I am?" Things like that. I think he was having an affair. Did he ever see a woman leave the house or see the car? He loved that bear. He devoted his whole life to her.
The queen is never in play. It's not a bank. Hardison, where do the police keep the evidence? The valuable kind, I mean? That evidence will be sent straight to Holyoke in the morning. To the precinct and then they send it away.
Assume that the pool table is like a time machine. If a ball enters a hole, it travels through a wormhole--and can exit another hole--before it enters the first hole. So it's a time machine. Now suppose the ball actually enters the first hole...emerges before it has entered...and then hits itself before it has entered the first hole. This would deflect it...preventing it from entering the first hole...and thus prevent it from ever having exited the second hole...and making the deflection.
Because the Chalice can be used for good but also for evil. I don't understand. Many centuries ago, it fell into the hands of a great warlord. One night, he gathered the army before him. He took a drop of blood from each man and collected them in the Chalice.
I avoided the vital points. Yes. I just came to bring you the mail. Bank statement, reports on the progress of the Resort, Kim the Jerk, and... Give them to me later...
She must want something, since she humored me for hours as if she were an assistant. I'm here for her glass mask. I see... Come to the studio. But I won't guarantee anything.
Thank you. - Have a seat over there. - Huh? Hold this. I wrote a few lines, and I want you to read them after you inhale the gas.
And we don't make deals with terrorists. Oh, please, we do it every time. He'll say he was tortured, we'll deny it. He will say he wants to go on the air, we will deny it. He will make impossible demands and we will deny them.
They developed their shells by drawing on carbon dioxide from the now-dissolved atmosphere in the ocean. These layers are accumulations of shells from those billions and billions of microorganisms. Thanks to them, carbon dioxide was taken from the atmosphere and other life forms could develop. It was life that changed the atmosphere. Plant life fed on solar energy, which enabled it to break down water molecules and obtain oxygen.
My death. But before we deal with that, it's necessary to go back to when it all began, when God got busy with the creation of the universe, when there was just cosmic mush. God's dido, if you will. As God played with his dido', creating all living creatures, he put death in a ceramic jar to keep it safe until he would figure out what to do with it. One day, God gave the jar to a frog and a toad to guard it while he created something even more wonderful.
He just wants to win. Miles wants to be unbeatable. With samuel and joshua, he's been through a lot to get revenge. - What did we find in the car? - Diamonds. He stole weapons from the U.S. military and resold them.
Look this way, here. What is this, lipstick? But, do you play golf? Me, golf? Those professors left them for me when they left.
It seems to be activated by a liquid. What is it? A parasite? That powdery stuff in the tubes you stole are like eggs, but the catalyst is stomach acid. So it's enough for the victim to ingest them?
! - Don't raise your voice. Excuse me. Could you check out the people he had really argued with? Man, you want to stick a name in the suggestion box, go ahead. Grace said someone had put their hands in her stuff at the mansion. - She had destroyed them.
I'm taking these old things to take them to sell. You won't get much out of it, maybe a few dollars worth of food. But every little bit helps. - Who would buy old stuff? - Tommy said he would buy it. He says he will use them for his rental properties.
And the only way to bring them together was your death, and you understood that. That's why you were about to kill yourself when I stopped you. If all I had to do was die, Ben, then why did you stop me? You had critical information that was going to die with you. And after you gave it to me.
That's the way it is, isn't it? I asked you how you know that! You should ask Geum Jan Di, if he still has it. What? Who knows if she dropped it or threw it away, but she certainly lost it today in the mountains.
- Well, he's obviously disguising it. - He's probably using his left hand. - That makes sense. - Or he's using his right, if he's left-handed. - That also makes sense. Or if he's ambidextrous, he probably got drunk and then wrote them down.
No. That's not right. I have to talk to her. I have to change her mind. She made it clear that she doesn't want to talk to you. But if you write her a letter, we'll make sure she gets it.
You can't do that. I think in the months to come you will find that we can do anything we want. What about the laws? We have always been above the law, Adelle. Only now, we also write them.
I think he had already crashed to the ground. Crashed to the ground? Yes, like an accident. Maybe he had a malfunction. I took a picture of it.
You look good, Red. Thank you, Adam. Nice new job by Jake, huh? Fast as the wind. I mean, Cass asked me for it.... And my friend Zach got him a job the next day.
Do you see this? The QR code. So? The conference room table is made of smart glass - and it's smart enough to read it. - What will the code tell it to do?
I am glad you have returned. - He needs you. - No, he's done well. All the people she's helped become free-it's unbelievable. The last time we saw each other we were running away from danger, now she's running towards him.
Less than a day later, his cottage explodes. Liv, you were with me at the hospital the night of the murder. You saw Cyrus. He was wracked with grief. Just because he killed him doesn't mean he's not sorry.
I even have an ice sculpture in the shape of Party Steve's trinket. Didn't they make one small enough to replicate yours? Don't joke, okay? My trinket is gorgeous. If you put a wig on it, it looks like Penelope Cruz.
- Who. The nerd I remembered. Be careful with that one. It's an exact replica of a Barnum Brown find in Hell Creek. I reserved this place for him.
What color is the wall? - White. - And what color would you like it to be? You can make it any color you want, it's your wall, Mary. The wall is here, Mary -- not that way. If you don't focus on what you want, you can't get it, because there is nothing in this world you can't change. If you unleash all your -- willpower against it.
No, no, no! Leave it, I'll do it. I just don't want to destroy it until we know what happened. Yeah, that's... good. Let's put him where no one can see him until we find out what the hell happened to him.
Please tell the court where you are. Is that the truth, madam? Yes, Herr Richter. According to the provisions of the divorce, Mileva Maric, married Einstein, will receive an annual maintenance of nine thousand Deutschmarks. And in addition, Professor Einstein guarantees the entire proceeds from a Nobel Prize should it be awarded to him.
- It is niche news for imbeciles. It's a superb car, because you can have it with the same 500-horsepower engine that you have on the Quadriplegic. And together -- together you get four-wheel drive. So this one works in the wet, right? Hammond, when someone has a child, you go next to them and when they say:
- Tie a knot in it. - What happened in there? - And since when am I supposed to do your job? Leave the report on the desk, Sergeant Flynn. I'll take a look at it.
They make delicious dishes. I love their chicken ramen. It has nice notes of lemon yuzu. I am a big fan of yuzu. I even dedicated an article to it on my blog.
Put me where? Buses are not bad, but I don't like to feel the seat against my back. So I sit like this. How do other people stand it? Maybe their back has hardened from riding on it. In Antarctica, there is a cod with a protein in its blood that keeps it from freezing.
Don't you think he will be happy for you? He devoted a year of his life to me, he... He taught me, gave me structure and purpose. Our work for him, it is not just a job. It is much more, and I am turning my back on him.
That's right. You had to get the hostages out of Tehran. One of my instructors, Diamond Dave, participated in that mission. The plane, which the soldiers were on, landed in the desert to refuel. While on the ground, a Navy helicopter crashed on top of him because of strong winds.
It currently contains an asteroid recovered from the Republic to be exploited for its heavy metals. The problem is that in about 20 hours the capsule will crash, and along with it everything they worked for will be lost. Maybe you meant meteorite, not asteroid. No, meteorites are asteroids that pass through our atmosphere before impacting the earth. But this asteroid is in a protective capsule, which keeps it from igniting during atmospheric passage.
- We were okay. - Then you won't mind showing us your bank statement, so you can show us the payment you paid him. I would, but I didn't pay him back in money, but with information. He came to my office, I had about -- a third of the amount I owed him, and I told him I would have the rest at the end of the month. But he said he wasn't interested.
Can we talk? What happened? This was among the junk found at the beach. What we have here is a human heart. Something took a little bite out of it.
It's easy to sit back and be skeptical without accomplishing anything. Remember that we represent only 4% of the universe, 4% ! - Overall, 4% ! - Abby. We believe in the scientific method, I have dedicated my life to it.
Don't kill him! I have been doing this job for a long time . I cannot tell you whether there is a heaven or a hell or what else is in their place. But one thing I can tell you with certainty, which is that evil exists. You can escape it, you can bury it maybe you can even slow it down but you cannot stop it.
We have to go there and understand what attracts him. When we understand why, we will find a way to deflect him. This plan is so stupid that if he had a face I would smash it. Let me understand. Instead of running away from a deadly asteroid, you want us to go to him?
- Tell Jamie it's a trap. - Where are you going, little mouse? Let me go, you brute! Or I'll tell my godfather you attacked me. Stay here and watch. My favorite says you turned a broomstick into a poisonous snake and commanded him to attack the Count. Almost like the last days of Moses and Pharaoh.
a tune that goes around in your head, you know? It is, if I am not misled, "Two Soldiers," and you -- you know most of it. But if you blow to play -- a note or two, then you should inhale. A more intimate instrument does not exist. You... You give him the most precious gift of a man.
But look at that. I've been looking for you guys for days. God, now you're ... screwed. It shouldn't make you uncomfortable. It's the circle of life, or... something that looks like it.
It is now. Let's see what we have here. The floor to our Honorary Citizen. Well... I feel honored by this gesture that perpetuates my figure, or something that barely resembles it.
When people come and go, you look back. Steve Aoki had a huge impact on what happened. If you can't say that Steve Aoki made EDM great, he certainly was a cornerstone of it. If you are looking for passionate, reckless, irrepressible, tireless men, or whatever you want to call them, then you need Steve Aoki. If he has a wall in front of him, he doesn't stop, he goes around it, or over it, under it, through it.
But I can't do otherwise. And in any case you will continue to work on the case. What the fuck are you talking about? You're assigning me to the Eastern District? As you said, you've been working on it for two years. Your connections will serve them well.
But she could not carry the pregnancy to term. They said her body rejected the fetuses because they were deformed. Now she has to excuse me. I must put this animal out of its misery. What happened to it?
That is Barrington House. In the 1930s the owners donated it to the state. The state turned it into a living history museum. Every elementary school within a 50-mile radius used to come on field trips here. This place has been standing long before the modern world grew up around it.
Where was it, like on his desk? - Yeah, in the middle... - To a bunch of other stuff. Exactly! And it's not like I was sure anything was going to happen to him,
I didn't think we would ever be able to do that. He didn't seem very happy about it. Happiness is not exactly his strong point. In fact, his temperament is one of the factors that kept him from getting ahead in his lab. I assure you that he does not lack intelligence.
Please, professor, eat or it will get cold again.... Someone at the association committee has it in for you. They are questioning your work. But we will show them your inspirations, which illustrate the years of colonial exploitation. - That's the title I gave them.
For now you are number one, but soon I will be number one. For now you are number two, but taken I will be number two. That Brainiac is a jerk. See how Superman threw that thing? He gave it an incredible spin!
What is it. That's the second volume. You wrote another book about me and Sherlock? Wait, before you rip my head off.... I already told the publisher he can't have it, it's yours. The other day when you came to my house, I was putting the finishing touches on it.
Hello, Sheldon. How are you doing? Good news! You're an asteroid! Please tell me what to say. Let me explain. Working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.
Who could have known? - Me. I knew it when... I knew it when -- you said a dollar to that valet. I can't sleep with the fan off. Ever since I was a kid. I had even given him a name.
Tell me how it went. There was little light. And in the darkness I saw an Adonis. He looked at me, I looked at him. I licked his nipple, and I liked it....
Because nothing would grow in Wayward Pines. Why, Kerry? What's wrong with the land here? Why didn't Pilcher take it into consideration? What have we done to him?
"It's a strange feeling, this double consciousness, the feeling of... "to always look at oneself through the eyes of others, "to measure one's soul by the yardstick of a world "that looks on with amused contempt and pity. "One always perceives one's own dualism.... "One American, one Negro. "Two souls, two thoughts, "two unreconciled aspirations, "two conflicting ideals in one dark body, whose only stubborn strength keeps it from being torn apart."
Stop him! Stephan, let me go. No! No one admits to helping them, but I saw them sneaking food and supplies into the barn. Once we have him surrounded, we will set him on fire.
Or do you want it for yourself? I am thinking of an order for it to be destroyed. Your Honor, Mr. Dolan relinquished parental responsibility when... Regarding the child. We are talking about an embryo is my genetic material, so I should have the right to decide what will happen to it.
This ring belonged to my mother. I always found it strange that she kept it. He never struck me as the sentimental type. And apparently, he isn't. He was holding onto it in case he needed it.
The temple is near. Wait here. - You stole that sacred manuscript. - I didn't. Jian took a peek at it one day, that's all.
I just want to prevent you from an infection. You'll be better by tomorrow. - Hey, that wolf is ours. - I don't think you think so. What did you give him?
It will become a juice store. Cool, huh? Yes, it's a wonder to watch you destroy everything I've raised. It's too late to reconsider. I just got back from the bank, deposited the check. I took a picture of it first, though, so I can hang it on the wall.
Take him away and let him wait for our verdict. The closing argument could have gone better. - We have to go to him. - He did not want our help. That doesn't mean he doesn't need it now.
All right, I give up. Favorite baseball team? That's the one with the hoop and the stretchers that bounce the ball, right? Courtship ring. I just found out there's a long mating ritual here -- where, if you like somebody, you put a ring on them.
Go, go, go, go! This way! Bridge. Let's remove the pivots. It will collapse under his feet.
Yes, and as such, it can be updated with new software or hacked. It can do whatever the hacker wants. Like accelerate instead of brake? Yes, in this case, yes. Someone bybassed the module that controls the accelerator wirelessly. He told it to accelerate.
I saw it. We were all in a warehouse. The address is: 22... 23, Seventh Street. He made me memorize it so that I could go back there, because I had to bring him something. It was important, and he needed it.
It is an opportunity to learn a lot about our planet and perhaps save it. I'm sure you will agree though. Wait, what is this? Victor Von Doom is here. He started the project, devoted ten years to it.
You don't believe me? I'm going to unearth Callum and look what I did to him. Now, let's try again. When Katherine was a little girl, I gave him a rabbit. She fed it every day, played with it.
I like that. So we do it every other day, so I replenish the supply? No, no, no "every other day." No, we'll wait for my ovarian peak and then-boom! My uterus won't know what's happening to it.
I've had enough of hearing about these sleazy creatures. It's chilling. The rats agree. Then he says to me. "Arthur, I don't understand what's wrong with my windshield -- no matter how much I clean it, it's always fogged up." I reply, "Don't worry about the windshield.
Fortunately, I know the recipe. You take hydrogen, add oxygen and burn them. Fortunately, I have hundreds of gallons of unused hydrazine on the MDV. By passing the hydrazine over a Crabtree catalyst I will extract nitrogen and hydrogen. At that point, I will direct the hydrogen into a confined space and set it on fire.
He was in the Serengeti on safari ... and had just returned to his tent when a hippo ... wandered into camp. Wow. - Was he attacked by a hippo? - No. No, I guess...the hippo had been attacking...when the guide picked up his rifle and shot at him, but...he took bad aim...and...
- Quickly, quickly! - Please, leave me! Needless to say, Marta Ochoa was released without a hair being harmed. But the killings did not cease. Pablo had tasted blood-and liked it.
Yes, well, she is fine. We ordered a cookbook that we saw on TV. Now every night she cooks a delicacy from who knows where. Some people like to, uh, vary a little. Last night she made a souffl√©. She served it in a casserole dish.... And at the end she set it on fire with a match.
He is hiding something big! He won't look me in the eye and told me he would rather walk around with open wounds than heal. - My God, I'm sure it's nothing. - I wouldn't be so sure! Today he took a tampon from the ladies' room, saying he needed it for things!
What is he struggling with, Will? You asked about the dog. Last night a veterinarian called the police. Leeds and his oldest son brought him the dog the afternoon before they were killed. What will happen to them now?
This is the money needed to rebuild the center, right? I wrote a check this morning for that and for... your recruitment bonus. - So you want to help the Nation of Islam? - No, never. But it's your money, do what you want with it. If I were you, I would ... rebuild the center, put a studio in it and give it my name. So that would protect my legacy.
- Those were nothing. - Just an owl. We were afraid to go up there at night, and maybe that was why we went up there so often. You know what they say about the carriage ghost? Anyone who looks at him will be cursed and die a horrible death.
It won't happen again. Thank you, detective. IA told me if I stay within 100 feet of that guy, I'll get suspended. What makes a man like Mr. Weiss become a killer? Guys like that, who live miserable lives, ... respond to a particular ad on Craigslist... and find they like it.
No, but she is an unverified resource. Ergo, it is up to us to verify her. Gentlemen. Good Lord, what the hell is this place? We haven't found a name for it yet since Congress shows reluctance in allocating funds to the Secret Service.
And you know what? I have no choice, because it's important for my children. Yeah, what about your needs? Parents don't have needs! Have you ever read "The Tree?" It's about a tree and a child who all his life takes everything away from him, until all that's left is a stump.
We found him in his little love nest under Nicole's house. I don't know what she's talking about. The lighter is mine, I admit. It was a gift from my father, but I quit smoking years ago. - So he found a new use for it.
Okay, let's start with the driver. Okay. - Let's start with him. - The accident was all his fault. He didn't even apologize, and when I asked him about the insurance ... he got nervous and wouldn't look me in the eye.
It's possible. I don't remember having a teddy bear like that. I don't remember anything from before my father abandoned me at Ed Clark's. Why would I start remembering these things...? Now? It could be because you plug your brain into a quantum computer and have it process enough energy to light up a small town....
Howell, I thought you had that you are not sure. Of course I am. But I need a better picture. Look, about the device that is capable of altering grades. Howell, he took a look at it.
to have a good time? This thing is really big. I'd take you all to bed. She's crazy! And then I'd drug you, roll you up in a comforter.... And I'd set it on fire.
- Why? I like to do things myself. Taco, masturbating is one of them. Yeah, well, I've been having a hard time lately. If I spend all day drawing a picture, it kind of takes the surprise out of it.
- In case you haven't noticed, I am doing well. I'm helping Merida. And when she has used the fatuous fire, - it will be my turn. - The fatuous fire is not a game you can lend. He can't just give it to you. The person who whispers to him ... Becomes its owner, forever.
Good night, Fitz. How long are the nights on this planet? Sooner or later the sun has to rise. Where is the sun? What have you done to it?
Mommy! Mommy! Jill! Miles, what's going on? I was slipping on a rainbow, but then Dora The Explorer set it on fire and repeated, "Can you pronounce 'climate change'?"
You wanted their attention, And I gave it to you. Why? Why are you doing this? When the end of her life approaches, the phoenix will build a nest for her pyre, set fire to it, and be consumed by the flames.
Vedreeeeeeeeeeemo... Straight... To the infeeeeeeeeeerno! Your series... It helped me forget what happened to my village. I set it on fire.
You... You thought you were going to get married. It was mom -- right? Can I know what you think about a pepper mill from the restaurant? - What? - I took a picture of it.
Black rage. Oh Jesus. ISIS, oh my God. This chicken tastes like shit. What have you done to him?
Hey, ladies, up here, I'm going down the stairs. Tell me if there is anything in front of me. 100% vision here, but this other side is very uncertain. Does your eye still hurt? Let me take a look at it.
What? Fuck no. I'm not aborting my baby. - Our baby. - That I carry in my womb. For us, so we have the final say in what happens to him.
- Because you are. - Am I? A child being a doctor, Becca? A kid being a doctor with a BMW 7 Series and a credit rating around 500? He almost got fired because during a hip surgery he took his sunglasses, put them on the patient's testicles and took a picture of him.
You too. I like the jacket. What? This old rag? Come on. I only wear it because I don't care if something happens to it.
Well, and what did you get him? I bought him a shirt and a tie. He's a securities trader. I have no idea what it is, but he has to wear a suit all the time. I think he will like it.
He was ... the most beautiful tree in the forest. He had the strongest wood. You could do anything with it. It was the World Tree in Norse mythology. No fault could be found with it.
He came to desecrate a way of life, to trample on our values and even our freedom.... And in this, he not only failed, but he gave us ... the greatest gift: the chance to be reborn. We will rise again, regenerated -- stronger and more united. This is our moment, our chance, to be able to prove our worth to all, to be able to set those examples of dignity, integrity and honor that have forged this country and will give it back...new life.
If you eat the heart. Now, I know it's crazy. I understand it now. - But at that time... - At that time it was the word of God, and I believed it completely.
Tell Dewain I want to see him, (bleep)! Really? All right. Okay, thank you. The coroner's report confirms that Rick Dawson died of a contusion to the head. Ann must have dumped the body, then set him on fire.
God loves you, for your virtues and for your sins. That's the Corbett whistle. Lor. Look at you. A coat of paint would freshen it up.
That's the Corbett whistle. Lor. Look at you. A coat of paint would freshen him up. He'd need a match to put him out of his misery.
Those in 51 have one. - Besides, it would really upset Mouch. - No way. Peter Mills, where's that dog? Um, I found him a home.
Do not lock me up, nor take away my throne, - you would advise me? - Edward, the council thinks that... No, it is not the council that thinks! The council thinks nothing but what you tell it, and you will turn it against me!
He's right. We have gone -- way too far. Mom, you people, out. Right now, let's move. This was your olive branch -- and you set it on fire.
Because the best trades happen in the short. Yeah, that's right. Taken. It was as simple as that. - I just gave him the number.
I thought I read in the report that the attacker also took your husband's phone. Yes, well, as I told you, Wallace is a hoarder. He's never thrown anything away. That's his old phone. A few weeks before he died, someone ... bumped into him on the street and spilled coffee on him.
Okay, I'm helping a friend chase a dream. More like an illusion. And if you were his friend you'd help him open a bowling alley or something safe. Not something that defies the laws of gravity. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you the first one to help him buy a helicopter? Yes, under duress, first, and second, I didn't think any state or any federal agency would ever give him a license to fly.
Hey! Who the fuck are you? Where did you get that phone? From a guy named Zip. He said he didn't need it anymore.
A couple of years ago, a new EP came to News Night and the program... Man... - Your wife is... - Linda is my ex-wife. The program took a turn and what? David posted things on the Internet that he didn't like.
He said he had killed people. I used to believe that. Some--some people thought it was bad luck, especially Lee. Lee Bysack. Alex had a rat and... Lee didn't like the way it talked to him, he found it creepy.
- Such as. Gasoline, Sterno, butane, etc. Whatever required the arsonist's particular appetite. So you think it's arson? Oh, yes. Someone doused the stage and set it on fire.
Chad, cheating is bad, but incest, that's sick! Please don't let him tell mom about our secret pastime. Secret pastime? Did you even give it a name?
Maybe he will buy a hotel in a couple of weeks. - Not with dogs. - That's to get him started. As soon as he has the money, he'll buy some stuff and that's it. He'll get caught right away. Tell him to buy a new toothbrush, he'll need it.
- Uh,I'll take it. - How do you know? I decided. Charlie has no place to put it. And he doesn't like it anyway.
- Six. - Check banks in the same cities, looking for withdrawals. Not deposits. Withdrawals. Same amounts from other bank accounts, around the same days. The money was not stolen. It had been given to him.
- Oh, it's anything but simple. I agree. I didn't understand. So, your immune system is built to defend you against bacteria, viruses and that sort of thing. But if something comes in that looks like your own tissue. In this case, the nerve tissue of pigs.... Your body doesn't know the difference and starts attacking-even everything around it.
Either way, if that's not Ryan's body, we have a new victim. And a new suspect. Ryan needed a fresh corpse to finish the job. So if he was desperate enough, he would have been willing to kill someone. He cut himself to leave blood, left a document on the corpse. He set it on fire to hide who the victim really was.
You are making fun of me. You're all crazy, I'm going to start. Well, then I'll go with you. Can we talk now? It's like he took our future together into the woods and shot him between the eyes.
It looked so real -- holding the crystal there in the hallway. And he was looking for your mother. - Did you see... - No. But my mother was talking to her like she was there. The spell showed me not only the location of the crystal -- but everything that was happening around it.
So, the lab is down on the third floor and the technician will take a DNA sample from you with a swab. No need, I brought one with me. This is a piece of my columella. It's that... thin segment of cartilage that separates the nostrils. Yesterday my surgeon sculpted it and left me this as a memento.
You're welcome. Have a great night! Excuse me, Lily. So. do you guys know how to find this wolf or not? What do you think you're going to do to him?
That was a really good one! We already know what's in that file! No evidence that Hagan drugged his wife, a few bruises on Nora's arms, but not enough to support the claim that they fought. - Nothing useful! - Then there's nothing wrong - if we take another look at it.
- By the way. Bad idea, grandpa. Bad idea. I loved that vehicle. - That vehicle was a piece of crap. - Is that why you set it on fire?
But is it possible that you, who put the crown on this ungrateful man's head, should be scoffed at, abandoned and turned away? Say no more. I will now set you privy to a hitherto well-kept secret. And for your bold remonstrances, I will tell you deep and dangerous things. Send danger from east to west, so honor will go to them from north to south, and let them fight!
That's already progress, isn't it? And I noticed that there was a sticky stuff down here in the front. At first, I had no idea what it was. But then I remembered that months ago you asked me to replace the fender, when you had put that deer underneath, do you remember that? We gave it a good steam coat and it was as good as new.
And from the books. - I always say if it weren't for books. - Forget the books! If you are interested in studying, study what is in the course of study.... Those who have moved away from this country have not done it a good service.
Said the professional privacy invader. I'm here to work with you. I thought you would have figured that out by now. Weren't you the one who said we should get to know each other better? That's how it works between tutor and mentor, right? Do you do that about the violin thing yesterday? Because you made it clear when you set it on fire!
My blood tells my story. I thank everyone I love. I hope to meet you again in heaven. God willing. A very big tree ... And another smaller one -- growing beside it.
Say it. The liquor... - is the king. - No, not the king. He is God. You give him your life.
It will destroy everything. - You don't know what you're talking about. - It's the end of the ranch, Elena! You have oil in your veins! When did you turn your back on it?
The book. "White Fang." This guy -- he becomes friends with a wild creature. But he has to let the animal go free, because it's the best thing for him. I know the plot of White Fang. But the animal doesn't want to leave. So, heartbroken, he throws stones at it until it runs away.
They destroyed this place to look for him. How did they know to come here? Pushkov could have installed a beacon that works when you turn it on. Anyone who had the access code could physically follow him. And they are willing to kill anyone who comes near him.
Did something happen? Yes, that is -- other than Lee Bang came here, there is no other news. Lee Bang came here? It's probably because of that matter. Those bastards are useless. They can't even chew the food I put in their mouths.
I tell you we sent them out. You were on the list. - And I got it, the invitation. - Yeah? Yes, and I gave it so little thought, I didn't even bother to respond.
Yeah, guys in turbans getting into a van and stuff like that. Saul, Bogdan is Romanian. Okay, well, we're trying them all here, so.... All right, there's always... "Really nice place this. It would be a shame if something happened to it."
Crazy days and even crazier nights! Tea? Holy shit. That's my lunch. I wondered what happened to it.
No, it's cool. Look, I know you're different -- so am I, Tyler. I know you think you're helping your dad, but for real you're making him sick. His body can't handle what you're giving him.
- No, listen, okay, okay, okay, listen. All right. I -- I've never been in love. It's never happened. But I guess if it had happened to me, I wouldn't have hidden it and said I wasn't really. That's ridiculous. I would have headed for love and just grabbed his boobs, squeezing them.
Maybe they went to get the money, I don't know. - It was my only chance to escape. - Basically, you compromised the mission. But you still have the passports. Yes, but as soon as Chupino's henchmen set foot in the store and see that you set them on fire, they're going to start getting scared.
Well, it was necessary, wasn't it? - Haven't you changed yet? - I had to mend the veil. What? What did you do to it?
- Haven't you changed yet? - I had to mend the veil. What? What did you do to him? I didn't do anything to him.
It's only those stupid humans who shed emotional tears. And elephants. No fucking way elephants cry. When one of the herd dies, they travel hundreds of miles to see its body. They huddle around it and shed real tears.
What's the sex like? I know. It sucks, doesn't it? I would call it more "nonexistent." Denis hasn't had a hard-on for almost a year.
What the fuck. Why didn't you say anything? - But it's not... It's not cancerous, is it? - I'm afraid so. I found out the other night when I was sucking him off. We went to the emergency room and the doctor took a look at it, and he said it was nothing, but I don't know.
But the planet has a protective shield -- like a sheet of Plexiglas.... that protects the globe from shots fired from the gun. It's called the magnetosphere, a huge magnetic field generated by the movement of the planet's core. It extends for about 70,000 kilometers. Just as one ring magnet repels another--the Earth's magnetosphere repels magnetized plasma from the Sun. A billion tons of electrically charged glowing plasma hits our planet. And normally it only revolves around it.
- Sally! Oh, my God! - Oh, it's really working! - You're really good at that. - Oh, my God, he likes it!
Or poured kerosene on a parakeet to see if it would fly faster to get rid of the flames? Of course it wouldn't. Well, I did. I did all that and more. The parakeet was my little sister's, and my mother caught me setting it on fire.
Instead she bought me a beautiful kitten. She made me completely responsible for him. I had to feed him, worm him, pay the vet bills, and all that stuff. She thought it would teach me the value of life over death, and that's how I saw it. Bella, that kitten was the whole world to me, and I looked after him like he was my baby.
- For its entire life... - since he was...a meteorite fragment. a million billion years ago.... How the fuck did it get here? up there in space...it was waiting... to come here -- right -- right here. I've been coming to him all my life.
- Because of him. - How dare he talk to me like that? He doesn't know what went wrong in the operating room. Here's what I know. I know you're new here, I know you're probably holding a grudge because you had a better parking space at Mercy West, and I know you're an anesthesiologist, which means you make a lot of money sitting on your backside for hours, flipping through architecture magazines, while someone else on the other side of the partition is doing the real work and they're getting sued.
Is he there? - No, he left a while ago. - Hey, did he forget his cell phone? - He left it here on purpose. - He said he didn't need it anymore.
They were on the apparatus used to beat Mr. Wolf to death. Are you talking about the rotary evaporator? My fingerprints are on it because it's mine. I lent it to him the day before yesterday. He told me he needed it to do something special.
- What? What are you talking about? To resist Lucifer you'll need more than you've ever had. - But-why? - It strengthens the container. - It keeps it from exploding.
I was painting the shutters to try to stop the moisture. Milk? - No. - Be careful--the other night there was a big rat in our coal house. I smacked it in the head with the shovel and threw it into the Jew's.
Okay. It goes to plan B. This is all wrong, isn't it? Your father getting married, living his good life alone. You ran away from your past, but you never turned your back on it.
He was injured, perhaps dying. He was having difficulty breathing. There was a high cliff behind me. And I had the impression that the animal had fallen from above. And I was standing over him, with a big stick.
Amy is sassy. She knows what she wants, and she does not take the Doctor's words at face value. She has her own opinions and does not listen to everything he says; she questions and challenges him all the time. That is the beauty of their relationship. It is quite stormy because Amy has a strong will and is not afraid to slap the Doctor when he needs it.
I will send the bill to the police. - Get lost. - Fin just found the real van. - Is the baby in there? - I hope not. Let me guess, no one saw who set it on fire.
Mom, I told you, I'm out of it, tomorrow morning I'm going to pack my bags and go find a college to go to, and I'm going to get a job so I can pay for my studies. What are you talking about? What college, Dartmouth? I don't know mom, but I certainly won't tell you. I'm tired of running from my future, it's time for me to run to it, no matter how far away it is.
Thank you. Candy cane? No, thank you. Listen, there's a serious problem with your peace-on-Earth crystal. The containment lab shrinks around it.
And these moons... heated by tidal force the inner part of the planet, and kept it molten... allowing, thus, the generation of currents and, consequently... the formation of a magnetic field. Now, if half a billion years after the formation of Mars these moons had crashed into the planet--this could have nullified its magnetic field. For many scientists, the evidence on the impact theory is not consistent. Is it possible for satellites large enough to cause such damage...to lose enough inertial energy to be captured by the planet to begin with? This theory that Mars had moons that crashed into it within the first half billion years--it's pretty unlikely. But it's not completely impossible.
Yes, I foolishly thought that if I found a way to time travel, things would get better, a utopia would emerge, but here we are, after more than a century, things, in fact, have only gotten worse. The gap between rich and poor, hunger and famine, war, violence and hatred, are rampant out of control. Men have found new ways to kill each other that were unimaginable in my time, even by fiction writers. But millions of us, fight against these things, every day. This planet needs a break, from what you have done to it.
It's tough. It's hard the life of the stick. What about that tree? Trees, dangerous trees? I'm afraid of scorpions and spiders and whatnot. A fucking tree with swords coming out of it.
Until he finds his next victim. - Law and Order S.V.U. - Did the captain say how long we're going to be here? - No. He's at the old precinct, cleaning it up.
Sir, my team and I will visit the country so that we can make an assessment and understand what is needed. It would be an honor if you would join me so that our project can be a joint effort. One shared purpose. Thank you for the invitation, General. You are very generous.
Perhaps she had identified him as a possible target? - And wrote down his address. - About his parents? She was my girlfriend, we used to go there when my parents were away. But whoever gave him her parents' address on May 7, the day before he disappeared-she was there, in North London.
- But he used the word "robust." - Yes. - In fact, he was very specific. He said, "About six feet, ninety pounds." I ask the prosecution to note that Mr. Kim is 5'7" with shoes on and weighs sixty-six pounds tops. - I put that on the record. - And it's critical... Every detail, because, as you said.
- It's semen. - Semen? And how did his semen get there at the scene? Well, I think we all know how semen -- gets out. This isn't the first crime scene that you've contaminated, is it?
It didn't matter to me or Evelyn. Was there anything else about the wedding that Andrea didn't like, before, during, or after? Yes. Evelyn's will. You inherited something when Evelyn died, even though you had only been married for two years.
Thank you. - Have you always been the night manager? - That's my profession, yes. - Did you choose it? - I think she chose me.
I'm like, "Who are you, Kelly Dhundee?" Is your last name Dundee? No, with an "H." Dhundee. Like Crocodile Dundee? Her name is "Dhundee." That's different.
Are you proud of all this? Are you going to defend this? Alex, you were so busy with Quantico, seeking redemption for killing your father that you didn't notice how I made you a scapegoat. And you are a formidable scapegoat, Alex because you have faith in this country even though everyone thought you were a terrorist. You still love America and you think she loves you, but she doesn't.
How does Bachmanity get so bad? Look at the crap that Big Head is selling. He was renting everything in the house. Did he rent that cannon? It was only for decorative purposes, so she lost her down payment.
- Even from a Protestant woman. That's right, it's significant that he supports her, given his hatred of all women. What's his problem? Women disgust him. I never knew his mother, but in my opinion it all started with her.
Get out of my life! Now go away! - GRANT] Please open the door. - Sorry. - Sorry about the noise. - At least she doesn't bark.
Copy. Break into the building. There is no reason to kill the child. To Tamiya, that child is just a specimen for her experiments! She does not have a heart like us!
How do you explain that forensics found four cigarette butts next to Danny's body with his DNA on them? I smoked a lot of cigarettes on that beach. And why did you take the skateboard? I thought it might be stolen. But it was stolen, wasn't it? By her!
He said she attacked him. Maybe I should call my lawyer first. Ma'am, I know who you are. And you also know that if you force me to come back with a warrant, it's likely -- the case will end up in the papers. I'm sure you're used to that, but ... if I were you I would think twice.
Will you do it? - No, I will never do that. - Nothing can change my mind. I have to write down this man's address. You will be among the first roundup.
Then I went back home to Katrina. She must be pregnant. I'm sure it must be very difficult. I saw a book. It resembles your description of Grimoire, and I think she....
- What ? - Sid, it's not Delgado. - He wrote the same... - It's not him. - And you know who it is ?
How can one survive in this wasteland? Yet some people succeed. Millions of years have taught them the necessary tricks. A desert viper rolls up to take control over the loose sand. Food is hard to come by, so the viper hides and waits for him to come to her.
I am convinced of that. I think I have worn out the tape. I watch it every day after breakfast. It is the only little film I have of him. She was not yet in the police force.
To ensure anonymity, I would appreciate it if you could PC type your answers. Can I use letters cut out of magazines? I do it as fast as writing on the PC. - No. - If we used a cat's point of view? - Even if written on the PC, when you read Fausta's, from the language, you'll know it was her.
Maybe I'm not just a monkey giving opinions about sports, and maybe I'll leave until the show becomes something that morally and ethically resembles me. I'll put my books away now. - Where's the violin? - Okay, man, I hear you. She's sweet and pretty and you want to impress.
No way, Max. This is our sanctuary. Have some teddy bears. Shall we move a dead man's shrine again? Wait till I light a candle for my dignity, because she died here too.
He acted like a person. But the world didn't need a person to protect it, it needed a machine. You took his memories. Not just the memories. Every night at midnight, she erases ... not only irrelevant data, but erases herself.
That's the only line that really matters to me. The length of your life is totally irrelevant, it's how you employ your time, that's what matters. Ah. All right. Well, let's hear it. What is my fate? She can read your fate, but not your destiny.
It was hidden, but it's a kid, right? Okay, Connor, we need to ask you some questions. Connor, let's go. - What was she doing in the closet? - What does it look like to you? I'm packing.
With a contract, you mean? Yes. Well, in many situations a contract is not a bad idea. What would you say, that I have no right to be involved in the child's life? - You can say anything you want to say.
So we can bond a little. Where has your southern accent gone? Sometimes-I like not having a Southern accent. Really? But ... it's so much a part of her, it's her trademark.
Percy ... you are ... dust... and food... For the worms, valiant Percy. Farewell, fearless heart. Ill-woven ambition, how you have shrunk! When this body enclosed a soul, a realm was too narrow a boundary for her, and now two steps into the vilest earth... are room enough for her.
It ruined his Christmas Eve. But it's our job--to make him understand--make him understand his situation. And she thinks she understands me? Well, she's not the first impressionable young girl to get stuck with... a very dangerous man. He flaunted his pageantry in front of her promising you the world and she believed him. But I guess now she has changed her mind, hasn't she?
I don't understand. There was also a note--for the cloth salesman. From Jocelin. She thanks him for his kindness. This gift seems an excessive reward for such a small gesture.... She goes like this.
It would be a very original contribution... [Information from some exhibition,] [an article read in passing, documentaries,] [all overflowing into my frontal lobes,] [mingling into a sizzling cocktail] [of very useful information.] [She had no escape.] What do you recommend? [We had really worked on the essay, too.] [In 45 minutes, a little gem had come.] [She was very satisfied.]
My family is impossible. So is the company. I apologize for my mother's behavior. I am used to it. She has nothing to do with it. My mother still holds a grudge against Henrik.
You don't understand, you don't know Adriana well. Look at the movement, the drawing represents her perfectly. You're wrong. Look at what she's done! Full of sexual innuendo, so carnal it's on fire. Yes, she is beautiful, but ... she has a subtle beauty that implies sensuality.
What is your first impression of Adriana? She's very charming. Beautiful, but delicate. You see Pablo? You are right Miss Stein, but I can see why you lost objectivity.
They have not yet seen my evidence. Be that as it may, I will fight this and I will fight her. I would expect nothing less. Your days in Chicago are numbered, Teresa. In any case, they're always more than you have left.
I told you! I'm on a secret mission for the president. Well, maybe if you could have the president confirm that for us, sir, that would be good. I sent him a message. Hello, I think you are Mr. Gardner, right?
- Lamb was the most popular. - Yeah. My dream is to turn this place into more than just a club. - Hello. - Hello to you, the usual right?
What kind of a name is Asher? Actually, Dylan and Asher are still... I like that you have a job, in my mall. What time do you finish your shift? Since it's your mall, sir, I would say, whenever you want.
Would you mind telling me your name, sir? You are the Amazing Mysterium, you tell me. Okay. I will. Oh, this is Richard Hollis, 604 Kirkside Drive, Cuesta Verde, California.
- But I'm stuck in the city. - Yeah, but what if he had a girlfriend? - Well, that would be tolerable. Do you see that? The problem isn't that you're stuck in town as much as it is that you're losing your girlfriend.
Sounds like bullshit to me. Billie Dean knows his stuff. She studies this stuff. The sturdier one, he wears a ring. Some kind of wedding ring, but I don't remember in which hand. I don't trust her!
She has it. She thinks, "Okay, I told him I want a pair of earrings, he's going to give it to me." Think positive about it. The problem with positive thinking is that if it doesn't come to fruition it becomes negative. And it is almost never realized, so she is almost always pissed off.
And was it just a platonic relationship? Well, no. But it's not what you think. Ours was a deep connection. Did you feel that way too?
What about transportation? That's going to be fun. We're taking care of that. Listen to me... If you try to move it -- it will end up dying, or you will die.
I thought I saw someone down here. - Are you in charge here? ! - I'm the janitor. Tell me what that truck is doing here. What do you think? I was forced to hire a gardener.
I lied to you. About what? That name--it wasn't--for one of the secretaries. It was for Frankie. Of course it was for her.
Praying for the prisoners. There must be a trail here. There must be a way to find out about these bastards. This program is constantly changing, evolving. And you are going to help us with that.
When she was 15 years old ... Amen Since then, almost every year she has had surgery. One year she had four. And they gave her this drug for pain ... but she has now become addicted to this drug.
Why ? I knew it would end badly what did you mean ? It's not his fault ! He fell asleep at the wheel YES but ... the charred body in the car, isn't it Emile Laullet's who do you think?
You are so small. Do you know how much I want you to stay with me? Please stay. Madeline, you can't bring a baby back to life. This is grace.
Is that all? Forensics recovered a charred body -- matching the description, the east body. - That's her. - Yeah. It's either her or the last customer.
- Can you stay with the girls ? - I'll go and get dressed. - Thank you. I sent investigators to Clove Lake Park in the afternoon. Jessamin Hunsecker's body was where she said it was. - A single blow to the head.
Please leave me alone! - We should keep our wits about us. - I need a beer. Just one. Make sure going in there she doesn't smell your breath. Make sure she doesn't smell you.
"Feel those muscles in your arms?" Not only did I do nothing wrong, my treatment was so successful that it will be reported in psychiatry textbooks. Did you follow the guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association? By the book. To you the witness. Dr. Farrar, when Selette Garner first came to you, did she tell you she could treat her husband?
- Right, okay. I think we got what we were looking for from this intervention, right? - So, good work. - Right, right? Did you do that?
Because of the death of the engineers, I was able to get some data. - They might help you with your work. - You work at the Pentagon, right? Neox has a defense project. I thought you would know something about it.
Laurel and Hardy finally found me. It took you guys a while. Do you have any idea -- how much this carpet cost? It's her, right? It's all about her.
I don't know if anyone is seriously convinced that they should die. What about the Lake Mungo image? What explanation do you think Alice gave herself? What explanation did she give herself? I think Allie saw a ghost but didn't know it was her.
Yes. A few years earlier, when we reached the peak of our smuggling, she simply appeared. And we think that one of these days she will simply disappear. Look at the tattoo on the back of her neck. It is an ink-written part of personal information about her.
Logical. Ah, I didn't know they kept inmates there. By the way, I don't have access. - How can you have access to the restricted area? Plus, in a serious country, you shouldn't even know where the restricted area is.
Don't tell me you still live alone, huh? Hey, you even have a son! He's your spitting image. But...is your wife a Negro? Well, that shows you're a broad-minded guy. I mean she's a different color but you're a nice couple anyway, aren't you?
I wanted to know how she was feeling. It's all right. Would you like to have a drink with me? Thank you. I don't know what it is exactly, but if I were you, I'd take it easy....
Jack Hilton's orchestra! buttons and with the super sponsor! - What are these things? - This - to interrupt the broadcast that goes on a 7-second delay. If someone is too vulgar she presses the button and cuts them off.
Sure. - I do. Huh? - Okay. - Well, you are... in the perfect position. - She? - Is she a child?
I've seen some really amazing things. But really! I'm serious. Even ... the omelet tube. I think if you were to sell your inventions-you know!
Come on Howard, I was only kidding! Good night. - Oh my goodness! This report defies any law of nature. - No, you are wrong.
- Good evening. - I'm not sure about... We've been expecting you, Colonel. Would you like to give me your coat? - Are you Colonel Mustard?
Only staff are allowed access here. I have read your book. Not all of it, actually. I'm on my way out. She argues that aging is a treatable disease.
I have to think about it, I don't know. But for the apartment, do you agree? For the keys, who should I talk to? With the gardener 0 with his wife. And she who does the cleaning.
I close the shutter and of course she doesn't answer the phone. Unless she's the one who calls me. Yeah, but how will she know it's me? Well, we could arrange it like this: She dials the number, lets it ring once and hangs up;
No. Not at all. They didn't notice it ... It could mean that it was there ... like it wasn't, right? Sorry, but ... who cares? If the dog was with her he should have found the body.
Where did this animal come from? Oh, no. It's pretty. What a lovely creature. Then she too will be welcome in our house.
4 p.m., Mr. Oswald? I just dropped by for a moment to see you. In private. This is not a private place, this. It is your office and you know it.
When I saw it, all those coincidences seemed too many. I was afraid, afraid to talk about it. So I went to the only place where those who are afraid go. Have a seat, Mr. Morlar. Your name is Morlar, isn't it?
I don't want to be the best lover! They are coming! Jenny, this is Shek Wu. They say the Great Wall was named after him. This is my sister, Jenny!
Drink. Mr. Borowiecki, the oath is a serious matter. Swear to me before this picture. I know, that it is a sanctity to you. You will swear that it is not.
If you want to ask me questions about psychiatry, I will answer them. - No, it doesn't matter. - Okay. The girl is there, you've had a few drinks, and she's leaning her feet against the fireplace. Yes, what is it? There's a real psychiatrist here for you.
- Her third mistake was Bessie. - And she was inside Bessie! So there is a connection between the ray and this organism? Yes, I think that ray is the method she used to come here. Well, now she has come and she is hostile and she is still here, so what do we do and how do we find her? We're not going to find it. If we wait around long enough, she will find us.
The painting is yours. Don't get ripped off when you sell it. How are you going to do that? I'll make do. - You can make do with some marksmanship.
- He finds me funny! - Oh, he is. Enough! Here's a glass cutter to break it, A piece of mastic to keep the cut glass from falling--and wake the fierce Doberman Pinscher she suspects is inside.
That was not the question. You stole it in my room. Give it back to me, please. I stole it. Why should I feel like giving it back to you? It is of no value to you and belonged to my mother.
Not even children do that anymore! Let the American give me Nails or I'll take him away! Give me that rifle and get out of my way! And who finds my daughter? She speaks well because she's not his!
Well... Can't you tell? Well, people gather on the river bank, the pastor and I enter the water. Then he explained to me what baptism is You know, for us baptism symbolizes killing sin and resurrection to a new life filled with faith, hope, dignity... and... Ah, then he took me to the deepest part of the river and immersed me in the water.
Excuse me. Hey-where are you going? The party starts soon, where do you want to go? It was all a joke. But didn't you hear earlier? I can't think that you are so spiritless.
Sooner or later you will do what I did. All right. What is the prize of the Apollo? Sure, I could tell you. You will get out of the business soon.
We were saying, throw the bomb, but like this, academically. Because he said you need the warrant of arrest. This document has expired. Because my dad is dead, I live with 2 aunts. If you tell me it's expired, I'll get it renewed.
It's simple. But if you inject even one of these, Winkler, Hoesch or Rothe, into the blood of a healthy individual, he will not remain healthy. He will croak like a dog. Also, when I took a monocle from her drawer.... - Say, does it belong to you?
- I used to believe that. But after the attack I suffered in his office, I'm not sure anymore. That was because of that scent I smelled before I was hit. It made me doubt that it was her. And now, I really believe it was her.
Yes, you had nothing to say about it all day. Why don't you care what's going on in our country? What did you say? Do you think I don't care about this country? I love this country, even though sometimes, he didn't love me.
And I saw the open sky and the white horse and the one who rode him was called Faithful and True He judges and fights with justice The 'LORD is my shepherd, nothing will fail me He is my savior and my protector He does not see, is he blind with all that sight?
You are ... a righteous and devoted man, Judge Hathorne. I am, yes. - And you don't decide when you find love. - And we have found it. Or maybe he found us.
- Yeah. I can't blame you, it's a beauty. Deadly, but still a beauty. Yes, sir. Take care of your rifle and it will take care of you.
Please help us. Dr. Strand? - Do something doctor. - Yes doctor, do something. Maybe we have to leave it to nature. And if the baby is breech, both he and the mother will die.
Caspar is famous for changing hotels if there is a carpet he doesn't like. What are you working on? I'm redesigning a perfect Limehouse apartment. A useless job. I mean, I mean, you cure a dog, he gets better.
So where are we? I'm not sure, something must have gone wrong. Gone wrong? Gone wrong! You don't know how to use a magic bean? You have to think of the place where you wish to go, and it takes you there.
- He did it! - Go! Let's see how Level 3 Felipe Camargo finishes. He is on the first pole and seems to have some problems. This obstacle should do for him, given his climbing skills.
The whole story, I told her everything. I mean, whether or not she was conscious to understand it ... that's a whole other issue, however, I told her everything. Father used to tell me -- when I had a problem, he would say. "Get it right... "and take him out before he can take you out."
Anyone would jump through hoops to have a clean record. Being out of prison? To breathe fresh air as a real, living person. Bury the past. Or he'll bury you, boy.
This is a troglogoblo. What are you doing with that? He locks it in, this evil beast. What does the bad dream say? He says.
I need you to be brave. I need you to be brave like you've never been brave before. Kathy, I can distract him. I can use fire. I can use it. I can get out of here, and he'll follow me. So you can get out--and get away from here.
- I know who he works with. I was like a poison in that place. Reshaping life so you can destroy it? I can't do that in the world. He knows.
But he doesn't hunt in packs like them. He's always alone, like -- like a bear. And then -- remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself? And then tonight, the deer ... He was bleeding too.
- I'm bleeding again. - Damn! Come, sit here! What's wrong with the donkey? He looks dead. He kicked me....
He is the man who is covering for us. Something that's increasingly difficult to do since the murder of Officer Russo. And now this. Other agents have already opened an investigation into this attack, so you guys are going to have to beat the rest of Homeland Security to the punch. Especially if it turns out to be about Vincent. So what? Is it about him?
I've lost count of the number of times you've been there for me. No. No! I think, this world involves you much more than you want to admit. You want to control the world rather than have it control you.
- Yes. High-profile cases. - Do they also have a foreign section? It definitely comes from them. The last time I worked with a foreign police officer was on the mountain accident case. But he was British. It was a damn circus.
- Who is that guy? - It's that Chazz guy, isn't it? - No. - Yes. - Is it him?
At the funeral of Louis Brandt, a.k.a. "Lou the Squint?" Oh, yeah, those guys. You meet so many people at funerals. But isn't that guy with the machete his nephew? Yes, that's him all right.
Look, I don't know all the details. I'm just basing my life on him, man. In that case, let's get you a tape. It's as I expected, even better. The tape takes me where he wants me.
Thank you all for coming. Okay. Thirty-five years ago, my father, Big Bill Primm put ... 4 million dollars inside this -- huge, old green horseshoe. That's part of Primm's history. In fact, it's because of him that we have Primm on the map.
Well, I don't care if a dog likes me, because I like myself. I like you too. But why doesn't that dog like me? Why do you care so much? Because it's like when you pick up a baby, he starts to cry, and ... you think there's something wrong with you.
We are lucky to have you... But you need to understand well what it's like to actually be here. Go home safe, sister. I'm not saying that you went looking for this demon.... But that he found you, chose you....
And probably, for collaborating with Denise Hemphill in the murder of Chad and many other people with her murderous hand. Look, Chanel... I know you've lost your usual coloring right now. You have an alibi so solid it's hair-raising. I do? How nice. I didn't want to believe he was the killer, but after the silver solution, and because of Chad's jealousy of me, I didn't know what else to think.
And then to make it flamb√©, the kitchen torch. No, I have the kitchen torch here somewhere. Here it is. He suffered a lot of smoke damage, but he didn't cause the explosion.
It's not just a wall. It's a cage. It is all your pain, all your losses -- all the lies of the Company. Hate the wall. Fight against the wall. Tear it down as it has torn you down.
Did you know? - We had nothing to do with the fire. What are you trying to do? Why all these secrets? I know where he was, I trust him.
What? Of course it's time! Play it! You can't play the turin like that. He tells you when to play it. What the...
We give them our strength, a kind of first gift. As well as our last legacy. But you humans don't do that, do you? You give them your strength every day. Your legacy you give them as they grow. So you can be the one to shape them and not let them change you.
Watson. Did you verify Mr. Dalal's story? Yes, but I'm not calling about that. I found the motive for the attack on the card-holding group. Or rather, he found me.
I'll take your horse. Is that okay? Good. Well, you know, normally I wouldn't mind if you took a ride on old Gus, but we're hunting now and we don't need any distractions, Well, you can keep hunting, we need old Gus. You see, if I don't find this bear before he finds all of you, you won't be able to anyway.
- Was brilliant. - The cat stew was Nina's idea. Too risky for me.If Faye had walked in while she was swapping pots? We had to get rid of that cat.He was actually helping her get better.
My challenge was to find peace, awaken my chi and atone for my sins. Perhaps the Golden Nectar of Mount Wuyi could help me start over. God knows how much I need it. But even if you try hard to leave the past behind, he always finds you in the end.
He could hardly walk. He slept in bed with me. He used to guard me. My wife attacked me with a knife. He took off her forearm.
If you let me out, I can give you the information you want. If you tell me something useful, I will take... Consider your release. I don't know... What made Sarah immortal, but I know about her baby. He's immortal, too.
Are you okay, Holly? Holly? Oh, oh, God. No! No, we made a mistake. The--the spirit we eliminated. He was trying to protect us and... that's why he wanted us to leave.
In every moment a choice is possible. We can cling to the past or embrace the inevitability of change--and allow a brighter future to unfold before us. That uncertain future may require even the most unlikely allies. Either way, there will be a new day, whether we like it or not. The question is, will you be in control of it, or will it control you?
That's the point. The accident destroyed the engine and sent the whole system into a loop. It is in a loop. Torture, heal, torture, heal. I don't think it knows how to stop. So unless we destroy the program, the only solution is to die faster than he heals you.
Yes. Hello old man. I can't talk to you now, I'm at a charity party for the homeless organized by violette. There are famous people there. Yeah, yeah. Wait, there's also that, what the hell's his name? That's not him, that's not him.
Yes. - What happened? - There was a stray dog. I think he was more afraid of it than I was. I tried to catch him and stuff, but he had other plans.
Yes, but you know. "What" is it? It could be anything. My God, they -- maybe they're having sex. I don't know. Is it that guy they fought about when Kate left and got pregnant? Yes, I guess it's him.
I think you'd better get out of this house. Why are you acting like this? You are not able to leave the house. You have to think about the child. Preacher James, this is Robert, my brother.
Let's finish this competition. Let's toast to that. Sir, did you... That guy left the lottery ticket on the table. - That was the guy from the telegram. - No, it wasn't him.
Nice to meet you. Are we going to discuss this now or are we going to move? More like, I feel like I play the violin less than the violin plays me. What-what do you mean by that? Like saying that he had many owners before me.
I love to help others! Dulcinea--could you describe the thief using mouth sounds? He was moving so fast that.... Is this the thief? Is this him?
Am I your mother? In the future, I mean. "Be careful you don't catch a cold." That's what mothers always say. But you're not really catching a cold, he's catching you, right?
And the rear is designed so that you don't need a spoiler to give the necessary aerodynamic load. And, like most Lambo cars, it has all-wheel drive. But not just any all-wheel drive system. On board it has 3 gyroscopes, like in fighter jets, and they are constantly at work, analyzing whatever happens. They send all the information to the main brain that governs traction, and he decides how much power to send to each individual wheel.
You are 43 minutes late. I know. Get off my back, computer ghost. Why are you still running that stupid game, Sarge? He's dead. It's not a game.
They are all so beautiful. And they're all about to be tested -- bounce style. # Lil John and the Eastside Boyz # Get Low # I love this mattress. And he loves having it on it.
It made me think of you, mother. He is so beautiful. His neck... Did you find him like this? He was the one who found me.
What did you see? What's the name of that stuff in Belgium...? The kid with his dick out? The Mannekin Pis. Designed by Hieronimus Duquesnoy in 1688. I think. That one. I climbed the gate and took a picture of him peeing in my mouth.
- Your help? I have new allies. Don't alarm your vile mind, I've already sent him back to where he came from, but his ghost proved quite useful. Apparently, our Countess has a weakness-her rotting old corpse is the secret to her longevity. Increase told me where to find it, and when the time is right he--and she--will be mine.
The point is -- love is complicated. You can't go looking for it. So how am I going to find it? You don't find him. He finds you.
Yes, because of family you get to know people with whom you have nothing in common. How come you are spending Yom Kippur at your brother's? Last year you had said, "Never again!" Which, honestly, was a premonitory sign. I know, I got a call from an unknown number and I thought it was Agent Skippy Truce, the one who likes me, but it wasn't him, it was Garry.
As much as we are obliged to keep players happy, it also means keeping them in line. The first time you won a fight with me, Uncle told you a story. On a hunting trip, a king goes to the river to fill his cup with water. This hawk pops up and spills everything on the ground. The king warns the hawk not to do it again, but he does not follow the warning.
And what was the pigeon doing? - It had perched on a branch. - It had perched on a branch. - And what was he doing on the branch? - He was resting and thinking.
I don't know -- do you think he's like a troubled teenager? No. This change will be good for him, though. Because... Because as hard as it may seem for him now, I think it's the place for him.
Councilor Madhavan. Excuse me, but the U.S. federal government would appreciate some information. And if you could answer one or two questions about whether you found your daughter before we did. Sir? What you need to know about kissing a diplomat's ass is that he doesn't kiss you back.
Okay, we will be prepared. No, I think we should look at the cards again. No, we'll be prepared because I'm great and you're McNally, the greatest at organizing piles and... In clearing... - I don't know, the piles. - What's going on? Well, I can't pass something like this on to my successor, whoever he is.
If you want to see someone in a dream, you can. - Really? - Yes. When you go to bed tonight, try to dream about George Henry. I dreamed I took a jump, landed next to a bear, and he ate me.
All right, thank you. "Calcutta, June 3, 1893" "After six weeks in this horrible slum, I met the first one." "He attacked me." "Fortunately I had the dagger and managed to cut his throat, before he managed to choke me with his tongue."
You should talk to her. Did you burn the ouija board once you trapped the spirit? Since when do you burn a ghost? - I don't follow you. - No, he follows you.
Thank you, Ma. You are the best. I hope my son will love me as much as I love you. He will. But what if I don't love my son as much as he loves me?
He must be stopped-he must be punished! If his father were here, this would never have happened. Tell me again... How was the relationship with his father? Oh, it was very bad. He...
But, Dad-how do you recognize it in winter? I've told you a hundred times. I don't remember. When the ash tree was created, he made all the trees in the forest jealous. He was -- the most beautiful tree in the forest.
I can take you there whenever you want. Melissa can come too, if you want. The body possesses immense intelligence. Follow the body. It will know what to do.
Like we want to climb on his hood. Crapule? What the fuck? Call the boss! This is Korzhov, he's in charge of my security.
And then Kat comes along, you two are flirting--she's making soup for you when you get the deadly vampire flu--and you want to give her a good thrashing. But you can't. You're a gentleman, so you hold back. But that's not enough to keep your subconscious in check. You go to sleep -- and he takes over, sends you out on the prowl for some nice butt.
Thank you. Thank you very much. And, sheriff -- I'd like to ask you something. Was he the man who escaped from the jail? Yes, we think that's him.
What Hannah means is that we have good news. They found a body in the woods. According to the police it was a camper. It was Toby. No, Spence, it wasn't him.
Ezra is taking responsibility-and he needs a job. - The rangers found a body. It was Toby. No, Spence, it wasn't him.
It was like watching a chimney collapse. At the last moment, the head made a sound like it was breaking! And we thought it was dead. We thought the animal was dead. And he lay there, it must have been three minutes.
Ivan, you are the bastard. The child is the bastard. Call a spade a spade! Katrina, listen. No, I will give my name to the child and he will know me.
- Have you moved? Forensics found DNA in the cottage. Foyle's? They want to see you. Traumatized by finding his wife, he looked up and saw a man, whose absence from your life would be very helpful to you. But he was not that man, was he, Mr. Burton?
That's enough now! My leg broke! Stan, you can do it! Just follow my body. He knows what to do.
The rat was tortured. Just like Alex Zukanov. The killer forced him to eat... Stones. Pushed down his throat so he would suffer, too.
This is not a trivial suicide. It is related to the seven years of Tribulation. The monster in your nightmare.... - I barely saw him! - Maybe he is the real cause of the doctor's death.
It maintains the sounds of each century. It maintains, along with the sounds of the 17th century, those that have developed from then to now... No. I don't mind the noise. In fact it's a stimulus for me. The important thing is that he is there.
You see, it's so strange Because I didn't think. I just acted. Keep following your instincts, little brother. He will never lie to you.
One who must be pure. - As you are. - Wait a minute. What child? The baby that will grow inside you. Very soon. He has chosen you, my dear.
He used a paralytic medicine on a guard. Do you think he got it from the inside? They're interviewing the staff right now. Hey, do you want to meet your predecessor? He's the one I was stuck with before I was stuck with you.
Scotty Evans and Timmy Knight. They would come after me. Sometimes, they would give me a black eye, sometimes, they would hurt me with a knife.... And you came along. Do you remember that? You raised your fist, hit Scotty Evans in the jaw, and he fell like a ton of bricks.
Ilizia? You seem to have been misinformed. I was only kidnapped from my bed--my son is causing me unexpected discomfort toward the end of my pregnancy. And did he also cause the bruise on your cheek? No--he didn't--it was my fault.
Well, then it looks like we have a lot of traveling to do. Oh my God. Justin is an idiot. Oh, and also. Bob asked me to make corrections to your draft for his speech, is that weird for you? No, it's not strange. You work for him now, so...
I want a new bed. We need a new bed! I want to turn our bedroom into a sanctuary. Here we go again! She always wants to change things. He wants everything to stay the way it is. Look, I found a nice bed from "Bedder Beds 4 Less," there are drawers underneath and the headboard has lighted shelves to show off our things!
Yes, me too. Me too. I'm fine here, too. Now we know what to expect. We just have to defeat the shark before he gets us.
I know, Leigh. I know you were a petty thief, thrown in jail for stealing a slice of bread. And while you were in there ... the guards ... went around the cells, singing Christmas songs. And five men ... pinned you down ... and took your virginity. Well ... the first one took it. The others took your dignity, and your self-esteem, and ... most of all...your Christmas spirit. But then you went out and found this costume. And he gave you everything you lacked.
Mangosta is a Colombian assassin whom Doris should have taken out 37 years ago. And she didn't kill him? Everyone thought she did. Then a man showed up who we thought was Mangosta. Intelligence still hasn't been able to confirm if it's really him. But you believe it is him?
Alex. Emotional intelligence applied to robotics works like this, okay? The fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms, allow us to design an artificial brain with variability. What does this mean? That of all the choices he has, he will always opt for the one that best fits the individual's needs....
It's cool. I like to be a lookout. - I don't know what your boss looks like. - It doesn't matter. If you see someone and think it's him, you give us a signal.
When you're pregnant, you become very sensitive, and you pick up things like you're a radio antenna, pretty much any kind of signal. - Right. - Yeah. What if the baby is able to sense my thoughts? What if he knows that I think he's going to die?
The bad news, crew, is that the beast reproduces asexually. A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone vampire porn, can produce dozens of lethal pups. That lucky bastard. I say kill him! But he loves me! And I love him!
People like you, I like to piss them off. We go to America, to your house or somewhere else. Calm down. Do we have to play this game much longer? He tries to be nice, and you ruin everything in five minutes!
Put pressure on him. How could a game have such an effect on a man's soul? The way I see it, how could it not? You don't choose the game. He chooses you.
I'll be fine. Okay. I guess I'll... I'll see you around. Actually, I hope not. We might think we've put the past behind us, but he always finds a way to catch up.
Of course I still have my oboe. I was just practicing. That was heading my way, and I was wondering if it was dead. The last thing you need is to meet a cornered, angry beaver. I approach, and he looks dead, right?
Yup... Look, the ocean. - Do you like it? - Beautiful. He doesn't have to do anything.
- Did you get hurt? I -- no, I'm fine. Yeah, but the car door was all the way back. What about the deer? He got... got up and he... how do you say, hopped?
Kiss me. He changed the lock. He changed the back one, too. What did you think you were doing? I thought. I spent more than 400,000 pounds on this house, while the dog, God bless him, has contributed very little to the mortgage so far, and yet he can come in and out whenever he wants.
The big problem with quantum mechanics is that the small particles we are all made of can be in multiple places at the same time. However, I am made of small particles but I am not in two places at the same time. So what is going on? Max thinks the mathematics of quantum theory is telling us something incredible. If the equation says that the tennis ball is in several places at the same time, it actually means that our reality has split into several universes, and in each of them the ball is in a very specific place. According to this theory, when the photon of light is in front of two slits, it does not split into two. It is he who divides the world into two.
As strange as this theory may seem, Max believes that reality must be accepted as we see it. When I get a parking ticket, there's always a parallel universe where I didn't get it instead. On the other hand, there is another universe where my car was stolen. Sometimes you gain, sometimes you lose. But seriously, as a scientist, my job is not to tell the universe how to conform to my preconceptions about how it should be, but to observe the universe and figure out how it really works.
Destiny can be a curse You can try to control it Someday these will be collector's items No, I wouldn't say But he usually controls you
Politics? What are you talking about? I don't even go to vote. "The world is like a suicide case. We save it and he gets some more pills?"
- Avatar. It's a movie. Okay, okay. So: there's this guy in a wheelchair and he goes to this alien planet to take part in a program.... So you pick a dragon and then you get to keep him forever? No. He picks you.
- But if I program everything the right way.... - No. That's not what's going to happen.... You see, you're so caught up in the possibility of creating some amazing new life form that you're ignoring the other options. That's not the case. - I assure you. - Growing a monster inside my fianc√©e and then sewing her up when he's bitten off, - is not an option!
A new commandment. Here it is. They filmed this one from the deck. That's Captain Zuniga, isn't it? Yes, that's him.
If I killed him, you would get me a reduced sentence, wouldn't you? - Hey, thanks for driving yourself. - No problem. Doesn't the seat go further back than that? The problem isn't how far back he goes, it's how far forward you lean.
- Aunt Ann, what kind of place is this? - It's where they keep corral animals. You don't have these on the East Coast, huh? Is this the place where they slaughter them? Yes, this is it.
No one can change what happened, no one can change what will happen, everyone should be happy in their present, all this is Happy Home! Is the baby kicking sister Lata? He will become an excellent soccer player! Let him out, I will tell him to kick you. Who is he?
- Did you say scold? - That's what I said. Nobody scolds anybody. And my agreement with the sheriff comes before yours. He was the law.
Thank you, Richard. What is it? An even more secret room? It's the place from which I was told I could call the monster. That was before I realized it was him calling me.
- That's usually the case. - It's always like that. We don't know anything. The brain knows everything. If you get an ulcer, you don't know, but the brain increases mucin secretion. It knows what the problem is and it also knows where it is.
It's by Ian Spankler, a Brit. I bought it for three hundred before he left. - Three hundred dollars? - Three hundred thousand. She wants to have sex with the hedgehog, but he rejects it.
Here ... about that prophecy ... The Book flew away. In flames. It's gone. Bye-bye. Oh, Atticus... It takes more than fire to destroy the Book. He survives.
And see that you return all your father's things. And stay away from us, I mean it. - Are you sure the ghost was Kyle? - Yes. No, I think it was him.
Wait, stop, stop. Look at the color. It's gone through the blood. There is no point in cutting off his arm. Not if it's spreading inside him.
But having escaped one danger, there is another around the corner. The giant frogfish can take on any color. Hiding under one may be a bad idea. The stonefish is one of the rudest fish. There is no predator he fears.
Absinthe. The one that drives you crazy? - Some people say that's what it is. - Correct me if I'm wrong--but didn't Van Gogh cut off his ear in an absinthe frenzy? But he was already mad as a goat.
You can even eat him before he starts eating you. Try a little. Eat the snake. That's what my new brain is telling me. - He is going to eat me.
At the beginning and end of the service I will play the shofar, which is the horn of an animal used in ancient ceremonies. In this case, it is meant to scare the spirit into the victim's body. Once the spirit is more submissive, we can begin to let it out. That is when we will be vulnerable. He wants to casey, but he could attack any of those present.
- It was. Clear as day. - How can you be so sure? How else would you explain it, you? There's a bullet in my heart and he's pumping like a piston.
I-I can use it for pretty much anything I do. You see, society votes. People like the way this guy makes ice cream. But the other guy, they don't like his ice cream so much, and they don't buy it, so he goes out of business.
Naked--in the middle of the night, more than two kilometers from shore, clinging to a buoy. - So much for miscalculation. - I wanted to take a night swim. It was cold...gorgeous...just me and the water.... I was one with the ocean, feeling...being in it. And him in me.
I can't help myself. It was incredible. No wonder you were so popular in high school. Excuse me? It wasn't sex that made me popular. It was me that made him popular.
Okay. Tell me exactly where the line is Okay, how about this? I have a friend, Abbey She had a baby boy and he farted
Don't take children away, keep families together. She has a prostitute background, she's a drug addict, and she left the child with the father who takes methamphetamine. - I think. - She's endangering the child. What if she's clean? What if I give the baby back to her and he dies after a week?
I mean, if the monster is on the loose, you go the other way. Yeah-unless she was convinced that he wasn't going to hurt her. But she ends up here. Why...? Well...he attacks, she trips and slams into the medicine cabinet.
But in the end he finds himself here. Why...? Well...he attacks, she trips and slams into the medicine cabinet. Yeah, and she lands right here. Then he finishes attacking her, and he goes out the glass cabinet.
There was no license plate on the truck, how will we find it? Kaleidoscope. The R&D guys up at China Lake developed the algorithm. What is it? You enter a description of a person, place, or thing, and it looks up live links from traffic cameras, ATMs, and satellite images for a match.
Mr. Chaddha, don't blame him. There is only one person who can help you. Are you sure the dog will eat after seeing him? Of course, son, I am absolutely sure. He will not touch any more food if he cannot see it.
