I have temporal lobe epilepsy. - Pernell... - No, listen. Before you say anything, let me tell you something. Napoleon, Julius Caesar, George Gershwin... They all had it.
Your will be done. The water is perfect. Are you coming? It's been five years since I've been in the pool. It's a fucking shame. People who are lucky enough to have a pool should pay a fine if they don't use it once a month.
You bastard, can't you give me some credit? Do you know how much I did without him? - You think I was his fucking puppet? - Dad, I'm not saying that. So what are you saying? What are you saying, kid? You're saying I couldn't sit in this chair without some asshole giving it to me? - No, I'm not saying that.
- But I know where there is. I don't understand you. You achieve glory by killing fascists and you leave at your best. No, I left when it was over. Glory only lasts a second. I lived it and I left.
- It would kill you. Of course it would kill me! It makes me feel less lonely. Put your hand in. It's beautiful. Where did you find it?
How much? There is a safe. It's full of money. There's got to be $100,000 or more. I'm going to have someone open it this morning so I can get the combination and then I have an appointment with Mr. Success at two o'clock this afternoon.
The captain is right. Nobody asked you, no neck. The protomolecule. What are we going to do with that? Simple, we attach it to the end of a torpedo and fire it into the sun.
And until we know, it's too important to destroy. Well, I won't keep it in the Roci. I won't take that chance. I sure as hell don't want to share a bunk with it. - Of course you don't. - Then we'll hide it.
That, my hungry friends, is a Kamal family recipe. It's a staple of the Marineris valleys. I admit, we had to improvise a bit, with no real cheese, wheat, tomatoes or anything. Damn, Alex, you're getting us really excited about this lasagna. Don't judge it before you try it, Terrano.
How? By developing a parallel program in North Korea. "Looks like." The evidence is more than credible. Saul calls it conclusive.
Of course. I was thinking about how long it had been without hearing your voice. - Please, please, please, please. - Let me finish. I was thinking about how long I'd gone without hearing your voice, and then suddenly I heard it.
- I'm in the area. I have to say you picked an odd time to do it. It appears that Iran is in violation of the nuclear deal. The evidence is more than credible. Saul calls it conclusive.
I got a call from the FBI to meet me in our office and they showed up with orders. Wait, what's going on? Rewind. The van that was carrying the bombs... Sekou was driving it.
I have meetings this afternoon with everyone, including the director, and they'll all want to know how that shit we had locked up got out on the street. And what are you going to tell them? Everything, including that you used a recording between me and my informant to free your terrorist. Which is why I need to know... that recording... Where did you get it?
- Well, that's true. But... The problem is that they know it must have come out of the ASN. Your organization is going to be investigated internally, so it's not going to be enough to say that. I didn't give it to you, actually.
There's a lot of things I can't say except in person, but you have to know something. About the recording we were talking about earlier, what's up? It didn't come from my source. I don't understand. Then how did you get it?
I don't understand. So how did you get it? That's... I don't know. There's a third party involved. I have no idea who it is. But whoever it is, he left it on my desk.
Can we? Can we have some privacy, please? Surely you know why I'm here. My statement... He wants to know why I didn't make it.
Who is making you surf? My job. Are you a professional surfer? No, I'm a writer writing about surfing. Although, what if the article was about how I went out to the beach, hated it, turned inside and never went out again?
Fiske? It's true, sir, we heard it from the traders. Where are these traders? We heard the same story three times, five times? We heard it three times.
I thought they were gone too. I thought they were gone with everyone else. I didn't even consider looking for them. If I had... I took the cross from the chapel and took it out there to mark the place where they died.
And they took us to the movies, bowling alley and miniature golf to entertain us? Yes, of course. One time they took us to a baseball game and I was too little to understand the rules, so I saw that somewhere else people were hitting a giant beach ball. And it was bouncing all over the stadium. And when the ball came toward our seats, you got up and hit it.
One time they took us to a baseball game and I was too little to understand the rules, so I saw that somewhere else people were hitting a giant beach ball. And it was bouncing all over the stadium. And when the ball came toward our seats, you got up and hit it. It was the first time I'd seen you smile in a long time. But then the ball went down the aisle... and an usher went for it, picked it up, and knocked all the air out of it.
Why would I want to do that job? Why would anyone even want to do it? Because if I didn't... that ball would end up on the field... and it would be fucking chaos. You can keep the van. I don't need it anymore.
I didn't even last two hours. I went to a spa that cost $2,000 a night. I hated our house. Really? I didn't say anything because you bought it with your money.
In a world full of orphans, they still had them. And I was a ghost. I had no place there. And then, I regretted it. The physicists who sent me said that the first one to use the machine was the one who invented it.
That also took time. But I found him and asked him to make another machine because he already knew how to make it. And he asked me if I had made it that far, why did I want to go back? I said I didn't belong there. And he built it.
I called your father in Montana. He's still not answering. We can talk about it later, if you'd like. Look, all I want to know is: You come back here to hang out every day, you don't talk to anybody, Emilia, do you still want our help? I said I'd get my damn water if I needed it.
We were doing it, he left the site going east, but we lost him on Thirteenth. I found out why Bin-Khalid's people wanted the safe. Inside was an external memory stick with a list of sleeper cells that Bin-Khalid set up here along with all the codes to activate his attacks. It looked like about 15 or 20 cells, but I haven't had the list too long. He says he'll give it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.
Thank you very much for coming. Thank you for your help. Sure. Sure. Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it.
If Isaac does not return from this meeting, he would not be mourned too much. Bin-Khalid's people have found us. They have killed the rest of the squad. There was an external memory stick with a list of sleeper cells along with all the codes to activate their attacks. - Are you saying Grimes still has it?
Bin-Khalid's people have found us. They have killed the rest of the squad. There was an external memory stick with a list of sleeper cells along with all the codes to activate their attacks. - You're saying Grimes still has it? - He says he'll give it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.
Take Agent Fox with you. - Thank you. - I'm on it. According to Carter, the list of sleepers is on a USB flash drive. We can't take action until we confirm that Grimes has it.
I was not at the campaign headquarters. I go for a run every morning at 6:00, after praying. I never fail to do both when I am in Washington. Show me your route. We'll see if we can confirm it.
The terrorists escaped with the list. One of the men was Jadalla, Bin-Khalid's son. We have the list. It's a sign that we're on a righteous path. Rebecca, the list of sleeper cells... the terrorists have it.
I just got off the phone with Keith. An operation Eric Carter is running has provided a promising lead. We may be able to find Jadalla without your father's help. CTU is running an operation. Keith asked me to supervise it with him.
We are going to eliminate Jadalla Bin-Khalid. Jadalla's flash drive is damaged. He told me to bring someone who could fix it and... he kidnapped my wife and brother to force me. I go with Carter to where Jadalla is. He thinks I'm going to fix the flash drive, but I've designed a virus that will destroy it.
I don't know. The same thing that made me... roam the streets. The same thing that made me pick up a gun when I was 12, with my brother and his gang. It's just... I still hold a gun, I just point it at different people.
This is where I read. I never use the ballroom. They'll have to redo the floors. The laundry room. They'll wash my underwear and then hang them up.
He left with an escort hours ago to make the exchange. You allowed him to leave? Your men need to know that my wife is not to be harmed. In English, damn it! Even if such an order had been given, no one would abide by it.
Previously in Black Sails... I have opened the doors for you. I hand-delivered this victory to you. Your men need to know that my wife must not be harmed. Even if such an order could be given, no one would obey it.
Woodes Rogers bears debts he cannot hope to pay. Because of Nassau's ruin, those debts could be bought for a fraction of their value, for pennies. He could own Woodes Rogers and imprison him. In the meantime, while Nassau burns, your real property could be bought for a pittance. I offer you the opportunity, sir, to own the island, shape the regime that governs it, all while justice is done for the murder of your granddaughter.
Do you know who I am? You are part of Long John Silver's resistance. I am Long John Silver. The resistance inside... I organized it. I led it, it was mine.
But it will still call out to you. And when it does, you'll walk through that frame and you'll feel the swell under your feet. And it will all come back as if it was yesterday. Is that so? I've watched you and yours practice piracy since I left it.
This invitation has to do with that. Of course. It was seen by over a million people. - Really? - You didn't see it?
- Sorry. The assistants are stationary. - And you come and go like a tornado. - But... You need a woman researcher. Research is for women and I know why I do it.
Good morning. - Good morning, all of it? - All of it. - There you go. - You don't order it?
And the best part is that it gives me access to the most fascinating people in the world. As our next speaker, the best performance coach out there. I would advise you to give her your undivided attention. But you don't have to. She'll get it.
That's a lesson you only need to learn once. Absolutely. I need to deploy your specialized computer skills, your executive attitude, the magic of your technical genius. No one ever told me before that I had an executive attitude. That's because you hide it behind a mask of superiority, disdain and pessimism, but I can see beyond that.
Right now, I'm just asking you how your whippet got to my car and what you might know about how my tire got flat. - Guys. - Well, I'm stumped, officer. Look, if you're going all Agatha Christie to get to the bottom of this, come back here and tell me who did it. In the meantime, why don't you take that whip and shove it up your ass?
- Guys. - Well, I'm stumped, Agent. Look, if you're going all Agatha Christie to get to the bottom of this, come back here and tell me who did it. In the meantime, why don't you take that whip and shove it up your ass? - Shove it up my ass?
- I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. - We all forget things sometimes. No, the combination is a mix of the girls' birthdays. I remember the day we picked it out.
Professor George Amory, who led the Oxford team, predicted that, within a generation, few compartments of intellect would be outside the realm of machines and that the problems of creating artificial intelligence would be substantially solved. We are no closer to catching this son of a bitch, and now everyone knows it. We'll have every nutcase and crackpot in Oxford claiming responsibility and there's no way to separate the wheat from the chaff.Tessa! Come here. This story, where did you get it?
- At home, possibly. He wasn't feeling well. Gibbs had told Dr. Gould to reboot Jason the night before the tournament. Would that be customary? Yes, Jason had been behaving erratically. It's standard practice. You turn the machine off and then you reboot it.
He wasn't feeling well. Gibbs told Dr. Gould to reboot Jason the night before the tournament. Would that be customary? Yes, Jason had been behaving erratically. It's standard practice. You turn the machine off and you reboot it. And he turns it off and on again and again.
- His name was King. - How does that lead you to Castle? What he wrote on the wall. Rook takes Knight. Rook is the correct name for the chess piece, but some people call it castle.
All right, I'll go get him. I'll go get it. How? The mountain bike's in the back. - I'll take it.
Do you have those...? What are they called? Those Islamic things to cover up? - A hijab? - How the fuck do you know the word "hijab"? I learned it in church.
I guess. Have fun storming the castle! What castle? Yes! You take the credit card, swipe it and then...
Preparing to receive these samples... has been the purpose of our mission these past few months. But the Pilgrim capsule is damaged. At 06:30 UTC... Pilgrim collided with space debris and veered off course. Rory Adams will go out to establish visual contact with the capsule... and grab it with a remote arm.
Like a bird. Don't misunderstand me. I don't hate my chair. I love it. Out of respect for the anonymous genius who invented it.
Go, Miranda, start. Initiating manual override. This is Dr. North's black box in case of death on re-entry. The creature killed four of the six ISS astronauts. A fifth, Dr. Jordan, presumed dead, transported it into deep space.
Thanos possesses many powerful artifacts, but none capable of changing mass like that. Who cares? It's ours now. Now I don't know my purpose, but I am certainly no thief. We are just stealing this rock from whoever stole it from Thanos, who would most likely steal it as well.
Get out of here! Mrs. Kevecki... You... promised... to protect Teena. You promised us justice. And we're gonna get it.
- Shut up, asshole. Yeah. Yeah, he baked me a cake for... Say that again? I didn't eat it in time so the candles had melted.
- Hi, how are you? - Fine, and you? - Fine. Can I try that lasagna? No, I ate it all.
Let's go to the police. There are no security cameras. Did you try the Find My iPhone app? There are no security cameras. He asked if you tried the Find My iPhone app. I turned it off because of international data.
No security cameras. Did you try the Find My iPhone app? There are no security cameras. He asked if you tried the Find My iPhone app. I turned it off because of international data. He turned it off because it was too expensive for his international data plan.
She was making sad noises when she was sucking him off." And all of a sudden, he's got something to write about. She's got a story...she's got an experience, okay? She's got something that makes her different from any other creative writing student that's come from Virginia. You know what I mean about experience...how people want it and the way they use it?
Are they copying the entire Universe? Symmetrical down to the last quantum particle, with one crucial difference. The Echo Universe will be devoid of organic compounds. Instead, it will be a lifeless cosmos... providing an unlimited amount of matter... that can be transformed into energy. Acting as a dimensional conductor, The Tower will create multiple gravity portals, which will harvest the Echo's mass... and convert it into pure electromagnetic energy.
You just plug it in? That's all? That's all there is to it. There's a terminal at the base of the Echo Tower. You jump in, take the box to The Tower, plug it in, and get back in time for dinner.
You know everything, don't you? And why should I tell you where it is if you're going to kill me anyway? Have you thought about that, Sheriff Lonelyhearts? Listen to me, you little shit. I don't know what kind of sick fuck digs his mother up from the grave and takes her out there, and I don't want to know anything about it or what you did.
But even that mistake has to be one... That you never get tired of. Today it's Mrs. Nair. A mother, a daughter-in-law. But for me, she is still my Bindu. She still enters my dark life and brightens it.
- John! Good. Now that we're all here, let's get on with it. You all know about my obsession with time travel. Yeah, how's your novel coming along? Have you finished it yet?
You've taken this too far. And once you're gone, can you come back? We don't want you to come back. The security lock automatically returns the ship to its departure date, unless you have this key to revoke the order. Have you used it for a test run?
Some form of indication of how we are related. When he showed up in my life all those years ago, I didn't believe him. But I did what he said. I looked for the time machine. And I finally found it in his basement at 10 Mornington Lane.
Thank you for coming. Now I prefer to be alone. [Marta] She started touching my legs to get rid of the ants and pulled up my skirt. I was hysterical because I hate ants. And he knew, he was making it all up. In fact, he took a picture of me and told me that if I didn't take my clothes off he was going to put it on the Internet and my parents would see it.
How did you follow the story of the fraud? Was it at the end? I have no doubt about it. It is a fraud. First he makes an intra-community acquisition in which he deducts the VAT quota and at the same time he deducts it, when transmitting the merchandise in the internal market, he passes on the tax which gives the buyer the right to deduct it,
Tell me who the fuck! That cunt has been stealing points from me like white people have been stealing from us since the beginning of time. It's the same old story. But here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take that blonde by the scalp and I'm gonna scalp her, because I am Minerva!
Talk to me. I understand you're upset. I'm telling you, if I had been in that basement, this needle would not be in evidence. No. I would have stuck it down his throat and made sure it penetrated every one of his organs.
We will, when he finally shows up. Hi. Oh, Justine! I think I left my camera bag. Well, let's see if we can find it, shall we?
Do you want coconut water? That depends. I prefer fish milk. Okay, I'll drink your coconut water. But I'm going to pretend I'm drinking it from a fish.
Is everyone all right? It's just me and the big guy. There's a picture of a door on this wall. See a lever on your side? I've seen it.
What's going on? Undertaker saved me from death. How ironic. Where's your board? You destroyed it when you pushed Tank into Joe.
The diameter of the hammer head suggests that it was the same as that used with Margaret Kwan. The size of the fractures is identical. However, the manner in which Mike Reiss was tortured far exceeds what was done to Margaret Kwan. The torture of Margaret appears to have been an effort to get information. Once the killer got it, he quickly ended her life.
Everything is going to be fine, okay? I'll make sure everything goes smoothly around here. Tom, what the hell happened? Two men ambushed the safe house. How the hell did they find it?
- Well, yes. Do I have a choice? Your hearing is in two weeks. You and Cam rejected the only evidence we had - that might exonerate him. - Well, we rejected it because your evidence was suspect.
Perhaps a pipe, or a baseball bat. Until the skull is reconstructed, we cannot say if this blow was the cause of death. The base plate of the cell phone was partially burned by the fire. So what do you do with the heat gun, burning the rest of it? No. The hot air will not damage it.
Okay, that sounds... sounds serious. Sounds... sounds serious. Do you like it here, Mr. Bray? Yes, of course I like it here. I need you to answer a question and answer it honestly.
The CIA has no information on this subject. He appears to be a native. We have recovered a cell phone, but it appears to be blocked. and the tech company is fighting a legal battle. They won't give us their help. We don't need it.
That I thought about killing him? Yeah. It was... it was a genius move. But you made it very clear during the generals that you didn't want my help. I didn't need it.
You mean when you look at a light bulb and when you look away you still seem to see it? Yes. Well, there is a more extreme version called palinopsia. It literally means "seeing again". That is, the image just stays with you... and you see it again.
And I'm going alone. I'm surprised you called me. Well, somebody had to call somebody. I need a tissue sample from the body. I was hoping you'd go in there and get it for me.
- Hi. I talked to Ali. I assumed you would. And I think you can expect some apology from her. I don't need it, and I don't want it.
I'll show her. She always runs her hand up Chelsea's thigh. Always? That was Coach Fields' first encounter. I don't know why I can't find her, but if I saw this picture I would understand why no one feels comfortable.
Anonymous carries A.D. Technically "anonymous" doesn't have a "D" in it, but whatever. I hear you. Are you sure it's legal? They've shared the post 500 times in the last half hour. What if Claudia Greco reads it?
You both think it was Mary Drake's doing. Is that what you think? I don't know what to believe. It's just that... Mary wrote me this letter that makes me cry every time I look at it.
I sent you that letter for a reason. Poseidon was monitoring my communications with those who might be a resource or an ally, but not with those I despised. Tell me straight out... How do you feel about me? I figured, if I showed mercy to a man who had never seen mercy in his life, maybe he would be grateful and do something for us.
Well, now, aren't you a vision? Are you sure no one has been following you? I've been avoiding trouble since before you were born. Now, where is that little girl? Have you found her?
Hayley. You've searched for five years. And you haven't found anything. Suddenly, I get a clue. What if someone else has found it too?
You will be fine. - You're still going to sleep. - Yeah, I'm tired. Here's a bedpan. If you need it...
He may know where Rip is. Intel is taking him to a meeting at the port of Lagos. All right, White Squadron, we'll take care of this. Sir, my team wants this mission. I've already assigned it to you.
Officer, I'm late for my delivery. You think I care? Come on! Open the door. I said open the door!
The wives will be here soon to prepare for tomorrow. You could help a little. I've collected most of his stuff from his locker. So much junk... I wonder why he kept it.
You don't believe me, I don't care. Why were you in New York yesterday? Are you following me now? I didn't say that. I had a job interview with Anthony and Levin to try to salvage what's left of my career after Annalise destroyed it.
Oliver, I told you... Nate's on it. Okay, but if he doesn't find it, I have another idea. Child pornography. I've heard the Russians put it on their enemies' computers.
Money from Salamanca! - Salamanca blood! - You have to calm down. That hacienda! I paid for it!
These people trusted you, Jimmy. Do you have any idea how much time I had to spend...listening to your ramblings about your sciatica...or which grandchild disappoints them the most? Of course they trust me. - I killed myself to earn their trust. - Then you betrayed it.
You have the rest of your life to at least try... and earn that forgiveness. I don't know how to do that. A good place to start is the truth. I've told the truth. And you're still telling it now, here?
Are you sure it's okay? Really, I'm serious. Thank you. Thanks. Wait, I'll get Mike's backpack. Don't worry, I'll pick it up tomorrow.
In the city... I told you you would die. We will both die, American! Turns out that gas station outside of Sana'a had a computer with Internet access. He sent this image from Yemen. Why? We'll find out as soon as we talk to the guy he sent it to.
Steganography is the practice of hiding information in the code that makes up digital files. The Russians do it, the Chinese do it, everybody does it. You probably think that if someone sees this, this will be all they see. But I'm already getting into the image, breaking down the data - that makes it up.
Here, boys. I don't want you to fall asleep. Hey, did you take care of that battery? Yeah. It's finally busted, but we replaced it a couple of hours ago.
He ordered the number three with fries and coffee ordered lots of extra sauce and paid in cash from his left front pocket. He took his tray, sat at a table on the east side of the restaurant.... - ...and put the backpack on the floor. - Where on the floor? Under his seat, between his legs. No one touched it.
There is not much we can do in terms of treatments to improve the outcome. Sometimes, some patients recover partially or completely, but usually, this condition gets progressively worse. Are you saying you could go blind? Permanently? I'm sorry, Mrs. Andrews, I can't say for sure, but there is a good chance that you will lose your vision and not get it back.
Are you right-handed or left-handed? - Right-handed. - That's perfect. You're going to raise your right hand, like this. And then you move it outward, giving it the command to move forward.
I'm going to go down there and talk to him. No. You're not. We're going to shoot her and we're going to keep shooting her. And if that doesn't kill her, we're going to force her out the way she came in.
We lost sight of her behind the container near a bulkhead on the lower deck aft. There is no good camera in that position. Keep moving to your left. She has to be down there. We would have seen her if she had moved.
The device that was ripped out of his chest was a safety regulator, a kind of command and control module. Control module, my ass. That was an incendiary device, you know what I mean? A bomb probably designed to destroy that thing in case it got out of control, okay? And I wish we'd known about that thing inside him before he ripped it out of his chest!
I'll keep her as long as I can. Go to the airlock. I'm not leaving you. Your armor is in the skiff. Why did you bring it?
He stopped tearing off the bulkhead. Shit... He turns to Holden. If he got to my gun... We hurt it the first time.
Yes, I'm warning you. Yes. I'm warning you. Don't come any closer. I swear I'll block it forever.
Do you think you could put me in one of those cargo compartments? Maybe beat me up a little bit? So they don't think that, you know.... Do you happen to have a nuclear warhead around here? We took it off a torpedo a while back.
So they don't think that, you know.... Do you happen to have a nuclear warhead around here? We took it off a torpedo a while back. A good belt never throws anything away. We'll carry it by the hull until we get close to the cargo sector.
Do you happen to have a nuclear warhead around here? We took it off a torpedo a while back. A good belt never throws anything away. We'll carry it around the hull until we get close to the cargo sector. And then I'll remove the shielding and you'll throw it away from the ship.
We took it off a torpedo some time ago. A good belt never pulls anything. We'll carry it around the hull until we get close to the cargo sector. And then I'll remove the protection and you'll throw it away from the ship. And hopefully, if you're right, that creature will follow.
I think we stopped. That's impossible. Are you sure he died? Of course we're sure. We've reduced it to the core.
Weapons. Rail guns. Nuclear bombs. No weapon brings peace. No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it is doing, but they use it anyway.
It has already dispersed too much for us to make sure it all goes away. It's part of the equation now, and it will be part of the equation from this point forward. We can't change that. We can't wish it away. The Earth has it.
It's part of the equation now, and it will be part of the equation from this point forward. We can't change that. We can't wish it away. Earth has it. Mars has it.
We cannot change that. We can't wish it away. Earth has it. Mars has it. And the Belt needs it too.
Did you know that? Yes. Just as we were on our way I was writing him a letter. Can I have a moment? You don't mind if I read it to you?
You're rushing a bit, aren't you? Did I overdo it? I watched half of the Snowden documentary and now I'm very careful. - You are? - No, it's easier if I sign her in. Sure, it is.
- Hey. - Aren't you going to correct it? - It's pretty close. - I don't want to go to swimming class. - You have to go, I already paid for it.
When I was in college, I went to a party and got really drunk, and then everyone dared me to shit on my hand. And I did it. - I shit on my hand. - Okay. And then, I walked around the party for an hour, with the shit in my hand, and I was presenting it to people:
I know a lot of undergrounders who play by the rules. Are you thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even... Simon, Clarissa's little vampire friend? No matter how good they try to be, Subterraneans can't control their demonic blood forever. If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
Previously in Shadowhunters... Valentine wants to use the Deadly Sword to decimate the entire Underworld, and he needs Clary to activate it. I'm losing patience. - Simon, baby. - Stop them! If Jace touches the sword, he'll destroy it.
Jace's plan is going to work. Let's go! Jace! He'll kill you! He's activated it.
Where to, cap? All right, here we are. Go to the cargo hold. Ray, don't crash my ship. You break it, you pay for it.
I'm not into feelings. Try it, fix my brain. Hey, what's up? Sara has asked us to find physical descriptions of the spear that might help us find it. She thinks Rip had it when he traveled to 1967.
Old man? What the hell are you doing? Brain surgery, what does it look like to you? - It's in here somewhere. - Oh, good. Good. Good. Cause you'll never find it.
And if I didn't make it, I don't know how it works. You know enough to alter what it does. I see. You want me to alter it. Well, how do you want me to alter it?
Fuck him. I'm sick of his bullshit. He loves to tell that story. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I feel like I'm the one who told him to tell it.
Listen, I wanted to tell you that... Jesus asked me to read the letter you wrote to him. - Why? Not for me. - Not for me. He asked me because he had a headache and his eyes were tired, and... I didn't read it all.
Birds don't write. Hey, Jesus didn't read my letter. - What? What? - He definitely didn't read it.
- because he can't read. - What is this? It's the letter Emma wrote to Jesus. - And what are you doing with it? - Emma doesn't want anyone to find it.
I'm done with secrets. So now you're done with secrets. Thank you very much. What was this letter hiding in your pocket? Emma asked me to keep it, so no one else could read it.
So now you're done with secrets. Thank you very much. What was this letter hiding in your pocket? Emma asked me to keep it, so no one else could read it. - Who read it?
- Has Jesus read it? No, just me and... Grandma. - Grandma? - She read it to Jesus because
- Okay. - I, uh... I just found out, and I thought you should know. - Emma told you? - Uh, not exactly. She wrote me a letter, but I couldn't read it.
The stadium is in the Glades, love, which is like the worst of the worst parts of town. I took her with me the last time I saw Zoe. So, you admit you broke the rules? I did some of that, honey. The only reason I agreed to let you keep that thing in the house is because you said we needed it for home protection.
I don't think it's going to work. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You said the hatch was titanium, right? Yes. The hydrochloric acid will turn it into Swiss cheese.
The chemicals Sampson has stolen are more refined than those used by Justin Claybourne and could produce a biological agent a thousand times more powerful. - And without a cure. - How's Chase going to distribute it? It's in aerosolized form, pretty much any way he wants it. We need to find out where Chase is stashing this stuff and stop him before he releases it.
It's interesting. What? Similar to the second mark of Belial. What do you mean? It's weird, in all my life I've only seen it... twice.
Like what? He's never faced anything like this before. Like this? No. How will you leave her?
Okay. Do you want me to call the archdiocese? So, we'll start one more time. There is nothing else that Father or I can say, that is not in that chamber. If you can find it.
We have taken too long to choose King Gareth's successor. No one can convince him to stop looking for his son. And abandon all hope that Walter will agree to take his place as rightful heir. Walter will not return, Brother Osmund. If His Majesty dies today, the land has no crown and no dragon to defend it.
I hope this does what we think it does. Yeah, me too. How much do you know about the branch he used to cure me? Not much more than he told you. Does he always carry it?
How much do you know about the branch he used to cure me? Not much more than he told you. Does he always carry it? No, he got it to help you. He got it from where?
Not much more than he told you. Does he always carry it? No, he took it out to help you. He took it from where? Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it.
Does he always carry it? No, he took it out to help you. He took it out of where? Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it. I forgot he had it.
No, he took it out to help you. He took it out of where? Where he keeps it hidden with the cloth wrapped around it. I forgot he had it. Nick left it on the bed when he took out the branch to heal you.
It's Lyn Lake. Lyn Lake? How do you know? Because Jace asked Idris to open a portal this morning. He thought he might have a lead on Valentine. But the Clave turned him down.
The Clave is trying to prevent an uprising. If the Underworld discovers that we don't have the Deadly Sword, there would be total chaos. But the sword has been deactivated. You can't use it against the Underworld. Not the way Valentine used it before.
But the sword has been deactivated. He can't use it against the subway. Not the way Valentine used it before. But it is still a deadly instrument. If he combines it with the other two deadly instruments the cup and the mirror he could use them to summon the angel Raziel.
But this isn't murder. She killed herself. What? How can you tell? The blood in her eyes, I've seen it before.
We lost a capsule! I need those scientists alive! Don't let anything happen to this guy! The protomolecule wasn't sent here by accident. If we control it, we can use it.
Picking on me again? Take the compliment. Texas looks perfect. It's your hometown, right? Your hometown only bears your last name because your family infested it like rampaging rabbits.
We are carrying out your orders. You lied to me, doctor. You snuck into Eros. We found your colleague dead in the airlock. I told Dr. Kane not to touch it, but he never listens.
I don't want you to think I'm hallucinating or anything. Fine. Say it. These voices I'm hearing, I think this thing has taken, I don't know, consciousness, some part of whatever it is that makes us human. It feeds off of it and spits it back out in another configuration.
Previously on The Expanse... Crap. "Protomolecule." They gave that damn thing a name. What are we going to do with it? We attach it to the end of a torpedo and fire it into the Sun.
The Rocinante and James Holden have stopped communicating. Along with Fred Johnson and the Martian government. So we'll have to be sharp on our own. How are we doing with the impact site mission? We requisitioned a civilian survey ship and are refitting it with our best sensors and probes.
Caty would realize I was in trouble. She would find a way to help me. She was my only hope. My last chance. And I blew it.
Crows Wood. Could you bring me some mushrooms while you're there. This is a Hundred Acre Wood. We have about as much chance of running into a bear with very little brains. And even if she did have a suitcase, maybe the killer stole it.
I'd say it just took a turn for the better. Stop! Don't... eat the soup. Something tells me this is not good news. Gillespie poisoned it with stinky amanita.
From Sam. He blocked me on Instagram. And I don't know, at first I thought it was Emily's bitchiness. But then I thought she must have seen the picture of us. What picture? Don't be mad. I know I said I deleted it, but...
After everyone turned us down, we decided that the best way to stay alive until we reached 1 million users was to reduce server usage, remember? The reason Gilfoyle and I went 48 fucking hours without sleep was to reduce the server load. Not to leave it the same. Technically, the reason for not sleeping was to try to get to a million users and I just did. Who doesn't want a 10% better image? Who doesn't?
Technically, the reason for not sleeping was to try to reach a million users and I just did. Who doesn't want a 10% better image? Who doesn't want it? Nobody. Nobody wants it!
Hey. Are you saying no? Drive. I really like this song. Will you sing it for me?
You can't take it, can you? I have to give it to you freely, right? That's right. Well, you're screwed. I'm not giving it to you!
Never ever. Ever. And never. Not forever. The flesh will fall off you. Sooner or later, dead wife. Sooner, if you keep soaking it in hot water.
This Friday or nothing. I'll be honest with you, Mr. Mayor. I'm not a fan. I'm not going to hold back. My audience expects the truth and I'm giving it to them.
The virus sample we got from Hugo Strange... - is missing. - Maybe Lucius got it. Only you two knew the combination, right? Yeah. No. Lee knows it, too.
I buried Jim Gordon alive in a place where you might find him if you look hard enough, but not before his oxygen runs out. Meaning, only I know where he is. But... here's the catch... I left him a way out. You hear that, Jim? I left you an emergency exit. Have you found it yet?
I have what I need to escape my hell, Wallace. No, not everything. We still have a piece of that Stone. Not by much. And once I have it, you and everyone you love will perish.
And then I'll come for you... And Barry and your sister and I'll kill everyone you love. No, you're not real! You're only in my mind, you're just... I am real and I know the limits of your speed. After all, I'm the one who gave it to you.
- Yes. - And I built a trap for him? - Me? You. He wants to kill you before you build it.
- Don't call me Jordy. - My apologies, Jordan Wilder. May I have your autograph? That coke wasn't mine. And if you didn't do it, then it was that bitch that was with you.
Because it's a good opportunity, Paige. When Adam mentioned it, I knew Jake would go for it because it's exactly what he needs right now. Yeah, maybe after he felt defeated because he got fired. But, come on, in the long run. Remember our freshman year when he wrote his first play and in that creative writing class they ripped it to shreds in front of him?
You have lied to me every day for 23 years. When I was little and you tucked me in, when you dropped me off at school, when I played baseball all those years. At games, alone, thinking I didn't have a father. You lied to me. You stole that part of my childhood and I'll never get it back.
I'm here for the movie. I'm ready to get back to work. I think we should get you into some program or go see a counselor or something..... I'm an adult. I'll get help if I need it.
Just a second. This is not a good time. This call is not going to make it better. I need the bell. I just had my dad take it out of town to hide it. Why?
This is not a good time. This call is not going to make it better. I need the bell. I just had my dad take it out of town to hide it. Why? Because I'm giving it to Sybil.
Damon's humanity is on, which means he's sensitive and scared to acknowledge what he did when it was off. When we were little, he used to hide every time we did something wrong, until I would find him and tell him everything was going to be okay. So, all you have to do is find out where he's hiding there and do the exact same thing. By the way, why are you helping them? I need the Maxwell's bell before my sister uses it against me.

So, all you have to do is find out where he's hiding there and do the exact same thing. By the way, why are you helping them? I need the Maxwell's bell before my sister uses it against me. So I'm willing to cooperate with whoever gives it to me.
There's got to be more to it than this. What are you not telling me? - Why do we have to play it? - I know. It's a silly rule, but your lineage forged it, so your lineage has to do the honors.
You're not tearing our town apart, are you? Because you've caused me nothing but trouble, and the emotional strain you have on Damon is worse than a Hallmark card. You're forgetting one little detail. You need a Maxwell to ring the bell, and I'm not ringing it.
Kai sucked me in like a juice box. Why are you here? I want the ash dagger. The only weapon that can kill me. Well, you're out of luck, because I don't have it.
Well, if we're going to be a family again, we need to be honest with each other. Okay, so yeah. Yeah, I finished in time to take a shower so I could get here a little early. And where's the dagger? I already gave it to Stefan.
You are next in line, Ramiel. Prince of Hell. It's just a title. It means nothing. Still, the crown is yours if you want it.
I'm sorry, Castiel. No. No. There is a cure. There's always a cure and we'll find it. - How can we?
All of them? Really? I guess we can be sure that... Black Bill has a connection to the plant? Yes. Or the family that runs it.
Yeah, but... this is what we need right now. Witch-killing bullets. And what about you? With the magic. No, I don't have it.
I have to say. A hole in reality to a bombed-out apocalyptic world? I give it an 11. I'm fine with that. You don't have to worry. The kid opened this door and he'll close it.
Budmouth Taxis, how can I help you, can you wait a minute, do you have a list of what you did and didn't do? Somewhere around here. I'll see if I can find it.
- When was this? - Last night. - Do you still have the card? - Yes. He showed it to me when I picked it up.
What was that light, Miller? Yeah, there's a security light. That could have been it. They often have motion sensors. What would have triggered it?
Whose flowers were they, Trish? I don't know. They were left at the door. There's a card. Do you mind if we take it?
Not anymore. What do you mean? Someone picked up my phone. And they looked at my photos. And among my photos... there was a photo, and they sent it to everybody.
And among my pictures... there was a picture, and they sent it to everyone. What was the picture of, Daze? Don't make me show it to you. Oh, honey, no. Everyone at school has seen it.
But yes, with you, a little bit. I'm angry because we have to fight this. We can't let men get away with this when they do this. I don't want that responsibility. I know you don't want it but tough luck, because you do.
- Everything is going to be fine. It's going to be all right. I was doing some work and I came across this bag. Did you touch it? When I found it, yes.
Okay, let's go in. Let's go in and rattle their cage. They went through the whole place two days ago. That bag wasn't there. He wants us to believe he sees a suspicious bag inside one of his sheds, picks it up and leaves his fingerprints and DNA.
I hate not being able to control my life. I say when it's time to sleep. I don't want a pyramid telling me what to eat. No matter what Titus says, gloves before jacket. And how do you button it?
What is this place? Does it appear one day every hundred years? Don't disappear, magic office. It's my company. I was running it from my bedroom, but I formulated a soup algorithm for Yum-yum, and a lot of funds came in.
He lied to me about not knowing Kevin Jones. I was a member of his congregation. Kevin had a tattoo on his arm with the cross of his church. Half of London decorates his body with the cross. The tragedy is that they don't accept it in their hearts.
Stop it, Frankie. That's enough. Thanks again for the soup. It was delicious. You're welcome, although they don't deserve it.
In the present act, I rehire you with an 8% increase in salary. The Baudelaire children will have a suitable guardian, and this series of unfortunate events has come to an end. As for you, Count Olaf.... I will keep your fortune if it is the last thing I do. And when I have it, I'll chop you and your little brothers into little pieces.
"Trite" means "used by so many writers that it became a tedious cliché." "Meanwhile, at the ranch" is used to link what happens in one part of the story to another, and has nothing to do with cows or anything campy. By "Meanwhile, at the ranch," I mean that, in the meantime, in the Reptile Room, the adults were having an adult conversation. If we put the peaches in a row leading to the cage, maybe the snake will follow the trail, and we'll catch it inside.
Take the week. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Aaron told me. He shared the information with spokeswoman Hookstraten... and she leaked it to Abe Leonard.
I've seen aggressive candidates last barely a term in office. You can't learn by doing. Come on. I've had a hell of a time getting back in the game, and there's zero chance I'm going to let some diaper-wearing brats kick me out again. There's a connection between MacLeish and the shooter, and I'm going to find it.
Slowly. Polymer electrolyte membrane. You bought it on the Internet for $87. I remember that. I used it to create a hydrogen propellant battery.
Seek harmony. I think this container will do the trick. Be very careful out there. You hear me? How's your head? It's like Paseo cracked it open with a jackhammer and filled it with concrete.
I have tried to be kind to you... for the loss of your father. But I can no longer ignore your behavior. You're so smart and beautiful and you're wasting everything. It's mine. I asked Savanah to keep it for me.
If I help you it will be on a fact-finding mission, yes? Of course it will. - You can't take anything. - I won't. If the card is in the box, you'll leave it there... and we'll call the police, okay?
- Write it down. - I can tell you on your phone. No, write it down on paper. Thank you. That's how hard I threw it.
Is he in his truck now? Oh, no, no, no, no. That's... That's Chris Jr. you're talking about. Christian was going to give him the truck for his birthday if he got good grades. He flunked, but he kept it anyway.
- Yeah, I've read something and I just wanted to know if it's true. - Well, I read a certain thing and I just wanted to know if it's true. Yeah, well, I don't really remember much from back then. It's from when you turned eleven. Our mothers got really drunk making the cake, and... when they brought it, apparently, my mother, well, she kind of tripped and fell face first on the cake.
It was not necessary. Meet your new friends. Panic buttons. I have enough friends. This sounds like a joke, but I don't get it.
I never saw him. I have no clear image of him. I refer to the evidence. But you love that farm. I loved it when I was 50.
See what he has done and why I congratulate him? Look how straight the label is. That's the way it should be. Unlike this. I don't want to know who committed this abomination, but why don't they take the Sol box and use it as a model?
Ignore them. No, I can't do that. "To triumph, evil only needs good men to do nothing." My father had framed that sentence and hung it in the living room. I saw it every day.
Come in! You know where it is. Why? We planned to put a bomb on that ship. We needed someone to detonate it at launch.
Do you think the pilot is still alive? He escaped into the area. We need to find him before the Occupation does. The one who died had a radio in his backpack. I memorized his frequency and changed it.
Look. Look at her eye. Heather. Heather. Interesting, you had a gun and didn't use it. Why?
Let your fingers scroll through the yellow pages. What is this? It's a Christmas present. So it's one of those... too-good-to-be-true kind of deals. We don't know what's in the fucking safe until we open it, right?
I don't remember. Something to do with the Bram, maybe, the stream that runs through the valley. So why did he end up with a tarot card in his pocket? I did a reading for him. And he took it.
We are not real estate agents without houses to sell. It's very obvious. Oh, God.... - I wish we had the cover. - I couldn't find it.
- I wish we had the cover. - I couldn't find it. Of course we didn't. The logical thing to do was to keep it with the container. I'll look for it when we get home, honey.
- She looks great. They're going to be great in our hands. And remember the master bedroom, with south facing windows and textured, impossible to stain carpet. I love this room. Then they should buy it, along with all the other rooms.
Yes. Get your things now, and let's get the hell out of here. These are the symbols I saw in hell on the dead man's face, or wherever it took me. And everything else is what Diana saw. Did the Crusaders make these marks on the cloth, or were they already there when they got it?
I can't explain anything that's going on. I keep thinking I need to carry around that stick. - Do you really? - No. But it's like... when you get used to carrying your gun and when you don't have it, you kind of feel like you're letting
I put it in the tunnels. Don't you think you should put it somewhere a little further away? No, I want to understand what's going on. I want to know where it came from. I want to know why the men who found it buried it and I want to know what's written on that rag it was wrapped in.
I may be involved. I'm working on it. I know you love Juliette. But you have to end this and never see her again. You want the truth, I'll tell you.
Guys, what's going on? We just got off the phone with the coroner. We got a cadaver full of an enzyme called hyaluronidase. It's found in the saliva of insects. I was hoping you might know of a wesen that uses it to kill its victims.
And where you gave me the key. And where you gave me the key. Nick! I brought the key. Here, I'll give it back to you.
Give it a try. We can't hide here for the rest of our lives. We won't have to. This thing is going to find us one way or another. And when it does... I'm going to kill it.
I wish I'd never heard of those damn keys... or The Black Claw. Or Bonaparte or this. Will I ever be able to get this damn thing off? Did you try after Bonaparte died? He said great harm would come after my children if I ever took it off.
That doesn't have to happen. None of this. The rod is what you want. It is. You can't kill me while I have it.
What the hell is going on? You can have her. No, Nick! You can't give it to this goddamn demon son of a bitch. If he wants the rod so bad, why doesn't he just take it?
Your laptop is probably already in Mexico And then a couple of days later, I got an email from someone claiming he had found my missing computer and offering to return it for a cash reward. I didn't take the deal? For that kind of money I could have bought three laptops if only I could have pushed a button and blown up the computer while the man was holding it.
Entropy, you are under arrest for causality violations in temporary sector 818. Well done, Chrono Guys. Thanks for leaving that note. I hope, we didn't leave a note. I guess I left it for myself.
He's talking about me. Episode 23: "The Problem of Paradoxes". In 30 seconds, I'll be a girl who remembers a program that never existed, which makes me a living paradox. And you can't go back to your present until you solve the paradox. How do I solve it?
Grandma. I almost lost my job today looking for her. Tell me what the hell happened to you. There was a competition today, a very important one. I couldn't miss it.
I'm glad this horrible story is over, you can rest easy now. Not yet. He thinks he left his cigarette case in the house. It has her name on it. I need you to use your contacts to see if the police have found it.
I need you to use your contacts to see if the police have found her. I'll do what I can, princess. Thank you. Do you think we can trust her? If the police have found her, she'll know.
He will have a say, I say. Francisco doesn't have any power right now. But he could have... What's going on? Did you find the cigarette case? No. Victoria says the police don't have it.
Good to see you, Harvey. I'd invite you to join us for dinner, but I'm pretty sure that's not the reason for your visit. Mike Ross is out of jail. As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason he shouldn't be allowed to practice law. I don't disagree, but technically, he never practiced in the first place.
These kids need your help. I wanted to help people as a lawyer, not as a teacher. The difference is that clients ask for my help. Michael, those kids need it too.
She came to my house to tell me that if I just try to get a job in a clinic, she's going to make it her life's mission to stop me. - She can't do that - Did you hear me? It wasn't even on her radar. I had one thing I wanted to do, and you ruined it for me, just because you can't accept the fact that I don't want to come back here.
- They can't do that. - Why? Because it's unfair? - Because it's illegal. - Only if she sues them, which she will never do, because they will discover her weaknesses and then they will try to offer her the exact amount she needs to survive and she will accept it.
I hate what you did and probably always will, but I don't hate you. I'll accept that. What's wrong? It's nothing. It's... it's... It's... it's just that I had your painting on my wall for a long time and I just realized... how much I miss it.
It is proof that his client spoke to mine for an average of two minutes per call and it was not to discuss the weather. Your Honor, Mr. Grady gave me a copy of this nonsense 20 minutes ago and specifically said it was not relevant. Because I have a phone record of a two-minute call I made to you ten minutes ago. Your Honor, she called 20 times. Yes, maybe to tell you why her rent was late, because she never paid it.
Did you think I wouldn't inquire about you when, all of a sudden, a Queens legal clinic starts acting like it's a real law firm? Well, I did. And if this goes to trial, I'll face him and we all know what happened last time. I wouldn't be here if that's all you wanted to tell me. So, give me a number and I'll take it to my client.
We don't give that kind of money. If you lose, you're going to have to give - And if I accept this, you're going to come back tomorrow and ask for more. Look, I'm telling you, I can make him settle for that. And I'm telling you, you've already had an offer. That's all you're going to get and if you don't take it now, we're going to trial, and I'm going to wipe the floor with that guy.
- You came back. - Of course I'm back, because I looked into what you're doing and why. There's not much to investigate, Mr. Specter. Let me break it down for you. Velocity Data Solutions stole your technology and they're going to bring it to market, so you want to orchestrate an acquisition and take back what's yours. Am I right?
- Why not? Because I can't. Yeah, I'll tell you why you can't. Because a guy as clean as you don't go to a guy like me unless he's got no choice, and you need me a lot more than I need you, so call me when you're ready to tell the truth. They got it from me.
You are not an officer of the court. They won't accept it and it's not your place here. At least I can sit next to him and I can... Listen to me! I gave you a chance because I needed it, but if you risk the reputation of this clinic over a housing case, I will fire you and make sure you never set foot in a courtroom again.
- Is that clear? - Yeah. It's clear. You have a nice office. When are they going to tear it down?
I would say it's not possible because he didn't do it. Well, you have documents and I have one too. This is a copy of a certified letter from my client to the rest of the tenants from three weeks ago, which says that construction would begin, giving sufficient notice to the residents. Your Honor, my client has never seen that. Maybe she didn't see it, - doesn't mean she opened it or read it.
Another lie. You didn't paint this. You asked Janet to do it. No, no, no, no, Chidi did it. I got you an awesome painting, but then she changed it to this one because she said you'd like it better, and she made me memorize things to tell you. So you wouldn't be so sad.
I'm just trying to keep us alive. Why do you need me? I hope your father finds the key. For this, he'll have a reason to look for it. What if he doesn't?
Well, what about cameras? I mean, a guy like this would have security cameras. Mrs. Chandler said she prefers her privacy, and has lived here much longer than the victim. Sir, her first husband, Richard Bloom, bought the house in 2000. the wife got it in divorce in 2015 and remarried 11 months ago.
It was one of the startups I was investing in Do you know OffKey's username and password? Yes. It's, um... ChandlerFamily1, and the password is, um, God. Tom changed it every seven days.
- No, Tom. Tom loved his job... And so, another Assistant Chief candidate finds a reason just to stop by No matter who gets that job, it's going to be bad for us. I was alerted this morning that Mr. Chandler's personal computer had left his residence. When they traced it to PAB,
Well, Criminal Intelligence was helping Chandler develop...let's call it...new surveillance technology for LAPD. The feds allowed me to take Wescott's confidential files from his victim's computer and leave everything else behind. Well, I'm surprised. Usually, when Criminal Intelligence takes possession of evidence... No one sees it again, that's correct.
- What is there to say? He's a liar. There are other things. This is your office? That's what we call it.
Is he telling the truth? Well, I think it's better to read the story as an allegory. Right. So, you mean... Well, he uses it as a fairy tale to explain himself.
But in every place now they say Sal de aqui Sal, sal.... I love this song. The guy is destroying it.
My ear is bleeding! Wow. This place is horrible. Now I look at a People magazine from the 90's with Tonya Harding on the cover. The red, swollen face from sick hands that touched her.
- Great. No explicit pornography. The "no explicit porn" rule is because the last one broke the computer. I can't tell you his name. We call it the Dave Rogers rule.
- Sophia. It was a pleasure and a thrill to be you for a day and see art through the eyes of a non-artist. Well, thank you again. Thanks again. And since I sweated like a pig on this thing, I cleaned it up.....
It was a pleasure and a thrill to be you for a day and see art through the eyes of a non-artist. Well, thank you again. Thanks again. And since I sweated like a pig on this thing, I cleaned it up... - ...and modernized it a little bit.
You want to bet? You started a riot over that ball you got. It's a five-year-old's. No, I caught it. You snatched it out of his weak little hands.
And Oprah said 99 percent of women wear the wrong bra. And I went to Victoria's Secret and found out that they gave you half off if you took out a credit card. I did. But I moved. I never got the bill. So I never paid it.
My apartment is too small. With no room for new inventory, these amazing charts will start going in the opposite direction. For your review. I have an office in sight and money to pay two months rent up front. But the idiot landlord won't rent it to me without a co-signer.
I made a homemade feeder. First, it's NastyGal. Second, this forum should be called David Lynch's Elephant Man because it's full of freaks and it's sad as hell. You saw that post, didn't you? - It's gone now, but I saw it.
I don't know what to do. It's your Two Lives in a Flash moment. You know, I never saw that movie. I bought a ticket and didn't go. I wonder what my life would be like if I had seen it.
It belongs to my wife. She used it when we visited that huge cavern in Kentucky. It's great. All my current misery can be traced back to the decision to sell that jacket. So I need it.
WHAT FOLLOWS IS A REALLY FREE RECAP OF TRUE EVENTS FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, HAPPY NEW YEAR! Happy New Year! Say something, please. I don't like you using this song to manipulate my feelings. I didn't ask for it to be played.
Raina! To the front of your cells. Shut your mouths for the count. Move, Teresi, or I'll put you in a wheelchair. You lay a hand on me and it'll be the last time you ever see her.
Voices on a phone, right? That's great. But I'll tell you something... You cocky motherfuckers. Because I remember telling them to send me a tape of their audition because I wanted it for their cover tape, okay?
Did they send you the tape? - Yes. - What's on it? Are you crazy? I haven't seen it.
There is going to be a lot of blood. We need to wrap him in something that won't drip. We'll have to put him in the car in something that doesn't look suspicious. With the body inside, the box is going to be heavy. So, let's not carry it.
I'm so sorry, Maya. He said he cares. - He doesn't even care. - That's not true. I give you a chance right there, right now, and you didn't take it.
Okay. Okay. Could you bring it back a couple of frames? And also, do you know the IP address of that camera? Because we're going to need it for the evidence file.
What? No. - Are you, uh... - 99.9% sure. Forensics tested a coffee cup with his saliva. Who sent it?
I'm not going to ruin that for you. I graduate in five hours! We'll get you another cap and gown. For decades, every honoree has worn that scholarship. I'm not going to be the one to lose it after I've survived earthquakes, wars, and the fire set by the '64 lunchroom gravy!
You need the car. It's yours. I don't know what to say. How about "on the nail"? I wanted that wonder on wheels ever since I saw it, but I knew my parents would never let me have it.
Good Humor" ice cream added. Can you believe it? I'm still on hold. With whom? Microsoft Azure. I'm trying to negotiate a lower rate because we'll need it if, or rather when, Richard decides to pay Burke.
It's like that fraternity game, the limp biscuit. I'm sorry, I wasn't in a fraternity. What is it? I don't think we should... Guys jerk off over a cookie. And the last one eats it.
- Yes? The patient's a panda bear. A panda? Atrial septal defect. Can you fix it?
- Yes. Excuse me, please. I just called the pharmacy. Dad hasn't given Gabe his chemotherapy in three months. He's withholding his medication. Maybe he got it somewhere else?
- We are working on it. - Let's go. - Jeff. - I'm right here. - Give me that strip, you got it?
- Maybe I should go. - No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, but I'm putting you on a 72-hour psychiatric hold. For his own good. What? Seventy-two hours? He wanted my attention, and now he's got it.
Good luck? Ethan, are you kidding me? Nat, I've known combat veterans who have been paralyzed. The feelings of inferiority can be overwhelming. If I told them a bottle of snake oil could help them walk again, they would drink it all the time.
You're welcome. Okay, I didn't want it to be like this. We're both inhuman. And as you say, we're stuck with each other, so why not make the best of it? I read your written statement and I believe it.
Do you have anything, like cyanide or...? - Cyanide? Why would I...? - Or a paper bag. You put it over my head and suffocate me quickly.
Radcliffe said he was in the Framework. Yes, but this is a contained prototype. His simulations are limited. If Radcliffe said he built a world, he must have built a more powerful standalone version. But if it is standalone, how do we find it?
You are in danger. I have many memories of snow. My first time ice skating on my neighbor's pond. One month stationed near the French Alps. But the truth is... this is the first time I've ever seen it.
- Yes. But their physical bodies will eventually give out because of it. Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter. Reality is just perception. You perceive it as real, which makes it real.
See? Good as new. - And stronger, it seems. - I know what you've done. You've stolen my mind and put it into a dirty machine.
We will change the world. Fitz, this is wrong. This is against humanity. These are inhuman. You've been a great agent, Skye, but unless I ask your opinion, don't give it to me.
More like a mass grave at the Academy. The story's a cover. I think Hydra killed me. Did you find the extraction beacon? Exactly where we programmed it.
What if... We make popcorn and watch a movie? "Chopping Mall"? - That silly robot movie again? - Don't pretend you don't love it.
The Russian has a base... under an oil platform in the Baltic. Go and save them, and leave us alone. How do we get out? Did you build a way out into the real world? Of course I did, but I suspect Aida has already discovered it.
I could have changed my life that day. But it seemed like too much responsibility. I didn't want to carry it. But now I think maybe I should have. Well, when I had that offer, I took it.
Calm down. We are not the enemy... - Let's stay calm.... - Shut your robotic mouth. Or I'll make these men shut it for you.
Okay, Wave and Mikey stay in the car, make the first contact with the guy. They'll find out what he wants, get the money and then send it... to the young people. Where do you think he's going? To get the stuff to... Exactly, he goes, he gets the food, and then he brings it to the guy and then he goes back to square one.
- Kevin Sherwood. It's best to leave him alone. - Is that a warning? You need to let me in. It's kill or be killed, boys. I've got bleach and I'll use it in your fucking eyes!
Well, what do you want to know? Everything. Who else was involved. All right, get the gun out of my face. I've got bleach and I'll use it in your fucking eyes!
I'm very glad to hear that. Do you still wish to leave Mrs. Quigley's pay? It's a blight on both of our lives. I know of a house you could use for a while. I offer it as charity, of course.
I can see why. - Was it as good as this one? - It was a good bike. An '83 Daytona Triumph. - Do you still have it?
And there's nothing you can do about it. There's something you can do, you just don't want to do it. You're talking about that woman. You want leverage over Palmer? She's the one who's got it.
Yes, I did it. Finally. Some truth in the night. Julius, I work in a legal clinic, but not as a lawyer. I was presented with an opportunity to become one and I turned it down, but then I had to stand by and watch a woman get kicked to the curb because I couldn't help her.
He died rushing to pick up our kids. What the hell does this have to do with smoking cigarettes? It shouldn't have anything to do with it, but this company doesn't care about helping people. It cares about making money. So if they can find a reason not to pay, they'll use it.
They gave us five million. Looks like you're going home soon. You did what? Shit. We had a chance and we took it.
Everything is here. Oxi, Percocet, amphetamines, pregnancy tests - what's ketamine for? Some guests have Sleeping Beauty fantasies. But girls use it too.
- A movie with a lot of... - Daya, we should get some rest. - I want my gun back from Pidge. - What? I can't believe you let her have it and not me.
- Daya, we should get some rest. - I want Pidge to give me back my gun. - What? I can't believe you'd let her have it and not me. She's giving it back to me no problem. What about you?
- He is my business partner. - Cal Roberts. - Where's Mr. Lane? He's the co-owner of the house. - We're in the process of having him sign it over to me.
Where are you, Eddie? You're a Denier. You're the son. What's behind the door? If you don't open it, you'll never escape.
I wish you would leash your child. And I wish you would help us with the other people. The ranch is not my autocratic plaything. The residents do not bow to my whims, wills and fancies. It's a place for free people who only ask for help when they need it.
You were right about that thing on Ganymede, ma'am. It was a weapons test. My team and I, and your Marines too, got caught in the middle of it. That test nearly sparked a system-wide war. The weapon is for sale and Mars wants it.
What was that? You used the protomolecule on children. What were you doing here? We were making the protomolecule do what we wanted it to do. We made it in our own likeness.
I am Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper of the Marine Corps on Mars. I request political asylum on Earth. You were right about that thing on Ganymede. It was a weapons test. The weapon is for sale and Mars wants it.
One hundred and seven years... I love that Earth thing. Well, you know what? Take that bottle with you. It's a gift. But as for the protomolecule, Sergeant Draper witnessed a revolutionary technology, and there can be no peace if one of us has it and the other doesn't.
Instantly absorbed through the skin, leaving no trace. Cardiac arrest. A divine act. This stuff was amazingly effective. But they banned it with the Brussels Law.
Sweaty but smart. Okay, can you guys close up? I have to catch the boat before it leaves for New Orleans. My cousin Tim put a voodoo curse on me. I have to talk him out of it.
And I'm going to need you to zipper up that dress. This movie is for all audiences. All right, I'll zip it up. I guess you don't want to make a sequel. The door, like the man who put it up, is well endowed.
I've got to get going. Enjoy the whiskey. Hall! Sandicot will not have a gambling license. The commission changed their mind and gave it to a city in Catskill.
All right. My friends will be your friends and your enemies will be mine.... About the secretariat, you can forget it. Thank you. I'm sure my granddaughter has already forgotten it.
Besides, you know I'll want to be out there with the looters, wiping everything out. Let's go. I see you've decided on the tarp. The tent. Yes, Lara chose it.
I don't know yet. I hope you do. Forgive him if you can. Axe asked if you have the Klaxon research. I have it here, but I haven't signed it.
I hope so. Forgive him if you can. Axe asked if you have the Klaxon research. I have it here, but I haven't signed it. Shall I tell him you'll take it away?
Forgive him if you can. Axe asked if you have Klaxon's research. I have it here, but I haven't signed it. Shall I tell him you'll take it away? I have it here, but I haven't signed it.
Crossing the Hudson wearing rebel blue? Wondering where his commanding officer has taken off to? I was looking for him. I know exactly who he is and what he is. Please, we report the war here, we don't fight it.
But you request my permission, unlike your last foray into Setauket? Yes, sir. Why fifty? Well, Culper said they have no cannon in the fort, sir, only muskets. Sir, do you think we should not risk the action, or do you not trust me to lead it?
Sorry. Tomorrow. First, there are hay pickers, then hay inspectors, then hay weighers. There are five employees for one man's work. I don't make the law, I just enforce it.
- And that's not what they say. - And what do they say? About you? In the camp? They say that if you were captured again, they would cut off your leg, the one that was wounded at Saratoga, and bury it with honors.
Because I was the one who urged Congress to declare bankruptcy last year. Well, you didn't sign on to be a politician as well as a general. But still... you can't even afford a moment to let off steam? That damn candle. I told Billy to change it.
All men are driven by something. Now I remember seeing your uncle shaking with paralysis in court, remember? That sort of thing runs in the family, doesn't it? Well, I may hate weakness, but you fear it.
You are a guest here, son. Be content with the past or leave my land. It is your land. The land belongs to the one who can keep it. The Indians couldn't, they traded it for beer money.
Be content with the past or leave my land. It is your land. The land belongs to the one who can keep it. The Indians couldn't, they traded it for beer money. I kept it, I keep it, so it's mine.
- Why do they have Ford? - I don't know. The original is made of wood. Have them put me next to Lincoln or Mao or some other revolutionary icon. Don't make that noise. Do it now! Or I'll melt the whole collection, and use it to wax Madame Tussauds' big, dirty vagina!
Ethics Committee debates closing the investigation into Rep. Lawler's trip to Nantucket. You'll vote "yes" despite the cocaine and reckless boating. He knows how to enjoy the guy. Tuesday, White House meeting on the debt ceiling. Unless they postpone it and pray we get hit by an asteroid.
- So he says. I'll go talk to them, as I will talk to everyone else, including the brewery. Inspector... If you visit the brewery, you may find that I have an arrangement whereby Brian sells me vintage beer at a favorable discount. We have been drinking it for years.
Mine got me kicked out of the army. They asked, I answered. Let's begin! Everybody get behind the chairs. I'm going to show you the routine and then explain it.
Should we steal some snacks from the restaurant before we steal Han's car? Earl, what are you doing here? You know you have the day off, right? I forgot my weed here. Then I smoked it.
You can't bring food from outside here. It's not food. It's a badly injured squirrel. All right, sit anywhere you want. Just don't let it out of the box.
- I mean, girls don't normally date their rapist. Thanks for your help. Unless there is something wrong with the girl, that is the girl the fog didn't touch. I didn't ask for your opinion. Too bad because I'll give it to you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please, no! I'm having a party at my country house. I'd be very happy if you could come too. I wouldn't miss it.
- It's the doctor. Neil sent me. Put the gun down or I'm leaving right now. What about you? I'll hold it until I know the place is safe.
You don't have anything on me, Detective. And we're back. Nice work, Murphy. Okay, it's rebooting. Just keep it in the chair. There's a tape in the storage room if you need it.
I wrote a letter to Pablo, it just came to me. - What Pablo? Your Pablo? - Well, not my Pablo, yes, to my Pablo. - I gave it to your Miguel.
- And what did you put in the note? - I don't remember! - But, Marga, Marga... The note... Where is it? I left it first thing in the mailbox of the building.
Sword and spear, sir, but a man tires of sticking irons in other men's bellies. I would have enjoyed a couple of beers with you, but I must leave you. Are you sure you have the letter? Yes, Father. I've put it next to my scrotum.
In fact, he never took it out of the holster, so... if you didn't shoot him, who did? My wife had kicked me out of the house that night. I got mad and, well, I fired a shot at the building, but I didn't point it at anybody or hurt anybody. I threw my gun into the bushes and Koblinsky came at me from behind. Exactly. He threw his gun into the bushes.
It is one of a kind. I have heard the stories of this sword. Nearly a thousand lives demanded by its obsidian steel. The man who wielded this sword would never part with it. How did you get it?
In any other direction, he will have his route blocked by one of Banneker's guards. I'll intercept him. I'll lure him here. How are we going to keep this entrance open? The others are negotiating it.
But I want you to know that I won every competition I've ever been in, and I will have you disqualified from the program if I even sense that you are trying to sabotage me. Ethan, I'm just here to help. Great, then maybe I'll even get you kicked out of school! In the meantime, could you help me with my homework? I trust you'll do well.
- Hold it against the light. "Maly Dolek, Jezyna Dolina, - Mala Wioska." - Those are the towns and cities selected for the next purge actions. I couldn't take the list, but I borrowed it long enough to punch a few holes.
The Dow Jones, the NASDAQ, and the S and P are approaching Black Monday level losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has already plunged a shocking 2000 points in a single day after the shot against President Kirkman. You better not be eating my Jell-O. It's my Jell-O. I've earned it.
We have many unanswered questions. Obviously, we still don't know who we can trust in the government. I know. I keep thinking about the designated survivor call. And if Langdon didn't make it, then who did?
Well, it's business. Does that mean you're inviting? Same thing? - Thank you. (chuckles) - I left a bottle on the desk. I guess you found it.
That's how it develops. And that light, is that the grenade detonating? Yes. At first we thought he was shot before he could throw it, but, the coroner's report was inconclusive. He may have detonated it deliberately.
Until things went off the rails. Yes, I heard... Scandals and lawsuits. The company went under. Yes, but not because he couldn't afford it, but because he felt betrayed by his own government.
Abe Leonard is going around with the story that Al-Sakar didn't blow up the Capitol. what? That's crazy. We've got the FBI, the CIA and half a dozen other agencies saying he did it. Yes, I know, and the last time Leonard had a story that I thought was crazy, the president confirmed it. Do you remember?
I was with a group of music students from a high school in New Orleans that they've named after their father. Well, he told me that their music program was going to lose funding. How familiar are you with the federal arts grants that make those programs possible? I remember that law. The sunset clause was added to get it passed by some of my more conservative colleagues.
Woodhull. Not the Woodhull of Long Island? The magistrate's son? Well, I'm very sorry for your loss. Any idea of the rebels who caused it?
I just want the chance to fight. I was ambushed by men who intended to burn me alive. And Providence helped me so that I could appear before you today. And seek revenge. And you shall have it.
From Sandstorm? I thought you said they disappeared after Jane showed up. They did. But before that, they were sending me coded messages through that marquee. I still check it every morning.
Today is about establishing contact and trust. Well, won't I need a gun or something? No, you won't. No, I'll have mine. But we won't need it.
The arrhythmia was caused by a minor defect in the septum, which means there is a small hole between two of your coronary chambers. Some people may prefer not to repair the hole and treat it with medication. But I strongly recommend surgery. Let me explain exactly how it is performed. Although it is a more serious surgery, I have performed it many times.
Is someone going to...? You know. Nothing. Ron? Has it been that bad? I have to say, when Olivia disappeared and Kevin decided to self-finance this play, against the girl who wrote it, I said to myself, "Ron, you old dog, you've won three Tony Awards and here you are,
Hi. Honey, I forgot my wallet. Did you look on the table? Yeah, it was... it was on the dresser. Oh, good. Uh... Okay, I'm glad you found it.
Okay. It's all right. It's gonna be all right. It's all right. We'll leave her. We'll leave her.
I miss them too. Jack... Someone put the soap dish back on. Yeah. You want to see if we can break it again?
And then... Are you all right? Philly left. And I decided, you know, what's the point? You know, when a tray breaks, you don't fix it.
Uh, could you...? Oh, hang on. It's girl stuff. They have a candy bar. Brand-new. I've seen it on TV, with nougat and chocolate and that crunchy wafer.
What? Lem's friends... Do you trust them? I don't know them. I don't know you either. I know a lie when I see one.
Or transform a family man into a terrorist. - What exactly do you want? - Give me the password. What password? Kaufmann e-mailed it to you.
Oh, my God. You sound like you're a Protestant. You sound like you're a Protestant. Is that a bad thing? Hey! If any of you know where my camera is, or if any of you stole it, give it back now.
I wear these lenses on my eyes One day I will win a Nobel Prize How did you record it? With the camera I found in my locker. My camera was in your locker? Yes, someone put it there.
Did you ask him about your camera? - What? - Your camera. It's in his locker. We all saw it.
I couldn't find you, I couldn't even talk to you. I had to regain some power in this situation. - I was unbalanced. - Well, it's too late now. I already made another copy and sent it to my lawyer.
But... But? Here's the "but." She puts the wrong date on the machine and goes back in time to the 1950s, where she's a horny teenager and spends the rest of the movie trying to fuck him and not her father. Look, I've seen that movie. No, you haven't. I haven't made it yet.
For years, doctors, hospitals. God, it was so sweet. But it... it moved. Sometimes a room, sometimes farther away. You'd hear her voice, and you'd follow her.
He was on and off for three years. Why was he leaving? People with schizophrenia are often subject to delusional thoughts. When David was on his medication, he was open, almost desperate to work. But when he was off it...
So you're going to create some kind of peace agreement, when? Before lunch or for dinner? Oh, sweetie. I don't care if you save me or the world... if you don't save yourself. You know the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia? - The most dangerous thing is believing you don't have it.
Do you know the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia? - The most dangerous thing is to believe you don't have it. That's the trick. That's what kills you. Your illness convinces you that you don't have it.
Fire, Klaus. Turn off the machine! Nice try. Did you think we'd use the same word to wake up your brat of a brother? You'll never find the word to save your brother. And you certainly won't find it in time to save Charles.
I have seen pain in many forms. Tears, laughter and petrified faces. But yours... it baffles me. I don't understand. You wear the mask of loss, but you don't feel it.
I'd love to prove myself against you. It was a joke, Carlos. Besides, I promised mother I would stop challenging the king of France. Don't let my crown get in the way. I know how much you want it.
It was a joke, Carlos. Besides, I promised mother I would stop defying the king of France. Don't let my crown get in the way. I know how much you want it. In fact, I bet you do.
Look. A small piece of the dryer breaks the tile landing here. Someone threw it. Probably from here. I've seen it...
I've seen it... And I've taken it, what's your point? - That it's garbage! - What the hell is going on here? We found it in the trash.
There's still one dose left! Where? What are we waiting for? A few weeks ago, I gave Major a syringe, just in case. He never used it.
Someone has stolen all the remaining doses of the cure from my office. - Someone has stolen...? - Well, let's not dwell on that. I gave you a syringe a few weeks ago. It's the last one and we need it for Liv. Do you have it with you?
My partner, Olivia Moore. Is Winslow around? My wife's picking her up from school. Everything okay? That flatbed truck out front, who's driving it?
Of course. And that letter... - The letter. When did you get it? - The letter. When did you get it?
The entire Nazi machine, everything... Airplanes, tanks, troops... All of it runs on oil. If we cripple the supply, it makes the war smaller. We end it sooner.
He took the bullets. Clever. He set off the bullets as a diversion to draw Himmler's guards away from Voigt. - Why? To assassinate him. - To assassinate him. There was a syringe with a lethal liquid hidden in the painting. I came to see who would retrieve it.
Agent Keen. Did you forget that her agent status was revoked? I didn't forget that, or the admission of guilt deal I arranged with Laurel Hitchin to keep her out of jail after she shot your AG. You don't want to hold on to the past, then hold on to this, the loss of her badge was a stain on Elizabeth's name and reputation, for which, basically, you are responsible. Your presence in her life has made her what she is today.
You should try Ginny's cheeseburger soup. The ground beef and spices, the melted cheese. I highly recommend it for the inauguration ball. If you think you can keep your immunity deal by blackmailing the president-elect for allegedly accepting illegal campaign contributions from Alexander Kirk, you're not as smart as everyone says you are. Marlin, your boss made me an election promise and I intend to make sure he keeps it.
He had access to that chip. My brother was a Marine. He died in Kandahar. Do you really think I would put this in my arm and dishonor his sacrifice by giving terrorists classified information? I don't think you gave it to him.
My brother was a Marine. He died in Kandahar. Do you really think I would put this on my arm and dishonor his sacrifice by giving terrorists classified information? I don't think you gave it to him. I think you sold it to him.
"I think he still cares about me!". It's like this. I'll tell you quickly. My wife and I bought a house in 2011. But I actually paid for it.
"Really? Well, I shopped here and I shopped there too, so I'll just put the fucking shoes wherever I want." "Look, I took my shirt off! Where will I put it?" You know what I mean? We got to the house, and she went through it, because she's smart.
I assume the R is for Raymond? I've never seen that letter before in my life. That's right. It arrived first thing this morning. I opened it, read it and then threw it away.
I get it. Why was he digging a well? He was burying something. A beautifully carved wooden box. Anyway, I clearly didn't want it... so I waited for it to go away and dug it up.
Nothing unusual. So why steal the miniature? Because, presumably, there's something there... that's not on its full-size counterpart. I made that miniature. If there was a clue, I would have seen it.
What are you talking about? You're Inspector Mallory's only alibi. The only person who can exonerate him. You want me to tell my husband that I practically did... a nude in front of one of his colleagues? I'm not saying the conversation won't be difficult, but if they don't have it... he'll hang.
Every time I look, there's a baby eating sand. I turn around, sand. Where does so much sand come from? I don't know. So I let them eat it.
What the hell happened to me? I promise I'll tell you everything, but I'm going to have to be there in person. Roman, look in your pocket. You have a coin in there, it's a very special coin. I gave it to you when we were little.
As long as you're not looking, it's fine. You want some of that pizza? Oh, no, thanks. We're not going to eat it, so... If you're not going to eat it, then why did you order it?
- Why? - No idea. DeLuca. DeLuca, wait! You called a meeting and they ignored it?
Actually, I don't want to get in the middle. We're in the middle. You're on Bailey's side on this. Richard, you're gonna have a great dinner tonight. Don't ruin it.
I'm Dr... Not Dr. Grey. She's not Dr. Grey. Where's Dr. Grey? Dr. Grey isn't available to perform your surgery, Lynne, so Dr. Kepner will be doing it with Dr. Pierce.
Well, I need you not to be on vacation. - No. - Please. Please. Come on. Come on. She's this sweet little nun and she needs open heart surgery but they can't do it until the aneurysm in her brain is sealed.
- Thank you. You lived here with your parents, didn't you? Yes. I've lived here most of my life. Well, my mother left it to me and Andi-Rae.
We are all trying to survive up here... I've got my sons... and you're fucking more than the rest of us! We need this water! We all need water! We all need it!
Let's send the old man. Yeah. No problem. Yeah. Where's your magic wand when you need it?
No, that's all right. Well, Frank, I'm sorry about the hose. Oh, no, no hard feelings. The shirt needed freshening up anyway. I haven't washed it since we stopped to take pictures at the Smokey-Top, Utah's oldest continuous tire burn.
Overruled. Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Fisk? They kept changing the air date. They kept pushing it back.
We face people coming after us for the slightest infraction. Well, how do we defend ourselves? Simple exaggeration. Really? I haven't used it since college, but okay.
But why? We can't put him on the stand knowing he's going to perjure himself. He can only tell something that is true or potentially true. God, I love the law. They take it all so seriously.
No, he didn't. He asked me to get out of the car so he could examine it. Then he handcuffs me and tells me I'm under arrest for possession of heroin. Was he in possession of heroin? No, he planted it.
Because he was young, sadly dumb and.... Unarmed? You know that if you had possessed the Burning Sword, the weapon that protected Eden, the weapon that can break anything, even the very Gates of Heaven, well, you would have won that rebellion. Why are you living in the past? The fact is, I didn't have the sword and Dad destroyed it soon after, so....
We have everything we need to get home. The sword of Azrael. Are you sure? I'm positive. So if we could get your brother to stop drinking and show us where he hid it...
So if we could get your brother to stop drinking and show us where he's been hiding it... I just wanted you to tell him what you told me, before you made a mess. What mess are you gonna... That's where she's been all this time? I put her in a place where I could keep an eye on her.
You didn't want someone to incite another wave of stabbings, did you? Well, it's not my fault that humans can't handle the divine. Besides, if I hadn't, we wouldn't have found out what that sword really is. And do you really think this is the Burning Sword? I thought Father destroyed it during my rebellion so I couldn't use it against Him.
Well, it's not my fault that humans can't handle the divine. Besides, if I hadn't, we wouldn't have discovered what that sword really is. And do you really think this is the Fiery Sword? I thought Father destroyed it during my rebellion so that I could not use it against Him. Father said he destroyed it.
Besides, if I hadn't, we wouldn't have found out what that sword really is. And do you really think this is the Burning Sword? I thought Father destroyed it during my rebellion so I couldn't use it against him. Father said he destroyed it. Apparently, he hid it in plain sight.
No, verbally atrocious. Horrible grammar. Got it. Did you see the fight? Everyone saw it.
Just before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The piece is here." I mean, I thought it was silly, but... that must be why the sword didn't work. It wasn't complete. Dad supposedly destroyed the Burning Sword after the rebellion. So, you're saying he only broke it into two pieces? Azrael's sword...
And guess who has the key. Well, don't leave me in suspense. Who is it, brother? He says God entrusted the key to his favorite son. Of course he gave it to you.
- Brother... - That Dad's favorite, despite all he's done, is and always has been you. Look down. Is that the key around your neck or are you just glad to see me? I entrust it... to you, brother.
It's Cheval something. It's valuable, so it must be good. I didn't expect to see you and your... mortal light again so soon. Well, something's been bothering me. When you first saw my wound .... you asked if Lucifer had done it.
- In every way. - I know. And he doesn't care who he hurts anymore. Linda. I'll go see Linda. You go get Mama, she'll listen to you. But, Luci, don't you dare promise her the piece, because I won't give it to her.
The car bomb. It was as if your security team knew where to look. - And you think I told them? - No one else knew. Except the weapons experts who made the bomb and the mechanic who installed it.
What kind of problem do you think we are having? In the last few millennia our magnetic field has decreased by more than 5% per century, and in the last 100 years it has accelerated by 10%. I would like to focus on preventing solar megastorms from destroying our nation's infrastructure. That is my point, Madam Chairman. If our magnetic field is reduced or disappears due to polarity reversal, then the same storm would cause epic tectonic rifts and atmospheric erosion, and the end of humanity as we know it,
- Your invitation. What about it? I see you were upset to receive it. Look, I didn't even know if I should send it. I kept it for a long time, but then I thought, if I didn't invite you, you'd be hurt.
And that's what I'm doing. Now, a Leyden bottle basically is a container made of an insulating material, like Cynthia's bottle...filled with salt water from the ground up to the roots. Then I wrap the metal...around the container. Then I insert this...through the center. This tip collects ambient electricity...and stores it.
He had been watching her for weeks. She had no idea. Matty, if you want to wait outside, maybe... No. No, the key to catching this fucker is in this room and we'll find it.
Yes, and then they got married. They got pregnant, and then their daughter has a heart tumor. I thought you had a TMLR. Yeah, I thought you had a ventral hernia repair. I did, but I postponed it.
He asked me to keep them until you need them. I think you need them. Put yourself in Pandora's shoes. She got a gift... a wonderful box, filled with things she didn't even know existed. Of course she opened it.
Don't worry. I'm here. Good. How's your hand? I hit it on something.
So maybe this is another black spring? I... I spent six years in prison. for doing really terrible things, so, if that was the case, I'd be the first to go. What was I looking at? The gray figure out there, did you see it?
I love that song. I love it too. I find it comforting. My father used to beat my mother. My sister would take my brother and me to her room, and she would play it, play it as loud as she could.
I had never held a boy's hand before. I always wanted to... But you know how people are. I thought it was going to kill me, so I promised myself, if I survived, I would do that. Hold a boy's hand. I'd hold it, I'd walk out on the street, and I wouldn't give a fuck what they thought.
That's all I know. What about last night? Did he say anything to you about that night? He was here. We rented a movie at Blockbuster, watched it after Raimy went to bed.
- Yes? Yes. - Yeah. What movie? "Twister". - Have you seen it?
We are the only ones between those monsters and our home. - If we run, they will kill everyone. - How can we win? This sword... is called Hrunting. It was enchanted with white magic... so that whoever wields it in battle will be proclaimed a hero.
Papa... Don't listen to him, Bae. He's just jealous. Maybe, but he's right about the magic. The war is over, you don't need it anymore.
Do you think your son will stop me? You may have ended the Ogre War... but I will be remembered as the hero who defeated Mr. Dark One. This book has the spell to repair the sword. Recovering its power will be harder than you think. It requires the blood of the one who forged it.
Ask yourself: What will a magician need if dark days come? Answer: magic. But if there is not, there is not, you say. Not be so, if you store it as a battery.
I'm an idiot, a fat, talentless failure. Even your magic pills haven't worked. - What magic pills? - Those in your bag. I filled it with other pills to stay out of trouble.
You got everything you wanted, and now you realize you don't want to sacrifice your soul, so you're trying to get out of it, right? How? Finally. Where's the last piece? I don't have it.
Finally, where is the last piece? I don't have it. I swear to you. I don't have it.
These could shed new light on these events. Crucial information about the philosopher's stone. Yes. This particular missive contains hidden information from a clandestine meeting between Washington and Benjamin Banneker. Mr. Banneker, you found it, didn't you?
Come on! Who's shooting at us? I don't know. We must be on top of the talisman piece. I think something doesn't want us to get it.
His version was the fairy tale that highlighted the dealings with the mortal creature. His ability to take human form. Not only that, he would disguise himself in someone he trusted, someone close to him. In the case of the Pilgrims, the dead girl's father, Captain William Bradford. Finally, they defeated the creature, and buried it in a chamber underground, sealed with an enchanted stone.
The guy has to touch me, I say "First buy me lunch". Once he did. Very uncomfortable. Listen, I need you to come get me. - There's the bucket if you need it.
That's right. It's disgusting. It's Artie again, Titus. But the lyrics... If you sell it, nobody cares what a song is about.
Let's see. She specializes in experimental drugs that reverse brain degeneration. Do you have a photograph? Yes. I'm sending it to you.
It's a joke I was planning to make without you. - I saw no reason to change it. - I have. It's what they expect of me. If she needs more confidence, will you take it?
- When? - Soon. How? I'm waiting for a signal from the FSB. When I get it, I'll have to take you somewhere... a 5-hour drive from here.
Because I'm beginning to understand how they work. We use what works. Your friend Shahanah gave you this bracelet, right? The exact same one. She never wears it, it's a shame.
On the left, the one held by Malotru. They look the same. But there are differences. In this one I ask him a question. And in this one... he answers it.
A good father. Yes, you can say that you have been our father. We would give everything for you and to please you. - Then give me your youth, Marie Jeanne. - You have already taken it from me.
- Were you trying to defraud the insurance company? - That's outrageous! Did you kill Walter Dunn? What? Did you kill him, take his gun and use it to rob your own office?
Maybe Alice killed him and you needed to get her away. She was at the dentist the night he died. She was at church. I have the prescription. I've never seen it before.
I had never seen it before. I don't know how it got there. There's a button missing. Like there was some kind of fight. I've never seen it before.
How did she look? Devonshire looked beautiful, sir. God be with you. What binds a man to his land? What inner power enables him to give his life to preserve his land and the lives of the families who work it?
I am going to send you a picture of a map that is in her house. It's all the places and operations where Lydia has been. I'll see if it matches any AIC activities. I'll bring the proof and you take it to him.
I know. It's time to grow up, Kar. It's time to fight your battle. How does this work? It poisons the light when the beast eats it.
For what it's worth, I have a plan. It feeds on light but is attracted to sound. - So what's going to happen? - It's simple. A little noise, we lure the beast here, drive it back to the door.
It feeds on light but is attracted to sound. - So what's going to happen? - It's simple. A little noise, we lure the beast here, drive it back to the door. But how do we keep it here?
Let's go. Someone's on caffeine this morning. You said you had a case. Your government's Witness Protection list has been stolen. Do you know who stole it?
From the Giannusa Mafia in New Jersey. Justice has a case pending against him for racketeering. Not if his star witnesses are dead. If Giannusa gets us the witness list, why don't we go after him ourselves? Because you don't know if he has it or where to get it.
Does he know you're FBI? Keen, we need to get you out. Margot's contact says Helldritch is in Hong Kong. We have no jurisdiction there. Our only chance of getting the witness list back is if The Harem steals it and I have to be there.
You're acting like it's too late. It's not, you can still get out. I dream about it, about the life I had, wishing I could get it back. I can help you. The protected witness list, when we get it back, I can get you on it.
Eva Taylor and Lily Hum. Aram, can you...? - I'm already tracking them down. - Hey, what's with the list? Emma took it.
- There are. Like the best wines. God! I can't wait to get back to Chiswick. Yeah, because London urine is like sparkling water, - you drink it and piss it away as it is. - Something like that, yeah.
Go to the closet on the right. No, not the one on the left! Don't go to the one on the left. Okay, inside, you'll see a gray safe. I need you to open it.
I can barely remember what it's like to be human. Liv. The syringes... they're gone. I gave you a syringe a few weeks ago. It's the last one, and we need it for Liv. Do you have it with you?
I can't imagine a life without all that. Then Tinkerbell was wrong. That's not your happy ending. No, it's not. But she gave me hope when I needed it most and that's just as important.
He talks a lot, doesn't he? Keep an eye on him, Carol. Despite not having a fucking clue about golf, that wasn't going to stop me from pretending otherwise. Or, to be more precise, from looking like a children's TV presenter who dressed in the dark. Meanwhile, Fitzpatrick was discovering that the new technology is only as reliable as the fucking idiot operating it.
I can show you how it works. Ten minutes of prep, and you put it in the oven for 35 minutes. - That's it? - That's it. Well, I used to make my own tomato sauce, but with the crazy schedule I have, I just buy it from a jar.
They have defended ideals that are above them, and that takes courage. And you've shown a lot of courage too. I haven't done anything. Yes, you have. Despite all the crap you've had to put up with, you wanted to know the truth and you faced it.
I have a permit for this, I'm in the military. That's right. I want to see some ID. - Right away. - I don't have it with me.
It is a gift from our youngest daughter and deserves a place of honor." "I think it's horrible. It's horrible." "Marilyn!" "I'll put it in the basement."
Hopefully the foot of a doll. A direct-to-consumer dog bakery. Stella and I went to one of those in Solvang. She had a quiche. It looked so good I almost shared it with her.
I need a scotch and a James Bond marathon. You may be jinxed. The TV wasn't working a minute ago. Sounds like it's the satellite dish. Big hands sure messed up my gutters.
Wait a minute, Bob, that's my son. - Luke, what's wrong? - What's the matter, Dad? I think there's something wrong with the dryer. But I fixed it.
Are you saying Laurie can survive this overthrow? Then why did you tell me to ally myself with Ed Chen? I say a lot of things, Monica. I say a lot of things. I know you think I'm some kind of hero who built a time bomb and planted it on Gavin Belson, to take him down in retaliation for his wrongdoing.
I think it's all over for me. No, it's not over. Look, I... I chose you as a partner, that says something. You didn't want me, you wanted the patent. If I'd given it to you, you'd have walked away without looking back.
We have to turn the lights back on. Come on, let's go... Ryan, stop, stop. My gun. I think someone took it.
The fence is electric. It is not a cross. It's a mark on the fence. You'd have to keep your hand there for a long time. Or have someone else hold it for you.
I have to go and see it. But I promise it won't take long. Save me a piece. Hey, and, Raims, go back and color the spare key. I didn't take it!
Police! Show me your hands! Drop it! The deed to the house is still in my name, right? Decker got it in the divorce?
I need your help. I'm sorry about this one... Sorry about this one... There's a list of names there. I need you to show it to me.
Loretta Dunkel? Fuck me! - Now I know where you live. - I want my dough! Yeah! I earned it!
- It's such a glorious day... - Courtney? - Actually, Courtney is me. I love your bonnet. Did you make it yourself?
- Actually, Courtney is me. I love your bonnet. Did you make it yourself? No. I bought it from a craftsman who makes them.
Or his people don't trust him. Maybe we shouldn't either. We put it in the milk! We tell Voss, new idea. We suspend the coke inside a container loaded with milk, ship it across the border, then return it to its glass state.
You're pathetic, Novak. I'm done with you, man. All charges against the Mennonites have been dropped because of your incompetence, Novak. Not theirs, yours! So, if you can still find your badge, I want it on my desk.
What will you kill me? How did you kill my father? You know what, Arman? You know a lot of things, but the important thing is what you don't understand. And that is that money sometimes requires sacrifices. By the way, did you finish Olga's portrait? - Why? I have a new photograph. - I have a new photograph. I'll send it to you right away.
Yes, the prosecutor shows a lot of confidence in letting Chantal take over - it could be a big career leap. But after Roy's outburst in her office, her boss is worried that she's not focused. It could take her off the case. I don't want what I did to cause her any trouble. This mark, see it?
Well, one of them has to be Fen. Okay, let me get this straight. What the hell is going on? I'm sorry, your highness. But this magic, I've never seen it before.
Dad. - Oh, Evan, hey. What's up? - I've got a problem. The letter was here, stamped and addressed, and now it's gone. Your mother probably mailed it.
No way. You know, $5 could save an entire whale. Okay, now let's go over the plan again. I pretend to lose my car keys through this grate, so when the mailman comes to help me, I knock the mail out of his hands, take the letter and rip it up.
Last question: Did any famous dogs stay there? - The artist's dog. - What? A table was vacated if you want it.
Oh, man, I got songs. I've got a lot, man. I just haven't had a chance to go to a professional studio. I've got a demo tape I can give you. Look, I love Nashville and I love country music, and we honor and respect it.
She didn't get the help she would have needed. But she didn't give up. She didn't. It wasn't the easy way she chose. If there had been a choice, she would have chosen it. Whatever the cost.
Who have you met? I know people. - Hope to see you again soon, Leif. Can you help me put the stove on the sidewalk? Someone will take it away.
- Naustvik. - Naustvik. I never heard of him. But the information I give you when we meet, what do you use it for?
Not only am I going to get laid in this van, but I want to get laid in it. Fuck. If the pope was a redneck, he'd have a van like this. - Where'd you get it? - Neumann's Hill gave it to me last night.
I brought you something. Oh, shit. It's my St. Christopher medal. It's supposed to protect you. I know it's silly, but when I played soccer, I had four knee surgeries. I always wore it and everything went fine.
Thank you. "You and genital warts." Why are you guys kayaking? Well, Mom. I thawed out the pipe in the attic, drained it and replaced what was broken.
- Yes, I think so. We should participate. We used to win in high school. Let's use Uncle Jimmy's fishing cabin. He won't need it for the next three to five years.
They were together for a long time. Jim passed away years ago, and I still think about him. The other day, I was cleaning out the garage and I found a shirt of his that I had worn on our honeymoon. And I smelled it to bring him back, I guess. I forgot we used it as a rag for the turpentine.
Sulu. Enlarge image of primary hull. Defiant? Affirmative. The ship's wave signature is out of phase since we last encountered it.
I did what I had to do... to save him. When I found him, he was as young as you. Now he's a shadow of yourself. Careful. A shadow can be bigger than the man who casts it.
Put a little judgment in his head. To what purpose, doctor? We're well aware that it won't change your mind. Samara and I will take the Enterprise to a safe distance. Then we'll enter the fissure and close it.
Isn't it a little strange? It always seemed a little strange to me. Strange why? Because your brother wouldn't let go of that camera at all. It doesn't make sense that he'd leave it behind.
Damn it! We'll use this as a flashlight. Shine it in front of me. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Don't drop it.
Then he takes the raw ones. He knows what he has. I didn't want to include just the raw ones and have the Navy take it all apart or the bureaucrats at the Pentagon. He wanted to make a film. He got the film out and went and brought it back to Washington.
He wanted to make a movie. He got the film out and went and brought it back to Washington. VOICE OF ROBERT PARRISH How he did it, I don't know. I think he said it was a cigar box or something. I don't know how he got it out, but he got it out.
This book was written 20 years ago. The plan it predicted has become reality. Audiences saw a picture of the black population that no film had ever attempted to portray. The film had great showings in both black and white markets. Noted poet and writer Langston Hughes praised the film and called it "distinctive and emotionally valuable."
"We don't need any more of this." Not only from a practical point of view, but also from a human point of view. After three days with no sign of Japanese surrender a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. I now invite the representatives of the Emperor of Japan of the Japanese government.... GRAL. MACARTHUR ALLIED FORCES ...and of the general base of the Japanese Empire to sign this document of surrender at the places indicated. Let us pray that peace may be restored to the world and that God may preserve it forever.
Instead, in 1950, he re-emerged.... I hated that he left comedy to do the things he did later for that more serious material because nobody could do comedy like he could. Stevens had taken the footage he had shot in the war and in Dachau and put it under lock and key in storage. He took them out only once, in 1959 when he was preparing to direct The Diary of Anne Frank. He went alone to the projection room to watch the scenes, played the first tape, and after a minute, turned it off.
Go away! You look very anxious. What's going on? We need 24-hour surveillance for Güero. For his bullshit about Phoenix and the Middle East. Nobody buys a shirt unless there's a girl who can take it off.
It's our daughter, Camila! Tell me, how much do we have to pay this man? Three million dollars. Listen, I'm going to put up the cash for the first payment. Then I'm going to take the coke you got, I'm going to distribute it and then I'm going to settle the debt with that psychotic fanatic.
I should have killed him in Bolivia. He can't stay here. I'm not ready to make that decision yet. First you have to move the merchandise. You're not giving it to Epifanio.
Need a troop? I've got it. The entrance is in the van on the left. Shit, you weren't lying. The coke comes from Mexico through the tunnel, and then the vans take it to Dallas.
No. No way. Like the social event of the season...your son's engagement party. We've already used my personal life. - We're not using it again.
Better. It is no longer inflamed. We have to keep rubbing it with echinacea, mornings and evenings. Do savages know echinacea? They call it tuka natsu.
- You have to leave. - No. Why? Nobody wants you here. Do you understand that? They've been waiting for an excuse. My father has given it to them.
That's good friend stuff. Okay, let me throw a hypothetical question at you. Nick has lint on his sleeve - do you go, "Hey, man, you've got lint on your sleeve?" or do you remove it?
A little fuzz on his sleeve. - It wouldn't do anything. - That you would just want to... Fine! I'd grab it with my bare hands!
I'm going to tell her that Don burned her and I'll be free from the shackles of this lie forever. Just promise me you'll keep my secret. It's okay, Lowell, everyone has secrets. Andi's famous ginger chicken soup? We bought it at a gas station.
It's okay, Lowell, everyone has secrets. Andi's famous ginger chicken soup? We bought it at a gas station. It was really just chicken soup that we poured into the ginger jar. - I'd throw it in.
Not without buffalo tranquilizer. Don't put my pants on fire! Calm down, sister. Of course it's our house. Mom and Dad left it to all of us.
You shouldn't be surprised, he looks just like you. It doesn't look anything like me. When my father gave me that knife, I said, "Thank you, sir," and shook his hand. It's the fondest memory you've ever shared with me. That night I stuck it in the head of a possum that was eating my mother's flowers.
Yes, but I call your office, - you don't call me back. - I have a lot of calls. I'll tell you what. Put your concerns in a letter and I'll read it, I promise.
We got through it. I don't know why I still use birth control. There is a pill for men now, did you know that? It's still in the testing phase, but I want him to take it right away.
She probably still has me on her answering machine. You told me that was your mother. Can I have my drink? Yeah. I'll get it for you.
- I'm a little cold. - Yeah? I'm warm. I'll open the window. If you're looking for your drink, I've put it there.
This is a good one. After this one we switch. Are you turning on the light? I'm turning it on. And I'm shaking it.
This is tearing us apart. Bob, you're ruining the egg hunt. No, you are! Stop it! You both ruined it!
And Tina and Gene feel the same way. Okay, you're right, they do. - What? - You don't like egg hunts? It's not that we don't like it, it's just that we hate it.
Okay, you're right, it's like this. - What? - You don't like egg hunts? It's not that we don't like it, it's just that we hate it. You hate it?
How did he do it? He's the smartest guy in the room. Hi. Paige, we can't turn the music off in this thing! I didn't know that when I rented it, just check the manual.
Isn't it beautiful? Yes. It's certainly interesting. There's a lot of dirt here. Sal says I hog all the energy, but I need it.
Who the fuck are you calling a rejectionist, you bumbling, tail-less big-headed bumbler? Bumbler? The High Evolutionary Majesty is no bumbler! Let me prove it to you. I have absorbed the fundamental genetic clay of thousands of living beings and molded it to perfection.
What did your brother know that you didn't want to come out? Look, Roman would have killed me or died trying rather than let me bring him to the FBI, so erasing his memories was the only option I had. And this decision you made to erase all knowledge of your most valuable asset, was that made with Deputy Director Weller's approval? No. I made it on my own.
Yeah, right. I dragged you here. Yes... You know all your stuff is getting wet? The people who had the house before me... said they waterproofed it in the '90s.
I thought you were a P.E. teacher? Jesus Christ! Is that my money? - Give me the card! - I don't have it.
- Give me the card! - I don't have it. - Give me the damn card! - I wouldn't do that! I don't have it on me!
- Give me the damn card! - I wouldn't do that! I don't have it on me! It's in the mail. I sent it to your wife.
I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Everyone in the boardroom was afraid of him. A newly minted woman would walk in, wearing heels and carrying a purse. Without saying a word, she would circle the table, with a malevolent look on her face. Then she would stop at the head of the table and stare at us. She would reach into the purse, pull out her ancient cock and toss it on the table.
- I'm afraid that won't be possible. Krilov is a person of interest in a criminal investigation. I want to cooperate, but he is a guest. And the letter is private property. I can't let them take it without a warrant.
Priority three. There were three men. At first, I didn't see the body. Just... a rug or a rolled-up tarp. But when they put it in the back of the truck...
Krilov was hired to modify someone's memory. We confiscated his lab. Then he stole yours. But his memory, the night of the fire. He erased it 25 years ago.
We confiscated his lab. Then he stole hers. But his memory, the night of the fire. He erased it from me 25 years ago. That's why we need you to get it back.
Okay, we are now officially out of "Reader's Digest" territory. - What are you talking about? - Okay. The Soyuz is kind of like a space cab. So, if we could at least get them to drive it to the satellite.
I went over the report six times before calling. Seventeen years ago, you recovered a gun that was the same caliber, make and model. But the bullet itself was too disfigured for conclusive identification. Luckily, microscopy has improved a bit since then. So I pulled the original bullet and compared it to the one from today's murder. The ballistic markings, they are identical.
Apparently the same gun was used in the Ruffalo murder. - That's impossible. - Yeah, I know that. That's what I said, but... - Well, who was handling it?
I turned my life around. You know who else looks different these days? Terrance Valentine. The man you put in prison for a crime you committed. The gun... you kept all these years... your son used it to kill someone last night.
And he turned to walk away. And then... I pulled out the gun. Just to show him that I was serious. And... and he said, "Bitch, you gonna bring a gun? You better be ready to use it." And I don't even remember pulling the trigger. But after it went off, I dropped it and ran.
I worked a lot of cases with the guy. He had no problem taking care of all the details. Why did he keep the gun? I didn't know it was the same gun. Otherwise, he would have thrown it in the river.
I am and so is Anna, but she also knows that if the treatment stops working, extreme measures won't change anything. Look, this is not a white flag. It's a worst-case scenario. She said she had a fever. She did, but we're treating her.
I can't find my wallet. Let me treat you. My coffee, your yogurt. Come on, come sit down. I think someone stole it.
Someone will come pick you up, okay? Dr. Stohl, I... I found your cup. Where? Thank you. I'll call maintenance and have them take it down.
If I succeed, you as the boss win. If I fail... I'm a dead man anyway. Manners are manners. And you skipped them. I looked at the opportunity... and I took it.
No, you are getting off the subject. I just want you to admit that you only stopped me because I'm black and apologize and say you won't do it again! Hey, listen. We wouldn't even be having this conversation if you had your badge with you. Next time, don't forget it.
Won't they look at what? Christina! How are you? Nice jacket. Where did you get it? You know, I bought it at Mervyn's.
Captain Holt's mother. The creator. Becoming a widow at 39, Laverne Kinnebrew Holt raised two children alone and still managed to become one of the first black female federal judges. Someone has read her Wikipedia page. No, Jake, I wrote it.
A place with so many stains that new ones go unnoticed. Where the couch cushions were so worn, they welcomed any kind of ass, big or small, flat or appetizing. - Appetizing? - Disgusting. We created a masterpiece, and you amateurs flushed it down the toilet.
Well, it's not going to happen. Besides, we are not cowabunga people. You are dismissed. I repeat, I'm very sorry about your wheel. I accidentally slashed it with my knife.
- No, you! - Gina, as you know, my fountain pen is being recalibrated in Germany. Yes, people keep talking about it. Because of your absence, I borrowed Amy's favorite, and... I've lost it.
- It's very clumsy. If the wrong person saw that recording, they might get the wrong idea. Well, I've seen the recording and I've been stunned at how clumsy that guy was. - Wasn't he? - And the funny thing is, I wanted to save the recording, but I accidentally deleted it.
- Hey! Do you know what happened to Phil? Yeah, I couldn't stop the bleeding. You couldn't stop the bleeding. But what happened was we made you think you had to stop it.
But if we can create a twenty thousand volt beam in the sand pit.... That will create a glass barrier in the middle of the coal seam, cutting off the deposit fire. Okay, but how are you going to create a lightning bolt? Sand is an insulator. We'll wet it with saline solution to conduct electricity.
Happy, how are we doing with the solution? I think we have something. The fire chief's hose covers the airport, which means it carries a tank of high expansion concentrate for jet fuel. Let's remove the nozzle from the hose. Cabe slides it through the cracks in the rocks.
I think we have something. The fire chief's hose covers the airport, which means it carries a tank of high expansion concentrate for jet fuel. Let's remove the nozzle from the hose. Cabe slips it through the cracks in the rocks. You need to tie a knot in the bottom of the hose and place it under the rocks that have you trapped.
I think he wins. My father abandoned us, and every time she looked at me, she was reminded of it. - That's so sad. - What about my story? It's sad, too, but I've heard it so many times before.
How long have we been gone? - I'm home. - Kitchen. What's going on? I'm trying to get him to take this pill, but he keeps spitting it out.
- Yeah, plus, remember how much time is spent at home when you have a baby? I can't do that anymore. I'd be downstairs until the kid was old enough to help me upstairs. Well, that's a good point. The other day, I dropped a strawberry and put it under the fridge.
Yes, according to this diary, you have found a small skeleton in an elf costume, now you know why. After the dinner incident things became more tense. Some clung desperately to hope. For that bottle to reach Allie, it has to go down into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, get swept into the Benguela, get caught in the South Equatorial Current, switch to the North Current, somehow find its way to the Gulf Stream and hope that some Florida fisherman finds it and mails it to her.

And, if I know my Florida fishermen, they would probably keep it.
- You are on my team. I sincerely hope you didn't come here for the radio. Walt, we need it to monitor storms and locations of other ships. You're going to sink it. Plus we need her for her handle and some of her components to create a charge on the magnet.
I sincerely hope you didn't come here for the radio. Walt, we need it to monitor storms and locations of other ships. You're going to sink it. Plus we need it for its handle and some of its components to create a charge on the magnet. No, no, you'll destroy it.
We've got a problem here. Where's the crank? The radio is useless without it. What are you trying to do? I swear, I hid it here.
You had a lot of ups and downs with your emotional quotient, but you always seemed to be moving forward. You know, my enormous excitement right now makes me... I'm feeling... Well, a little sick to my stomach. Do you have a bottle of wine upstairs? Someone gave it to us after a job.
I'm sure Mr. Fontino's family will enjoy the blood money to be made as soon as Houston Spivey's name is recruited. The lab says the blood in Fontino's trunk matched the victims. And he knew about the murder weapon. He knew about it, but he couldn't show it, could he? He said he threw it off the Staten Island Ferry.
But as I said, it was the worst throw of his life. Both victims' blood and his prints are all over the place. What happened? Did he think he heard someone approaching? Did he panic, throw her as far as he could?
Where's my skateboard?" "Fuck you, Joe. Fuck you." Don't buy that skateboard. I don't even know why they sell it here.
We wanted to tell the consequences that these events would have. If we could tell a story, not just one with integrity.... EXECUTIVE PRODUCER ...but one that managed to reach young people, who aren't usually exposed to reality in their entertainment, hopefully, it could become something that was an honest representation of their experience. The photo taken of Hannah was innocent. But an unflattering photo taken out of context, posted by a guy with a certain reputation or saying something, and if the story is turned around, it can ultimately destroy someone. And when Bryce takes Justin's photo and sends it to the entire school, it's the beginning of the end for her.
You need to start opening up to us. Just tell us what's going on. It's hard to be the parent of a teenager. Teens are trying to establish some independence. Sometimes when they would like help on some level, they are also rejecting it.
If you don't have a date, I'll go with you to graduation. Oh, I sure wish I had someone like a mom. I'd do your homework when you didn't want me to. You'd let me have an iguana. As long as you'd take care of it.
I will kill myself. You can do it. Just that one time. But they can. It's interesting because even if life gets bad, people choose it.
They never know. "Shall I tell you something about the whore?". "She's afraid of coins. We think maybe someone threw bunches of coins in her face. Other than that, no." So you take that whore, and you put her in your house with your family... and you watch her personality emerge.
"Hi, what's the job about?". And they tell them, "We need you to do this. We need you to make the kids know math." "Do they want to know math?". "No, they don't want to know math. You have to make them learn it against their will.
But anyway... Everything was different. This building is no longer here. But... They look at it over something dusty and full of rubble.
And when I change the channel and it's on, I stop. And then I play the game of chicken with this movie. I stop because it's a good movie. It's well made, directed by Steven Soderbergh, a good director. And so I watch it, I get into the story, and then they get naked.
- The zombie protagonist. I'm not a... I'm Lieutenant Cyril Figgis of the L.A.P.D., you mongoloids! - I showed you my badge! - And if you show it to me again...
I'm Lieutenant Cyril Figgis of the L.A.P.D., Mongolos! - I showed you my badge! - And if you show it to me again... No. Whoever attacked me took it off me.
They have no problem killing cops, Bob Lee. It's not going to be any different with a war hero. I appreciate your concern, but Dobbs was my brother. There's a neighborhood, if you can call it that, off Highway 7. You'll know the house when you see it.
Bolivian coke. 98 percent pure? 98 percent. Let's put an end to it. Did you buy it or steal it?
Hesitation is like taking a step in fear. I needed to step hard. Somehow I had to force him to see me. You wanted my attention, Mrs. Vargas? You have it.
Find your car. To see Devon. We'll get you some help. You wanted my attention, Mrs. Vargas? You have it. I'll be on my way.
Take the elevator to P3 and wait for me. - Okay, I've got a plan. - I have a plan. I've mourned my dad long enough and the asshole wouldn't even leave me his motorcycle. You would have wrecked it by now anyway.
While you are discussing the bioethics of invisible snakes, I think I know one way to look at it. Anacondas and pythons can survive up to 14 weeks without food. Our window of opportunity to capture this thing is closing. Think your white whale is here, Max. No, don't kill it!
Yes, I understand. Electrify it. Okay, we're close. That thing is very clever. Dr. Abe improvised it in a matter of minutes.
Granting you immunity in exchange for your testimony takes away your right to invoke the Fifth. How can they do that, take away my constitutional right by granting me something I don't want? I don't want immunity. You can... I refuse to let you grant it to me.
I'm sorry... why are you telling me this? Because I meant it. I'm angry that you still don't know why Reddington came into your life. The blood on this shirt from Raymond Reddington's shirt has been sealed inside an evidence box for over three decades. I got a sample and sent it off for a DNA profile.
No, our question is: did he know? Because if he does and he withholds evidence that could put Ukhov in jail, then obviously that would make him an accessory to murder. I swear to you, if I had known any of what they say, I would have called the police myself. I have no idea what Ukhov did with that information. I mailed it to him yesterday and we haven't spoken since.
But it is information from him that we need. In a moment, if you agree, you and I will call a bank in the Cayman Islands and ask for information about the account there. The account belongs to a company that has billed your husband's company millions of dollars over the years in "document handling fees". The truth is that these billings are lies. Her husband also owns that company and uses it to hide money.
Are you a man or a woman? The first answers were: "I am a man". And I am taking on a language, a culture that is feminine. I am invading that area and claiming it for my use.
Actually, we already reviewed it. At the time of Nanette Vlasik's death, her camera was recording footage of different costumed characters near Times Square. That's right. I was looking for my next target in the game. The problem is that whoever was using that camera never spoke, never turned it on himself, never filmed any reflective surfaces.
So, Clem and her pregnancy, what's the factor in all this? The child has a unique protein. Unlike anything I've ever seen. It shows even greater potential than the NLRP2 protein to synthesize the reproductive hormone that we need. I'm going to call it the MLC protein.
Misfortunes have been happening for years. Both in my house and in the one next door. An important writer used to live there, but he died of an illness and it became empty. They say that at night you can hear the piano and see a ghost in a white dress. In the neighborhood they call it the haunted house.
My heart needs to be free to spread the wings of imagination. How could I admire it the other day? Let's play together, Masamune. Yamada-sensei, weren't you going to create the ultimate light novel? I will create it, have no doubt.
I never visited the crime scene. I never spoke to the friends and family of the victim or the alleged killer. You were never asked. And the chain still hasn't been found. What if that's because Luke Munro was telling the truth and the real culprit took it with him when he fled?
What went wrong there? A few days ago I went to Mr. Folsom's home with two of our consultants. One of them noticed an encryption device in his apartment. It may be that Mr. Folsom noticed it, that he realized we could track his communications. This morning's operation was to look for hard evidence, we didn't get it.
Usually, for cocaine, a patient presents symptoms like someone going into cardiac arrest. He's drenched in sweat, but that's about it. This guy's eyes were very red. And it looked like there was a chemical burn in the nasal cavity. I'm pretty sure it was bleach. We found his stash at the scene, sent it to the lab for analysis, but I thought I felt traces of bleach.
I don't want to brag or anything. But it's in my stomach right now. And I realized that you don't eat in a restaurant like you eat at home, you know? At home, you would never put a chop in a pan to fry it on one side, flip it over, fry it on the other side, cut it up to see if it's cooked and then say, "Wow, I'm going to love eating this chop. As soon as it's cooked through, I'll eat it.
I mean, you're the victim here, right? I remember at our wedding I was thinking, 'I'm going to seduce every relative of my wife's regardless of gender, I'll fuck them all. And then, I'm going to invite them into the house and set it on fire, killing them all.
- I was very fast. - You are fast. Mike, seriously, I appreciate you being so understanding. The appointment is tonight at 7:00. Rachel, I have an appointment tonight for my pro bono case and I can't put it off.
- I think I deserve a raise. - Easy, tiger. Mike, seriously. I thought you were busy with the pro bono case. Yeah. But Donna said you needed my help, so I gave it to you.
Do you want me to fix anything else for you before I get back on my case? - I'll let you know after I see Louis. - What are you talking about? If you couldn't stop Bratton from taking your client from you, what we did only results in a split decision. You say Louis doesn't want your help. Maybe he doesn't want it, but if that doesn't work out, he'll get it whether he likes it or not.
Violating attorney-client privilege is a disbarrable offense. If we find out that... No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you. Like you said, I used a technicality. Because I'm a good lawyer. And I'm an ethical lawyer. If this firm gets inside information from Pearson Specter, it doesn't get it from me.
This is a fight you started. And it's a fight you can't win. So either you give me back my clients, or your legacy to Pearson Specter Litt will be that you were the one who destroyed them. Let me get this straight. I got an offer for more money than I've ever seen in my entire life, and you want me to turn it down because you think that what happened to Chris
- I don't know what that means. - You must listen to me. I know you know that my parents died in a car accident. What you don't know is that after they died, a lawyer went to my grandmother and made her an offer. She accepted it instead of suing.
I have been a freelance writer for the past 30 years. I go wherever I can to work and earn money. It's been a roving life... JOURNALIST ...to find a good story, get the editor to accept it and assign it to me.
I have been a freelance writer for the past 30 years. I go wherever I can to work and earn money. It's been a roving life... JOURNALIST ...to find a good story, get the editor to accept it and assign it to me. When I finished a story, I'd move on to the next one. I'd throw it in a box like this.
When I finished one story, I would move on to the next. I would throw it in a box like this. There are other rooms like this downstairs. And I'd start the next one. Damn it, where did I put it?
I had helped at different priests' masses. And one day, we were getting ready for mass. We altar boys were arriving a little early. He went into the sacristy. He took a gun out of his pocket and put it on the sacristy counter.
That's when I heard the police officer say, "I don't want to." But Maskell was encouraging him. I was sitting across the table from him, and he had a gun. He was taking the bullets out one by one as he said that if my father ever found out that I was prostituting myself.... Then he took the gun, put it to my temple, pulled the trigger and said he would do the same, but with the bullets inside.
On the one hand, it is marked 1712. "Good and prosperity to Scotland." That would have been before the rebellion of 1745. This sword has history. I would love to know who carried it.
- Interfered. - How did you interfere? We were asking for an arrest warrant. "I'll look into it. I don't know." If you had information and you didn't get it within 48 hours, goodbye.
I never experienced any pressure from the Catholic Church not to investigate. I didn't always have, necessarily, the level of cooperation that I would have liked. I was not and am not a Catholic, so I had no problem with my faith being questioned or my idea of right and wrong being affected. No. The accusation was made and I investigated it.
But she is the link between Joseph Maskell, the abuse at Keough and the murder of Cathy Cesnik. Here's her story really. When the Facebook group was started, when the two women decided they were simply going to start a conversation about Cathy Cesnik's death... I waited. In 1992 and 1993, I used my voice and thought it would get somewhere. Instead, they silenced it.
Edgar was a man who lived a complicated life. He was arrested for grand theft auto two years after Cathy was murdered. He was hanging around the high school trying to pick up high school girls in a stolen car. And literally, high school is here and Cathy's department is here. High school Cathy's apartment. They share parking lots. We looked into it because Edgar's first wife, who I believe, gave us this complicated story. We researched it and looked it up, and it was all true.
It was something black... The vagina was wrapped in newspaper. So it was... It looked like a wrapped heart. And he threw it on the table.
I called my father, who had worked for the post office. He said, "Tell me everything that postmark says." He said, "They sent it after Cathy disappeared. They didn't send it before. Stay there, don't move and don't open it, because it could be evidence.
He said, "Tell me everything on that postage stamp." He said, "They sent it after Cathy disappeared. They didn't send it before. Stay there, don't move and don't open it. because it could be evidence. So don't open it, Marilyn."
Do they know who did it? But also I tell them that I would like to have my letter, and I understand it's a test and if they won't even let me touch it, could we... Could I at least see it? Could I read it? They said they didn't find it, they said it's probably lost.
They said they didn't find it, that it must have been lost. It existed. There is no doubt that she existed. There is no doubt that it was turned over to the police. There is no doubt that the police had it.
I understand from what she says that the letter was lost or missing. Yes, well, I know about the letter. I have information about the letter, that her sister received a letter afterwards. But as far as I know, the letter is no longer part of the evidence. The city would have had possession of that and we've never seen it.
Is anyone out there?" And there is still silence. But we hear each other because we all approach the crack. And what happens is that we find each other as we approach the crack. And at some point, the pressure of that voice coming through the crack is going to break it.
- Only if you have time. Sorry, he dropped his boot. Oh! Thank you. Shall I put it on for you?
- Well, straight home now. - Yes, I do! - Come with me to my... I don't need this fucking shit, Callum! I don't need it either!
The first shot they do is a wide shot of the whole scene with all the characters and everything. They do that sometimes. Then they go to short shots and shoot a small shot where.... You only see three characters. And when they come out of that scene, mentally we see the whole room because we saw it before.
And it felt... It was such a relief. And my friend John was standing in the corner. And I don't remember this, they told me. I took my hand out. And I gave it to John.
And my friend John was standing in the corner. And I don't remember this, they told me. I took my hand out. And I gave it to John. And in another moment, his hands were tied. What did I give it to him?
- Not yet. But if you take care of something for me, you could. Will Lockwood launch a solar panel? Since when are they in the renewable energy business? Since they stole the technology from Galvadyne. - No. They didn't steal it.
Almost. See if you can increase the yield by another ten percent. I'm not sure what the rush is. We can't even launch that thing. The Russians will shoot it out of the sky.
Right. What they stole was a reprisal. A reprisal for what? Something called Atlas. Grace Barrows got this information from the Russian ambassador and kept it from us.
I am with my family. Katya, there are urgent matters. Please. Hi. If you wanted Darius' attention, well, now you have it.
There's a record of the call in the log. And I gave my personal code? - That's right, sir. - That's odd, because I have no record of that call on my phone. Mine didn't record it either.
You'd go from 44th and 8th Avenue to that masturbation parlor, what was it called, Shake Shack? Yeah, "come into our Wacky Shack and we'll shake it good," and whole families line up to get in there? While you wait, they give you vibrators to stick between your buttocks. I took that nasty thing and put it on my prostate while I jerked my penis.
And if time runs out and I can't get you justice.... Fine. I'll see what I can do. Stephanie, we need to talk about this assignment. - Is there a problem? - Yeah, the problem is you didn't do it.
Donna, I need to talk to you about something. - What is it? - About the fact that I'm furious. - What's going on? I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment and she passed it on to someone else. - I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment and she passed it on to someone else.
It's a free case. You just took it. You can drop it. I gave him my word. You gave me your word once and you broke it, and I let it go.
Someone needs to convince her to drop this, and it needs to be an advocate she can trust, but it also needs to be someone on her level or she will feel attacked. I think I have the perfect choice. Katrina. - I guess Louis got my lawsuit. - Yes. And I came to ask why you made it now, because the things you claim he said....
I finally started. And I think that allowed me to get over my anger and make peace with Stephanie. I'm glad to hear that, Louis. I'm proud of you. Like I said, I wish I had listened to you sooner. But it was every blow of your insistence on my wall of denial that finally broke it down.
He will be brave. He will continue to be what he is and he will be the champion. He will get his belt back. Peter Quillin has the reputation of being one of the baddest men in the ring. He is now on the cusp of greatness, OWNER OF WILD CARD WEST but he hasn't reached it yet.
It was just easier when we were going for pizza. Why don't we do something about your hair? Just for a change. That's better already. About the scar... did you ever find out how he got it?
And we love kungpao chicken. But... - Julia thinks I can do it now. - What if...? If I see something nice, I take a picture of it, send it to you, and then you buy it from home.
He wants me to do an article on the best orgasm. Those are fun. This is your worst nightmare in the best possible way. - Yeah, I can't write this. - Sure you can. Just open a bottle of gin, don't mix it with anything,
I don't know what I'm talking about. Okay, forget the money. What's your dream? Fashion. I've always loved it, but it's too much of a risk, you know?
I have to pay one million yen every month, don't I? But what do you say? That's what the invitation said. Will you show me the invitation? I don't have it.
Yes, I suppose so. Still, it's very popular. Did he do this pretentious cover too? Yes. I've already read it, so keep it.
Are you interested in him? So a new emotion. Those idiots don't know anything. I'll take care of judging that book properly. Could you tell us something about your next work, if you already have it in mind?
It is the logical thing to do. And why do we do it? In order to create a logic that only I can create. I will find a logic that does not yet exist in this world. I will explain to everyone why we need it.
That's how you'll be next year, in your new beginning. Hi, Sam. That's my sweatshirt. You're wearing my sweatshirt. When I was in your closet, I felt cold and I put it on.
It was me. - Lena Luthor? - Let me guess, she told you to make sure the amethyst is ready for transport. The amethyst? So, you have it?
We'll see about that. Let's get 'em, girls. Don't bats like to hang out upside down? I'm trapped. I usually set my gun at five, but for you, I'll turn it up to 11!
- Mr. Norris. - Hello, Barry. Hey, Mike. Leandra, the 2:00 Caracas call? I'll set it up.
As a jumper, I had so little respect for the sport that I fear I will do the same as a coach. Thank you, Warren. Very stern words from Warren Sharp... So, no pressure. Where's my jacket when I need it?
I need to boil water to make tea. I'll get a vat. I'll get it. No, you stay. I'll get it for you.
With guns, ammunition and artillery. What does that have to do with my farm? It's got a lot to do with it, Ward. How? They're the same people who burned it down.
I don't mean to tell you how to run this place or anything. I'm just... I'm curious. Michelle... How close do you think he got to that filtration unit? Do you think he touched it?
I'm just... I'm curious. Michelle... How close do you think he got to that filtration unit? Do you think he touched it? Yeah, I'm sure he touched it.
Full of gold, roads, temples, ancient symbols". What? El Dorado? No, gentlemen! I call it Z.
Over there! There's a little beach. We made it! Come on, Tatty, name it. I name you, Walker Island and claim it as ours.
That's Ed's son, Ed Junior. Obviously I knew him. Hi, Junior. When was the last time you saw the paranormal entity? And if you could classify it between probably a T1 and a T5... Garrett saw it on Tuesday, and I think he soiled his pants.
Until he dislocated his jaw and "ectovomited" on you. It got everywhere, in every nook and cranny. But even that was tremendously beautiful. I detected a strong ionization discharge. I could smell it.
Oh, no! Yes! I wish we still had this presentation. I mean, it was great. I wish I'd seen it.
I promise. Tom Cruise is dead. - TOM CRUISE EXPLODES - These images just came in... at a Scientology church service... that Cruise was presiding over... when he apparently... and details are still coming in... spontaneously exploded. You're right. I'll have a bottle of 10-year-old whiskey... if you have one.
It goes. I came to... Years ago, I made a promise. I broke it. I've broken it a thousand times.
They cut off your eyelids so you can't close your eyes, and they'll bring your fucking family. They'll cut your son's head off with a wire. They'll do the same to your little girl. And then they'll cut off your wife's tits and you won't feel a thing. Finally, they'll cut your fucking head off and send it to your friends at Customs.
Here you go. Yeah. Well, I was thinking. Maybe there's another way to get back to sleep. What about the infirmary? I already checked it.
It's as big a story as there can be. But you wouldn't know any of the people reading it. But they would be reading it. Well, they would have. I'll never write it now.
Welcome to my island. - Your island? - Yes. My grandfather and I used to come here to fish. He inherited it from me when he passed away.
So Amelia had a second copy? Wouldn't you do the same? And she gave that copy to Misty. So she came in, checked the film against that wall... Lily saw it through the window.
Wow, you look amazing. How do you get your hair to...? It's gorgeous. I don't know what's going on, but there's been foul play. Did you know that the suitcase you gave us someone switched it?
Can we go in? No one entered the cell. Strange. Did anyone touch the security camera? No one touched it.
Delicious, want to try some? It's all organic here. Lots of onion. I, before I julienne the onion, I blanch it.
What do I do? Run the print and run it through. Can you take another blood sample from Barkov's body? No, the blood clotted. But I don't need it.
- Yes. - Excellent. Please continue. Yes, one more request. Don't tell anyone about this for now. I just gave him the vaccine, he bought it for me. That's all!
When Ivanova was here, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the hospital. I prepared a photo album. I took pictures of the wards, of patients with relatives, and so on. One day, I photographed the corridors and Ivanova's father was in the picture. He came up to me without a word, took the camera, removed the tape and spoiled it.
For now you will live in the guest room. It's small, but it's temporary. We will build you a very complete laboratory. - What about my scent collection? - We'll bring it here.
I don't know why everyone is so nervous but I can say with some certainty, I had nothing to do with this. She was found with drugs. Methamphetamine. You don't know anything about that? Meth or how Kami got it?
Thank you. I'll tell you where it is. It's out there rotting. There's some shit, in those woods. And cousin Henry's been spreading it around.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving! I'm leaving! Fuck! Those kids brought the disease. They gave it to Dennis.
- I don't know what to do with you anymore. - No, I don't know... - I don't know whose jacket it is. - That's why... - It's your jacket. It was in your car. - Whose would it be? - You left it in my car,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, can I speak? Is it my turn to speak? I think you need to find inner peace... Mr. Screaming Lawyer. Then why don't you stick your head up your anus... and find it?
"There's got to be more to it than this." And I tell them, "There is something more." Jesus loves you! United! It's like having the most valuable thing in the world...and knowing that people need it...but they don't even know they need it.
They currently have churches... in London, Paris, Kiev, and Cape Town. I don't feel judged coming in here. - I found love here. - I was addicted to heroin for 12 years. Thanks to Hillsong, I quit.
# How holy # # How beautiful you are # # How powerful # # # How strong is your great love # It's impossible to know... if a song is going to work... until we play it live.
It's taking a lot of blood fast. Dr. Marks, my patient is in a delicate condition. Are you sure an incision is medically necessary? You need circulation. I'm giving it to you.
- Sunflower seeds? - No, thanks. How's the slow ball going? I don't know. Sometimes I think I've got the hang of it, and then...
- Thank you. - Yes. Sign the ball, please. - Yes? Sign it?
Honey, I have to get up early tomorrow. All right, well. I won't tell you. It's a good story. Okay, all right, I'll listen to it.
I used to burn sage in our house once a month...to cleanse the negative presence. I'll book a flight for next week. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's too much, not necessary. Anyway, I appreciate it. I'll go anyway. If the house doesn't feel right... we'll put it back on the market.
So, I need to buy some things at the store. Put on your slippers, we'll go for a walk. No, I don't want to. We're watching a movie. Then you can put it on pause, we'll finish it when we get back.
Hi, I'm Majorie from the office. Come with me this way. I've located the house where your sister was found. It belongs to her ex-husband. He told the police that he loaned it to her until he moved back to Chicago with his daughter.
Judging by the level of decomposition, we believe the deceased committed suicide three days ago. That is not possible. Anna had no reason to commit suicide. The autopsy revealed that her sister suffered from Huntington's disease. Her 12-year-old daughter also has it.
- How is she? - Lying down. What's that? That thing you have there is really scary. I almost died of fright when I saw it.
I've always wanted to know... You almost hit the nail on the head, Tribeca, except I wasn't a gym teacher yet. I was on my way to a job interview to be a gym teacher. Do you have any idea yet? But I missed it because of you and your stupid coffees and stupid handwriting.
We have 3 candidates. We have the professor. The medium. And the businessman. The first is Dr. Ben Ellison. We create the world around us with our subconscious, that's why... adults rarely see ghosts. Close that door, lock it. Tightly. With superstitions and suspicious questions.
Goodbye - Mrs. Parks, wait. Have you ever seen anything like this before? - It's a magic bottle. I made it myself.
She mumbled something like, "Sorbovoz, sorbovoz." And, Cornelia thinks she wants a drink. He gives her his cup to drink. She doesn't want it.
The boy was a criminal. He is the voice of the evil Jafar in Disney's Aladdin... and now my special friend and family friend. So, Jonathan and I started being friends... the weekend when I turned 19 when my mom, dad and I... went to New York to see Disney's Mary Poppins on Broadway. - I saw it! - He was the Admiral... and my dad wrote him a note and sent it to him... and he called me for my birthday... and Jonathan is now a good friend of mine.
He said he doesn't want to play. Let him out! Please open the door! Have we been locked in? Open the door before I break it down!
Small size. You could connect it to a laptop... I couldn't be wrong. And you used the information for off-market trading, right? She had secret information and I used it.
Not the motive... The uprising is destined to fail... it must not happen. Again, that is not the reason. The real reason for your certainty... remains carefully concealed. And you are hiding it from me.
Again, that is not the reason. The real reason for your certainty... remains carefully hidden. And you are hiding it from me. You're right. We're still keeping it hidden.
They have differences of opinion. We are at an impasse. No. And I don't like that word. I will not allow you to use it.
- Air conditioning. Did you say beloved? - Air conditioning. - Beloved? When Conner has an idea, he takes it all the way aquaspin PRESENTS CONNER4REAL THE CONNQUEST TOUR ...and 99.9% of the time you have to trust that he knows what he's doing.
My fans always ask me to sign them because they love me and I love them, Lawrence. You gotta grow up, man because this is what it's all about, man. Making art. Connecting with people. This is the life of a rock star and I chug it all down like a rich milkshake.
- Thank you. - You are welcome. - You're welcome. Honey, what are you gonna name her? I'll call her Maximus.
When did this happen? What year? Your mother said I was seven or eight the last time she saw me, so it must've been... 1947 or '48. My father had a... safe deposit box in his closet. I knew where he hid the key, so one day, I opened it.
Mostly academic stuff, but... there was one letter. The reverend mentioned an incident involving my mother and father, and the way he put it made me think it was something big, maybe something terrible. Something he didn't want to put down in writing. It scared me for some reason. I put the letter back in the box and closed it, never looked at it again.
Take it to dry your cheeks. How is it that you can stand it? You should go crazy. York can't talk unless he wears a crown. Hold his hands while I put it on.
How now, resolute and firm companions, are you going now to dispatch this business? We are, my lord; we come for the order that we may enter where he is. Very well. Here I bring it.
What the hell am I looking at? Are you looking at, I don't know, some kind of biological weapon? Where did this recording come from? Phoebe, that's what I think. - Phoebe station. - I mean, where did you get it?
Phoebe's, that's what I think. - The Phoebe station. - I mean, where did you get it? Julie Mao. She bought it from a data broker. She gave it to Dawes.
And we are the fugitives. And as far as they're concerned, we're the ones who blew up the Donnager. And I'm not going to spend the rest of my days in a Martian gulag. How much justice do you think you're going to get for the Canterbury inside a cell? If the price of justice is more innocent blood, then I don't want it.
Pronounced "Anubis". Egyptian god of death. "Anyubis" also works. Okay, people, let's review. So the crew of this ferocious ship boards the Scopuli, uses it as bait to destroy the Cant, and launches the entire crew into space except for Lionel Polanski, who survives, takes control, and then
There's something in the reactor. It seems to have consumed all the others. If it's a biological weapon, I've never seen anything like it. I've got to get off this ship. I'll set up an APE locator beacon, and park it where no one else can find it.
This was planned. They have assigned missions. They knew it was going to happen. How did they know it was going to blow up a ship at the docks? They blew it up themselves.
I'm sorry, I should have woken him earlier, but I didn't dare. - Was he snoring? - No, he was sleepwalking! - What? He was next to Louis. - He was next to Louis, then he got up and came over here and sat for a while. Then he took out his notebook and wrote a prescription, then crumpled it up and threw it in the wastebasket.
Well, she doesn't need to know. God bless you both. Maybe there is some way I can be of service to you? Your friendship is service enough. Then you shall have it.
- Great show. Yes! Did you get my friend request? Yes. I noticed you didn't accept it. Yes.
It was very hard not to say anything. You are dead to me. You're dead. Get used to seeing this face. Because you'll see it forever!
And after this trip, I hope I never have to see you again. Okay, you look upset. Because you sabotaged and then stole my proposal. I didn't steal your proposal. You gave it to me.
I just go over the speech. I make sure I say everything I want to say. Well, yeah, I know you'll be fine with that. But I meant how you're feeling about the whole Todd thing. What do you mean? Clearly he used your marriage proposal... or maybe you gave it to him?
Bimse? - Let's go look at an old car. - A Mustang. We have to start it. - Do you have the key? - No. The owner has the key, so let's go and start it.
In cities, they live wherever they can get the opportunity to move from place to place, unseen. The streets are no longer controlled. The sidewalks are beginning to disintegrate. Right here, as you can see, under our feet is a big crack. As the rats dig it out, watch it crack under force.
so that future scientists can reanalyze these rats and compare them with their own tomorrow. I can still smell the rotten odor. First, we want to prepare a proper specimen. We prepare them as if they were museum specimens. - Here you go. - You keep the skin and stuff it and then preserve it.
- Yeah, why not? I thought you'd rather stay in Dad's room. - Do you want me to? - No, it's a better room. And he's not using it.
I made good use of the space, plus I was in the room ahead of time. And the breathing? The breathing? - Did you apply the technique? - No, I didn't need it this time.
No, it's too risky. Where did I put the key? Let me go. I have an appointment. They're picking me up. I don't have it.
Where did I put the key? Let me go. I have an appointment. They're picking me up. I don't have it. I really don't have it!
I thought you wanted to try it. I'll get the coffee. Please have a seat. Yes, thank you. You take this tool and dip it in hot wax.
In theory, there is nothing. - Is that your car? - Yeah, I just bought it. Can I see your driver's license? Sure, you can. I have it right here.
Many people have paid a lot of money for your resurrection. It's important for the world to know you, Marc. Of course. Would you like to try it? I'll put it on for a few seconds.
But it can't be this time either because he has decided to cryonize his body and needs to commit suicide before the disease destroys his organism. Dear Marc. I have written this letter a thousand times. I have tried to tell you what has happened to your loved ones during all these years, but it seems unfair to summarize their lives in a few lines. Do you want me to read it to you?
I don't care if you live or die. It would be so easy to cross the line and avenge them. But you don't have the courage. I've crossed the line and the Lazarus Project is all I have left. If you cross it, you will have nothing left.
- His name was actually Wylis. He could talk, and he could fight, and... and then... What's going on? The three-eyed raven says there's a war coming. And we're gonna fight it here?
This is great, man. Congratulations. I thought you might need it. I thought you might need it. What? I'm giving it to you.
But only blessed, right? I respect that. Thank you. Listen to you, you're very polite. She feels like silk because from birth she's been kept in a dark box so small she can't even turn.
Yes. These mannequins, and your artwork would definitely qualify as such. I'm sorry. Do you have a letter from your uncle? You mentioned that. The lawyer gave it to me with the deed.
I want you to give me the baby. "Even if you want to... you can also not be happy.... "one hopes to become happy. "If happiness doesn't come at all... "hope is prolonged... "and the fascination of the illusion lasts as long as the passion that generates it.
Argentina. I thought we agreed not to talk about it. Maybe you do want to talk about it. We had broken up. Here was the situation: you were presented with an opportunity, and you grabbed it.
- Yes. - Yes! - Yes? - You really got that shit? - Yeah, I saved it.
The kind masters of Astapor and the wise masters of Yunkai. With the help of their friends from Volantis. See? We don't have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three wealthy foreign cities that finance it.
Yes, but she's the victim. And Naz isn't? If I were her lawyer I'd at least pretend to believe it. It's like a nuclear weapon. You don't want to use it, but if you have it, you negotiate better.
But it's okay. - Are you ready? - Yes. God gave you a face. Why would you change it?
I tried. It's too late. So what, that's it? You know this show is about me? A loser who had his chance and blew it.
- Look at this shit. It's a real fucking palace. There's no stale bread for hunger, Cinderella. I wonder what kind of factory it was. Well, no matter what it was, nobody wants it now.
But it wasn't like that. No, it wasn't like that. Her face is fine. You've seen it. Yes. I've seen her.
Continued. Tell the story. You can tell it... No, go on, please, go on. Okay, I mean... Joanne tells it better, but...
Bring her home. What a beautiful table Sister Julienne keeps. Family meals are important at Nonnatus House, Mrs Busby. It was never like that at the nurses' home, was it, Cariad? I still wish they hadn't destroyed it.
Unfortunately, that's what he deduced. That's not what I meant. Another day and the baby would have suffered severe dehydration. Forgive me, Sister, but your influence is enormous. Please be careful how you use it.
Typhoid is complicated. Sometimes two people have different symptoms. Do you think Angie is right? Could it be me? Do you think I had it in China as a child?
That's all I ask. I can't imagine living up here. Like a bird in a nest. Look. Hot water when I need it.
If I get a diploma, I can be a teacher. Or write for a newspaper. Or work for the BBC. Doing poetry programs. Putting better food on the table than you've ever seen in your life. I could be proud of how I put it there.
That was fun. He likes to pick on brave guys because he can. We had a commander in commando school, a bastard. Last night, a friend and I stole his beret. All of us students rubbed it. - What?
- Inside you. I'll have to think about that. - I'll be here all night. - Okay, that's all right. I have a gun in my locker and I'll use it.
In the Operations Center, can you see us? We have to go in. Sometimes the initial attack is to draw more people in for the real attack. Oh, God. Open the door or I'll blow it!
Hi, this is Peter's uncle. Oh, hello. He's embarrassed. He lost his wallet last night. Did he happen to leave it at your house?
Do you think I asked for this? They tricked me, beat me and put me in a tank like an exotic fish. I came out of there with... skills. They saved your life. Ruined it, more like.
That's what I'm telling you. And as a proud NYPD detective, I have a relationship of mutual accountability with my partner. We need to know where each other is 24 hours a day. And thanks to the GPS on my partner's phone, I have Mr. Cage's home address. And I'll give it to you if you behave yourself.
It's his son, Earl. I never knew he had a son. Earl's dead. One night, Scarfe forgot to put the safety on his gun. Earl found it and accidentally shot himself.
- I noticed that my hair was wet. - I showered. Police personnel searched every inch of Harlem's Paradise. We also noticed that the shower in Mr. Stokes' bathroom was used. - I used it.
The 4K. Luke Cage is in action. You're still hitting like shit. - The folder. - You don't have it?
He can reverse news. He's got a bulletproof vest 50 feet from the hotel. How do you know where he is? That fountain. I could see it from my window when I went there.
How are they destroyed? If I don't... I can't... - What if we swallow them? - Yes. That way they trace it back to your ass!
I would love to. Very well. I love this house. It's very quiet. That's why I bought it.
This is for you. You wanted to go crazy, didn't you? Yeah. Well, this is going crazy. All right, Gipsy, you ready? Dude, if you don't want the blowjob, I'll take it. That'll be the only treat.
Well, where is it? Uh... You... I got it. I probably lost it.
Uh... You... I got it. You probably lost it. No, I didn't lose it.
Oh, shit. The garbage was today. Don't take it out the... I'll see you around. I told you he lost it.
Salome. All right. Break it down. Look, I'm sorry I can't stop thinking about the song. I really liked it, and I want Joan to hear it. Can you play it for her?
Me too. Les Skunks! Really? I want you to play "Devil's Kind. I want you to play "Devil's Kind." I love that song. She listens to it all the time.
But first... I need you to do something for me. Inside this. Dear Marcus, I can't see you. You'll run away from me again. This time when you see the scar across the width of my wrist. If you had seen it the night of our date I would have explained it to you.
Right. And that's nothing. Right. So how does it work? The guy you hire takes the card the usher hands him at the door... and when he hands it back to you at the end he signs your name.
We'll see which one. What do you want from me? I didn't put it there. Is the pharmacy there a coincidence? I didn't put it there.
Stories used to be told of an elf who lived in Vale. He would gladly tell you his wild tale of how he single-handedly won the Brood War with only a magic sword and three simple elven stones to help him. Well, my father taught me not to believe in anything I didn't see with my own eyes. You think just because those pointy-eared bastards told us that magic is dead, it's true? What makes you think I haven't seen it?
Drop it, you little prick! What the hell is going on? This little shit pulled a gun on me! Isn't this your gun? I was going to let him use it, but he pointed it at me.
I was just teaching my son.... License and registration. Look, I built the pergola, and... What about your license? I don't have it with me.
I left the van alone. Oh, no. No, Anthony. It wasn't your fault. No, I left it unlocked.
Only money matters. What were you doing? You still don't want the key? No, I don't, thanks. You're the only guy I'm offering it to.
No, I don't think so, why? Maybe he overdosed. I haven't received the autopsy yet. You should have. When did you send it?
You should have received it. When did you send it? I don't remember. When you asked for it. Did you send it here or to the office?
- No. - You have to listen to it. - Do you want to hear the frog's song? - Yes, they do. Of course you want to hear it. - They do? - Play it. She played it for me and I cried.
You fell in front of that bus and I thought it was water under the bridge. It was a dry river and you know it. - Didn't we bury the hatchet? - You buried the hatchet. It was my favorite hatchet and I never found it.
And I don't think my work is up to your standards. - Do you have a scholarship? - Yes. And I had a hard time getting it. And I don't want to lose it.
I've lost everyone I had. All I have left are scars. Father says when this box is empty, we leave Gold Mountain and return home. Last leaf inside for two years. I never take it out.
He's in Vermont with the kids. You here, family back east, doesn't sound like you, Jim. Mining has helped me figure things out, Bohannon. Life down here is simple. You cut a vein, bleed it and scrape until there's nothing left.
And I don't? We need a solution, Kevin. We need it now. Yes. - And we'll find it.
I'll complain, but I can live with that. It's the branding that has me pretty upset. You didn't agree with the judge's decision. I completely agreed with the judge's decision. And I told Thompson six months ago ... that we would lose if we took it as a trademark dispute.
Do you think you know me well enough to make that prediction? No. But I'm a very hopeful person, so I'll just say I hope you do. We should probably go to the meeting. Denby from New York magazine... thinks Spike Lee's new movie... will cause black people to riot, but Chicago's own Roger Ebert calls it a masterpiece.
No. But I'm a very hopeful person, so I'll just say I hope you do. We should probably go to the meeting. Denby of New York magazine...thinks Spike Lee's new movie.... will cause black people to riot, but Chicago's own Roger Ebert calls it a masterpiece. Have you seen it?

Have you seen it? Who's seen it? What's the right review? Are you rioting already? Call in and let me know...and if you haven't seen it yet, do the right thing and see it now.
You saw the corporate culture, the racial culture. You knew the score and yet you said yes. Are you sure it's the Firm you're frustrated with? That's the second time you've asked me that question. That's the second time you haven't answered it.
Thank you for inviting me. It's been a long time since I've had... that kind of connection to a real life fight. Me too. In High School, my typing teacher gave me a I wrote her a letter a day until she changed it to an A.
Did you all find your soccer balls? Yeah. Yeah. See when they were busy finding their ball... They couldn't find it.
Yes, there is. Leave it to me. I thought you said we'd never find his signature. No, I said you'd never find it.
When did this happen? The night you raided the Pot Palace. You want to explain the gun in your belt? I found it. I didn't want some kid to get it.
So play me my video, please. You said you'd do it. Yeah. Let's go outside and let the man work. I told you not to say we have a VCR in front of a stranger. You want the authorities to find it and take it away?
Just like you didn't move my gymnastics video, I guess. I said I didn't touch your gymnastics video! Then how did it end up in the trash? The doll is here somewhere. It hasn't left the house and no one's taken it.
Are you saying you've never used the "N" word? What does this have to do with the case? Detective, have you used the word? Has anyone told you that I've used the word? So if the Defense calls a witness to testify that you have used it, how would you respond to that?
Apart from the night in question. No. Not that I can remember. So let's be clear. In all your years as a Detective, this is the only case where you've taken evidence from the crime scene, placed it in your car, driven home and not turned it in until the next day?
I then presented to Detectives Lange and Vannatter, what I had observed and, in discussing the situation, we realized that it was that Mr. Simpson himself could possibly also be in danger. Injured, or worse. Well, that makes total sense. What did you do in response to this "reasonable concern"? I went to the wall and around the door and manually opened it.
But that's the verdict, that's the jury's position. That's their voice. And I accept that verdict. We came here seeking justice. And you will have to judge, I think, whether or not it has been done, none of us have found it today.
Definitely, the race card came into play. Barbara, my position was always the same: that race should not be and would not be part of this case. I was wrong. Not only did we play the race card, but we pulled it from the end of the deck.
Curly, Charlie. In the kitchen in five minutes. We were just told on the train there'd be cocaine. Jeremiah, Johnny, in the kitchen, come on. I swear to God, the fucking cavalry boys are looking for it.
We can't stay here. Not after what has happened. There's only one place we can go. Home. What will we do? Ask the Boltons to pack up and leave? We'll take it from them.
I need your word. If I convince him to leave the castle, you will guarantee him safe passage to the north. You have my word. You have until nightfall. You gave it to me for a purpose.
Right. Three lords enter a tavern... a Stark, a Martell and a Lannister. They order ale, but when the bartender brings them in, each finds a fly in his glass. The Lannister, furious, throws the glass aside and demands another. The Martell pulls out the fly and swallows it whole.
What, afraid you might like it? You and Cephalo deserve each other. That mark, what does it mean? I don't know, I've always had it.
Your blood is the key. Don't let them leave without you. A proposal... Your help in exchange for your freedom. That mark, what does it mean? I don't know, I've always had it.
Kael Pindanon would not dare harm the son of King Eventine. How do you know that? Because there is still honor. Within these walls. This letter bears my seal. I need you to deliver it to gain the support I need, to get the Council.
And I'm sorry, Let's see next week, I'm actually due down to Emily at this very moment, so, I thought we were gonna see boobs, but if I'd rather hang out with a girl, Oscar, are you cooking? - I'm reheating a pizza, Did you take it out of the box?
Of course. The blue one, too. I mean, both the orange one and the blue one, if you step on it, it's going to look nice. I'm thinking about the blue carpet. What if we don't buy it for my house, but for our house?
Foot! - Can you fly? - Apparently. Yeah. Are you sure it's not the untraceable sword? I think I found it.
Thank you, Beetle. Knowing that Kubo has... someone to take care of him, when I'm gone, that would be a good way to end my story. Your story will not have an ending. It will be told by him, and by... the people he shares it with.
Is this a good dream or a nightmare? See for yourself. - My dad's fortress. The last piece of armor. Is it there? Follow the setting sun and you'll find it. In the place that could have been your home.
Dislocated shoulder. That boy won't bother you anymore. I could have hurt him worse. And he wanted to. When the hero fights the dragon, does he care about hurting the beast? No. He takes his sword, and plunges it straight into its heart, and the crowd loves him for it!
Want a slice? Eat some chips and you can go back to playing. - I don't want pizza. - Okay, that's fine. - Don't put it on the table. - Here you go. Here you go.
Thank you. Well... Well, I'm off. Will you take Xoan's sweatshirt? Xoan gave it to me some time ago.
Then Antía told me that each one gets what she deserves. I raised you in the same freedom that my parents raised me. When we moved to Madrid and I fell into that depression, I didn't say anything to you, but I was suffocated by a tremendous feeling of guilt for the death of your father and that of the man on the train. I always avoided talking to you about it, I wanted you to grow up free of guilt. But you sensed it...
I abstained from you for years, but I made the mistake of relapsing into the hope of meeting you or hearing from you. That absurd hope has devoured the weak foundation on which I had built my new life. I have nothing left. There is only you. Your absence fills my life completely and destroys it.
It's really worth it. I watched the city from here; alone. - Can you see your house? - No. Over there. To locate your house you have to look in that direction. Do you see it?
And I'll do it again if you don't come out and give the royal blessing like the Kan that you are. Brother. Now you call me "brother"? The news was coming. The only question was who would deliver it.
You are truly beautiful. And you are very handsome. I know this union was forced upon you. And I was a fool not to recognize that it was a blessing. I give you my word and I will keep it.
This song is mine. No one in this place can have it. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. I can wait until you share it with me.
Where are you going, Night? For a walk. Are you the mother or the sister? To you I'm neither. And I know a hyena when I see one.
For dinner. They make excellent grilled meat. It's not grilled meat I need today. I came to sell you this garment. My mother gave it to me.
- Bellamy, where are you? I got it. What the hell were you thinking? We got the beacon, didn't we? Yeah, but where did they get it?
Here we go. Sorry, but that wreath is corny. Mom, nobody asked you. You have a very pretty forehead; don't cover it up.
In the field, the only thing that matters is who wants it the most. And here at Rydell, we want it! We never had it, so we really want it. When we finally have it, we'll come here and ring the victory bell. We'll ring the bell... Where the hell is the bell? We think it was stolen. It's been so long.
What we are looking for is an authentic representation of the youth of America. Director McGee, we need your help. What's going on, fine, healthy students? I ask that Rocket Club meetings be held on Thursdays, in the multipurpose room. And I want it for the Future Homemakers of America.
Seeing is believing. I know! Sandy, put on J-14. What's playing on the radio like that? Why am I moving from side to side? I've never heard that song But if I don't listen to it again
What if I cut the rope, at least I'm saved? That's right. I don't cut it. Then you die together. If the partner is you, I cut it immediately.
It's not a place where you can climb. But Habu... Staring at the precipice in front of him. It gave me goose bumps. He had that expression, I'll never forget it.
Should I ask you how your day went, like a good wife? No. I guess that means your day hasn't been as fortunate as mine. Well, it depends on how you measure fortune. You see, personally, I measure it in sapphires.
How do you know the combination to the money box? Tommy talks in his sleep. Shut up, Esme. You changed the combination. You got it wrong.
Keep us posted, will you, sister? I will. Fucking hell! So, Arthur tells Linda everything? He's stolen her soul and taken her to a better place, out in the suburbs... where men are honest with their wives.
She will love him as if he were her own. I know it is a severe grief. But it can strengthen your faith and your vocation. The diocese has not yet found anyone to replace the late Father Piasecki. As for the vow ceremony I have postponed it twice.
Someone set me up. Cause of death, blunt force trauma to the head. Captain, listen to me. The murder weapon is a crowbar. We found it under the couch.
It's the same. Still, it's better than my mother's bitch's goulash, isn't it? Where are the kids? Ring the bell again. I doubt they'll hear it.
Forged by the monks themselves. It was said to possess supernatural powers. Theo knew about it. He might try to steal it back. Does your grandfather still have it?
Close your eyes. Imagine that I am God. Almighty. I am God, and I absolve you of all your guilt. I put that guilt on you, and now... I take it away.
- What? He's like in "A Beautiful Mind". Because he's a genius. He's writing the word "case" over and over again. Now he's spelling it with a K.
I can't believe you knew about Sheila. I also knew about Wendy. And Bonnie. Wig-wearing Bonnie? She left it in our bathroom.
Nicky Baxter, the Bolton Brow vet, had managed to arrive earlier than expected, so he gave the sheep a lethal injection. I thought I had finished the poor bugger off, but who knows, I shouldn't have. So the sheep had pentobarbital running silently through its veins and guess what? The dogs. Whether it was the same ones that attacked her in the first place or a new pack, they decided to go after her again,
As an apology. Beyond that, fuck off. Knock it off, Johnny. You can buy me a drink. I'll take a bottle of whiskey, but we'll drink it together.
I also served in 2002. - Operation Anaconda. - Your guys did a good job. Thank you, sir. What was the name of your mission? You know, we called it "I'm Gonna Fuck Bin Laden."
These warriors went to capture a young girl from a rival village. Sure, she must have been beautiful. But the young girl, as soon as she found out, found herself tied to.... a trap in the forest in a bear den. You see, there was a drought. The sacrifice was to cause as much blood as possible so that rain would fall on the land and fertilize it.
You are lucky. The bullet entered your head, but you have no critical injuries. Your motor functions are not affected. But the bullet is a foreign body. If we don't remove it, there could be bleeding, pus and infection... and you could die.
Well, well. - Now where are you going? - To get you a surgical gown. Do you know where there is one? Have the nurse bring it.
Kam. Yes. The latest 33-inch TV. Good stuff. I'll give it to you too.
We have watched her follow the crazy. We have watched her follow the rich. We have watched her bow to tyrants. But now, it is time for her to have a king. When we are ready, when he is ready, he will take the place we have created for him... and he will lead an impossible army into an unwinnable war... and he will win it.
Don't become an asshole lacrosse player. Honey, we invented lacrosse. I don't think we did. Anthony, this sacred pipe, the chanunpa, was carved nine generations ago. It survived the massacre at Wounded Knee. And we use it to pray for our brothers in Vietnam.
It's a tobacco vaporizer, Dad. Katherine Heigl uses one. Smoking kills, boys. Where's the pipe, Jackie Lynn? I held it up in the air, and a hawk took it.
Those ingredients are wrong. I'll agree with you in 20 minutes. But it doesn't matter, does it? Because it's New York, where everyone's morals are "relativistic." You order a pizza with ham and clams, and some crazy guy makes it for you.
- The forensic auditor. He called you? He had some questions I tried to answer. Something doesn't add up. Somebody fiddled the numbers. No. If Richie drained the damn company, why didn't he sell it?
It's $150. My last name is Gross. It's spelled like, well, "gross." You have an idea and you can't get it out. You spin it around on the train. You like it for a moment, then you hate it.
I love that song. No, I have to go. I love you! I don't believe you. Do you still have it?
So, what is your problem, young Rostov? None at all, Captain, except that I didn't come to war to go on a retreat. I know you didn't. You want to put this horse of yours to the test, huh? Well, at one time or another you'll get the chance, and this won't matter to you when you get it.
- Which high school do you go to? - I don't like your team. - Hi, daddy. - Where's your shirt? - I took it off.
- Can you publish it? Get me out of here. - You want to see it? - Get me out of here. You better not have taken it.
Yes, you'd better, because I've banned people for less. Listen, honey, can you do me a favor? Can you hold the bet until the race starts? All right, yeah. I'll hold it and I'll call dispatch and see if they can wait, okay? But only because you asked me to, Yiannis.
For God's sake, ma'am, I'm a doctor, what gypsy customs or what...? Okay, ma'am, you're the boss. Quick, Irene, here. What do I do with this? It's a forceps. With the two blades, first one and then the other, you take the head of the fetus and extract it.
That flu killed 50 million people in one year, five times more than the First World War. But that was in the year... -1918. It's been almost a century since then. -And the population has lost immunity. If we bring it back, it can happen like in America.
How did you manage to stop the pandemic? Unfortunately, we didn't manage to stop it. It just subsided after a year. I couldn't even get them to stop calling it "Spanish". I read that they called it that because Spain was the only country that did not censor the news.
Americans, Americans, Americans, Americans, what's wrong with Americans? Do Americans do everything right? Yes, yes, yes, movies, Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, fucking great, but Americans have their little things too, eh? Just so you know, the United States will come back to save Europe in a Second World War, but in return they will invent the atomic bomb and drop it on Japan.
True love is always worth the wait. Regal, strong, virile, aquiline. That's what I asked for. And this, this is what you give me? You took a dick from the body store and wedged it between her eyes?
Let's go to the commissioner. Oh, fuck. Hi. Nice backpack. Is it new? Yeah, my friends got it for me.
We will check them. We have a lot of legal citizens on record that the feds don't. I also need a warrant. You want me to draw up a warrant? I'll draw it up.
What? Something doesn't add up. Why would he keep it? If he took out Allen in L.A., he could have just tossed the gun in any sewer and been done with it. Maybe his mother gave it to him for his birthday.
Oh yeah, and shove that smile up your ass, you fat fuck. Oh, fuck. I'm taking the gun to L.A. tomorrow. How fast can you get it done? I'll take it to ballistics myself.
Before we give up extradition... What? You're not fighting it? So, what would be the point? You got the murder weapon and tied it to my client.
There must be a way to correct it somehow. Fortunately, Gideon is showing us a prediction of the future you have created. Time is like cement. It takes time for it to become permanent. In this case, until Savage's team has solved the mystery of your future technology and mold it for their purposes.
Don't leave a trace of it this time. Of all the knives I have collected over the centuries, that is my favorite. And though my soul may depart from Earth..... A beautiful poem. I remember it well. Though as you can see, I can make the dagger do its work without it. carter! This was your lover's blade. It should be his hand that wields it.
Why didn't you sing at the rehearsal? You're carrying it! Again! Again! Put it on again!
Are they so stoned they can't see this shit? - What do we do? - I don't know. I don't know. You found it. Really? We all found it.
Don't you do a trick for us? - What's that? - My wallet! - He gave me my damn wallet. - When did he take it from me?
Now. Eight of clubs, okay? Keep it in front of me. The card will remain in your hand. I won't touch it.
The first time I saw a magic trick, I was with my potatoes... on the Venice boardwalk. There was this guy, an old Italian guy, with a little Jack Russell. He was performing on a little stand. He did a lot of tricks with cards and coins, but he did one thing that stuck with me forever. He took a pocket knife and put it in the center of his hand.
Please, we have been lying to ourselves for so many years, I want you to get your stuff and get out of my house. - Your house? - Yes. It was ours before you destroyed it.
I downloaded it via Torrent and... It's good because I spread the word about this movie. Please take a look at it... You don't have to give me this. You watch it and call me, and we'll talk about it.
We have studied their routine for five weeks. The chemists live in this isolated cabin. The lab is two clicks away, in another old cabin, quite isolated. And the formula is hidden there? They keep it on a USB key.
This is Roscoe Kaan, from the Kaan department. Today we're going to talk about coats and brooches. What? Don't get mad. I was looking for a pen and found your wish list. And I read it all.
Hold on. Excuse me... - Can we help you, sir? - Yes, we can. I need some gas. Let me finish that for you. No, I need it in a can.
- Yes, he must have crashed. Did he hurt himself when he fell? Not so much that he couldn't walk. This bike is a Cadillac for kids. He would have taken it.
- Mike, what kind of danger? Danger, danger. We're back to plan A. We told your mom. Look at this beauty. You should have seen it when I bought it.
Shut up, Scott! Stop talking, you cunt! I'm a junior partner in this company! Fellas, we started this company, the three of us, out of nothing... - That's right. And now we're selling it.
A mundane shouldn't even be here. Where is "here" exactly? - She's not a mundane, Alec. - How do you know that? Because the seraph sword lit up when she touched it.
Chuck Rhoades. Yes. Denny Dantone brings an offer on the Norton house... $62 million. I hear he wants to close the deal in less than a week. How the hell did he see it?
How touching. I am apart. I'm cut off from you, from us. And you sit there and try to claim moral superiority. Did I claim it?
They played roles. And the fact that their voice is distorted? It was obviously meant to humiliate and embarrass Christine. She broke up with him a month earlier. Are you saying he turned her in?
And the fact that her voice is distorted? It was obviously to humiliate and embarrass Christine. She broke up with him a month earlier. Are you saying he turned her in? At this point, it doesn't matter who gave her up.
So you knew you were being filmed? Yes. Again, it was an intimate moment with someone I loved. The tape was for us, not for the public. Why did your ex make it public?
Yes. Again, it was an intimate moment with someone I loved. The tape was for us, not for the public. Why did your ex make it public? I don't know who made it public.
I will sleep at Yolanda's house to get away. DJ Malibu will play music. There's a dance contest and the winner will have dinner with Malibu. That's what the tape is for. I'll win the contest, and I'll give him the tape to listen to and say:
I understand that it would make you uncomfortable to share it. But look around you. The Bronx is a war zone. Our community is in agony. And we need leaders to save it.
That's where I keep my tailor-made suit. Tailor-made? He said custom-made. How do you have electricity? Did you hook it up yourself?
It will be your perfect weapon. Raise your hand. My hand? When I grab you... Raise your hand. See? When I raise my hand, you raise up. When I put it down, you put it down.
You were going to teach me what you do. Don't underestimate the crayon. I promised you the secret. Not the answer, Grasshopper. To earn the answer, you must solve the mystery together. And when you open the door, we'll go through it together.
It's rare. It's dangerous to have it. Dangerous? It's a fucking tape. So I listened to it.
Here's the song. - "Oogie Boogie Disco Biscuit." - It's a party anthem. With a 4/4 time signature, but with subtext. I wrote it.
They pretended they were playing and charged the entrance fee. And the people swallowed it. Total blasphemy. Seriously. - Do you think Shao recorded this tape? - No, they bought it in a store.
And the people swallowed it. Total blasphemy. Seriously. - Do you think Shao recorded this tape? - No, they bought it in a store. We went there and the owner said he got it from a black guy.
Okay, understand me. In order for us to make the changes this city needs, we need a mandate. And to get it, Ed has to win by ten points in November. I'm not just asking you to give us the Bronx. I'm asking you, Francisco, that you and your people take down the competition wherever you can find it.
- I know. - No, you don't. Music is the only reason. It will move you forward and open doors that others see closed, Shao. It will put the fucking world at your feet if you love it and hold nothing back.
A written request... More than a year ago, but I never received a reply. Do you think I should resend it? Well, it depends on what kind of request it was. Maybe I wrote it crudely.
Do you remember? You used to sing it to me to make me sleep. I don't remember tucking you in or singing it to put you to sleep. And I wish I had written that song! Yes, I may have written it but I gave it to Gino.
Idiots. Liza and I are finalizing the details for this Friday's launch party. Well, share. I've been on tenterhooks ever since I found out it would be at a former bone boiling plant. The Glue Factory is the hot spot for parties in Greenpoint, and we're not planning it as a typical label launch.
Well, that's pretty much the highlights here. Shh, we don't want people to know we're from New Jersey. We have fake IDs saying we're from Oregon. - I love your shirt. - Thank you. My daughter gave it to me, because I'm kind of an enthusiast.
How do you feel? Very stupid. I'm sorry I ate your popsicle. Oh, that's okay. In the future, though, you're supposed to lick it.
What? See? I knew Hector and Dorff would love the sculpture. I told them we'd stop by before the opening. I can't wait to see where they have it on display.
What the hell...? Try it again. I forgot my card the other day, too. Card? Yeah, it's hanging on me.
I don't believe that. I feel really bad, man. As your boss... Javier, I need you to put your shirt on. I need your mother to put it on.
That's good, because I love cheese. All kinds of cheese. The orange cheese, the pizza cheese. I love everything about pizza, especially the dough. One time I ordered a dough ball, and they gave it to me and I took it to the park and ate it.
If you don't see how, well, that's because it's tilted against you. Still, to say thank you, I can provide you with a night with some very willing women. I've fucked my share of whores. You're going to have to up the ante. How about I up the ante by killing you fast?
He did it because there was a competition between guards to see who could collect the most, right? I was ordered to do the job. Please look at this photograph. These are the washers you collected before you were arrested, correct? Yes. This photograph was taken in your house when the police searched it.
Yes. Good. Thank you. Oh, my God! You did win it. How? That machine is tough but I won it on the 15th try, my new record.
They can't do this, can they? I think they just did. Remember the Hanneman deal you brought in and I said, "Richie, it's a bad deal" but you went along with it because you wanted to do something crazy for a change? Yeah, I remember that. You basically loaded a gun and gave it to Hanneman and he sold that gun to Raviga and then Raviga butted you.
- Thanks, Mom. - Do you want me to make you that blood sausage? Yes, until it burns. - What's that? - I want it well done.
I didn't promise you anything! Mom said you'd be in trouble next time. Shut up, okay? Go get the ball. Can you find it?
No, it's okay. You want to take a helicopter there? You could take pictures for your Instagram account. - Did you read the magazine? - My mom gave it to me.
- You're welcome. All right. Do you think it's hot in here? I often feel hot in here, and I keep the door open. Do you mind if I open it?
- No. Will you get cold? Just open it. Open or closed? Maybe I'll open it just for a moment.
Of course. So, we just move it over here. - This is heavy. - Yeah. Mind if we prop it up here?
Sorry, I had to pee. - We'll manage. Yes. - Yeah. I left my wallet in the Chapel. I went there last night and I think I left it in the collection basket.
I love it! I got it! How did you know about this movie? Gus told me about it. He told me it was filmed near here.
I would have thought you'd have gotten toxic shock by now. Has your skin fallen off, have your organs fallen apart, or...? Not yet. Do you know anything about this shit? Well, yeah, enough to know that smashing it with a hammer isn't going to fix it, so...
"We fear that the information given so far is too optimistic." That's all that's known. When was it agreed, if you know, to allow the terrorists to go from the building to the helicopters? What's that? That guy's bomb is fucked. He can't afford a new one, so I told him I'd fix it for him.
So what's in the press? So Irving got what he came for. You know, if he wanted headlines, he got them. "No Holes, No Holocaust!" He wanted a catchy phrase, he got it.
This trial is going to be against him forever. Now, some people are saying...that the outcome of this trial...will threaten free speech. I don't accept that. I am not attacking free speech. On the contrary, I have been defending it... against someone who wanted to abuse it.
- Drag? Thank you. I don't want to fight, I'm almost there! You always want to have the last word! You think I'll give it to you?
Aren't you a little late for the party? Maybe I'm too late. There was an archaeologist, Carl Bugenhagen who visited Thorn's father 25 years ago. Bugenhagen wrote to the Vatican saying that he and Thorn thought the child was the Beast from the Book of Revelation. The letter was kept in the Vatican archives until I found it.
Smoked turkey legs, half a cup of sugar... - and a pinch of bugs. - Bugs. That's amazing. Did you see the sweet potato pie recipe? Gosh, Mom used to make it so often, I don't think she wrote it down.
Yeah. Hi! Did you remember to bring Maddie's backpack? Oh, shoot. No, I left it in the car.
You know what I hear? I hear Westmoreland is gearing up for another Operation Linebacker. If Nixon gets re-elected, we can all go back there, right? Well... I hear peace is finally at hand. I'll believe that shit when I see it.
Eleanor McGovern. Thank you so much. I'm here among my friends in South Dakota where this campaign started almost 22 months ago. It's.... And -- now -- now, tonight, we bring it to a close, and I've just sent the following telegram to President Nixon.
We're not going to do it, so.... He said we could get 8500. That's all well and good, Joni. But we're not selling the house. Mac, I've already put it on the market, okay?
Everything has a base: a Shakespeare sonnet, a bookcase... or the fucking Empire State Building. E. A. Yes. You start with that structure and embellish it a little bit.
Do you have the same phone number? - Same phone number. - Cool. Toby, who are you building the house for? What makes you think I'm building it for anyone?
You bet it is. Imagine what it was like... being a kid in 1939 or 1964, and your parents taking you... to the New York World's Fair. For example, being taken to the Chilean sector. You smell Chilean food for the first time. You've never seen it before.
I'll read the part about how to attack... and defend. Are you ready? "Attacking skills and how to attack. The symbols indicate whether you have melee... or ranged attacking abilities.... I have a question. I'll answer it for you, because I think I know what it is.
That's perfect! I don't even want to go. Sounds boring. How about my reverse psychology? Here's a tip: when you use reverse psychology, don't say you're using it.
So, you want a hat or something? Oh, my gosh! It's an autographed sweater from Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum. He's my favorite pitcher of the modern era. We'll take it.
I also have my Patrick Swayze moves. Our favorite movie was Ghost - how could I forget that pottery scene? We were making out with that movie. I rented it in 1991 and never returned it.
Thank you. If you believe it will happen, it will happen. Of course it will. My mom always says that "Thoughts become things" and I hardly ever paid attention to it. But I really believe that if I used all this energy that I have and dedicated it to getting back to a major market, then....
Hannah! That song sounds so sad. Not as sad as Dance With My Father by Luther Vandross. God, that song breaks my soul. Every time I hear it, I think, "Where's my daddy?".
- Get down. - Oh, shit. Quiet... Let's get back to the track. If we follow it, we'll find somewhere.
I kill myself for them. When it's time to do something for me, put in the same energy, time and effort that I do. This is what made me angry. For my birthday, my son gave me a handprint. The boy dipped his hand in paint, rested it on paper, it said, "Happy Birthday, Dad.
He said, "They must have rubbed off on my jeans." "Black!" "You're not giving my kids faded mints!". "Okay, more for me." He pulls the mint out of his pocket and pops it in his mouth. Five minutes later, I saw my dad take the mint out of his mouth, and put it back in his pocket.
It's a vagina that you put in your pocket. I don't know, ladies and gentlemen. It's pretty self-explanatory. I think the definition is in the name. All I know is that I didn't put it there.
"You put it on your thing before you start, "it numbs it, you last forever." I said, "Nate, I need it for today." True story. I go to Nate's house, he gives me the cream, I put it on at his house.
"Is it a latte or a cake? "Give me.... "Give me a banana. "Can you give me that banana? "Put water in my hand so I can put it on my face soon."
I like it. I'm putting the kitchen back here. Richard, stop! I don't know what you're talking about. I bought it.
Many years ago. My friendship with August Corbin was stressful, but it was? mutually respectful. Oh, here he is. Elder Edda. If there's a key to the Ragnarok mythos, you'll find it here.
Cooperate. This group of transactions... I would like you to supply the research behind them. I was asked to do it, so I provided it. Sure, but in reviewing your reports, I see gaps. Like this boardwalk pipeline... what's behind it?
- As for the captain's family? - No problem. I'll call Copenhagen. - What's the address? - I sent it to you.
You weren't lying when you said you were going to take your father down. Mom, I know you're somehow... caught in his web right now, so if you've come... to tell me to pull the brakes, please... I'm not here to tell you that. I think competition is healthy. As long as you use it to push yourself.
In the future, everyone will remember Steve Aoki's great impact on everything that happened. Few will say that Steve revolutionized electronic music, but he was one of its founders. When it comes to passion and people, entrepreneurs, go-getters, go-getters, go-getters, whatever you call them, Steve Aoki is one of them. If he has a wall in his way, he goes around it, climbs it, goes under it or goes through it.
Relax, honey. Well, I did kill her. But those were special circumstances. Miss Groves, I think I should talk to the machine. The machine, I killed her because she lied.
He's just acting defensively. We don't know that. Maybe the machine sent the assassin after John. What if it's the machine or us? Did we kill her?
Yes, we need to get her camera. Catch Maggie on a break. We cut the tape off her camera with... With that. We bring the camera over here where I'll pull out the memory card and clone it into the laptop.
Look, buying the gun was a bad idea, but I've been robbed before. Amir, if you want to get out of here, you have to tell me where you bought the gun. Yeah, yeah, sure. Whatever you need. I bought it at a gun show in Cleveland six months ago.
That's why I did some research. How he hires people. Three different shell companies, same mailing address, but I followed the mailman... who led me to my real boss. Do you know his identity? I figured I'd need it someday... and here we are.
Oscar, the horses! Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, my God! You kept this part as it was. That's amazing! Oscar, why didn't you use it? It's so brilliant!
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, my God! You kept this part the way it was. That's amazing! Oscar, why didn't you use it? It's so brilliant! I told you, I really don't need it.
Oh, my God! You kept this part the way it was. That's amazing! Oscar, why didn't you use it? It's so brilliant! I told you, I don't really need it. And even if I did.
You know, I've been looking at the visits and stuff... and there's a lot of live people in the world... Okay, okay, okay, you're right, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Jackson's curtain hasn't come down. What? The curtain, it's not down yet. If you leave it like that all night, it'll stay up.
Come on Gloria, have a beer. I'll tell you what... if you don't drink that beer... I'll go for a walk in the park later. What... Are you kidding me? Drink it. Please just know that I'm... this insistent, because I know deep down you love her.
This is where we live. Our backyard is spacious. That's me, Sparrow McGee. I'm heading to the best party in the world. We throw it once a year, because it takes us a year to recover.
And now their problems are solved. No more welfare benefits. That sounds good. We're going to take life by the horns... We're gonna throw it to the ground...
What is e-Cow? It's a good concept. I'll give you that. You sponsor a cow for two dollars a day. We send you pictures and updated information. At the end, you get to eat it.
I can help stimulate your... recovery of your memory... if you let me. See these sine lines? They're remnants of an old trauma, 20 years old or more. Your wife's skull was fractured in seven places. Scar tissue can impede long-term memory, sort of like a splinter in the brain, waiting for the body to push it out.
Patrick? You are the spitting image of your mother. We tore down the old barn, turned your father's fields into corn and soybeans, if you can believe it. Your adoptive parents sold me the fields. On the condition that you kept the house. I can't say I loved it very much. Because of the good and bad memories, you know?
I don't know. This is important. Where did you hear that song? I don't know. Of course I do! Now tell me where you heard it!
I stopped by the restaurant down the street and brought you dinner. It's that shrimp stuff you like. I'm going to leave it here, in case you didn't eat. Don't keep leaving your food there. He doesn't eat it.
It's much more complicated. Yes? We love that man. He's not just our boss, he's our friend. Howard is a brilliant, creative, charismatic guy who used to be fearless. He used to love life and now he hates it.
So you're going to stalk me? Yeah, basically. What if I get a restraining order? I don't think you can get one. I'll make mom pay for it.
What if I get a restraining order? I don't think you can get one. I'll make mom pay for it. For your information, they're free. Then I'll make you pay for it.
For your information, they are free. Then I'll make you pay for it. I really love you. Mom says you denigrate that word. Not when I say it to you.
Your son's sociopath hit a boy in the throat. The victim did not report it because he feared revenge. That boy has a lacerated trachea and can't sing at Nationals. I don't care where the violence comes from or why. I don't want it in my school.
In those days, if you had that much money, you paid a share to the Voi. We lived in a secret enclave on the outskirts of Moscow with several of the other nouveau riche. There was over two meters of snow, but you could still make out a lot of big houses behind big fences lost in the white stuff. You asked me how I got my sight back. How I lost it is a better story.
Jesus Christ! Did you just throw up in our fucking water? I need water. There's no water to drink now. We use it for washing.
What happened, Homer? Homer. A family was going to live here. Probably not. They just built it, and the economy went to shit.
Yeah. I read about that. Some guy in Detroit convinced a girl to empty her bank account. It's scopolamine. Some call it Devil's Breath.
- Is it because eating is hot? - French gave it to me. It was the last one. - Never mind, I'm fine. - If you want, we'll share it.
It will be very painful. But you must live to give them this. And a white moth flew from his mouth to mine. I swallowed it. I kept it inside waiting for them to come.
I've had it inside waiting for you to arrive. Would you like to know what it is? Come closer. It's almost over but I can touch my Stan one more time. Will you guard her with your lives?
- It's okay. - Now kick it to me gently. I've got Hobbs' gun. - I know exactly where it is. - I'll get it.
That was it. The second time, they sent me a picture of my sister. So it happened again, and now it happened three times in the last month. I didn't look for it, Flores. The offer doesn't come unless you look for it.
Listen, the driver, in case.... If he feels cornered by cowboys like you, he should run away. If you can't get away without trouble, then you must go to the river and dump the goods. Uncle has many boys working for him on the river with ferries. They pick up the merchandise, transfer it to another car, and send it to another driver.
Hi, Mom. It's me. It's me. I miss hearing your voice. Where did you get that memory? I didn't get it, I created it.
Make a statement denying it. Damn it, deny what? That leak could only have come from one place! And what do you want me to do? Find the son of a bitch who leaked it.
For some, Talia Freeman does not deserve a moment's consideration. But for others, her death is a cause for sadness. It is a source of great frustration and anger and violence. I myself have been part of that violence. I have encouraged and provoked it.
I am saying that I did not kill Talia Freeman. I know how the media is portraying me, but the point is I did not kill Talia Freeman. They're portraying you as a man who refuses to answer a direct question. I am answering a direct question. I'm answering it directly right now.
No. Nothing shows up in the system. So he was fingerprinted but no other information was noted, is that what you're trying to tell me? No, no, they didn't. They wrote it down, it's just that they didn't put it in the system.
Oh, my God! - More salsa, Mom? - I'd like some, thank you. The show went very well. More than six bloggers covered it.
What the hell is that? Salad. What? I've never eaten a slug before. Where did you get it?
His mother died young. His father was an actor. He was blacklisted in the fifties, couldn't get a job. I guess he drank himself to death. Gosh, the story goes from bad to worse every time you tell it.
What's the point? You're going to leave this briefcase in that phone booth. Okay. And then a man is going to come in and make a call. A real call or is he going to mime it?
Don't let them take that away from you. So? You're looking at the chief of staff for the next Lieutenant Governor. Oh, my goodness. I saw an opportunity and I took it.
Goodbye. - Loonie. - Chuck. What's wrong? Did you read the science section on Tuesday? I may have skipped it.
Relax. Peyton Automotive will rise from these ashes. - But it won't be with Matthew Peyton. - I didn't pursue this. We gave him the opportunity to sell the place and he didn't take it.
I've worked so hard to run this place! You idiots, are you trying to ruin me? It won't happen! Open the door! Let them see her!
Stop him from biting! Sorry, I hadn't seen such a big octopus. - I got so excited! - Excitement is good for young men... But I advise you to focus your energy on women and not waste it on an innocent octopus.
Sometimes, you hope it's in you. Sometimes, you wish you were invisible. Because when he looks at you, he sees everything. No, no. I got the offer, but I turned it down.
No, no. I received the offer, but I turned it down. That's what I came to tell you. Good. Because it seemed like maybe you were trying to tell me that if I didn't match it, you were going to leave.
Eight percent. Eight percent? That should really matter to you. That's right.Well, I'm long the stock, obviously, the one that's a little bit on a tear, but if you're right and this company goes down, my position is ruined and I'll have it forever, waiting for it to recover.
Let's stomp on it. Welcome to Isodyne, is there anything...? We have a warrant to search your premises. You can help us by opening the door - or we'll force it open.
- Do you think it's a gift? - Yes! To be at the mercy of a force trying to destroy me? Only because you resist it. If you accept it, you can control it.
I love you. Me too. What happened to the picture on the beach? Was it ruined by the fire? No, your silly wife knocked it over and the glass broke.
So, well, let's get down to business. You guys, maybe we should start talking about why you dislike each other. Sarah, you want to start? Kelly photoshopped a picture of me, - posted it on Instagram and made my...
You know that movie with Robert De Niro? Al Pacino. No, I don't. An action movie, explosions, weapons... Great! Do you have it on DVD?
Seven million euros fell out of this bag. How could you not feel it lighten? How could you not notice it falling off the back of my bike? Because that wasn't my job, okay? I gave it to you to take care of.
So it's a kind of shorthand. Yes. That's a good analogy, but if you're interested there's a 1960s TV movie that shows the sessions. It's bad, but it seems accurate. I'll look up the title for you later but if you type in "Hugo, Jersey, turntables" on YouTube you'll find it.
I'm fine with that. I don't want him to get mad and then take revenge with the food or something. What? Is he going to poison you? No, maybe he'll mess with my food and touch it without washing his hands.
Thank you, doctor... Wilkes I want to thank you properly for saving my life How about dinner and dancing? Now hand it over.
Yes, that's right. Go build a robot. Okay. What did you find? I did an IP search on all the e-mails Khaled gave us... and... you're wearing my shirt. You want it back?
Surely you can handle my father. Why have you stopped? The song is over, my king. What if I order the song not to end? Do you want me to play it again?
Can I have one of those? Calm down. For God's sake, Ricky, calm down! The ladder's not very strong. It is. If you use it like a normal human would.
Listen, inspector, I don't spend my days paying attention to the bay. - Wonderful view, really. - Yeah, but I don't see it anymore. You understand? I don't see it anymore. It's normal: By dint of looking at it, I don't see it anymore!
This is something completely different. This is professional. It's clinical. It's someone who wants information. I probably should have given it to him.
At least your drug would be safe with me. Come in. Is it Samir's? - Did you steal it from him? - No, he left it lying around.
Rebuilt. After the fire. Yes. History is full of darkness. If you'd like to leave a note I'd be happy to give it to Mr. Pembroke.
Yes. I am not patient. I had an accident. You signed the admission form. I have it here.
We were born in space. They told us Earth was uninhabitable, but they were wrong and we've been fighting for our lives from the moment we arrived. Some of us have collapsed because of it, but most of us are still here, searching for other Ark survivors, trying to build something real and lasting in this wilderness... a home. Our leaders believe that to survive we have to make peace with the Earthlings, but here peace is an unknown concept. I have found it, John.
We will surround the dead zone. You two, move out. We're right behind you. We'll head west towards that mountain. You know, this whole helpful guide act, I'm not buying it.
You mean the drone, right? That's how she found us too. And what do you do for her? We collect technology. You mean you steal it.
And what do you do for her? We collect technology. You mean you steal it. When we have to. We bring it to the island, to him.
We have gathered tonight, as we have many times before, to watch a man die. Wanheda... Vengeance is yours. No. I don't know if your death would bring me peace. I only know that I do not deserve it.
If you care about Clarke, you'll send her home. It's the only way she'll be safe. Don't make her pay the price for your mistakes just like Costia. My mistakes? Azgeda cut off Costia's head sent her to my bed and I still allowed them into my alliance.
In my tribe, if a man loses his sword to his enemy, he is no longer worthy to be a warrior. Really? We abandon him in the mountains and he dies alone. And if he loses his sword to a half-grown Warig? Then we usually give it back to him.
I don't know. Was I supposed to memorize it? It was the nine of clubs! That was his card. Trust me. It was the nine of clubs. He just told me to look at it.
Oh, my goodness. Arya and I are good friends. It's better than that stupid visit. The studio visit sucks. My uncle did it and he didn't like it.
There must be a way to correct it somehow. Fortunately, Gideon is showing us a prediction of the future you have created. Time is like cement. It takes time for it to become permanent. In this case, until Savage's team has solved the mystery of your future technology and mold it for their purposes.
I remember it well. Although as you can see, I can make the dagger do its job without it. Carter! This was your lover's blade. It should be his hand that wields it.
- but under the circumstances... - No, no, no. The circumstances are that I tried to help you and this happens? Yeah, I'm still a little confused as to how you were able to do that... Mr. Dinard provided me with a lead and I followed it.
I promise you. I'm going to get your house back. I promise you... I shouldn't have put my name on the deed. You know, maybe it's not such a bad thing if I don't get it back.
The flash drive... From Mia's bag? The Russians... - Excuse me, madam... - The Russians. Put your mask back on. The Russians, they have it.
And leave the memory? Yeah, fuck the memory. Okay? I don't need it. We don't need it.
I'm talking about your retirement party. That's funny. That's funny. I still have a few rounds left, Marty. What? I swear I found a lamp and every time I rub it, a genie appears and grants me a wish.
- From? Yes? On whether you're a fucking grifter or not. That fucking bet was no good. And you still took it?
- You taught me yourself. - Don't try to screw me. You and your companions don't talk about heaven, you talk about this world. Come, sit down. Your lie... is harmless to the listener,
I'll go fishing. Could it be that your answers have become a bit crude? Do you see everything black? Cavalieri, are you depressed? I have a letter here, I want to read it.
The chariot scene looked fake to me - how is he going to jump from one chariot to another going at full speed? Well, we can take a look. But as for the religious aspect, does the portrayal of Jesus Christ measure up? The nature of Christ is not as simple as presented in the script.
Don't play dumb, Eddie. I'm talking about... With Eagle Wings. - What's that? - I'll post it tomorrow.
- What? - I'll post it tomorrow. First of all... First of all, that story is not true. I've heard it, it's always been rumored, and it's never been confirmed.
What a bore. We should go to Onondaga Lake for the weekend. Just the two of us. I didn't bring my suitcase. I left it in your lobby.
Baird Whitlock, your biggest star got his first role in With Wings of an Eagle by practicing sodomy with the film's director, Laurence Laurentz. We've all heard the story. But here's what you haven't heard. Your source is a communist. If you publish it, it will be dismissed as communist slander and you will be dismissed as a communist stooge.
Tell me what you know about Mr. Flaherty. When am I gonna get Mr. Flaherty back? Is your name really Cowboy? Who names his son Cowboy? My daddy says you can have his gun if you take it off over his dead body.
Everything is fine, but for how long? Mom, I really, really miss you. Also, I have a field trip permission slip that I need you to sign for school. I think if I mail it to you at the prison, it'll be easier than getting Dad to sign it.
- There might be someone outside. - Mom, where's my suitcase? - I don't remember. - It's a surprise. - I found it.
Help me figure it all out. Do you have any files we can look at? Anything that might help? They broke into my house and took my laptop and my cell phone. So you had the formula that fights cancer and you lost it.
- Do you have anything? - Negative. We're still looking. Hurry the hell up. We have to find the formula. We find it, we give it to those Nazis, and this nightmare will end.
Max, I'm sorry. I'm trying to find a way out of this, okay? Damn it. You're right not to give them the formula. But that doesn't matter if we don't find it.
You're all right. Oh, God. Who's "they," Shecky? Trojgaard is the largest chemotherapy company in the world. - Ronald didn't want to sell them the drug because he knew they'd bury it.
- What? Are you sure? - Yes! It's right in front of me! Ronald put it in an app on his tablet!
It's out of control! You were right. He's only in it for the money. Get out of his mom's house, it's not safe. Meet me at Factor's Walk in 15 minutes, bring the tablet. It must be in good hands before Max finds it.
Have a dinosaur. Yeah, go play. What's up? We pulled the tablet out of the water. My best technicians checked it.
- What do we do with her? - Let's kill her. - We'd better set her free. - Let's eat her. - Shall we set her free?
Back to your posts, please. - Nice house. - Yes. It belongs to an acquaintance of Elis. He doesn't use it.
We bought the boat together. We designed it together. Yes, but we skipped the part when we talked about when and how we will use it. Do you hate this idea? No, no, because I see how much you love it.
It is also very dangerous. Look at her shoulders. This bitch grabs you like a bear trap. She'd rip your dick right off. She'd rip it off if she wanted to, all the way.
He makes amazing baked eggs with green tomatoes. Give us supplies, we'll save Craig and take care of Negan and the Saviors, forever. I'm sorry, I find this whole conversation very amusing. I mean, you resisted when I proposed that your people work for supplies, but now? isn't that exactly what's happening? See, I had leverage and I used it.
I don't give a damn about Chuck Rhoades. I care about protecting this family. We're going to be outcasts. The kids aren't invited to the Bancroft party, and nothing has happened yet. So if there's any way close to an easy way out of this, I hope you'll take it.
Check the digital trail. Our guys did... and it's clean. I doubt you're even real. You need evidence... Bobby Axelrod exchanging important proprietary information... and you need it in a week.
I am your boss. Tell me one of the worst. "The guy scares me. Is he even a man or some kind of wizard alien?". "His eyes see the dark truth inside us, a truth that wasn't even dark before he looked at it."
Hi. Thanks for coming. I made it. Butch Probert. "Butch." I took an old Wells notice and manipulated it.
Once in seven dreams. And the food was hot? That's what made it good. Five kilometers from the road and 13 from the edge of the forest, but the food was hot? Maybe she was putting it in some kind of thermal bag.
Mayor Claire Warren set social media ablaze tonight when she promised to microchip convicted sex offenders if elected governor. Stay tuned for more on the story after this. I got your story - has she always had that truck? Never lent it to anyone?
It's amazing how much land there is outside of DC. Let me ask you something, Nathan, what's your take on infiltration? Well, what do you mean? How do we prevent it?
Everything you've put me through has been for nothing? It's the nature of the job. No! This happened because of your pet theory! And like an idiot, I followed it.
- What? - His hobby. That's why she touched a scorpion. No. Although I practiced it as a child.
Vanessa. And where is she? When did we lose her, Ethan? She was standing in a silent room, staring at a cross. She reached out, took it off the wall... and threw it into the fire.
I think I know where Reverend Corby keeps the key. - Oh, that's great. - Follow me. The doorknocker was found the same day... that Cicely Milson was dug up. Dexter Ingram logged it as an "unidentified metal object."
I think about what it means when the father takes off his mask, And he is not only seen but loved for who he is Underneath that hard metal exterior. Well, that guy is a hero. He deserves love. And you? What happens when he takes it off?
Melly is innocent. She's innocent. - Give me the tape. - Why? What are you gonna do with it? I'll take it to the boss, shove it up his ass and press play.
From now on, you will be known as The Hawk. No. I prefer Kestrel. Kestrel's fine too. The tape? I made a copy of the tape and put it in your car in Mindhorn Heights.
- Richard. - Don't ask. - Thank God you're alive. And Melly? In a cave. She made a copy of the tape and hid it at Pat's house.
Quickly. It's time for the Apocalypse of Justice. Baines, don't shoot. We have the tape. Richard has it.
That's what killed Monroe. You're crossing a line, Kane. No. No. I've already crossed it.
Hey. It's okay. The bag's blocking the signal. Now we can talk. Who put it there?
The technology Clarke has, belongs to me. No way. Clarke, just give it to him. Clarke! If you let Raven die, you'll never get her.
I'm sorry, did I say it was optional? Because someday it might save their lives. Inhalen! The Colombian cartels have no power anymore! Now the Mexicans move cocaine down I-90 and bring it into our neighborhoods like they're the mail whores!
The lesson to take away from that is, "Let's not give him a chance to retaliate. - You're just trying to scare me. I'm... Should I make me a razor? So they can take it away from you and stick it down your throat?
Why do you think Lucy would want to kill Sister Fabian? Because Sister Fabian murdered her. Lucy's music brought joy to this miserable place. Her favorite song was "When You Were Sweet Sixteen." When she played it, it made us... happy.
I don't want to fight. I just... I just want to tell you... Ken, where are you? At home. That's what we still call it, right?
What's going on? Even John makes better tea than this one. - Yes, he does... But... Something's got to be wrong with this milk. Who brought it in?
I can do the management for you. I have many contacts. But if you want to do business with someone else, it's a different matter. No, no, I just want the address. A friend needs it...
But you weren't sure if she was dead or not. That's why you elided any evidence. You eliminated... all evidence. It was very smart of you to rent Kumar's black van. The van couldn't take anyone directly over you... because so many people rented it.
I work directly with the owner. Francis needs to win in South Carolina. Of course he does. Let's pull from the strategic reserve. It will slow inflation, but it won't stop it.
- They reset the cameras every morning. I asked what she looked like. The director says she was white, brown hair. Nothing unusual. Get the box. Don't let her out of your sight.
- Thank you. Have a good one. I'm David Grimes from the Cleveland Plain Dealer. - Where's your badge? - I left it in my car.
Calvin Underwood hated himself for going to the meeting. He hated himself for having that picture taken. But he would have hated himself more if he had lost the farm and been unable to provide for his family. I don't ask that you forgive him for being in the picture. He must have thought no one would see it.
You mean get our own chickens, feed them, love them, and then eat their eggs? Check. Mate. An urban poultry farm is a great way to reduce our carbon footprint. Or maybe it increases it, I'm not sure.
Well, your 'Ironhead' is pretty cool... and you're hardly ever home to ride it anymore anyway. Maybe I should... Never ever ride my bike? Yeah, I love that idea. I mean, I thought you'd ride it eventually... when we drove to Baja. Baja.
- I got it, Lisa. What? There aren't many. No, look at them. I've got like five dozen versions of that play you didn't see on tape. Why don't you go and ask one of them to repeat it back to you, so you see you're wrong, we win the game, and you can go home with your lazarillo.
I just don't have the right to speak. Brooke, what are you doing? Nothing unless you're called as a witness, young lady. If I put her on the stand, what am I going to hear? That she asked a question and I answered it.
You just informed us that the South is not insured. But it exists... - No, no buts. Even a dog needs discipline. By the time he gets it, he forgets the blows.
Spoke the son of a thieving, murderous bitch. If you curse my mother, you curse a Mongol queen. Who cast aside my father's offspring. - Who schemed to favor her children. - If you don't watch your tongue, I'll tear it out.
I can still hear his voice in the house. She had a very soft voice... like a little bell. I'm so sorry for your loss. So...this is life again. I've hardly seen her over the past year...especially in such abundance.
I am afraid the Division will not approve. You must remain suspended from duty. Thursday. Before the Blenheim Vale files were sealed... ...a final piece of evidence was subtracted. I don't think anyone will miss it for 50 years.
She hasn't spoken to Fitz in five years and if he's done this for her now, they're going to be linked for life. It won't be because of the tape. It's gone. What? You erased it?
Shut up and listen, Harry. Your debt is no good to me. I can't sell it. No one will touch you. So I'm reclaiming it.
I kiss your ears. I touch that big mountain in your pants, I start to unzip your pants. And I take off your shirt very slowly. No, this one has buttons. - I unbutton it very slowly.
And I take off your shirt very slowly. No, this one has buttons. - I unbutton it very slowly. - No, I rip it off. - I rip it off.
Frank, what the hell is going on? This is Jorge Mendoza and his clan. What are they doing in our yard? I rented it to them. If we let you keep the house, will you rent it to us?
So if you could call us back when you have a minute... that would be great. Thank you, Patrick. 72 hours to vacate the house. What happened to our flour? Debbie used it as an imaginary baby.
You just got out of juvie and you have $3,000? Yeah. No. What's the matter, you don't believe me? No, I believe you. I just don't want the state to repossess our house because we bought it with drug money or whatever it is you're into.
But I got the money. It took me a year. But I got it. A bike like this. I had it for only a day before my dad sold it for a chop.
- Slow down! Listen. Listen, listen, listen. I want that dough, Butch. I told you, I don't have it. I told you I want the dough, Butch!
We have to send a message, it has to be done. A lefty sends a message, I mean, he'll never use his right hand again. Look, if he's lying, I'll kill him when we get back. Okay, Clayton. Go take a picture, we may need it, fast.
If we lose Ethan to evil, the night will never end. And if it is a prophecy, what is your role? Are you the savior? The warrior who puts an end to the night? Or are you the wolf who worships it?
Well, their mission must have succeeded, despite General Howe sending them devils. Lafayette and the French forces rallied the colonists against the British. They must have found a way to turn the creature to stone. So how do we do the same thing? Well, Abbie and Crane usually learn a lesson from the past and use it to find clues to help with the present.
We're an hour early. Did you know they close at 6:30? No, I didn't. It's not like you're a patron of the opera. Oh, in Oxford, I lived and breathed it.
You know what I remember? Your voice. Reading me stories, singing. I loved that voice. And I'm sorry if you hadn't heard it for a while.
We know you're not on our side, Theo. You said you wanted to help Lydia, but you left Eichen with something else, didn't you? You mean the mask? Are you worried about that? Have you put it on?
Or... or... o... It starts up here and then you swing around and you catch him right here in the shin. See that? See that, Dad? I've ripped it right off.
Excuse me, where are you going? To try to figure out how to use this against Zoom. Remember Zoom? "Cisco, please come with me. We'll use your idea and take it to new scientific heights and save the world."
Apparently, it is a famous painting, recently recovered from Markovia. The painting is on loan to the museum from the Silverberg family. Jacob Silverberg said, "The safe return of the painting means more to us than all the money in the world." It's as if they are begging Turtle to steal it.
Where are you going...? Finding Turtle is the important thing now. Yeah... this is important to me too. But we have to see if your speed still works. I think... it still works. We still have to figure out how Turtle consumes it.
Yes, sir. Very well, then. I have a mission. Honestly, it's more of a chore. For a chance to see my brother, I'll gladly accept it.
Elijah, Rebekah, even Hope... Sometimes you do them more harm than good. What? What you just said, keeping Rebekah safe. I know what the gun is. I made it.
If there was any way to get Aiden back, I would do it, no matter what. If there's even a chance that you're with the guy you want to be with.... You have to do it. I just want to get back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I had to get your attention. So do I?
Traitor to my family, - thief of what is mine. - Don't be dramatic. Like I said, I just want your attention. And seeing as you're here, I'd say I have it.
Maybe that's what you heard, Aria, but the rest of us heard him kick us out of his apartment. Girls. And every member of this police department is taking the case not only seriously, but personally. Without going into details that might affect the investigation, I can tell you that we are narrowing down our list of suspects. We are sure what the murder weapon was and we will find it.
Add the funds to mom's celebration party. Hey, how did you break the suitcase? - What? I told her because she loves to fix things. - I told her because she loves to fix things. What makes you think I broke it?
- What? I told him because he loves to fix things. - I told him because he loves to fix things. What makes you think I broke it? Well, when did you realize it was broken? When I took it out of the cab at the Philly airport.
It's like this, isn't it? Yes. I'm here to turn myself in. What are you doing? I took a firearm from the evidence locker, and I gave it to Detective Malcolm Graham.
It's in the bag. Yeah. I believe you. You don't need to do this, Malcolm. I know, but I was going to shoot you in Palmetto, and now I feel like I've been given a second chance, so I'm sure as hell not going to waste it.
Where are you going? To my house, Sol. Where I live. I need to take my medicine. What medicine? We may have it.
I have to do something about it. - Where are the kids? - I kicked them out of the house. After I gave them lasagna. I thought you weren't going to eat it, but if you try to fill that bowling shirt...
Of course it is. It is the basis of your whole personality. - What did you lose? - A carton of cigarettes. I threw it away.
I don't like murder. Not even murderers. It's not murder. It's justice, Sidney. People need it.
Why are you showing me this, man? It happened a long time ago, Emile. I thought you might need a refresher. You recognize that gun? Remember the last time you saw it?
- No! Listen. This is what people are going to say. You got out of jail. You took the gun where you hid it.
You got out of jail. You took the gun from where you hid it. - No. No. You used it to kill Tamika and her baby and planted it in her church to frame Reverend Price.
Did Daniel and his whole gang find Jesus at the same time? Or did they find a safe place to produce and distribute heroin? Not to mention the money laundering. Any luck? This heroin is from the 28th Street Bloods network, but the kid who sold it to me already has lawyers to defend him.
TWO SEARCHES FOR THE UZI SERIAL AND ONE COULD SOLVE THE MURDERS Well, one is mine... when we found the gun in the church. Yeah, I see that, Mike. But before you found the gun, Francine, you identified it from the casings.
But I thought that because I'm your son I can't talk to criminals? Well, they did invoke their rights, but Gary decided to stand up for himself. You can ask him anything you want. And can I... can I record the conversation? The prison will record it for you.
"I love him." "No." "It's my baby." And I said, "Could you do that? Because I'm trying to watch the movie. And your baby ruins it."
And they say: "I did... When... When Jeanette came, she didn't, she brought the yellow cap.... She didn't want to give me the ball back, but I told her.... Because Brian's cap is red, that if you, if you... if you don't have it now, you don't have to bring the blue....
By the way, does anyone care about us? Does anyone care about us? Yes. The University of Paris asked me to give a lecture. I will give it via Skype from here.
You're not very meticulous. It's not very clean, is it? He walked over the garbage. No, Jai. A normal person would have gone around it.
To encourage construction, the government makes the railroad companies an unprecedented offer...millions of acres of free land. For every mile of rail the railroad built, Congress would provide land to the company on both sides of the rails. The land grants Congress provides is truly the bargain of the century. 175 million acres are granted to the railroad companies...more land than the entire state of Texas. The railroad then took the land it had gotten for free and sold it to settlers...using a massive advertising campaign promoting the West as the uninhabited paradise.
Grant realizes that the only way to defeat the Indians is to send his best commander of the Civil War...a man stationed 2,000 miles away in Texas famous for his victories and unconventional command style. His name is George Armstrong Custer. George Armstrong Custer was very flamboyant. He had a full head of blond hair. It was said that he curled it himself.
There is a place there called Wood Cave that many of us believe is where we came from. We valued the land and the animals as much as we valued the people. Gold had no meaning or value to us. Of all the places the U.S. could have sold to the Lakota...the Black Hills was the worst place they could have chosen. The celebrated Sitting Bull picks up a pinch of dirt, holds it and says:
Seeking to make a fortune in the booming cattle industry, Tunstall has bought a ranch outside Lincoln, New Mexico, and in just two years has become one of the most successful cattle barons in the territory. But his success, has upset some very powerful men. Lincoln was the wildest of the Wild West. The law was almost non-existent and the people who controlled it were corrupt as a rule.
- He is a swindler. - Relax. - The guy ripped me off. - Put the gun down. His gun, have you seen it?
No one could tell an outlaw what to do. A lot of Americans could imagine, "Boy, if things had been different, I could have been as bold and brave, as fearless as Jesse James or Billy the Kid." The Old West occupies your imagination in a way that nothing else ever has. And it really is that timeless American figure of the guy who faces adversity and overcomes it.
You do not have this option. Finally. Look, that thing you wanted, that amulet or crystal or whatever. And Emerson's Repellent Alloy? Yeah, that guy I was with took it.
Shit. Quentin! No. Yes, that's it. I'm talking to you. I told you to stop with that stupid song, and I'll get it out of your brain myself. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hello. - Oh, hello. I'm sorry, I don't know if you remember me. I have your wallet. Yes, of course you do. Oh, I'm so sorry about that. I took it by mistake.
There are about 20 blocks left. - Where do we go? - This old water tunnel. So silver powder... how do we disperse it?
That's what you do. Riddles. It's what we do. It's scary. I had a beautiful life... and now I'll forget it.
Easy money, really. I guess the temptation was too great, Freddie? Boss! I was right. I searched Freddie's house and found it.
How do you sleep, Lord Ecbert? How do you sleep? Your Highness, I want to praise you for all you have done for me, and for Paris. And for me. I gave you my word, and I keep it.
Why are you looking at me like that? In that way? Why would you pity me? I think you carry a terrible burden. And you carry it alone.
Where are you? Are you at my house? I found the backpack. The boy's best friend, a nice young man named Liam. He took it.
Just breathe. The drug will kill her soon. Narcan. An antidote to heroin. Every agent looking for you has it.
I couldn't even a little bit. I was too anxious and nervous. When do we have the first interview? We'll leave by car as soon as you're done with the blood transfusion that should have already started. Or have you already done it?
No. We need to set the tone for today. Lookinglass and this announcement need to hog the news cycle. If I cancel interviews, that's all they'll talk about. Your transfusion, you need it.
It is clean. Please remember that the camera is in your contact lenses. So, do us all a favor and don't look in the mirror. Does this scar have a story? I got it saving your uncle's life.
I had to get some air. That was quite a song you sang with Piggy. Well, it was just a corny old number. Yeah, I'm not really talking about the song. I'm talking about the way you looked at her when you sang it.
- It does not appear on the license. Mrs. Fontaine says that the wife has a dark complexion and is a bit of a nutcase. I haven't heard that word in a long time. When was the last time you heard the word "pazpuerca"? I had never heard it before.
I'm just telling you that you can't judge me. Did your girlfriend break up with you? Yeah, I'm pretty sure she did. Hey, Harry. Wait, if that app gives you eyes and ears all over town, why don't you use it to find the next "Miss Perfect"?
I did it. What? What's that? I stole your speed. I gave it to Zoom.
No, I learned from a book, actually. I... I... Yes. There it is again... that song. That's the third time I've heard it today.
No doubt about it. Demand and supply. Don't you mean supply and demand? No, they've been teaching it wrong for years. You see, demand comes first and the giver gets the benefit.
Do you know how to use it? Yes, I do. Look. You should have told me first. I won't wear it if you don't want me to.
It could be cheese! I don't think we have room for more cheese. - I'll make room for cheese. - I'll put that on your tombstone. Don't try to make a wig out of it because I won't wear it.
- No. I have to go. - Grace! - Sir, you must pay the bill. I haven't brought it yet, but I was just about to.
They can't combine $100 million in advertising. Go ahead. Flush your money down the toilet. Democrats lost that battle decades ago. And you will lose it again.
Not if Conway is busy with public outcry. Think about the data they have. In proposing this, you said it would be a last resort, not the only resort. We are not at risk if they approve surveillance. Then we see if we use it or not.
They will defend this to the hilt. Of course they will. And it is very likely that the law will not pass. It will pass. Because you will push it until it goes to the House, the Senate and is on the books.
I can't. Look, every safe deposit box needs two keys. The bank has one and the owner of the box has the other. Well, I'll bet you anything Bob doesn't have his key anymore. I think the man who killed him has it.
- What the fuck? - Norman! Hey, either calm down or I'll throw you out. Hey, get your hands off me, man! I'm just looking for my friend, man! Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you. - Hey, Norman!
What did you do with the evidence we collected from the RV we found? Packed up, like you asked me to. He said you'd take care of it. I know what I said. First thing tomorrow morning I want it sent over for analysis.
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris. I feel slower. It was me. I stole your speed. I gave it to Zoom.
Frantz often played the violin for us. He was not a great musician, but he played with all his heart. His room. It is just as he left it.
He apologized. All is forgiven to youth. My dear Anna. I am writing this letter to you in French, so that my parents cannot read it. I hope you will receive it.
I should have fired him. They were doing well. They have problems too, like everyone else, believe me. I mean, we bought a house and I'm the only one who's been able to see it. - What if they hate it?
We will be living off the Big Mart for a while. - What's this? - I've been putting off telling you, but the gas stove is broken. - How? They said they'd fix it. - They said they'd fix it.
Yes, Mom. It's guy talk. Yeah. Where'd you get the hat? I found it in the lost-and-found section and brought it to you.
Suzy, slow, slow. - Signal search in progress... - Once we find a tower, we need to make a short call. Our signal is strong. Anyone will pick it up quickly.
Now you have to take pottery classes. At summer camp I made a mug for my mom. - You made one? - I did. I bet she still has it.
Hi, guys. That's how rumors get started. It's not what it looks like. Really? Cause it looks like you got a blow-up doll and you're dressing it up like Amy.
I mean that literally. Well, Helene's 40. Yeah. I'll stop by after the barbecue. A few firemen are making it.
No roof? What happened to the two grand you got for Gus' ring? I can't use them. I have to return the ring. Well, you know you always have our house if you need it.
It's a long story. Someone took my phone and they... sent a picture. Professor Runyon? That was you? Jesus Christ, you've seen her, too?
This is ridiculous, okay? We don't have porn! I'm on eBay. I'm bidding on another copy of The Wacky Penetrator. I've put in to have it sent to the office where they'll ask for a signature so no one steals it from us.
It was a disagreement over their priorities. Hank and Malik fought for the basic rights of the Egyptian people when their own freedoms were still in jeopardy. And Hank could identify the others in the photo. The unsub is using Hank to get information out of him. When the unsub gets it, Hank is dead.
I can't turn my back on who I am. Didn't your hair used to be darker? I'm just saying this is a great opportunity for our gravy. "Our gravy"? All of a sudden, Cam's calling her "our gravy"?
Didn't your hair used to be darker? I'm just saying this is a great opportunity for our gravy. "Our gravy"? All of a sudden, Cam's calling it "our sauce"? My great aunt gave me this recipe she got it from her mother who stole it from a blind maid.
Show me. Come on, ladies! Let's reach for the sky! How come you're better at it than Jane Fonda? Mitchell, you can't talk and feel it at the same time. Donkey kick, get serious, Jennifer. I'm curious, because this tape was among the others, and all of a sudden, you've pulled it out of your pocket.
But he will never stop until he gets that painting. Since we hung up, he's sent me six text messages... - and they all say "Kenny Loggins." - Here's what you do: You go to the garage, you take it out, you say he gave it to you, and you say hi.
Shit! Come on, Dixon! What about the Russians? I don't know. We gave them a way out and the son of a bitch turned it down.
Hey, you two, keep your distance. Miss yellow jacket, stand back. Be patient. You will all receive a box. Once you receive it, move to your left quickly, please.
Why would I risk everything I have for this? It won't bring them back. - It won't save lives. - No, it won't. But our friends died searching for the truth and you can find it at your fingertips.
As in Let's talk about Eve? Yes. Because Adam... Adam told her not to eat the apple. She ate it and became wise.
I didn't say he fucked her. Why else would he take her? The guy's weird. Last week, he came over to my house for drinks, and we saw a cockroach. But instead of stepping on it, he put it in the blender.
You're coming with me to the baby products convention this weekend. Rusty stood me up, so I'll need your help with the boxes. How much are you paying? An uncomfortable bed and your mom's food. Where's the table? I couldn't find it.
What? You went to the car? Yes. I looked in the trunk, but there was only the base of the table, not the legs. It's a folding table! Didn't you lift it up and see that the legs are underneath?
Yes, it is. We're gonna have to start digging around for pennies. Diapers are like 30 bucks, and a box of formula is 25. - Why formula? - I told him to buy it.
They are real. I broke another fork. One arrives. This pepper is empty. I'll refill it.
You guys look like you didn't have a very good night. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis! Janet's producers! You guys are crazy. I'm going to pull out my taser and set it to "boy" mode.
We've been through Halloween vandals, black mold, termites. Exactly. And after that, we're just going to cover expenses. We're supposed to make money on this house. And if we rent it out, we will.
Exactly. And after that, we're just going to cover expenses. We're supposed to make money on this house. And if we rent it out, we will. Do we rent it out?
We're supposed to make money on this house. And if we rent it, we will. Do we rent it? That man was right. You buy a sick cow and fatten it up and then sell it for beans?
Well, maybe they wanted to now, but.... Hold on. It gets better. So the next day, my picture was on the front page of all the newspapers. They even used it for the recruitment poster.
Why did you write it? Why did you tell absolutely everything? I want people to know what we did. I'm proud of it. The city was a complete mess, and we took it back street by street.
It's a comedy, genius. At least it's a movie released this century. Sean. My favorite is actually a TV movie. I saw it when I was a kid.
The fail-safes have been switched off. This has been intentional. The matrix prism is totally fried. Someone turned it upside down. Instead of concentrating the time current, it has dispersed it.
She seems very protective of him. So I'm just trying to figure out what I'm going with now. - So Denny took the gun - Yeah... If he did, he must have thrown it in the river.
You know, I also wonder what happened to Clara Riggins. I wonder what happened to Clara Riggins, too. Well, the bedroom down the hall is intact. Looks like it's been that way for a long time. This house is taken care of. He took care of it.
I have to find it immediately, but how? I'm sorry. Did you just say "Galavant"? I heard he's at his father's house, five days away. I just found his sword. You want it?
Leo wants me to quit my job. What? Abby, you can't quit. Leo, by the way, has accepted a campaign in Texas. He hates Texas, but he took it because he said it's okay, he never sees me anyway and I was about to get mad, but he's right.
I remember a shitty sentimental note coming through the door, saying "How can we go on like this as brothers?" It was like, "Shit!" So that was it and then another streak of body meth. I woke up in the morning and found a note under my door I opened it, and I knew.
He had no rules, he was making that crazy face while saying "Let's hit it, shit!" Those were the best moments during a taping I've ever had He's gorgeous and engaging, and ... He had his priorities straight. Liam was extraordinary. And they had this weird thing where Noel would play the song once on an acoustic guitar in the control room, Liam would give him the lyrics and he'd sing it.
Those were the best moments during a recording I've ever had It's beautiful and attractive, and ... He had his priorities straight. Liam was extraordinary. And they had this weird thing where Noel would play the song once on an acoustic guitar in the control room, Liam would be given the lyrics and he would sing it Noel would listen to it once to check that Liam got the lines right the whole song, which he'd only heard once.
Sounds like a plan. Paul Bunyan's sister, go to the freezer, get me the emergency ice cream cake, stat! One piece each. There's only one emergency ice cream cake? Because someone may have eaten it last night.
If Heavy posted the video, who was he trying to take down? The Senator? Or The Lance? Maybe both. If there's any connection between Heavy and the senator, we'll find it.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You have to show me how you do that triple combo kick. Why? So you can use it against me?
- addressed to the governor? - Out of 100 glasses? - That would be quite a coincidence. - It would. Which means the only possible way to poison the victim's glass would be... By adding it to the glass after the sheriff took it off the table.
Which you won't like. Merci. No one else is sick. And none of the other cups or the bottle appear to have cyanide in them. So let's try to elucidate who might have put the cyanide in the cup, once he gave it to the governor.
Where was the president standing? - Right there. - Okay. And where did you go with the cup after that? I took it to the governor.
They are uncertain about the computer - or printer used. - There are no fingerprints on the letter... and only one on the envelope, the governor's. Did someone pass it to Caroline wearing gloves? Or someone with gloves left it in her purse.
- or the printer used. - There are no fingerprints on the letter... and only one on the envelope, the governor's. Did someone pass it to Caroline wearing gloves? Or someone with gloves left it in her purse. Where he knew she would find it.
So, will you send your answer? Yes, Dwayne. In the end, I decided to go with my own version, I hope you don't mind. Not at all. I've been kicking it around about a couple of things... and finally sent it off at 4 a.m.
Assuming we set aside the commissioner himself. - Which we will do. - Of course. But in the end, that's how the cyanide got into Caroline's glass. It was added after the sheriff took it.
While everyone was looking at Caroline... and after she was dead... just then you put a lethal dose of cyanide in her glass. Knowing that we were going to presume it was that cyanide that poisoned her. But that wasn't your only stroke of genius, Ellery, was it? Because it was also what you wrote in the letter. You knew that when we opened it we'd find apparent evidence that...
Let's just say, when I do it, it doesn't make me any happier. Happiness is a myth. No. No. I've had it.
Previously on Once Upon a Time... - I can see why my brother likes you. - James... When you see him, tell him there's a new Sheriff in town. The Author's power is greater than that old man wanted you to believe. When you broke the feather you sent it straight to the Underworld...
- I can see why my brother likes you. - James... When you see him, tell him there's a new Sheriff in town. The Author's power is greater than that old man wanted you to believe. When you broke the feather you sent it straight to the Underworld... Now you will find it and send me back to our world.
- We both made mistakes. Killian fought against darkness all his life and you pushed him into the abyss. - He was trying to save his life. - You were very selfish. He had a chance to die a hero and you took it away. That's not fair.
Let me guess... They went for the Eye of the Storm? The way I see it, they got what they deserved. Maybe you're right, but that gem isn't a legend. - They found it.
And if you want to be alone as a teenager... that would be fine too. Wait, wait, wait. - I want to show you something. - The author's pen? - I thought you destroyed it.
Mom... And my original Blockbuster series is keeping me very busy. I don't understand how that's gonna work. Honey, it makes perfect sense. They film the whole season, put it on six DVDs.
And my original Blockbuster series has me very busy. I don't understand how that's going to work. Honey, it makes perfect sense. They film the whole season, put it on six DVDs. People go to Blockbuster, and they rent it one disc at a time, five days each.
I don't want to talk to you. I want to tell you something, but it is very confidential. Mommy is going to liberate Tibet. I don't care. Honey, please. Remember when I was a little girl and you had a "Free Tibet" sticker and we couldn't get it off the wall because you stuck it on the wallpaper? Kit
Doug, backing up Keith, yes, he said that. I was definitely there. I'm Don. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, because the plan was always based...on a free model like Dropbox. The platform is free to individuals, and once you have a large enough user base, you sell premium options to businesses. If we're going to give it away now and then we're going to sell, what are we going to do now?
We must make the network for deep learning. With enough ongoing data, it will be able to recognize patterns and actually learn. It will be able to optimize the algorithm on its own, increasing its speed and efficiency. Great, isn't it? But it won't happen if we delete it.
The best enterprise storage solution - that's what I'm talking about! Here's the game, team, let's win! Check this out. Chef Amy heated up a watermelon and filled it with jelly.
No. Wait. Are you wearing a gold chain? I've had it for a while. I wear it from time to time.
- It's Baal... - It's Baal... Jesus Christ! We need the Kandarian dagger. - Where is it? Where is it? - Someone confiscated it.
And it works too, honey. It's something mother told me works. Okay, you pour the hot water into the pot, okay? You swish it around a little bit. And then you pour it out, okay?
Monica, is it necessary for you to be here? - Geek Squad. - The computer is here. You don't have your shirt on. I got coffee on it.
We could go to the border, the river. Yes, but with people coming from both sides, it's dangerous. - But the water. - That's why it's dangerous. Everybody needs it.
Secretariat opens in theaters. - What a thrill. - Please stop. People will see your movie, form opinions and judge you all over the country. - What are you doing? - Or don't. Maybe no one will see it.
I drove here. I was pulling into the parking lot and realized I didn't have my card. I had to go home to look for it. When I got there, I couldn't find it. Suddenly, I remembered that I had put it in the glove compartment.
Maybe I'll be worth something someday. You're sweet, Todd. You shouldn't waste that on people who don't deserve it. You want this plum? I found it in the kitchen.
Then settle down. You have nothing in your hand, PC, I know you're lying. I'm coming at you full speed ahead and I'm not changing course. That's not fair. I used a poker metaphor and you changed it to a car metaphor.
It is a fragile stage. We are settling in. Give me six months and then you can leave. I promise I'll never ask you for anything ever again, but give me six months, please. I'm sorry. I left my jacket. I left my jacket. I found it.
Do you know that it is illegal to serve water to everyone? I do want water. Yes, we all want water. That's not the point. In the state of California, it is illegal for a restaurant to serve water before it is requested.
Hey, Elisabet... Hi. Before I cut off I wanted to tell you that your last transaction was very impressive. Thank you. Almost as beautiful as the fingers that made it.
I liked him. Too bad Richard's going to blow it. Did you move the pool? Yeah, I felt it was too far away from the house. So I had it moved closer.
We will not launch the beta version. We have just integrated the neural network. It has bugs. But that's what the beta version is for. People use it in the real world and that's how we find the bugs.
What about the interface? Did anyone have problems with that? No, not at all. Why? Do you have problems with the interface? Actually, I haven't seen it.
We were discovered. - The disk is ruined. - It's my personal laptop. You opened a stolen beta on your personal laptop? Yes, and I installed it on my phone.
I could look at your entire history print it out and give it to Heidi I imagine there are things you did and said on the internet that you don't want Heidi to know did you like the movie, dear? no, it sucks! I'll send Butters an e-mail right now "Dude, don't watch the Ghostbusters totally not funny, the girls ruined it".
I saw your jacket. You work for Pied Piper? Yeah. Their app is great. Everyone's installing it. Really? I downloaded it last night.
- "The president has stated that since..." Are you serious?! Get off that computer! Mom, we were just using it to watch the news.
What are you saying? We are saying that Mateo was not trying to stop Barrios. He may have been involved. Mrs. Ortega... I have to ask you: the van that's in your house... do you know if Mateo used it three nights ago?
You came into my office. With all due respect, sir, you entered my mind. I built your mind, Bernard. I have every right to wander through your rooms, chambers and corridors, and to change it if I so choose, even to raze it. After all this time, I know it almost as well as I know my own.
How about Bernard? Bernard, yes, but who am I? That is a very complex question, to which I can only give a simple answer. You are the perfect instrument, the ideal companion, just as the tool fits the hand that wields it.
Are you going to tell me about it? Prune, this last evening we shared touched me deeply. I often recall it. I look back at every moment. Because I want to take it with me.
Is it time for you to have "the talk" with your dad yet? Because he's going to have to read some things first. No. I'm going to destroy it. Ralph has a cool tree house, and mine sucks. Well, Bart, your dad built it, and he did the best he could.
Well, Bart, your father built it, and he did the best he could. I've done my job. Now it's your turn, tree. Grow up already. Tell you what, why don't I order it for you?
But someday you'll understand that it gives our family a better life.... Something I have never been able to do. ...is the most important thing in the world. We've all been given a third ball. Let's not throw it away.
I'm a hypochondriac. I've been taking my blood pressure since I was nine. Why is Sylvester giving you medical care? My doctor says my numbers are high. He wants me to check it every morning.
It's working. They're moving! Good thinking, son. Hey, doc... It's good to hear your voice. Are we... naked? Yeah, I saw an opportunity and I took it.
Meghan, I have to say, you did a crappy job today! I beg your pardon? Dad, we're having dinner. It's family time. You can't expect to give me crap to eat and be ready for the race tomorrow!
Ready! Bryan Iguchi showed me much more than just technique. He dictates the modus operandi, a certain way of living. He is the humble master. He had a vision of what snowboarding could become, and he realized it.
No. Where's the flash drive? What are you talking about? The flash drive you traded for Mateo. Who gave it to you?
Where's the flash drive? What are you talking about? The flash drive you traded for Mateo. Who gave it to you? We gave it to Rose.
What are you talking about? The flash drive you traded for Mateo. Who gave it to you? We gave it to Rose. No, she doesn't have it. Who has it?
While we wait for the sun to go down, I wanted to show you something. I found some old stuff the other day, and without expecting it I found this old letter from our Tree Canyon Camp.... Those were the days! Yeah, I was like "Oh my gosh, I have to show this letter to Josh." Do you want me to read it to you?
I'm the one who screwed up. All you were trying to do was help me. All you were trying to do was help me! You came here for an apology, Joe. I'm giving it to you.
Not his blood. Don't talk to him. You make the rules? I have the sword, you're tied up. You have the sword, but you don't use it.
Find a safe place to disappear to. I spent months carrying my Emperor from one hiding place to another, and yet you found us. You're deluded if you think those Mongol soldiers are the last ones who will come for you. Our protection is your best bet. And if you want it, you have to earn it.
Yes. And then I spent the next three years traveling by your side. Until you abandoned me. What was your plan then? I simply saw an opportunity to gain the Kan's favor and I took it.
There was a girl. I would go through the canals to bring merchandise to her family. Once a week, at the same time. She would look out on the balcony and smile at me. She would lower her basket, and I would fill it.
I would go through the canals to bring merchandise to his family. Once a week, at the same time. She would look out on the balcony and smile at me. She would lower her basket, and I would fill it. Then she would bring it up.
Blake, give me the ambassador, will you? And, is there anything else I should know? Yes. He and President Dalton have been friends since college. Maxwell inherited a large sum of money and invested it in some high-risk ventures.
Did you read the whole thing? It's like a horror movie. Bio-terrorist weaponry, diseases jumping from animals to humans, accelerated climate change, demonic robots taking over the world. Well, I'm happy to have a demonic robot take over my world while I clean my bathroom and organize my stuff. You know, I'm going to get a 3D printer, use it to make another 3D printer, and then return the first one.
The ambassador has a gun pointed at President Shwe's head, and this action seems to be related to the trade agreement. And this action seems to be related to the trade agreement. Are we sure the gun is real? Where does a Buddhist get a gun? Possibly he brought it with him when he was a mere American citizen.
Just listen to me! I've been listening to you. Now you listen to me. I'm done with that life. I don't want it.
I'm done with that life. I don't want it. I don't miss it. Well, that's a complete lie. I don't love her.
Eugene loved her too. One day, he musters up the courage to confess his love to her and she rejects him. A normal guy would get depressed, mend his broken heart and get over it. Eugene wouldn't. Eugene got a shotgun, pointed it at her and blew half her head off.
Okay, I know how much the church means to you. I know how much the church means to you. What's wrong with the church? You don't know? Well, they're tearing it down.
You don't know? Well, they're tearing it down. What? ! The preacher... he gave it to Mr. Quincannon.
What? ! The preacher... gave it to Mr. Quincannon. Well, at least he was supposed to. He gave it to him?
Come on. It's like "Lady and the Tramp" but with the ass. Jesse Custer, don't come near me with that thing. I swear to God. I know you want it.
I am the Alpha and the Omega. No, you are not. I am the bright morning star. I just saw you picking your nose. No, my son, I was picking it. You are an imposter.
Okay, do it. I would but Ms. Grant needs you to try out a column for her ASAP. I'm sure one day she'll give you more editorial responsibilities. Good one. I know you see yourself as a very brave heroine who had a story like Watergate and gave it to her biggest competitor, and I know you think that once the Daily Planet gets the story out you'll have a good job there,
Well, you can't. Nor can I deny help to someone who needs it. Dr. Meyer says that adolescence is the most vulnerable years... I wouldn't be in this situation if my dad would let me drop out of school, like I want to. It can be a dangerous time, Eddie, but isn't that the point? To finish it so I can learn what I need to learn to be able to confront IS?
- No. Well, I have to pack up and let him start his homework. Oh, can you... What? The door, can we open it? The door, can we open it?
I realized that the Kryptonians were using my LTE interface. That's why they broke into my lab at Christmas. They are using my satellites to send neural signals directly into the minds of everyone in National City. They scrambled the signal before it reached my brain. If you invented a technology that blocks Myriad, why didn't you give it to the DEO?
It's awful. We're very sorry. You'll be more sorry when I sue you. Why would you sue us? I never gave permission for the school to use it for that play.
Maybe you could use a friend. I know who you are. You're Ezra Bridger. I heard your broadcast. Yeah? My parents heard it too.
There is a curse on the family and a prophecy. Harmony will be restored when the raven takes control. My hair is the color of the raven's feathers! You went to Francie to have her read your palm waiting for confirmation? And did you get it?
- Shut up and drink up, you idiots. The drinks! I think my dad's calling me. Look what I found. Naman takes the bottle... uncorks it... and smells it deeply.
I wouldn't joke about a mask like this. What does it have... some magic in it? Something like that. What does it say? It says you'll pay me half of what you earn for as long as you wear it.
Maybe we should go back. Yeah, that's right. Why don't you run home to your mommy? We came here chasing death. We shouldn't be surprised if we find it.
Aldrich! Let them go. Why do you care about them? They stole your pay. Yes, I'll get it back.
You want to die as your friend, as a warrior. Give me what I want, and I will fulfill your wish. No more shame, no more guilt. Unless, of course, you don't have the card. He hands it to the girl.
You're welcome, honey. Let's talk tomorrow. Don't you see the big picture? What, that you're pimping out your daughter? Then you see it.
We should play the movies some night, - Let's see, Rebecca... - I haven't seen anyone since the beach. Wait, someone broke into your house? Yeah, yeah, they broke in and broke it, with a big...
No, I just saw the rock and the broken window. And I got scared and came here, and the door wasn't locked. Jo, sometimes that happens to me. Did I leave the fridge open too? Well, yeah, and I locked it and saved a bunch of cold cuts.
- *Roca* - *There it says "stop "* - *Where's the rock? * - * Rock * * It says "stop" there * * If the rock is yours * * you're gonna have to believe * * that someone broke into your house * * and then picked up a rock * - * Rock * * and then went outside and threw it against the window * * and then threw it against the window * * and then threw it against the window * * and then threw it against the window * * and then threw it against the window *
Everything is academic. I have no further interest. But I do. I have an inheritance... and I want to invest it.
- No! George killed a man. We have to bury the body. I have an inheritance. And I want to put it to work.
Your father... used to take you for walks. He'd take Martha by the hand and you on his shoulders. All the way to Castleberg Crag. He could turn a Sunday walk through the valleys into an adventure. Remember? He once made a den out of sticks and called it a castle.
If you want a pompous and expensive ceremony while the rest of the country starves, fine, but don't cry when your head and our children's heads are on the line. If the people are hungry, they want to rejoice. And how do you want them to be distracted if they can't see it? The people see the crown as something greater than themselves, an inspiration, a superior model. If you bring it into their homes, if you let them see it while they dine....
Disconnect from Arcadia. That would be unwise. The migration is still incomplete and the backup is now compromised. Without the Arcadia server, the mobile unit would be my only source of power. If it is destroyed...I will be wiped out.
Tim was a decorated and respected member of this department. He is subject to the presumption of innocence...until proven guilty. Witnesses saw him shooting in a subway car. And we have the man who has Tim's wallet. I don't think Tim gave it to him.
I served your father outstandingly for 20 years. You sent me to Staten Island... the day he left the building. This has nothing to do with that. Yes, it does. The city's being taken back... by the wolves because you've tied up the people who saved it.
- I like that employee. The writer Bae. - Mom! Isn't that computer? Sunbaenim, did you take it?
Isn't that computer? Sunbaenim, did you take it with you? - We were afraid it was missing! - Ah, this? Aigoo, it was dusty so I cleaned it outside.
I don't need to move, plus Cameron thinks it's great. I'll miss his sheets. That thread density was ridiculous. I don't think Cameron actually likes us in his bed. As if the puritanical Lord of the Rings ever even used it.
There was nothing in the reports, they led nowhere. Listen, Steinar. - You didn't take the shooting test. - I will. If something happens to you and you didn't take it...
He shot at me, I returned fire. I saw Maria sitting there, so I had no choice but to shoot her. - How did you get there? - To the summer house? Jens bought it seven years ago as a gift for his mother.
One is about your writing ... and you know what it's about. Please. Please make some copies. You know I know your poetry is very, very good. And someday you might decide to let the world read it.
That would be... unbelievable my dear. And you know what else? My guitar is due to arrive today. My harlequin guitar straight from Esteban. Esteban is going to deliver it personally?
Where do you get that conclusion? From Janice. What? You showed her her own memorial action figure the same day she died. I bet you didn't think she'd take it, did you?
Janice's. What? You showed her her own memorial action figure the same day she died. Bet you didn't think she'd take it with her, did you? Look, we found it... in her hand... clutched like this.
I don't think anyone starts out wanting to be a portrait painter. But, while he was finding his specialty, he did a little bit of everything. That's true. I started painting quite late. And now that you've found it, you'll never give it up, will you?
"My heart today is carefree" "You are in control of me today." "Let the crazy world say what it wants to say." "Life runs full of opportunities like a Ferrari." "Life is as you live it so far."
- What? What? It's the finder's, you must not be very smart. What happened? - He stole the wallet and won't return it.
This is my wallet I found it. Inder. Inder. It's someone's wallet. Why did you throw it in the trash?
Aren't you, sir? Look, we should be halfway to Havana by now. Why? She obviously doesn't want our help. Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't, but she needs it.
Fighting the elements! Keeping the family dry! That's fur! What's the plan, Luke? No bad ideas, but waving a metal shovel around during a thunderstorm might be inconvenient, so we're putting it back in the garage, okay?
Jay! Jay. The pool water's coming in the house! Of course. Because Phil was supposed to pump it!
We took him to the hospital. I'm fine. You're not the patient. The bullet's lodged in the base of your neck. We need you to remove it.
Just go for a walk, please. It's just like your fucking father. Go! We needed that house, Nina. We needed it.
I'll manage. Just... let me talk to JP, okay? He'll calm down. I don't want the house. Tell JP he can have it.
Just... let me talk to JP, okay? He'll calm down. I don't want the house. Tell JP he can have it. He can sell it.
Tell JP he can keep it. He can sell it. I don't care. He can't keep it. Dad left it to you.
Couldn't you let me know what was going on? If I'd known you were arrested, I could have done something! I could have postponed the audit! You get a phone call! And you don't fucking use it?
Guns are not like dogs. They don't recognize their owners. If I shoot, you'll get shot. Why did you buy a gun if you don't even know how to use it? I didn't buy it to kill someone.
They don't recognize their owners. If I shoot, you'll get shot. Why did you buy a gun if you don't even know how to use it? I didn't buy it to kill someone. I bought it to protect myself.
I couldn't stop thinking about it. We were on the road. Another trip. I... waited until he fell asleep and then... I reached into his backpack. And I took the razor he used to shave with and put it right on his neck.
Don't forget that repeated use of the Yanbue turns people who use it into monsters, okay? Look, if you go into that place... don't touch all that stuff. Well, what do you want me to do? Try to get a sample of what he's selling. Then we take it to the lab.
Maybe I could do it. There are many issues that need to be taken care of. The shipping boxes are probably already on their way to you with the documents that require your signature. Tomorrow is the Privy Council. Thank you, Lord Melbourne, but when I require assistance, I will ask for it.
And I know... one thing. One thing for sure is... I'm scared and you're not. I don't know prayers or anything like that, but.... David reached into his haversack, pulled out a stone, threw it and... hit the Philistine in the head.
And then you will have the power to get that brain and perform my time travel spell... for you! And only for you! Because that's what I would do. No. You want revenge and until you get it, you'll never be satisfied.
Fuck. This is going to kill us. Not necessarily. Look, he found the letter after he died. If he'd found it before he died, it might give the impression that he was a guy pissed off at work and blowing off steam, not a guy who was going to immolate himself.
yes. don't listen. but i have news for you, comrade! it's not your blood that's thick, it's your head! where did you get that cookie? you know where i got it.
Nice T-shirt. 20 dollars. Sold. I used to have one like that. Heather gave it away.
I'm ready for war. And not just to sit in a comfy chair and watch it all from a hillside while eating cucumber sandwiches, although that was exquisite. No, I'm actually ready to stand next to you and fight. Looks like you've found your manhood, Richard. Bobby has found it...
I won't miss you. This pathological lying brain is going to get me in trouble. I can feel it. Not with me. I know the truth when I hear it.
He's paying off old debts. Remember his nickname? - No. Chinatown. Because he gave him a corner in the middle of Blue Cobras territory, told him it would be his if he could keep it.
Sure, I know, I know. But, look, there's no science to an oral hearing. There is a way to deal with them. There are five very simple rules. When they ask you a question, if you don't understand it, ask them to repeat it back to you.
It was Michelle's idea to deliver it privately. She insisted. God, how weak she is when it comes to you. Why do I get the feeling that this restraining order may have been your idea? I may have suggested her as a friend and companion.
- Good-bye. Good-bye. - Bye. He's gone! Let's start in the parking lot! Okay, once we get the next image and compare it to the ones we already found, we'll know what we found.
No. No. You've written a magnificent apology. You drove across town. You left it under my door.
So... when Glen and I got married, his parents gave us, as a wedding present, um, a little house that they had in Pennsylvania. They had it from when they got married again, I don't know, in '69, and now they spend their summers in a bigger house ... that they moved into that's very close to the little house ... and I think they partly gave it to us ... so they could see more of Glen's children,
- I don't need children. I have you. Oh, that's great. She's going to set this whole thing on fire. - Hi, Lorelai. - Hi. The kitchen is amazing. - Sookie has organized it perfectly.
"Hello, Pater." - "Father," British English or Latin. - Already. He puts the word "ontological" three times. He had already used it.
- No problem. We can spare sausages, if anyone wants some. Babette, what did I say about food bought outside? I didn't buy it. I brought it from home.
- Hi, Lorelai! - How are you? Great. I love this kitchen. Sookie put it together beautifully.
Let's put it this way. I thought that maybe knowing Nick Cave and Radiohead well, and a dash of Stravinsky, was destined for success. So I'll never forget the day I realized that in my composition class I had to compose. But I did. I composed the melody, I added the harmonies, I set the treble and bass clefs, I wrote roundels, half notes, quarter notes and rests, and although you will never hear a public performance of my composition because of that experience, when I hear music, I see it.

Call her "mom". Lorelai hasn't told you about this? It has nothing to do with Lorelai, it has to do with you. - Did you lose the card I gave you? - I gave it to Lorelai.
- Yes. We'll have to blow up the back. He doesn't pay. Don't let him complain. Yes, let them blow it up.
It moves. Yes. Flour moves. - Hey, what's going on here? - What's going on here? It's dead in here. Some idiot asked me for the wifi password and an even bigger idiot gave it to him.
For my family's home in Maine. A great place. Private, on the coast. It's empty. No one uses it.
A great place. Private, on the coast. It's empty. Nobody uses it. My father only bought it because Martha Stewart wanted it.
I'll go to your crazy therapist. I'll open a branch if that's what you want from me, I'll take care of the kitchen in your hotel. I'll leave the whole closet to you. If I've taken up half of it, it's because you insisted. I thought you'd take it back anyway.
As if the story had been inside my head for years, - taking up space. - Like the lyrics of "My Sharona". That's it. No. It was there, waiting for me to write it.
- Hey! You put the house on the market. - What? Yes. - Are you kidding? - No. Why? Did you want it?
Did you love her? No, for God's sake! - So you didn't? - I'm sorry, but no. Well, since you don't want it and neither do I, - I thought I'd sell it to someone who does.
No, for God's sake! - So, no? - I'm sorry, but no. Well, since you don't want it and neither do I, - I thought I'd sell it to someone who does. - But... Or pay me a lot of money and throw it away.
Yeah. You want something to eat? I have Berta's fritters and some mystery soup from last night. No, I'm good. Grandma, why is there a TV? One of Berta's cousins overheard me say they were showing live opera, and since it was during dinner, they turned it down and hooked it up.
She doesn't need you to embarrass her! It's on the house. Go away! That was the last straw. Suddenly Lorelai's demented face appeared. I'd seen her before, but after an overtaking or shoe sale.
On the house. Go away! That was the last straw. Suddenly Lorelai's demented face appeared. I'd seen her before, but after an overtaking or shoe sale. I saw her when Marla Tipton's mother called you illegitimate.
And this is the test that Kurt McVeigh, the expert hired - by the prosecution? - Yes. And what test did you perform? An elementary composition test. He would have done it too if the bullets had not been lost.
It's a haul of about 200 rare old silver coins. I'm sorry. You mean a real treasure? It's not the terminology we use, but in layman's terms, yes, a treasure. And that's why you're here, to find the silver? We already found it.
I knew that the child in the child pornography had been abused, and they suffered horrible consequences for the rest of their lives. Sometimes I just want to look at those kids and wonder, you know, where they are now, and what horrible things have happened in their life. You think about it kind of abstractly, but it doesn't stop you from doing what you're doing. Psychologists call this "dissociation"... a screen allows you to detach your true self from your Internet behavior and create an alternate reality where social norms no longer apply. I'm not advocating watching child pornography, but if people weren't producing it, we wouldn't be watching it.
You waited until now because you think the Committee won't have time to stop you. I'm Chief of Surgery, Alex. There's not a remote chance we're going to approve this. I'm not asking for your approval. And as the Chief Innovations Officer, I don't need it anymore.
Where is my... Or, stab wound, subclavian artery? I think I have MRSA. - It's a rash. - Please don't tell us where. I think I got it in South America when I was volunteering for Doctors Without Borders.
- You can't believe that we... - I don't want to hear it! I know how the world works. I made a tape. I gave it to a lawyer.
Okay, we know Sasha Boyd is our suspect. What's her next move? See the web address with the HTML? That's the next photo that Sasha embedded on the page, so the next victim, if it has anything to do with drugs, will be in that photo. Okay, so we can see the photo without triggering the site to send it to every
I will never allow it. Never. He wants to talk about the blood, my heart has been bleeding for a while. And thinking about her voice is the only thing that can save it. I fell in love with her voice the first time I heard it.
He wants to talk about the blood, my heart has been bleeding for a while. And thinking about her voice is the only thing that can save it. I fell in love with her voice the first time I heard it. I was 13 years old. Maestro Rivera brought her to me.
I fell in love with her voice the first time I heard her. I was 13 years old. Maestro Rivera brought it to me. And it was you in "Tosca. I listened to it over and over again.
Hello, is she up yet? She's not answering her phone. I haven't seen her this morning. We have an appointment for a pedicure at 9:00 this morning. I'll do it for half of whatever she's charging you.
Yes, I know what you mean. Sit down, come on. I'll take care of it. Eggs Florentine. I upgraded the sauce a little bit and, uh... well, you know, I spiced it up.
Different streets, same avenue. Here on the South Side of Chicago, what you post on social media can get you rich and it can get you killed. You take daily life from the streets...the guns, the drugs. Basically, the streets inspire the music. And then you turn it into a song and you take all that anger and turn it into hyperactivity.
It's okay. Sly. Happy. Did you see the door open for Cabe? He lifted the handle and turned it.
All of you trying to steal what is mine? How dare you accuse us... open your bag. Give it to me. I suggest you hand it over.
And don't call me Vicky! You're the real deal, sis! Hey, that's my sister! Well, if the Spartax brats are done, I, Ronan the Accuser, pass sentence. This refinery will be turned over to the Supreme Intelligence after Nebula gets it ready to blow up.
I know he just grew you back. What do you want me to do to him? He's asleep. Quill, where did you get that tool bag? I borrowed it from my dad.
What... You should be excited about. I'm very excited about this. It's just that... Evan has made amends. He asked for the truth, and I gave it to him.
What do you have in mind? - So... I got my car all packed. - Okay. And I was throwing the ball to Mojo for old times' sake in the backyard, but, when it came time to leave, she just sat there with that pesky old ball in her mouth, waiting for me to throw it back at her.
So I did but when I was going to bring her in, she tripped and fell. She's, like, 13, and she's.... It's hard. I know. It didn't stop her, though. She wanted me to throw her again.
I would assume control of West Point while General Arnold would wait to surprise reinforcements. Led by you, sir. When did the correspondence between you and General Arnold begin? The first contact was in September. And made through Arnold's black market contacts. And as smugglers that they are, their only loyalty lies in currency. I don't know how much Arnold paid the guy to leave the letter on my doorstep, but it must have been enough for him not to break the sealing wax and read it.
Luck, I am looking for a very unique murder weapon, which you ignore. - You're lying. - No... and here it is. Oh, great, great, great, great. We'll deliver it together.
And we also see eruptions of xenophobia. When they say that in Europe... they don't want Muslim refugees... they give the excuse to Daesh propaganda... about the attitude of the Western world... about the Muslim world. If it continues, everyone will be threatened. The tide of refugees pouring out of Syria... has been the greatest humanitarian crisis of the modern era. But the global response has transformed it...because of suspicions that the ISIS attack on Paris...was done by someone who entered the country as a refugee. And it has unleashed complex and contradictory reactions... around the world. CYCLE OF TERROR
You would have fired, if I hadn't panicked All you had to do was break some bones Sir Where is the water bottle? Sir, Bapurao took it to the bathroom.
As soon as she saw me, she started behaving strangely She came up to me and asked me, are you Manik? Why are you dressed like that? I thought, something's wrong I got off my bike, and as I was parking it
The university was closed for vacation When I found out... That my own daughter was the thief All the students had gone home only Akira was staying at the hostel That's why I left that bag outside her room So that when Akira found the bag outside her room She would take it to me immediately.
No, I just told you we were going to the Christmas tree. Oh, okay. Did you know Norman had this letter? It's addressed to Emma. It's from his mother and I found it here the other day.
You know what? Fine. But why did Norman have this letter? He tried to give it to me too. I wouldn't take it. I guess he gave it to Norman.
I know a little jazz club a couple of blocks from here, what do you say? I'm very proud of what my husband has accomplished and his contribution to science. He's definitely the spy. He's the one who took that picture of us and showed it to Bill.
No. But I'd take a drink, if you'd pour me one. I noticed on Saturday that the light on the back porch wasn't working. I thought I'd fix it. I fixed it myself.
They found out how to cross the stone wall! Hello, sister! It started again, didn't it? We need that gun. Wyatt Earp called her "Peacekeeper."
- Wynonna, get the gun! What? What gun? Where's the gun? Where's the gun? The boss said he could never take it away from you.
- This time, you are the law, and innocent people are depending on you. - Now, your gun. - What? They're not gonna let you in with this. I'll give it back to you, Earp.
- Don't tell me you brought a dryer. - Yes, I did. - Did you bring a hair dryer... - to The Amazing Race? - And a curling iron. Does your dad know you brought a blow dryer? He carries it in his backpack.
Is it Ash, did you find it? - Does anyone have her emerald? - It's not green. - We're looking for an emerald. - Yeah, I found it on the first try.
Once built, you will have to call the locals who will help you get the party started. Colombia is a culinary delight... A wonderful blend of African, Spanish and world spice flavors. And in the hands of these beach cooks, they execute the best of the world. In "Parrilla", the teams will have to cook a delicious barbecue. When they serve it at the party, they will receive their next clue.
You will be awake and you will be able to play. No, for you. I mean, I don't know if you know what happens when... women hear me play. Your hand's gonna shake a little bit. Well, I'll hold it.
And it never stops working. Omar is a farmer. He brings the grains here to make flour. That's fine. The villagers bring their harvest, grind it here and don't pay with money.
And if you look inside, there are bubbles everywhere. When you eat bread, you mainly eat air. Bread is a fascinating combination of cooking, biology and physics. Biology is present because bread has life before we bake it. If we take some flour from almost any grain and mix it with a little water and let it sit on the counter, in anywhere from two hours to a couple of days, it will start bubbling like crazy.
You can see a small lattice of gluten molecules that is almost like a fishing net. Gluten is composed of two proteins. When the flour is moistened, these two proteins join together in a kind of mesh. In doing so, they form a substance that is very elastic and stretchable, but also springs back into shape, like a balloon. Modernist Cuisine's head chef took a ball of dough and dipped it in water to rinse out the starches and leave only the pure gluten.
They are everywhere. In the air... They are always there, omnipotent, omnipresent. Sourdough is an ecosystem that combines bacteria and yeasts used to ferment bread for thousands of years. If you expose moistened flour to the air and stir it, you will obtain a sourdough that transforms wheat into a very nutritious substance.
Here, eat. Cooking is always alchemy, isn't it? It's pure transformation. But baking bread is the greatest of all. You take a small portion of food and transform it into something huge that can feed a lot of people.
May I? Come on, let's go. I'm not going to do it here, I promise. First, I'd stop by Home Depot. I'd buy a nice polyethylene plastic sheet, put it up nice and neat so it wouldn't make a mess.
Of course not; Eugene wouldn't do that, he's a politician. All his words are calculated. Do you really think he's leading a human trafficking operation? Or he's protecting it.
I still can't make sense of the dead cat in the trunk. Unless it was a pet he couldn't say goodbye to. - Any luck with the computer? - No; it's password protected. I'll have IT check it out.
What do you think? No, what do you think? I think you feel a lot of anger and you don't know what to do with it. Hey, you didn't answer my question. I believe there is a choice even when there seems to be none, but it is the reaction that determines whether the choice was good or bad, not the person making the choice.
We can't assume they are safe. But I didn't do anything. Unfortunately, knowing Hank is enough. Close the door behind me. Don't open it again unless it's Hank or me.
You'd be surprised. I think the flood is coming, Rebecca. It will change everything. We need an ark. I need you to design it.
- You can do it. - You can do it. Press down on the thigh and stick your fingers in to find the artery. Stick your fingers in there! Okay, I think I found it!
Expelled from the Marines. Dealer given a second chance. Pilcher chose everyone for a reason. Yours was "initiative. But instead of using that ability to ensure the preservation of our species, you use it to help yourself.
Kerouac sure did. - Who is Paul Robeson? - Where is that scene? It doesn't seem to exist. Maybe I'm no good, that's why I can't find it.
Is something wrong, honey? No, I'm thinking about the movie. You and the movie. What did you like best? The first time you saw it.
- No. - Are you sure you don't mean... Yes. Gerald gave me some real intelligence. All I'm asking for is a small window of time to chase it with the prisoner who gave it to me.
Do we look like we're selling candy to you, huh? I got some candy for you ass... My badge. Where's my badge? You lost it? I mean, such that you lost it.
Except no. I'm lying to you. I'm all alone. This is The Sleeve Cutter. It takes any t-shirt and turns it into a sleeveless one in less than a second.
They want to get the same. She wanted to see my dick. You know what I mean? - Yes. - Yes. So I sent her a picture of my dick and instead of sending it to her, I uploaded it to Instagram.
I don't want to be alone! I owe you a million thanks. And my life. You can keep your life, Doc. I'd just ruin it.
I will not tolerate questioning Mary's conduct with innuendo. What have the eavesdroppers heard? - What is this accusation? - There has been an offer. And who made it?
George Hancock suffers from severe psychiatric problems... including paranoid delusions. He is on medical leave. If they exploit him for ratings, our lawyers will bury them. There are two versions of the story. In one, the Army took his technology... and used it to massacre a million people.
Legendary. You Andersons earn your fame. We're gangsters. How's your leg holding up? Better now that Joe's not pulling it.
You have sources. He and Spencer Strasmore are friends. We're getting off topic, Jim. I'm just saying Jerret sounds like an interesting story and you're all over him. Accidental pun. If you want that story, have Mitch cover it.
Like for example... the shed? I hadn't thought of that. Honey, do you always have good ideas? What do you think? I took your idea and ran with it.
I'm going on a trip with my old girlfriend! Why aren't you having a garage sale at your house? A, we don't have a garage and b, in our neighborhood... a $2 chair is too expensive. You know what? Wherever you do it, it's a good idea, a fresh start.

So far this is the third person to try to hack it. What's on that laptop? And how is that hacker involved? Well, now you can ask him. So, I traced the hacker's IP address, connected it to a physical address in Baton Rouge.
also known as a malicious program. So someone was spying on Zorn? Oh... and here's the kicker: All the information from the computer was being transmitted to a server at the Houston Globe. I'd love to be able to say who was receiving it, but there are too many firewalls on their servers.
Hail her. And you are? Better you don't know. There's a mechanical clock in the hallway facing the Great Hall. Hide the gun inside and I'll retrieve it when the time is right.
Go home! Hello? Hello? Fuck. I've never seen your shitty show. I hope they cancel it!
She's right, you should do it. - What's the point? I mean, give me a reason to do it, why me? - $3 million - So what? I mean, that's- If you have that kind of money when you're young and you use it to build something, right?
I don't know what you're talking about... The vault... the key. Back off! You changed it. Yes, we changed it several times.
The vault... the key. Get back! You changed it. Yes, we changed it several times. You come with me and open it.
Here it is. They audition girls from all over the country. Detective, I assume you are checking to see if some of these girls are underage. And also if Bo was maybe "rehearsed" with them before their birthdays, but I couldn't prove it. Is there a possibility that this Bo guy was upset about your investigation and took it out on Hudson?
There's a geo-located photo in Salt Lake on Bo's Instagram account...from two months ago. The caption reads, "Scouting new talent in Utah. Can't wait to give Madeline her ultimate anniversary gift." Did Madeline post this photo too, did he send it to her?
Give me what I need. No murder charges, no consecutive sentences. The most we will accept is murder and possession with intent to distribute, all sentences to be served at the same time. Nothing else. That depends on how your hypothetical statement sounds. I never gave methamphetamine to anyone who didn't want it.
The Asians' merchandise is now part of our inventory. I said keep Chu out of our territory, period. Do you even think before you do things? When you mentioned it, I assumed... I never said you stole it!
What, the cocaine shipment I told you about? Our mutual friend has it, right? I wouldn't know. I think he has it and he's too smart to put it on the streets now. But nobody keeps cocaine as a hobby, and when he sells it, there will be a lot of money.
This first one is from the brochure. The second is from the crime scene. I see. In the brochure, the utensils are all facing the same direction, but in this one from Buzz's video, the iron is turned. Yes, that's why I examined it closely and found traces of an expensive cleaning solution that is unusual for cleaning barbecue utensils.
Well, I certainly didn't intend to kill her, but before I say anything else, why do you think that? Because you didn't have a gun with you. They argued in the garden. She turned and in the heat of the moment, she picked up the iron and hit you. Then, afterwards... she cleaned it with the disinfectant she uses in her office.
What if that kid comes back because I talked to you? Hey, as long as we're here, that's how long it looks like you're cooperating. You want us to leave? Tell us what the gun looked like I didn't see any gun until he fired it.
Amy, uh, Amy, do you have the victim's bullets yet ? To see if we get a match, I'm going to have to shoot this thing and then get the serial number off the gun so they can find its owner. And that's all we can do? Well, if I get it into the saline fast enough, I might get a few sebaceous fingerprints, but I doubt it.
Do you always dress this way for work? - What form? - This is a formal investigation. Looks like my gun. I usually keep it on my nightstand.
- In the last nine hours, yes. - Well, Mr. Ogden, apparently there's nothing we can tell you that you don't already know. Other than what happened to the guy with the gun. Uh, it turns out it was sold by someone else, who we're still trying to identify.
Cash is easier to spend, and can be used anywhere. Just like at the airport to buy a round-trip business class ticket to Los Angeles. - There's nothing illegal about that. - He's right. It is not against the law to carry cash, regardless of the amount. Listen, I admit to buying the gun, but that doesn't matter because I sold it a couple of days ago.
Um, so, he never suggested that he had enemies at work? Well, sure. and, uh, he also resented the crap out of his old company, The doctor who botched his knee surgery and refused to fix it. Oh, and he hated our lawyer, the bank that foreclosed on our house, the people who bought it for half of what we paid for it.
Munro is too well protected. Even if the Scottish army could breach its defenses, it would only have to slip into the forest. Disappear. We may never get another chance like this again. Munro already took my sword, and even if I had it, I can't get close enough to Munro to kill him.
Come on, buzz. You're lying, Mr. Hetch. No, I'm not. Your fingerprints are an exact match to a partial that was on the bank card that one of the victims dropped during the robbery. You took the card, put it in the ATM machine.
make your point, if you have one. I do. Dr. Bowman, am I correct in indicating that on July 16 of last year, you predicted that I would be at one of 12 addresses in Pasadena using this gun to execute a married couple who intended to dilute the purity of the white race? We narrowed down the date and some possible targets in such a way as to affect their arrest if that? So am I here today, on trial for my life, in part because you, took my individual nature and reduced it to a pattern?
Got it.

We narrowed down the date and some possible targets in such a way as to affect their arrest if that? So am I here today, on trial for my life, in part because you, took my individual nature and reduced it to a pattern? Reduced it to fit a generic profile?
Do you want me to take Wildred Darnell for you, would you really prefer to do it yourself? Father, I'm in a strange place. I don't want to be the kind of person who takes human life without feeling and if this job has done that to me And if I'm really confessing, knowing that I'm supposed to seek absolution but really thinking that I don't need it.

WINNING BLINDNESS The blurry white substance you see is a cataract, which is a blurry lens. I'm moving the lens very gently until it's free, and then I'll remove it from the eye. - Is that it? - It was the cataract, and it's gone. It's amazing; he removed it in seconds.
- Yes, there's another one. Do you think it might be useful to you? It's the best thing in the world to have this limited view. I can't tell yet, but it's better than seeing nothing. While the Argus II holds promise for people like Anthony, who once had vision but lost it, they caution that for all the advances we've made in fighting blindness, we haven't considered what it means to restore sight to someone who never had it.
They say to do things with my eyes closed, as if I were blind, but I can't, it's very different. When I was blind, I didn't see black, but now, when I close my eyes, I see black. It's not the same as being blind. Would you advise someone in the same situation to have that surgery? - Frankly, I would not recommend it.
Look, I know I'm just here for support, but why would Jackson do that? Because it's exactly what I would advise her to do. Whether you like it or not, April, this restraining order has started a war. The restraining order was a mistake. Can't we just drop it?
- No, no. No, it's okay. Well, that's not the problem. You have a significant income disparity. Well, I don't know if I would call it "significant."
I have never seen a dungeon like this one. The bars are enchanted. Magic won't work to escape. What about the wand? Do you still have it?
I was a doctor... before the Guardian controlled and ruined everything. He made me his prisoner. We need magic to fix the wand. I know where to go. The hospital lab, but... I couldn't take anything without the Guardian noticing. You must give me the pieces and I'll repair it there.
The crystal... Gold must have done something with it. What the hell is he doing? He won't give that magic back to anyone. He's keeping it for himself.
The manager promised to fix the wand and return it to us. Unfortunately, I was only able to keep half of my promise. What do you mean? Where is the wand? I repaired it but the Keeper took it away from me.
He attacked me! That's a lie! I tried to tell him that's the guy. I don't care what you tried to do. You wanted an emergency, now you've got one.
That's exactly why I didn't want to tell you. Look, these guards are corrupt. If you go to the warden, Gallo finds out, he'll come after me with double the effort. It's a week instead of two years. Look, if we have a chance to get him out of here, I'm gonna take it.
- Damn it! The climb. - The what? Well. Two years before Wynonna came to town, we all felt it.
No. I'll ask Nicole to take her home. How many times do I have to tell you? That's poison. I've been putting a bandage on her for the last two days. Yes, and I've put it back on.
You will cross the Ghost River Triangle with the heiress. But what is the clue? That's it. The heiress is the clue. Willa was right. She had the clue and then she lost it. Lost her... Constance.
What do you mean you have it? I found it! And I chloroformed it and tied it up. All by myself! Can you come and get it? - And bring your head so I can cut it off and get the antidote for me and my dad.
Get under the bed. Hi. - I got it. - You got it? Waverly rat took it from me.
You're not going to leave this, are you? - No, we'll take it. We already paid for it. - That's what I'm talking about. Bad news about the van. It started making a noise. So I took it to the shop.
Helping Natalie with the baptism. She wants you to do that? Sure. Why wouldn't I? What? You want my opinion? Looks like I'm gonna hear it.
Please... That's for old people. I'm 40 years old. You're 41 and your hip thinks you're 80. My hip's in tip-top shape, okay? I banged it up a little bit, but I've been walking on it for years.
Everybody, get down! Are you okay? Yes. - Where'd you get that gun? - I printed it at home.
That's interesting. It's not cryostat testicles, but I like it. Why do you have a storage unit? - Hold on. -How long have you had it? -How long have you had it?
- I'll tell you what Gwen said about you. - Okay, so, uh... - Anything from the waste company? - It's new, it's called Bullseye. We don't know who's running it, but rumor has it it's a new guy. I don't know about that.
Okay, honey, it's not important. Give it a push, we can make it. He's going faster than I can pull. She never gives up. Back for the 2nd time for the track and now I'll be very careful where I put it.
It goes faster than I can pull. It never gives up. Back for the 2nd time for the track and now I'll be very careful where I put it. -You got it, honey. -I'll be right back, I've got it now.
We are going to the Planpraz Gondola, so another cable car station. I wonder if we'll go back up for more fear in the cold. We only do scratchy things today. I see the track, do you see it?
I had a visit yesterday - from Frankie Vargas' brother. - Mm-hmm. He offered me dirt on Susan Ross if I give him dirt on Edison. I didn't think he needed it, so I threw him out.
Actually, the booth, I'm, I'm not sure we need DNA to prove that he did this, And why is that exactly? Because as he strangled her, he took this dagger and swung it backwards, which hit her.
Did the Devil set you free? In all known history, nothing like this has ever happened. Given your history of saying and doing anything to get your way, I don't believe you. Believe me or not, the Devil is here, Cotton Mather. And whether he just walks the earth or rules it may depend on the two of us.
Here. Drink it, all at once. And you too will be freed from my yoke forever. If I have given you your freedom. I do not desire it.
There is no use of a surgeon. Only blood can save me now. I don't have the courage to take his blood. No, my dear, there is no need to take it. We will give it to you willingly.
- And miss this? I'm still a member of this distinguished club, Mellie. I just don't get a vote. You know? There is a way out. No one has mentioned it yet, but I'm sure we're all thinking about it.
Oh, Mathilda. No, no, no. Mathilda. He wasn't going to open it and tackled the suspect, Mr. Buckley. Mr. Reid took Mr. Buckley's head in his hands and well, I can't imagine a better expression for it than, he smashed it against the wooden pillar.
She's got cash, and if we get her, we can fix the Volvo and go to the Timbersports championship. I already know this kind of stuff, because I'm in charge. No, you're an idiot and I'm in charge. Of what, busting your chops? Because that cream is not where I left it last time.
That's not true! What is Ivory Tower? A safe house for fundamentalist groups. Garcia, we have the location. I need you to give it to every available SWAT team.
You better "KimChies" that walk, baby. But my fear with Kim Chi is that she's a look. Because she's so successful with who she is visually that she doesn't have to blow away a performance, She just has to be cute, nerdy, anime But I know there's a personality there. I just want her to let it out.
That's what they said about Ted Bundy. We got Ruby's ultrasound results back. She's seven weeks pregnant... which means she's Stommer's. I called the owners of the house in Bristol. They said Stommer put her on the market six months ago.
We have Ruby's ultrasound results. She's seven weeks pregnant... which means she's Stommer's. I called the owners of the house in Bristol. They said Stommer put her on the market six months ago. He didn't list her on the Multiple Listing Service until last week...which means she was in the house.
I don't know what you see in her. I see her and all I think is... sexually transmitted disease. They say we came here on a convict ship. Let them prove it. If there's a piece of evidence, let them show it.
- Is it done? No, it's not done. Okay, Fabien? You know, this is going to spark a war. You just don't see it yet.
The song you were humming... My mom used to sing it to me to sleep. "Little Sparrow." Your mom and I used to fall asleep to that song. Your grandmother used to sing it to us.
I visited Jenna at a school for the blind in Philadelphia but it was not this location. The school was here until 2009 and then relocated to Bridge County. So Jenna could have come here the first time she lost her sight. I didn't lose my sight - you took it away!
They modeled the guy who runs Cobra Kai after my Sensei. Why? I've been trying to find a medical explanation for why you think you're dead, and I discovered the Cotard illusion. Named after a French neurologist, Jules Cotard. Basically, people who suffer from it think they are dead, or in some cases that they don't even exist at all.
Wait, so I'm not really dead? I'm alive? Thank God, I'm still alive. But wait, how do you explain how cold I am? People psychosomatically manifest symptoms of an illness if they really believe they have one.
We have about three minutes until the heart tissue dies. Rock, come on! Well, there was a song my au pair used to sing to me when I was a kid. She would sing it to me when I got into bed, and it always calmed me down and helped me sleep. Okay, what's the song? The Chanels and I will sing it for you.
Good choice. And what's your excuse? I just like to drink at lunch. So, the official offer for SwapMeet is happening tomorrow? Yes, John Bosworth will take it today afternoon.
I thought you would be happy. I am happy, very happy. I'm just a little surprised at how you went off script. I thought this would be just a handshake and a few hellos. If you see an opportunity, you take it.
Pack your things. Starting tomorrow, you start working from my house. Why would you do that? If you can find someone who wants to pay more than $350, then you should take it. When you see an opportunity, you take it.
Very embarrassing. I know Sara told her father she was leaving to protect history. Why? Why does history need protecting? Because the idiots who were protecting it...
"Hey, you're just a regular Einstein." They'll say, "You're like one of the Einsteins." That's so crazy. I can't believe we just changed history. No, Dr. Heywood, we saved it.
You hear that a body has turned up, you take a look and maybe even kill the thing that did it. But that person is still dead and maybe a few more. But my people? We follow a plan. We study the lore and use it against our enemies.
Hey, guys. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. It's me. I understand you wanted a photo, but I have to ask you to treasure it privately and not tweet it.
You think you can win against this thing? You can't. My life is over. My life has been over for a century and a half, Stefan. Ever since you took it from me.
Caroline, I want you to be happy. Okay, I want our girls to be happy. And one of these days, I plan on being happy, too. Look... we can't escape this life, Care. So shouldn't we make sure we at least live it right?
More importantly, this book is one of the great love stories of all time. You're an incurable romantic, aren't you? When it comes to you, love, I would never stop fighting. I'd brave oceans and sail through mermaids to find a way back to you. "In the meantime, I took a large quantity of wax, cut it into small pieces with my sharp sword, took all my men in turn and filled their ears with it."
My friend and I have a particular and innate sense of smell, not to mention an immense taste for blood and we couldn't help but notice that the red you wear, very liberally, it should be added.... Perhaps a little direct... It has a very familiar smell, would you mind explaining to my friend and I why you are painting with human blood? And more importantly, what the hell have you done with the person you took it from?
Where am I? - Good evening. Good evening. - Hello. - Do you know who I am? Give me a lead on Zamacona, and we'll look into it.
We don't say that word here. That's where you draw the line? Yes, we don't say that word here. - You don't say it?
I will help you if I can. I want to be the judge's next victim. - A sting? - Exactly. I'll fix a drop, stab it, and catch the angry lout.
* If I don't take cover * Oh, this! This is what I was talking about. "Chapter 10... why I never answer prayers, and you should be glad I don't." And chapter 11... "The truth about divine intervention... and why I avoid it at all costs."
Surprise. What are you doing? I'm trying to. Your robe's on backwards. I figured fewer people wore it that way.
We got to the west creek. The two of you, all day, did you get to the west creek? Is it possible you're saying that because you're impressed? Did you close the door on the way out? Yes, we closed it.
Come back, Shane." Then Shane walks away deep into the night. I don't know why, but it always thrills me. I remember that movie. We saw it on our honeymoon.
Everything proves that to you. My God, what a year. Colt came home, all our rough edges, the homestead. It's good to have a win. You deserve it.
! You are 90 meters from the police station. I'll be back in an hour or two. We had a deal. If there's a scoop, I'll make sure you get it.
When we pulled Rafe Carey out of the river, he was clean as a whistle. He had been cleaned by the river during the five hours he had been running it. His shirt was as clean as when he...put it on in the morning.
You may not be a fool after all. Unless you decide to spy on me as Wallace asked you to do, probably in exchange for a key role in his political future. He doesn't... Every good politician plays that card. My father used it constantly.
Hello, you old wrinkled bastard. I'm starting to feel some tension. You two, don't start. Penny and I are doing this second wedding for you. Please don't ruin it.
As for that, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood in their mythology. I don't have a mythology. I have the infallible word of God. But that's very interesting. I didn't mean to belittle your faith. Actually, I admire it.
Sit down. - I hate him. - Who? Nate. He threw all my junk food at me. Actually, I hid it.
I didn't make it up. I stole it. Most of the time I was there, I had to file all the damage and accident reports.... How soldiers were maimed, how they died, how many pieces they came home in. That story may not have happened to me, but I felt it.
Don't ignore me. T.J. How did that fight happen? T.J. How did that fight happen? Did you start it?
- Move it! - No! I'm giving it back to you. You're right, a gun is evidence. I don't want it in my house.
- No, but it was Rajvir's room. And he told me to go to the other room. What could I do? Why didn't you go alone? Rajvir said the room was locked. He told Dumpy to open it for me.
Well. Today, we will see how to graph a function. Sorry about that. It was silly of me to post that picture on my wall. - Do you know who took it?
So you've stolen them. We've done things, honey, you and me, haven't we? Things your brothers haven't had to do. When I caught you the first time, remember? You were stealing food from the kitchen, and you were hiding it all over the house.
Thank you. Ready for a big night? Yeah. You? Ready, ready, ready. Good luck... not that you need it.
I mean, sometimes you just have to get over it. Realize your priorities in life. Sometimes. So, what, you took the gun out of the box without me knowing? This guy, the one you put it in the locker, is he the one who's been stalking you?
Cryogenic Preservation Society. I knew it when I signed up. Dare I ask? You know, like cryogenic freezing? When I die, they take my head and stick it in a container at minus 200 degrees until future science can find a cure for whatever, you know...killed me.
So how did this tradition begin, anyway? Some think it started back in the slavery days, on the long walk back from the cemetery to the outskirts of town...singing and dancing, remembering loved ones and lessening the difficulty of the miles to be traveled. Hmm! Wikipedia Wade! So much for me; however remind me to do my photo approval before you post one of mine like that and go showing it off.
That son of a bitch tried to scalp me. I shot him. But these signs point that way. Kerosene. Okay, so he does his cleanup, rolls up the bodies in the carpet, puts them in the cart and pushes it into the water.
Mostly composed of lye and potassium chloride. The Bensonhurst Terrorist's signature recipe. I still smell the bleach. It was hidden inside a soccer. The victim, Tom O'Leary, picked it up and it exploded in his hands.
- and we have no machines on board. - Is she awake? She's still in a coma. We've put her on therapeutic hypothermia to preserve her brain function. We'll keep her cool until after neurosurgery. - Assuming she needs it.
You are my grandfather. You're... you're more than that. You're a hero to me. I don't want to be anybody's hero. That look you gave me when we met, I've seen it before, when people look up to me, they decide they have to act a certain way, one that would probably end up killing them.
About that. This village is under our protection. Leave now and we will spare your lives. A sword is only as deadly as the man who wields it. And an armor is only as strong as the man who wears it.
How the hell did you rascals manage not to get killed without him? Miss Lance has been serving as captain. But she's a woman. You're a woman, aren't you? You know I can take your life as easily as I saved yours.
Forget it, kid. There's nothing you can do against a sprinter. We'll see. Long story short, Rip had a secret armory. Gris and I found it along with Barry's message of the coming war.
What's the connection? Yeah, we'll get there, folks. We'll get there. Just keep trying. Maybe someone steals power from the transformers and gives it to the monster.
Those names are on the list. What the hell is the list? Let me get this straight. You have a list of people "to kill" and I'm the one who's out of control? I haven't used that list, haven't looked at it in four years.
Arrow 5x07 "Vigilante" Come on, old man. Treat me right. What happened to you today? The last three weeks, you've been living here or at HIVE. Call it cabin fever. Well, how about you don't take it out on me?
I have to stay in shape so when these aliens show up I can kick their asses. Yeah. You'll have better luck on the salmon ladder. All my life, I've been waiting to see a sign of intelligent life. Now that I'm seeing it, they're not intelligent at all.
Claybourne Pharmaceuticals and their plant has just been brought on-line. Yes. I know that. How do you know that already? Because Green Arrow already attacked it and we already got everything there was to get in there.
If you will excuse me, I have a class to teach. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Dad, what are you thinking? If Lars found the lamp and rubbed it, he'd be the master of the lamp, right?
Walter, this is destroyed! Get me the cable! Okay, I'm on my way. It's Collins. If you're calling to demand my investigation, I know you don't want it and I know you didn't hurt Toby.
- Why, our Republican moderates will stand by if their only alternative is to go with the liberal extremists. True, Luke is the danger. There will be no Republican leakers for Ella, but they might leak for Luke, so what should my statement be? I'll write it...we'll support Ella.
I'm just getting started... Why are those two men sharing a candy bar? What? Those two men over there. One took a bite of the candy bar and passed it to the other.
There is only one. Which one? Ours. We need a base organization that we can create and control. We'll call it... The Unicaformists.
There are those who have lost a brother, someone a father... because of Gennaro and his kids. But that is a finished story. The one who had us as slaves is now hidden in some hole. Or is attached to a machine that keeps him alive. And they must never come back. Salvatore Conte and I have made a promise, and we will keep it.
I don't know. You don't know? What did you miss? Maybe my bed. Uncle Cal kept it warm for you.
- Nice. How was Miss Nussey? Fine. Did my box arrive safely? It's in your room. We brought it up, Emily and I.
We are here to clear up a misunderstanding that, when cleared up, will prove beneficial to everyone, both you and us, and we apologize for what must be an interruption to your morning's work. But perhaps if I give you this, it will make it clear to you who we are. - Where did you get this letter? - From the mail, from you. You sent it to me.
Yu Xiaohui! Yu Xiaohui! You leave this medicine-smelling fridge. - How can we use it? - It's not smelly. I always cover it with plastic before putting it in.
All right, this one... Give me back the letter. We knew that Yu Xiaohui was in love with you. However, we didn't know about the letter. Yu Xiaohui gave me that letter and asked me to give it to Liu Bo.
They all laughed about it. What happened next? Where is the letter now? I have no idea. Do you have it?
Let's go. Roller coasters, caffeine, undercooked eggs. I've been avoiding them my whole life. Since you're pregnant, you should avoid them. The difference is, she brings life into the world, and you detract from it.
Yesterday, I opened the safe deposit box for the first time... since the tragic death of poor Nicotra... - and realized that the gun was missing. - Wasn't it? - Who would take it? - Commissioner. I'm sorry to say, but I think Nicotra himself took it.
I took the opportunity to grab my bike and leave quickly. I followed the same path as Nicotra, but I never caught up with him. No, I didn't even get to see him. And... what did you do with the gun? I found it in my pocket when I got home.
- And who's talking about it! - Commissioner, are you kidding? - No. Are you thinking of going to jail? To listen to Rosales we need a judge's authorization! - If we don't have it, it's because he hasn't given it to us, it's over! - Listen to me.
Tell me where you've been. What, are you wearing that fucking lipstick? When did you start wearing lipstick? Where have you been? Tell me where you've been and don't lie. Don't tell me you've been to Tina's, because your mother is in cahoots with that lie and I'm not buying it.
- I mean, so I can call you when we figure out what we're going to do, because I'm not sure what we're going to do. - Okay, I'll give you a phone number. I don't really have a phone, but I know this guy - It's a long story. This guy I dated for a long time, he was actually an alcoholic and gay and he came over to my house and drank all the sangria and then I had that watermelon and he picked it up and threw it on the floor.
Cold Macchiato. Hi. The cash register won't open. Shit. Did you unplug it and plug it back in?
I know we won't. The house is just up this road. What am I saying? You know where it is; you've attacked it before.
She should know. Good morning! What is the purpose of this visit? Did you consider my proposal? Will you let me keep the third district? I didn't even take her seriously.
I was hoping that would happen. Yes! Yes! I don't think your wrist is supposed to move like that. No, it's been like that since I broke it playing soccer in high school.
I hope it's Brandon. He's got a key. Hey, look, look, look, look. I'm still wearing your chain. Why would I wear it if I didn't want to be with you?
Okay. So how does Grandma know that I'm lending Cort money for his divorce? Because I told her. And how do you know? When I was in her apartment yesterday, your checkbook was on the table, so I looked at it.
I mean, no. No, I'm not high right now, but yeah, I... I'm licensed to use medical marijuana. - How? You're 15. My mom got it for me.
Yeah, it's just... Listen, I... I don't think I'm ready to smoke weed. It's okay, um... The thing is, we're not gonna smoke it.
The blues were born here, in the Mississippi Delta. John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, BB King, Jessie Mae Hemphill, I can't see them anymore, but their spirit lives on, right here. I can tune out to the music, Can you hear it?
It's what I used to do as a child. Lay my mother's clothes on her bed, in her shape, imagining she was there. That turned me on. When I was a little older, 12, 13, whenever I could, I would get women's underwear. I would use it to masturbate.
"In the old days, when wishes still achieved good things... there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful. But the youngest was as beautiful as the sun itself, who indeed had seen so much, he marveled every time it shone on her face. In the vicinity of the king's castle was a large, dark forest, and in this forest, under a linden tree, was a well. At the hottest time of the day, the Princess would go into the forest and sit on the edge of the cold well. To pass the time she would take a golden ball, and throw it into the air and then catch it.
The stone. Dance! Would you like to dance? The mind is like a piñata shaped like a brain, Deathstroke. As we smash it to pieces, the candies of memories fall on the lawn of destiny.
It destroys the body, but life remains. It is horrible. I know. That's why it's called the forbidden tactic. Then why are you teaching it to me?
- You really are the Boy Wonder. I wouldn't have had to save you if you'd listened to me at first. Don't remind me. When Batman comes back he'll give me his "little look". He left me a perfectly peaceful city and I wrecked it.
Now, yes. To most good debtor's eyes, I would say you are viewed as an irresponsible thief, and we are only collecting what is owed to us. Now I'm going to ask you one more time, do you have the amount owed? I don't.
I've had it for a long time. You have a gun. Why? Like you said... for protection. Have you used it?
I want to know where it is. It's in a box under the bed. It's under our bed? ! That's where we need it.
Jo, he's still alive. Barely. You know, back then, I... I didn't value my life very much, but now it's different. I'm over it. I don't need it anymore.
Hardly. You know, at that time, I... I didn't value my life very much, but now it's different. I'm over it. I don't need her anymore. I don't want her.
Why on earth would you make me run away? I didn't make you run away. You wanted to. You showed me the carrot. You showed it to me because you didn't want this wedding to happen, so you showed it to me.
I never knew what the proper name was until now, did you? Anyway, they became Mom and Dad. They had many children, including yours truly. And they built a house. They called it Heaven.
No one stops you. There was blood everywhere. - You should be dead. - Well, it's not like we haven't been through this, detective. What's new? I got a sample of your blood and I'll take it for testing.
You know there are many ways this can play out. It seems like there's a very obvious one. Not really...because someone who goes to the trouble of putting on a big show like the one we just saw, you don't make the mistake of leaving a gun in your locker, do you? - It's my father's gun. - Yes. I carry it to protect me and my friends.
Hey, where's Touie? He said he... he was going to play basketball. Yeah. Did you see the picture he sent? He sent it to you, too, didn't he?
I could steal your motorcycle and take it with me. You do that. - I think she likes you. - Can I take it? Yeah, as long as you give it back, I don't care.
- Have fun and take risks. - I will. It will be fun. As soon as I was on the bike, I felt like I was buckled into the road. That kind of connection is super rare, and I was honored to have Roland lend it to me for the rest of the trip.
Seven priests offer all the elements to the Ganges... water, air, earth in the form of flowers, and most important of all, light, which represents our souls. As the ceremony comes to an end, people gather at the water's edge to place the light of their own souls in a small boat. This is our individual way of offering ourselves to the river, with candles carrying our soul to the river. It is the light of my soul. It is my soul and it says take it wherever you think is good for me.
Just stay here. I want you here. I need you here. It's not like you can go back to that shitty relationship. I faked it for a whole year.
Hello, Rafe. Hello, Mrs. Johnson. - Why don't you come in? - Unbelievable. So I took her home and Melanie was there.
Elliott was kind enough to lend you. Stand here. Are you deaf? Stand here. When I give you an instruction, you follow it the first time I ask you to.
Yes, the Pope tells it like it is. Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Are you all right? Those guys hurt my back. There's a bag up there. Can you reach it?
Is that a bloody kite? I smell coyote babies. The other house was too expensive. Yeah, this house is actually perfect. Or at least it will be, when we renovate it.
How about you and I take the car and go to the lake like we used to? I can't do that. There's a Hitler Youth meeting this afternoon. Well, you'll miss it. I'll miss it?
You can taste the dishonesty It's in all your breath As you pass it so cavalierly.
You're after Thomas Shaw. And in order to keep that secret, you've been trying to eliminate Daniel Miller. Who the hell does that? Give me Shaw and we'll sort this mess out. You, for one thing, are trying to pin the Iosava extradition on Steven Frost, when we both know he didn't order it.
Your hands are full of bacteria. What did I say? Don't fuck your eyes so you don't get contaminated. Don't play with the doll now. You can only play with it after I wash it.
On top of that, he was also drunk. He fell asleep there. I couldn't think of anything. I went crazy. There was a rock nearby. I picked it up and smashed his head!
What happened at the rehearsal? Everything is fine, but Mrs. Golishevsky fired us as godmothers. She didn't like Caroline at all. I'm not the one she put a 1,000-year curse on. I've reduced it to 500 years.
Yes, that would be great, Mrs. Golishevsky, because I shattered the last one. Call me mom. Okay, mom. No, I don't like it. I'm going to put the holy water back and it'll be like I never stole it.
Okay, Mom. No, I don't like it. I'm going to put the holy water back and it will be as if I never stole it. I can't risk God's wrath. Or have I already suffered it?
Questions about... case... Honey, I'm losing you. I'll be back as soon as I can. Welcome to the party. I wouldn't miss it.
Alice told me that her brother feeds on anger and grief. I don't want that to be all that's left of us. You mean all that's left of me. Barnes asked me to put you on a forty-eight hour stakeout. I've already signed it.
It's a long way to the cellar then.... That little minx hasn't turned up Well it would be an absolute shame to let this nice meal go to waste What do you say I save it and put it up for lunch tomorrow?
The badge creates expectations People want a hero, and I'm no hero You know what a hero is, son? A man who values protecting others above himself A man who knows his limits but is not afraid to fail, a man who knows when to call for help when he needs it
- Great, great. - Honestly, Captain... Look, I know I've been around for a while... Maybe that's why you've forgotten how things work around here. I give you an order, you follow it.
Let me go. If the police want to come after me, fine. But you... let me go. I'm not going to do that. You'd be condemning this town when I'd be saving it.
You mean the key, don't you? You're not getting it back until I talk to the people you work for. What if we kill you and take it? You think we're stupid enough to bring it back with us? You really want it back?
What, like some kind of... weapon? Well, honestly, we don't know. We captured a member, but even he didn't know what was inside the box, only that the Court fears it will fall - into the hands of their enemies. - Wait, wouldn't they know you'd steal it?
I will inform you myself tomorrow night. Volk! Mitya, be careful. We know you've been looking for the second key. Have you found it?
Or are you? Are you going to arrest me, Jim? You want to make me look even more like a paranoid ex-boyfriend? I'll pass the test again. We'll find out how you passed.
Or anyone? You think this is about Alchemy? There's only one way to find out. Julian lied about the Philosopher's Stone. I think he found it at that archeological dig.
One night, I was there alone and she came back to me. She stood right in front of me, clear as day... a ghost or a vision, I don't know, but... it was real. What happened? She told me about the stone. She told me where to find it, she told me that if I got it, then she would bring us together again.
That's what I did. I mounted an expedition to India. We searched for days, weeks. Nothing. And then we found it.
Jay is right, the stone has been the key to everything. So, we destroy the stone and Savitar is gone forever. It's impossible to destroy it. It's been around forever, there's a reason for it. Why don't we bury it again, put it in the ground where you found it?
It's impossible to destroy it. It's been around forever, there's a reason for it. Why don't we bury it again, put it in the ground where you found it, "Jumanji". Someone else would find it and we'd be right back where we started.
- What? - Trixie's best friend, Langa, has a new All-American doll, now Trixie wants one. So she does that? She destroys her old doll, - waiting for me to replace it.
See? He's innocent. Tina, I can see that your father loves you very much, but... this video doesn't prove anything. His lawyers had this tape for 16 years. He made them promise to give it to me when he died.
Pop-Tarts. Mr. Glory has a second home in Ventura. If you don't mind. Okay, we'll check it out, but... Luci, if he's the one with the sword, he's much more likely to go on a killing spree than to hide it.
Laws of the universe and all that, so.... I didn't ask to come back here. No, you didn't. And you hate it. That look in your eyes, I've seen it before.
You were so quiet! This is not what I wanted, Dad. Well, we'll do the proposal properly, with a ring and a photographer. For the wedding of the year. That, and we'll celebrate it at the spa, which with the subsidy will already be n¡quelao' right Benito?
You just said he placed the same type of artifact. And for a good reason. One that I'm not willing to reveal to you at this time. As you wish. If I had a white flag, I'd wave it.
I am looking for his father. I have not been able to track him anywhere. He's traveling today. I don't think so. I received this letter by messenger, just a little while ago, and the man who delivered it to me said he was present and saw his father write it.
The sooner we know what's going on, the sooner we can let Dad rest in peace. Wait a minute. Where's the box? Wasn't it right there? You said you wouldn't move it.
Wait a minute. Where's the box? Wasn't it right over there? You said you wouldn't move it. No, we haven't touched it.
I mean, it's probably like this... O... You know, so where is it? Sometimes they drain the blood and replace it with embalming fluid.
Since the hostage crisis in 1979, our relationship with Iran has been the biggest problem...in foreign policy. But last year, Iran and world powers signed a deal...that eased years of economic sanctions...in exchange for Iran abandoning its nuclear weapons program. With the nuclear deal that the U.S., our allies and partners... signed with Iran, it can begin to get rid of nuclear sanctions... and have access to the funds it had frozen. This agreement has been very controversial in the U.S., and 47 senators signed a letter... asking to rescind the agreement. I signed that letter and I stand by it.
As you will see, there are farmers, villagers.... The village is right there. Davondan is separating his team... to warn people that there's going to be an explosion. Out. Copy that. Affirmative. Here are the blasting capsules. He'll take the capsule out and put it on top of this explosive, down in the hole, and explode the bomb, hopefully without damage.
- What? - Franny needs her own room for the home study that Social Services is doing today. - Franny's getting my room back? - That's what I just said. Am I getting it back?
I like your spirit. And your kneecaps aren't bad either. So what are you going to do about your trespassing and approaching my students? What are you going to do about you destroying public education? We're not destroying it.
♪ Man you ain't a money maker boy ♪ ♪ ♪ Paper clip, paper clip ♪ ♪ Yeah I need a paper clip ♪ Hey, is this milk any good? What you gonna use it for?
- Did you really say that? - Yeah, man, I had to. Okay. You know the song "Paper Boy"? Yeah, "Paper Boy" is sung by Paper Boy. Yeah, I've heard it.
Okay. Do you know the song "Paper Boy"? Yeah, "Paper Boy" is sung by Paper Boy. Yeah, I've heard it. Good shit. Man, the streets love it.
Yo, tell him that Flo Rida story. It's so funny. Yo, tell them. Oh, uh... yeah, so I was at a station party. And, uh, the DJ...a friend of a friend, he was really bad, and, uh...you know, it was a big event for the station, and the party goes back and forth and he's ruining it, and then he goes and plays Flo Rida.
peace. Dude... yeah. That's cool. Why didn't you tell her... dude. It's weird that your card didn't work the first two times they swiped it.
Bess... who carries a terrible burden of guilt for failing her own child. You can free her from that. Can you do that? Brandon Peters did not murder Alyssa Yang. People know the truth when they hear it.
David Mailer? Yeah? I'm Special Agent Grant MacLaren with the FBI. I stopped by earlier, left a card under your door. Excuse me, I didn't... I haven't seen it.
He saw that I was not very well, and asked me why. I explained. And he gave me a bottle wrapped in brown paper. He said it would help me. Beryl found it in my pocket, while I was looking for a cigarette.
Do we go in there and question her? Depends on what condition she's in. The killer left that tape for me. Clearly there's some connection to Ms. Lang. Either she gave him that tape, or he took it.
The killer put it there. That's how he found out about the recording. He hasn't been watching us. He's been listening! He knew I'd take it.
You must have gone to great lengths to get something like that. I feel very lucky. I have to tell you something. What? I stole that sculpture from someone's studio... and then I tried to sell it through Martin, but Martin took it and gave it to you.
Well, I'd say more like indecision. I was reading this comic book... I think young people call it a graphic novel. It's called ... Zombie Pandemic. A voter gave it to me.
It is called ... Zombie Pandemic. A voter gave it to me. I thought it was funny. But then, then I realized who made it.
We have this from 12 hours ago. Say hello to T. Solotov. It is the only known photo, taken from a drone in Sudan. The drone was not supposed to be there. The pilot was capturing the panorama en route to his house. He took it by accident.
Diamonds are forever. The last time Voydian and I spoke, he was nervous about something. And it wasn't imports. Before he was arrested, he left information for me. He hid it in a massage parlor.
Hello? Hello, Miss Jacobs. Hello, Miss Jacobs. Yes. I'm sorry about that. Duke had his homework, but I forgot it in my truck.
We will have to destroy everything that is left. No one is going to eat it. We'll bring you more, okay? They took the refrigerator. They broke it and took the pieces.
He slammed his head on the table. Very hard. Then he pushed me to the floor. That's when the bottle broke. Then he picked it up and started cutting himself.
What aren't they into, millions of bugs flying around saving the ecosystem? Yeah, that's great, let's save the planet, hallelujah! The government is not going to invest millions because of the opinion of a few scientists and 200 votes from environmentalists. They saw the opportunity to have more and they took it.
Cool. Gingerbread cookies. Let's see. Yeah, this'll do. It's going to be behind the door when I close it, right?
- Who's hungry? No? Who's hungry? Aren't you hungry? So... is that formula just for babies, or can hungry big kids take it too?
The hawk swooped down on the prey and carried it off...
Believing in the dreams I was given! Trusting in what is shown on TV and written in the newspapers. But you took away my world and I'm going to take away yours! I'm not going to complete the story! I'll leave it incomplete, in the middle!
Look, there is a process to follow. We act according to the Law. Where was this Law when my son happened? To get justice, it may take some time. If that was the way to get it, then I would have it now.
So what are we doing here? Agent, you and I are like the snake and the cat. If the snake can, kill the cat. And if the cat can, it kills the snake. But sometimes, you both see a big rat and you both want to eat it.
But tonight the thing couldn't go more cars even if we wanted it to. And I'll prove that to them because we're going to start with this. Bear with me, bear with me.... I agree! The thing is, several supercar makers have taken Prius polar bear friendly technology and are using it to create sheer speed.
Salvatore, but that's not the way forward. He's right, I'm already juggling to pay you in my "square". And what can I do? I don't understand. If this is a democratic alliance, we all have to buy the drugs together at the same price. - And we buy it from you, who buy it for less. That way you win twice: with us and with your "squares".
- And we buy it from you, who buy it for less. This way you win twice: with us and with your "places". You are not obliged to buy it from me. I am not Savastano. Buy it wherever you want. As long as you can find it for less, but that's another matter:
- Okay, I'll get it. - I'll get it. Did you bring a wallet? No. I left it at home.
- Yeah? Wow. - Yeah. Yeah. Mom, what are you turning it on for?
- Just one. - Well, just so you know, I've been cleaning up. I threw out several newspapers yesterday and I have a bag in the garage ready to donate. Do you want to see the shoes I bought today? If you have a bag ready to donate, will you give it to me so I can take it off your hands today?
I threw out several newspapers yesterday and I have a bag in the garage ready to donate. Do you want to see the shoes I bought today? If you have a bag ready to donate, will you give it to me so I can take it off your hands today? No, honey, I'm putting things in it. I'm not ready for you to take it yet.
The Jews, the veterans, the gays. Nobody wants it and they say it's too big for their? showrooms or stores. It's the divorce table. He was supposed to take it. I don't want it, I paid for it, and guess who is now literally hooked on it?
She's not a posh old geezer. Whatever the hell does that mean? I can get rid of it for you. You want me to? Yeah. 200 bucks and I'll take her to the dump.
You will lock onto the target, then your lights will go out. Thanks for all your hard work. Corben. Yeah, the ship didn't explode. Superman and Supergirl saved it.
Show me. You got a warrant? Be smart. Come on! Every time you come in here, you squeeze my balls to get information out of me, and I give it to you, right? Right?
Well, I'm going to play a little "Portal" and wait for her to write me. Get the crystals out of the garage and tidy them up. A week of home suspension. You're not spending it on the computer.
I left a branch in the attic window when I installed the recorder. I left a branch in the attic window when I installed the recorder. Hold it when you're inside. As long as the window is open, the alarm stays off. If the window is closed, the alarm goes off again until someone turns it off.
Why? The tree, the rooster... I planned everything. The ball too. I paid some kids to throw it at your window during the session.
You're angry... and I understand. But you're smart. Maybe we can work something out that benefits us both. That benefits both of us. I saw an opportunity and I took it.
Didn't he tell you? That's interesting. The Russians claim there's evidence going around. Evidence of what? I don't know exactly, but it makes me very nervous. Meachum wanted to know if Dmitri had it.
He was at a supply store on Mt. Baker an hour ago. - Take your men there. - Mount Baker? Shouldn't be hard to find. I'll give you his location when I get it.
Nothing has changed. Flynn is still out there. He still has the primary ship. And you're still our best option. When he uses it again, we'll call you.
Freeze! Little boy! Freeze! Have you ever played that game of telephone? It's a kid's game. You take a can... and, uh, you tie it to another can with a string. And then, you pretend it's a telephone. And you can hear each other.
With three, there was balance. Now it's chaos. He squeezed my hand... He squeezed my hand. What? No, he squeezed my hand.
He squeezed my hand... He squeezed my hand. What? No, he squeezed my hand. I was holding his hand and he squeezed it.
Get out! - Stop. Stop it. You sold me the laundry, remember? I bought it from you.
It's a deal. I run the homeless shelter. You may have seen me on the news. As it turns out, the washing machine is a safety hazard in my community. It was a good deed that a good Samaritan donated it, but it's not safe in a house with kids and little sober supervision.
I always wanted a wine rack. No, Etta, I haven't seen it. I need a job and I've spent the whole day trying to get along with Derek's family, and now I have to go to the grocery store and make dinner for Neil. I swear that card was in my wallet. Do you think someone stole it?
No, Etta, I haven't seen him. I need a job and I've spent the whole day trying to get along with Derek's family, and now I have to go to the grocery store and make dinner for Neil. I swear that card was in my wallet. Do you think someone stole it from me? Isn't it possible you left it at one of the places you've been shopping?
A couple more weeks like this and you're loaded. Are you stressed out because of that chick, Margo? I'm thinking about her offer. What about Etta? Well, I didn't say I'd take her up on it, but I'm trying to think of a good reason not to.
Okay, they're all gone. Can we talk? Not right now. I'm in training. Oh, come on, now. You haven't used that thing since you took it out of the box eight years ago.
Not now. I'm training. Come on, now. You haven't used that thing since you took it out of the box eight years ago. It was six years ago, and you don't know how many times I've used it.
I'm training. Come on. You haven't used that thing since you took it out of the box eight years ago. It was six years ago, and you don't know how many times I've used it. Actually, Lance, the odometer tells me exactly how much you've used it.
Just like old times, right? Yeah, except for the anger. That's right, we were both fucking maniacs. What's wrong with your hand? I sprained it.
You're starting to sound just like me. Shit, Dirk, I get it. I get it all. Listen, before we go into the hotel, this is the time to stop and think, seriously think about how we're going to do this. We only get one shot at this, and we have to be careful how we take it.
I'm a detective. You hired me... Your future you hired me... to investigate all this... the "your death" incident. Well, me and him, we came from the future. We found your time machine a week ago and used it to get back here.
Your future you, hired me... to investigate all this... the "your death" incident. Well, me and him, we came from the future. We found your time machine a week ago and used it to get back here. Impossible. When I took the machine out of Springsborough, I buried it...
Well, me and him, we come from the future. We found your time machine a week ago and used it to get back here. No way. When I took the machine out of Springsborough, I buried it... We dug it up.
But you didn't. You kept things from me on purpose. - You lied to me! - I didn't lie to you. I just... I didn't tell you the whole truth because I didn't understand, and...
Well, 100 years ago... Okay, I need you to shut the fuck up already. - I thought you said you wanted answers. - I want reality! I want my reality back and I want it now...
You were supposed to protect him. That wasn't the first time that happened, was it? I was supposed to take you there too... You did the thing. And now that you've done it, all of a sudden you go and...
Farah, help me. It's crazy to see it up close, isn't it? So much money, and then... Where's the head? We're keeping it aside.
That's what we do. Am I being investigated? We told you before, Todd, you are a "person of interest" which is getting more and more interesting. Your parents told us about this medical condition, which runs in your family, your sister has it now.
I didn't even know about this place. So... the unlimited power source, that's the machine those guys are after? The bad guys, right? The bad guys... Yeah, but nobody ever found it.
There seems to be some sort of body swapping going on with the bad guys. Looks like Gordon Rimmer used to be Lux DuJour. I don't want the same things Lux wanted anymore. Where's the head? We're storing it separately.
All part of the job. No, it absolutely wasn't. Unless you're talking about your work at my detective agency. The machine! I left it in the car!
Don't worry, I'm on my way. I'm on my way. I have a theory. I have a theory and I don't like it at all, but it's... it's my theory and it's all I have right now. So I'm... I'm going to explain it to you and... if you understand it, I mean, if you grasp it in its entirety, you're going to have to tell me, you're going to have to help me and you're going to have to confirm or deny whether it's correct or not,
That dog... is the most important thing here. Because it's Lydia Spring. Yeah. How did they turn her into a dog? No, they didn't, they took her soul out of her body and exchanged it with a dog's.
Were they killed? Well, actually, it was the shark. That "machine," where is it? Here, right here. We put it together ourselves, some of the pieces may be backwards but...
I have the other machine! So that means you're now following me. So now you're going to go and recruit everyone you can, everyone who hasn't fled. My men are bringing me all the relevant people. Tonight I'm going to have the machine, and I'm going to have it at the tempo, and you're going to meet me there.
Well... Red gave it to me. I see. Senator Wheatus. And did he get it from a valet or...?
And he proposed to me: "I'm going to make the soup. That's what they want. I'll make it and taste it. I'll add flavor. The chef would taste it, and he'd say, "It's good."
The first stop was Cuquila. In a coffee plantation I met a man named Roberto who was making a sauce in a molcajete. I was starving because it had been a long trip. I went straight to the kitchen to get something to eat and saw Roberto. He was making the sauce and I tasted it.
And when you start to fail, people panic. At some point I thought about closing Pujol. It's the worst feeling in the world. Suddenly, one day I walked into the kitchen and they had the music on, they always played it when I wasn't there. I went in and they turned it off.
Salsa evolves and is a living thing. When I went to Mexico City, I think the mole had been there for 453 days. He told me it had about a hundred ingredients. It's a very complex sauce, much more than any classic French sauce. And he serves it on a plate in a perfect circle.
This would have been a magnificent moment for Napoleon. After all, St. Petersburg may have been the official capital of the country, but Moscow was still its spiritual heart. The tsars were still crowned in the Kremlin, right there. But the Russians were not about to give Napoleon the satisfaction of officially surrendering the city to him. Instead, they simply abandoned it, leaving it barely governable.
Going somewhere? It's half past three. Emma's house. The house is clear. We've been through it from top to bottom.
I ask you not to contact the family. It is impossible. We cannot stand by and do nothing. It would be indecent. Write, give me the letter, and I will forward it.
And, dollars to donuts, white adults. I... Who are you mad at, Brian? Uch, how much time do you have? Not enough for that, but you're right. If you want a song that a baby likes, you have to have a baby write it.
People leave everything a mess. Someone poured a beer in my Brita mug. It's like I fucked everyone, but I don't fuck everyone, man! It's a blue aviator jacket. - Have you seen it?
- (Al) Hello? - Hey. What's up, Al? Did you take my jacket yesterday? Fuck. No, I thought maybe you took it.
Hi. Here you go, your key. Thank you. I've been looking for it all day. I've been looking for it all day. Yeah, your drunk self told me to hold it for you... last night at the club.
Oh... Oh... my... God! There are no shoes in there. We've inconvenienced an innocent man and his guest. You know, I'm not 100% sure I ordered that rug. I may have just put it on my wish list.
And Marinella? - I have good news. - Where's Marinella, mom? Listen, you have a "square" all to yourself. Sette Palazzi. Everyone wanted it, but I was faster than the others, and now those bastards, the kids in the Alley, are dying of envy.
Potency changes from batch to batch and bag to bag. Also, heroin must be mixed, because pure would kill even a veteran addict. What they mix it with, nobody knows. I can sell them for between $8,500 and $10,000. And how much do you sell it for if you mix it?
And we are putting together the list he wants. We know his tricks. We're not going to give him the list. The police won't do it. How are you going to get it?
I can't find the other fishing rod. Can't you look for it tomorrow? There's no time, we leave at dawn. Well, calm down. You'll find it. I'm sure Vincent took it and didn't put it back.
Good evening, champ. Olivier Blanpain, born in '79... and died in '96. His parents, Ghislaine and Claude... left Belgium a year after his death. Everyone knows that story. They told it to us so we wouldn't play with guns.
I know, but I believe in myself. Someday, the world will see what I already know: That Jason Mendoza is a beautiful, unique soul who has so much to give to this world. Okay, that's the Acidcat boat. Hand me the thing that will blow it up.
We can't do that. That's crazy. No. No, I know-- we had the chance and we blew it and I married someone else.
Did your father leave you something? Yes. His house. What? He didn't leave it to Nina?
I barely wash the dishes with it. I don't let my granddaughter bathe, shower or brush her teeth with that water, because we don't know what effects it can have. I was drinking that water until about a month ago. And when I saw the news, I said, "To hell with it." They said it had lead in it, but I drank it.
You did it for a fee. Mac, did you ever wonder why our government wants that weapon? What they're planning to do with it? We're running out of time here, Mac. Even if you find it, the people I work for won't stop for anything.
The bite on your neck. What? I gave you a dose of the original HZN1 vaccine. It counteracts your bite and frees us from Murphy's control. I've been taking it, too.
No, but I'm a quick learner. Okay, this question is not intended to be sexist at all, but it is a requirement for this workplace, so no offense. What, can you lift that bag? Where does he want it?
You have to get that cough checked out. I said let's get started. Yes, of course. I offer you this flower as a symbol of peace. I hope you will accept it and we can put an end to this war and return to peaceful peace.
Chaos Pugilistic Brawl. Graduation. Well, weird. I remember my graduation. My abuelita organized it because she was studying at my house.
I was collecting nails. I made a puppet with teeth. Also, my mother ran over a raccoon...and I dissected it. I cut off a cat's tail. But a vet sewed it on.
What is your secret recipe? There are about 24 different ingredients in barbecue sauce. It's not too sweet. It's not too spicy. And it makes it so everybody can eat it.
- About the rock, alien boy! God, you keep talking about what a prince you are, but all you do is stand there and ask stupid questions and misunderstand things! Is the rock dangerous? Yes. Yes, it's dangerous. If you hold it too long it'll fry your brain.
I'd rather swim in my own vomit. In any case, what little we know about their species suggests a fight to the death. But then again, it's up to you. I just saved your life... I won't take it from you now.
- It's all right. - In our new minivan. Hey, what's for lunch? Did you buy a minivan? It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it.
Can I see yours? Alex Danvers, Secret Service. I'm sure you mean well, detective, but this is federal business. - You're tainting my evidence. - I'm contaminating it?
And where is he? I terminated his contract yesterday, but I can give you his address. - Where did you get the sample? - What did you get? To test the DNA you needed a sample. Where did you get it from?
- He got you. - I know he did. - Dad? - I love this town. I really do.
It's not over. I think it is. No. Listen to me. I've been thinking about that knife and I seem to remember your father giving it to you.
Because the only real evidence they have is the knife from your cabin. And there's an ocean of time between when the ivory shard fell out of the handle and when they found the knife. I'm going to rip them to shreds over this. And I know from your mother that it wasn't even your knife. Your father gave it to you.
And there's an ocean of time between when the ivory shard fell out of the handle and when they found the knife. I'm going to rip you to shreds for this. And I know from your mother that it wasn't even your knife. Your father gave it to you. He must have carried it during a murder, left the ivory shard behind, then gave it to his nature-loving eldest son and that was it.
My God, what do we do? Make this lawsuit go away. I own the company now, I didn't own it then. No, my father did then... and if you hadn't meddled to buy it behind my back... some huge conglomerate would have taken it... and this whole mess would have been their problem, not ours.
You no longer need it. The campaign is over. - Nothing has been decided yet... - It's over. She is prolonging it to stay in your life.
I'm going to the lab. Great. I'll be right there. I'll be right there. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Okay, look, how about I write him a letter and you decide whether he gets it or not?
Thirteen Boston hospitals purchased this brand of bars between 1989 and 1998. Okay. So we get the medical records of everyone who had surgery at those hospitals, we make a list. It's a nine-year window. Even if we narrow it down, we don't know the name of the ACP.
Fragile, sensitive Tessa, who always needs protection. Well, I don't see you that way. Who was the first person there when I passed the monkey? Who kept in touch with Garrett? And when family drifts apart, you always bring them back together.
You got that assignment from the director before I could restart it. Of course I did. I got back before you did. What's the difference? I was still vulnerable to faction corruption back then. Argue all you want, but I have my mission and I will complete it.
You get to the point, don't you? I... I always thought your broadcasts were from the 1950s and then that you could predict future events. Well, we're like fish in water, trying to understand what water is. Yeah, that doesn't help. Then a wave washes over us and we ride it.
It's a long way from here. - He's not here? - He's paranoid. He was afraid the Tesla tower would burn his brain out. Just send me the signal and I'll relay it.
Shouldn't you be out there somewhere bothering me? - That's funny. - So what do you want from us? You have the only communications network in the country. Your government needs it.
You see, I don't think you're going to make us all pay, Charlie. I think you're better than that. You have no idea what kind of person I am. Or what's at stake here. If I use it, I'll have nothing.
What's so scary about the local guardians? Are you leaving now? Why would I stay? Here's a letter. I found it among Miss Baia's things.
Are you leaving now? Why would I stay? Here's a letter. I found it in Miss Baia's things. Sorry, I didn't have an envelope, so I opened it.
You'll never hear Julia's name again. - Hi, I'm Julia. - No! I just wanted to introduce myself and tell you that you have a great husband. I also have a nice bike, but I keep it locked up.
I reported it in the flood of '09. My career and the waters of that flood culminated at the same time. This is Kent Brockman blowing a sad song into his beer bottle. Mr. Brockman, we've uncovered a great story! And we need a real journalist to expose it to the public.
What? He left the only guitar I have... that matches his voice the best. Like I said, eyes on the prize. Where'd you get a chainsaw? I found it in one of his closets.
He left the only guitar I have... that matches his voice the best. Like I said, eyes on the prize. Where did you get a chainsaw? I found it in one of his closets. I'm sure he bought it to use on his stupid farm.
I was wondering where you ran off to, you little thief. I've got it. I can bring it to your office, and we'll have lunch together. I'm very busy today. Then I'll bring it to your place tomorrow night.
I'm just matching your sloppy points, you know you have them. Maybe I like those sloppy spots, and I want to be with someone who likes them too. Do you understand then you lose the Jenkins Herschel offer? That's too bad. You gave the folder to my dad and he dismissed it?
He's a great guy. He wants to legalize marijuana. That's a good idea. Ask Colorado why they have so much money for schools and roads. As soon as California legalizes it....
It's a good idea. Ask Colorado why they have so much money for schools and roads. As soon as California legalizes it? Legalize it! As soon as California legalizes it, they're going to say, "We have too much money.
That's the way guns are. The more you look at a gun and you see a gun where there's a gun, the more likely it's the gun you're looking at. And that's the most dangerous thing about a gun. So when you think about owning a gun, understand this: when you buy it and put it somewhere, it's probably going to be there when you look at it again.
Let's hear it for Chloe Arnold. Previously on Crowe's Nest: No, but I'm crazy about marijuana. I think it's making a comeback. Obama smoked it and that's great.
Previously on Crowe's Nest: No, but I'm crazy about marijuana. I think it's making a comeback. Obama smoked it and that's great. And George Washington smoked it.
Darkness is important to understand Inside you It's not always about being good It's about understanding why you have to be good in the first place Empathy is bullshit Once you feel it You can't get rid of it
- How can we help? - Out of context, this photo makes me look insensitive at the very least. - And as a racist as the worst. - Yes, exactly. Look, a bartender at the party emailed it to me. threatening to go to the press if I didn't pay him 100k.
I think Sarah ran that kid over and Jake found a defense. You son of a bitch. I'm so tired of being cheated on this week and you of all people... Calm down. What's going on? Sarah Keaton didn't take Ambien, and you put up some ridiculous defense and I almost believed it?
I've heard great things. I'm Madison Gray. How can I help you? I don't know about this. I haven't been on a board in over ten years. You made a promise and I'm taking you to keep it.
I didn't abuse shit. I disagree. Because not only does Kevin live in New Jersey, but his accident was there too, which means you were out of your jurisdiction. You better drop this lawsuit, because if they come after me.... No one's coming after you, Sean, because I haven't filed it yet.
He's loyal and always has been. No shit. Donald Mannis is using this shit to gain power. That's exactly right. And I made it easier for him, because I showed up without you.
- I can't believe it. I'm about to cross-examine in the most important case of my life, and you come here? Jessica, we left you a dozen messages. Jim Reynolds' board of directors changed the meeting. Well, tell them to hold it, because I can't make it right now.
Jessica, we left you a dozen messages. Jim Reynolds' board of directors changed the meeting. Well, tell them to hold it, because I can't make it right now. Damn it, don't you understand? They moved it to get this over with.
Which part? Besides the obvious hypocrisy of pretending Nicole faces expulsion for a pinch of herbs when the Leyton girl was selling pills at school last fall and yet I just saw her in the hallway. Okay, what are you doing? I'm the feeder. It's very simple. We appreciate your consideration but we don't need it.
How twisted. Yes, it's twisted and it would be the end of my career. How could it have happened? A time bomb. You access a computer, enter information, hide it, and program it to open on a certain day.
You are welcome. It works for me. - Donna! - Okay, okay, okay, okay. Now, listen. If you really want my help, I'll give it to you.
He came to see me last week to ask me to represent him. If you make one false move that could put me in danger, I'll call this whole thing off. I need a big, expensive house in the Hamptons. Why are you buying a vacation home? Because I told Tara Messer I had a property there and I hired her to remodel it.
Well, you can go back in, because I just talked to Sutter. I guess he told you about our conversation today. If you call doing things behind my back and getting his investment business, then yes, he told me about it. I didn't go behind your back. I saw an opportunity and I took it.
Well, what happens when we lose this case and your business disappears? We'll be back on our feet by then, so instead of blaming me for the position Sutter put you in, I suggest you go and find a way out. Rachel, how can I help you? I was hoping you could do something for Leonard Bailey. I drafted a petition to reopen his case, but I need a current member of the bar to file it.
- Your home? - Louis, who are these people? These people are the registered owners of this property. You mean the one you said has been in your family for generations? We built this house ourselves and until five minutes ago, we were going to sell it to him.
What's the matter? - Yeah. I got this... Gold gave it to me. It's about the coin. A shepherd... found it in the wreckage of a wagon.
Get the van moving. Audrey and I will look for Monet. Good. A quick search. But when you hear the van start, the bad guys will hear it too.
- Yes, thank you, well... She was sick for a while, so... we were prepared. - But thank you. - Yeah. But we've been clearing out her house. And I think I'll fix it up and maybe sell it.
Well, technically, I only stayed for six months but I've owned it for years. No one who knew the history of this place would touch it. You can look up the title, and within months of taking possession all the owners are either dead or missing. I became their guardian. I couldn't live in the house, but I kept it so others wouldn't repeat the mistake, and then a slight reversal of fortune left me short of funds when the property tax came in and you were unfortunate enough to buy it at auction.
Dead? No, no, no. That sweet little girl is not lost. Now, just sit back and relax your mind. I feel Flora's life force, and I feel it strongly.
- I get it. I'm on it. Do we still have the house? I own it. I bought it from Matt and Shelby for fifty cents on the dollar when we shot the reenactments.
We'll get you, woman! What the hell are you doing? Get the camera! It's around here somewhere. You'd better record when I catch it!
Those two savages are still out there. We killed people last night, Audrey. Both of us. There's a videotape in that farmhouse. I want that tape before someone finds it.
So, based on what I'm seeing, it looks to me like you need surgery. Will that make me feel better? Well, there are never any guarantees, but, if things go well, then, yes, it will. Good! Then I want it.
If I had told him to wait, maybe the police could have come and broken the circle and he would be free. I was careless with his life. Dr. Reese... you are anything but careless. Sometimes the best advice isn't enough. One dangerous thing about psychiatry is that it can sometimes give those of us who practice it the illusion of control.
It's not every day that the boss comes to the neighborhoods of 35. When did you have your surgery? My Everclear presentation is tomorrow. Good luck to you. It's not like you need it.
I am aware of how my own agency works, thank you. Every day at the same time... Agent Elizabeth Albee carries a device... with updated location information. I'll steal her ID badge... so I can clone her and put a false identity on her. And then you'll take this flash drive... insert it into the server... and that will give me remote access.
I'm sorry. Yeah, well, what he did should do some good. Mack got a lead on his uncle... A possible location. We'll follow it, and we'll make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else.
Except that I have proven that it is not true. I'm rewriting the laws of nature. Yeah, but you're either drunk on power, or drinking your own Tang.... or drunk on Powerade... I don't know. The point is, you're not creating power, Eli... you're stealing it.
Are you trying to fire me? Well, let me tell you something, love of my life. I don't get fired, okay? I have a 99 percent customer satisfaction rating. I have a plaque from the county, which I said we should hang in the living room, and you never hung it, now no one can find it.
He did not tell me the contents of the box. He instructed me to wait for delivery instructions. I had to retrieve it. Torres had too many warehouses, too many offices. It took me a week to find out where he kept it.
They say, "Receive the mandate of Heaven, and with it, longevity and prosperity." Assuming he got his hands on the genuine article, Rey was right: the green rock was worth a fortune. In fact, the Chinese emperor once traded it for 15 cities.
All I need to do is share my suspicions with my clients and it will be the next one torn to shreds. You wouldn't dare. Confess. If you are arrested, tried and convicted, I could convince them that justice has been done. If Jimmy Koslow had been offered the same opportunity, I think he would have taken it.
You would never realize what happened. More effective. Yeah, that, that would be more effective. I'm just kidding. I sharpened this sword in case you need it during the night.
Hey, I'm sorry. I know they're too little to talk to you about cocaine. It seems to me... I think six is too early for cocaine... Yeah, but at seven... We'll let them try it at seven.
He does his tender loving care. People forget that I'm a doctor and I know shit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Check out his little squirrel dick. You dare me to take it off?
Then I dressed Parker Posey for the premiere of "The Good Wife." Before I knew it, I was a stylist. - I love your jacket, by the way. - Thank you. My trick is to buy a cheap jacket, replace the buttons with cool ones, and tell everyone I bought it in Italy.
Alex said you were going to put the coke in the bathroom, man. - It's not in there. - It's not there. What? I left it under the soap. Dude, I'm sure Alex took it.
When a girl dates a 20-year-old model, she won't date another one like that. I've got a chance. - You have to keep the weed. - No! I'm too overwhelmed when I have it.
- Do you see it? - See what? Small eyes, whiskers and a long tail. The rat? I want you to catch it.
- Eat it. I want George Caplan's loser son to eat her. She's sick. I'm also the only person who can get you that skeleton key. But how badly do you want it?
I'm going to tell the whole truth. If you get angry, get over it and get better. Second: I'm going to say, on a positive note, I didn't hate your wig. Thank you. When you walked in I thought I would hate it, but it's not bad.
I guess Leo has a lot of headaches. Okay, let's go. He's going to record now for broadcast tonight. This interview is highly desired. All the networks wanted it, but we're hoping Elizabeth Vargas will be friendly.
I was jealous. Because he was with mom all the time, and I was not. Then mom said I would be away from them "just a little longer". So I was happy. I remember asking my mom if she had received my last letter. She said it was so beautiful that she put it on the fridge. So she could see it every day.
I widened the search area a little more, but I don't think we're going to find anyone who saw anything. The department hasn't sent any cars out here for a vehicle fire. So no one saw the van catch fire. It was raining the night of the homicide. Probably not a lot of foot traffic if he ditched it after he shot Kenneth Tolan.
Like everyone else, I guess. I just got back from Andrews. The bomb we found, the unexploded ordnance, may not be telling you what you think. Okay, I'll bite. I'll bite. Okay, well, what if they wanted us to find it so we could focus on Al-Sakar without considering other options?
But it was exactly what the sniper chasing us needed to do. Do you make a bomb? Because if it's a bomb, that would be awesome. Wait, shouldn't you... drop the bomb? Why don't you drop it?
Well, unfortunately, you don't have clearance for more than that. Sir, every moment that passes without finding Nassar is a moment for the American people to question your worthiness for this job. I believe this is when you offer me your full support. Your sincerity as a child is your best quality, Lord. I hope you don't lose it.
But as long as I am and the whereabouts of one of our people are not known, we do nothing to further jeopardize their safety. I agreed to 12 hours. These terrorists came to our house. They killed our people. Any sacrifices we make to eradicate them from the face of the Earth are sacrifices worth making. When a snake is in your kitchen, you don't invite it to dinner, you cut its head off.
No, Mon-El, there is a time and a place to eat candy. Yes, and this is the time and place. No, this... This is your workplace. So when James gives you an assignment, you should be the one to do it. Not Ms. Teschmacher. She wanted to please me.
How nice, how nice. To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure? I just wanted to come by and see how you were doing. Well, thanks to you and your Martian blood, I'm almost at full strength. I hope you don't want it back.
God, no! My mother couldn't care less about L-Corp. What about when it was Luthor Corp? How did she feel when you changed the direction of the company? You mean when I changed it to "assassins who want to take over the world"?
You're in charge of Cadmus. Is this the part where you lecture me just like you did Lex? No. What you said before, there was some truth to that. Ask me for the help and I'll give it to you.
Those look ugly. The cost of doing business. We have tried growing aloe vera for such purposes, but, they just don't thrive in the Midwest climate. I have noticed that nightshade thrives, though - what do you use it for?
I would like to leave a note with the general's apologies. Of course you would. Take your time. You know. my father is coming tonight to see the show. Have you seen it?
Technically, it's broken. Much to General Grant's dismay, he and I are going to see the play tonight. No! As I said, it's a horrible play. The general will hate it.
Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard's door. It was scary. What did he say? He gave me his business card and asked me to please give it to Howard.
We didn't. Sheldon did. And you just let him? Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial. No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying, "Okay."
Doesn't that make you a witch, Sophie? No comment. If it isn't Magic No-Johnson. Pick up a card and don't show it to me. Don't worry, I'll hold it over four feet.
I've never seen him so confused. Well, that's because you've never seen him button his shirt. - Where's the cake? - The cake? We left it right here.
Who crapped in your coffee? First I'll say: Absolutely yes to the chicken thigh. Okay, where's my rum vanilla cake with hot dog filling? We put it on your side of the counter and now it's gone.
The latest news from the land of the stars. Fans everywhere of Minna Davies are celebrating this week as Brady-American Pictures begins production on the... Minna, Hollywood's beloved Irish girl, tragically died two years ago when fire swept through the mansion she shared with her husband, Brady-American mogul Monroe Stahr. Now her story from pauper to millionaire comes to the screen and guess who wrote it?
Hello, Monroe. Tell me, Red, what do you notice about Saba's head? That it's on somebody else's set. No. It's on somebody else's finished set, considering that your Sheba's head isn't a head at all, and that's why I'm sending it back to the sawmill.
Part of it even became a children's song. Eventually someone put it on the Internet. And with that, he released Pandora's box. The crooked man now belonged to the world. You were the one who put it on Creepyhollow.
What? Did you hear he escaped? Who escapes from Cefereso? And as for the next drink... I'll get it for you.
Maybe it's misfortune... shame... fear of death... or your past. Maybe you are easily manipulated. Or maybe you are plagued by self-doubt. Whatever it is, identify it, accept it. Your greatest weakness cannot be discovered, but if you exploit it, it cannot kill you either.
Order, doll... hot. Sophie doll? Well, she's full of hair, so she'll pass for food here. Get rid of her. Sophie's constantly using it to criticize me, so I've disconnected her app.
Yeah, and tell the girls we got Chestnut in. "We"? What happened to his shirt? Chestnut's? Well, I took it off.
There's the door. I need you to leave. Go ahead. Don't treat my office like it's a waiting room at a bus stop. You're blocking it.
Don't worry. He won't come near you. Wait, wait, wait. Where's footnote 289? Who's got it?
No doctors. I need you to save me, Gareth. Please. We used to be close. When I dropped the ball, you'd pick it up.
There were markers on the counter that corresponds with the.... Megan, what are you trying to tell me? The photo in the e-mail of Sarah's dead body came from someone who works here. Now I know who. My friend got the photo directly from her phone. He took the photo and sent it to you.
During the 50's and 60's they tested about 1000 nuclear weapons in the Nevada desert. They fired them a couple of times a week. What? I know my military history. Before they called Las Vegas Sin City, they called it Atomic City.
The end justifies the means, huh? We have to get that woman back. Let the record show that our limitation... Water? If you pour it in drops in a glass of gin.
It's too important to JFK and to history. I can't do my job this straitjacketed, worried about throwing a salt shaker and changing history in some way. - This is not a game. - I agree. Flynn wants to erase it all so, if we get a chance, we take it.
Believe me, I'm as upset as you are. I doubt it. Did it just come up? You've already mentioned several times about the scar on your hand, Eva. Do you want to tell me how you saw it?
Come on, it will grow... for sure. - And my statue! - And my wedding leather. And my hand. Well, he already spit it out.
Do you? I don't even have a skin. Always so funny. You'll never tire me. Come on! It's hard to clear your throat if you've been eaten.
When we went into the house, I looked through the window and there he was, smoking in the Jacuzzi. Where the hell did he learn to smoke while bathing? And where did he get the marijuana? He says he got it from a friend at school. He didn't get it from you?
I pretend all day that I like to sell cars, then I go to my stylish house and pretend I like to barbecue fish. And if that's not bad enough, I have to pretend I like listening to Adele while we do it! I can't do any of that without weed! Please don't take it away from me.
Aloha? Okay, listen. You're gonna get the pot out of your house... All of it this time. And you're gonna put it in a combination safe and you're gonna send me a picture of the safe.
- A pomegranate. - The written word. Pass. I have drafted a letter to Headquarters saying that we feel Captain Stentley is not a good fit for our station. If we all sign it, they'll have to act.
May I come in? Sure, yes, of course. Is everything all right? Just have a seat. I was hoping... that we'd already had this conversation and that you'd initiated it.
Answer the question, please. I wanted to know if I... I wanted to know about the film, the one I gave Joe. What about it? I wanted to know if you'd seen it.
I wanted to know if you'd seen her. So? Am I under arrest? Just answer the question. Yes, I saw her. Wouldn't you have seen her?
Good morning, Brian. I'm afraid you ran a red light. Your license please. Ugh. I swear, Joe the light was still gray when I ran it.
- I'll listen to him! - Tell him, Godfrey. Nothing can hurt him more than your silence. If that's the way you want it, Rachel. It is said that the gem promised to Mr. Luker is the moonstone and that I am the man who pawned it.
I can't. But I know... I know Godfrey Ablewhite is innocent. Mr. Bruff, please draw up a statement of Godfrey's innocence and I will sign it. Do as I say or I will do it and send it to the newspapers.
I may not have much time, but my biggest concern is that Rachel doesn't know the truth. You promise you won't tell her, won't you, dear? Yes. Yes, dear Aunt. If she knew of my illness, she would immediately attribute it to my preoccupation with the diamond and reproach you bitterly, poor child, for whatever secrets you have burdened yourself with these weeks.
You will probably remain unconscious for the next six or seven hours. Dr. Jennings, I must beg your pardon for doubting you. Having proved that Franklin Blake stole the diamond, unwittingly and under the influence of opium, you have, nevertheless, done him an invaluable service. The first object of your experiment was indeed successful, Dr. Jennings, and, for that, I thank you. However, if Franklin had led us to the moonstone, if he hid it unconsciously somewhere in the house, I would have known that he did not steal the diamond for mercenary gain.
But we must be prepared. The burly man, the man in the gray hat and the sailor. Any one of them could receive the diamond. We must be ready to follow them. Whoever takes Mr. Luker's jewel is probably a middleman and will deliver it to our thief.
My estimate, taking into account imperfections in the stone, was £20,000. How did you come up with this? It's a family heirloom. Come on, Mr. Ablewhite, that's not enough. My cousin inherited it.
Rachel Verinder, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife? Yes. Well, if it isn't Mr. and Mrs. Blake! And what happened to the moonstone? The three guardians took it back to India by boat.
Your buttonhole flower, sir. Keep it. I kept your rose. Don't laugh, if you can. I liked to imagine that he gave it to me because he cared about me.
I wrote you a letter! I chose my words carefully so that, if it fell into strange hands, no one would have known what you did. It said that I was happy to have paid off your debts. I have no urgent debts and I didn't receive any letter. I tore it up when I heard that you, the thief, had called the police and were trying harder than anyone else to get the jewel back!
Make a road if necessary. We have to get the women and children out. - Same goes for the letter. - Well, as I said before, - Travis didn't finish it.
Indeed, and I am flattered that he became someone. As the cloud rock says, "One finds oneself in misfortune." Wow. "Truth is what you seek here, and you have found it with your tenacity."
Okay, so you're telling me that room 105 was a secret office? Yeah, inside the Capitol. Recently renovated. Okay, and this is important because...? Because I went to interview the men who renovated it.
The inevitable? You. Me. A hot tub and an old Prince compilation. Since when have you had a hot tub? My boy Mac did some reverse suction thingy to our vacuum cleaner and hooked it up to our kiddie pool.
Coming through! Weller, Jane, are you okay? Yeah, we're fine. One of the suspects is down. Secure the bomb before the other one detonates it.
Michael Murphy? and Bridget Taylor? Agency intermediaries. They were supposed to use the intelligence they were gathering to dismantle the terrorist network. Instead, they were using it for profit.
From Karl Pierson... yes, I felt responsible. But I didn't do it. And I wonder what responsibility the factory worker feels...who makes the Smith Wesson or the Colt. What responsibility do they have...when the gun is put to the wrong use? I'm not comfortable with that analogy, so let's not analyze it.
I love the morning after pill. I had to take a couple of boxes to my timeshare in Tampa. - Tampa? - Yes. The women there love it.
Did I steal your fruit? No. Was it an act of civil disobedience that I admire? Yes. Do I know who it was that stole it?
- Yes, it's all right. - Yeah. Yeah, okay. Great. So who took her?
- That's right. - I understand that, but I think you're focused on something wonderful right now and.... - On what? - On your work. If you want to talk about it, I'd be happy to, because I've read it and...
- Great. Come on in. We have three beers on tap. And we're fermenting an amazing dark malt. Come back in two weeks and try it.
- Men think they have to eat a lot of protein and that eating a diet of vegetables is not masculine. But I'll tell you what is not masculine, erectile dysfunction. If you want to be virile, have a great manly life, eat a plant-based diet. There is evidence that erectile dysfunction is caused by diet style. If you have a coronary artery disease, in any area of the body, you have it everywhere.
I understand, I can relate. I won't tell anyone that moderation is easy. Moderation is very difficult. Very difficult. I haven't mastered it yet.
You are not their brother, no matter what they call you. If you're looking for a family, you've already got the two of us. Jules and me. Fine, fine. But take your share, I don't want it.
Yes, that would make sense. They never spoke English in front of me. Do we know where to find him? Our information says he has a workshop - in the East Falls area. - I'll look up an exact address and send it to you.
Are you still willing to go? I'm not sure if we can avoid it. - You got the address? - Yeah. McGee sent it to me this morning.
Or reload the Primary Ship. Are you saying you've narrowed down your location - to this neighborhood? - No. I'm saying I've narrowed it down to this building.
It has to be. I'm not picking up any trace of radiation. It's not close. Maybe we're early. Maybe the Nazis haven't planted it yet.
The signal. What aren't you telling me? Keen's voice. The last thing we heard him say was to ask if there was a weapon on board. In honor of the sacred spirit. In honor of the land and those who share it.
One hectare. A jewel. A simple buildable hectare... like a perfect diamond set in a sea of emeralds. A property equivalent to a unicorn. I acquired it a few years ago from a family that had held it in trust for over a century and a half.
You see, you're a technician. An operator. An instrument of a larger plan. I, on the other hand, am a strategist. You throw that can at me and I'll catch it but only because I calculated the risk that someone might throw it ahead of time.
My memory is not very good anymore. Besides, it's not me you should be asking. I only took care of these things here. In Russia, it was all his business. As far as we know, he left his farm when we burned it down in February.
I'm fine, I'm fine. Where's my son? He's safe. Where did you get this jacket? He gave it to me.
Our father's watch is missing. It's a Piaget. His black leather jacket is gone too. He loved it. He never left it with me.
Slow down. It's not a fucking race. Rohan. Are you there? Rohan, listen, I have your medication and I think you need it, so why don't you tell me where you are and I can come and pick you up, okay?
It is a system that allows us to take a low voltage and transform it into a high voltage. Yes. That's what I wanted to hear. Nikola Tesla named the coil after himself. The Serbian-born American invented it in 1891.
Would it be like a cloud that charges up with electricity - and then releases it as lightning? - Yes, that's it. Energy is stored in the cloud and then the lightning is the discharge. Here we store that energy in some capacitors and then our solid-state circuitry dumps it into the Tesla coil quickly.
Yes, his doctor confirms that he died of poisoning. And do we know what the explosive was? We do now. Surveillance camera caught him assembling a bomb in his car. Bomb squad sent it to Abby.
I had a hard time with it because it is missing parts. - Someone tampered with it? - Yes. And according to the DNA left behind when he touched it, it was Bruno. It's as if he assembled that pump and then rendered it inoperative.
Gold. I won't let my son suffer the same, okay? You can get us out of Storybrooke. I've seen you open portals. Even if I wanted to, I can't help you without the Sorcerer's wand... and your poisonous husband has it under lock and key.
We know Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where, and we don't know how many men are with him. The plan is to lure them to the Fun Zone and ambush them. - Any questions? - Yeah, did you miss us? And another quick one, did you ever look at the moon and wonder if we looked at it too?
They are designed for that. - No, they're not. - Well, they are. They don't reflect. - They absorb information and pass it on to the creature.
No, what is it called here? Border Control? Border Control, you open the door and: "Well, there you are." So I was thinking, surely there's a better way to get into England. And I think I've figured it out.
Hello and welcome to a Grand Tour special, which starts with this, the Volkswagen Beetle. It's a car that we really hate because only Nazis and hippies like it, and we're none of those things. But if we remove the bodywork and replace it with something more fun, like this.
Oh my goodness, did you also modify the battery? -It doesn't charge. -No. -Because I haven't modified it.
More or less... -Now take the longest diagonal. -And draw an imaginary line to the horizon. Now cross it with the line drawn by those two other stars, and where they cross, just below is south.
All right, what do we have? We've got family, friends, boyfriends. Carl Brown was her boyfriend. Hey, what if she's at Carl Brown's house? File says he inherited it from his aunt three years ago.
We have family, friends, boyfriends. Carl Brown was her boyfriend. Hey, what if she's at Carl Brown's house? File says he inherited it from his aunt three years ago. Feds seized it when he went to prison.
It's going to be a long night. We'll find her, G. Her and everyone behind this. We're going to find the head of the snake. And then we'll cut it off.
What? When I was a reporter inside the 43rd infantry in Afghanistan, there was a U.N. interpreter with them? Pascal. It wasn't his job to worry about navigation, but he always carried his compass. Her father had it in Vietnam and came back in one piece, so....
And who got him to put anything else besides gloves in the glove box? I did. They were mittens. And who got me to try a turkey sausage? Actually, that was Koothrappali, but I let him spit it into my hand.
I had a hunch I'd find you on my way to the White House, Lucy. I need you to do something for me. We're not going to get you the Nixon recording. We don't need to. I already got it.
I needed the fucking eyeliner. So I had to find it in my purse. However, I had a big purse. There's a very specific way women search for something when they have a large purse. They put a search claw in...and dip it.
I can beets. No reason. I live in the city. I wanted to connect. I make preserves out of my shit. I take it, put it in there, let it solidify, make jewelry, sell it on Etsy.
Those people, they're going to hurt me. We can protect you. And what about the heroin? I need it, you know. They give it to me.
I had a few... vitamin drinks and... I caught up! The traveler was so grateful that he wanted to give me a gift. He had almost nothing, so he reached into his little backpack and pulled out this t-shirt. He told me it was magic. And that when you wear it, your enemies see you exactly as you want to be seen, and only like that.
Magic. I want to be a princess. I want you to know .... that your father already sees you like this without your shirt on. You don't need it. Thanks, Daddy, but I'm gonna wear it anyway.
They are very well marked with these signs that Carol has made. I'm doing something similar, but with axes. I haven't put up any signs or anything, but it's.... basically a bunch of axes all over the house... pretty obvious. There's one over there. So, what you do is you take the axe, and you turn it towards the person.

So, what you do is you take the axe, and you swing it at the person. And then you wipe the blood off and put it back in its station.
- I want an O.R. ready. Make it happen now. Robbie's in the O.R.? Yeah, he had a brain hemorrhage. They took him upstairs as soon as they detected it.
It is Veronica's. Black. She had a hoodie. I was looking for her and Dr. Bailey came in and... - Are you sure she left it here?
This was a good idea because we had it together, because we were going to do it together. She's the one who thinks of things, who remembers things. I'm in charge of the fun ideas. She's in charge of, for example, common sense, and where's the damn sweatshirt! Maybe the next sweatshirt I lose, my son will be wearing it.
If not the truth, a good cover story. - You'll know it's a lie. - Not if it's convincing. Make it personal. A story that plays on one's emotions makes them believe it more easily, as you did with your parental issues in your cover for Alex in Quantico.
But you? You're gone. And yet you're here. Maybe if I focus on it, I'll find the answer. They say they never knew.
That's going to be a problem. He's here. - Dr. Webber! - If you're in there with my residents, I'm not gonna miss another minute of that meeting. You're gonna miss all of it!
Maybe Dr. DeLuca... No. Excuse me? This artery will allow this woman to survive. I'm not putting her in the hands of a first-year intern who hasn't even removed a tonsil.
- Nothing. Stop it. I'm not doing anything. You're already giving me that look, and I don't like it. Mom does it, too.
Wait a minute. What's wrong, honey? What's wrong with this story? Don't you understand the story? Do you understand the story?
What's going on in this story? Don't you understand the story? Do you understand it? Of course I do. Yes, of course I understand it.
You know, if you still want to - the vacation home, you can.... - I don't want it. It's too much trouble - worrying about hurricanes and whether or not it's going to be occupied by guys who will use it for who knows what?
I mean, they're great. And then they see me as a joke, you know? Which starts to make me think I'm a joke and then I start to get scratched. I don't even know what the play is about anymore. Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?
Look how beautiful Va is, who knows? Roberta The date of the Constitution of Cadiz? - I can't find it - Can't find it or didn't you write it down?
I made you pick up the shit because I want to talk to you about love What do you do? Merli, then you pick it up Yes, man, yes. According to the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek We tend to think that shit disappears We throw it in the garbage and it's all over
The teacher asked the father of the family how they managed to survive in those conditions And the man said "we have a cow" "A cow that gives us milk and with the little money we earn with this milk, we are making a living" Very well, when the teacher and the student left, the wise man ordered his disciple: "kill the cow" the student, without knowing if he was right, went to look for the cow and threw it over the cliff
I don't want everyone to keep an eye on me Well, it would have been great to explain this to you from Rome To illustrate the story of the cow But in your case it's not that you killed the cow, It's that the cow agonized with you Host, you crushed it alive, and once it was on the ground, you finished it off
You are an emotional minefield. Thanks for the appraisal. That means a lot coming from someone as perfect as you. Well, thank you for finally acknowledging my perfection. Well, you acknowledge it so much all the time, I figured, why not?
Forget Terry. At the time of the accident, my team had the badge, so I'm going to take it and give myself a four-minute head start. Not so fast, Peralta. I say we put the badge back and start over. What? But my team had it.
Mary Anne knows it doesn't suit her. She still has things to learn. This is very frustrating. There is no way to know who has the badge. - Amy and Rosa have it.
Whatever. Look, the point is you don't know what I do and that's fine. So what if I didn't watch The Manny? You hated the show! You were so embarrassed you quit.
Kevin, you're going to love it. - She tells it very well. - Why does it always have to be her? I can tell it well. Honey, don't be mad, but you tell it like it's a hostage video.
- I hear you. But the clock is ticking for her. Quickly. Clarke, I... Look, fine, do whatever you want with that information. But if you want to take the blood test, stop by and I'll rush it through.
You'll see. I have a scholarship. Oh! There it is. He says his scholarship was withdrawn because he didn't renew it.
There is no need. I'll send myself. Thanks for the ride, Hunter. See you at graduation. Let's not treat a cow and call it butter.
Did you see her? No, I wanted to, but I couldn't, I... I heard a noise upstairs, the killer must have run away when he heard me coming. And now there's a tape with your name on it in the video. If the NYPD finds it, they'll start looking at you, they'll find out you were in the house.
I wasn't on duty that night. But I saw a guy in a car outside the victim's house that morning. Black male, short hair. - Did you get the license plate? - Yeah, I wrote it down.
I think I know how the killer got in. A security guard named Steve Beck was just found dead in his home in the Bronx. Yet he still made it to work on time this morning. I tapped his badge. If he uses it again, we'll know where.
The other day I found a note in my mother's letter box. It wasn't addressed to me, but to my older sister, Emma. Oh come on! Even today, I'm not sure if she ever, ever saw it.
He's very pretty. Bailiffs! What are you doing? They've raised the flag. Well, now they've lowered it.
Did you suffer from scarlet fever when you were a kid? - Yes. So did I. So did Caitlin. Which means if you've had it once, you can't get it again. I don't think Miss Morton's had it before, because she's got it now.
Adam. What are you doing here? Well, Emme forgot her lunch... What are you doing here? I could ask you the same question. You just asked it and I answered it.
Because it is safer if we work this track in 2016. Nothing changes that way. If I can find this guy today, he'll never see you coming in '96. And they suffer? Right now, you having this information is more valuable than his family having it.
Did we get anything out of him before he died? He wasn't very cooperative. I understand he wasn't cooperative. He asked for authorization to question him. I granted it.
I was just doing my job. But if you want the story to go away, it will go away. - It wasn't even mine to begin with. - I know it wasn't. Lisa Jordan scrapped the story and your editor passed it on to you.
I can't do it. Seth, get the press together. I'll make the announcement myself. Your first press conference. It's not exactly how I pictured it.
You took care of the finishing touches, didn't you? You know, we had a deal and you broke it. Next time you try to be a Woodward, pick a better Bernstein than Jared Abbott. Look, to be fair, all I said was that I wouldn't go forward with the story and I didn't. No, you just gave it to someone else.
If she's from the Cause, I hope she's dead. I don't understand these people. - They are a bunch of sons of bitches. - They are ungrateful. The Other Side offers salvation for everyone and they despise it.
We must decide the criteria together. - You can't just take a coin. - I think it's very fair. The test is to take a coin. I took it.
What? Shit, where's the coin? Where's the coin? Where's the fucking coin? Wait, she stole it!
Your birthday present. - You already gave me a present. - This one is not from me. When your parents left me to take care of you, they gave me this letter. They told me to give it to you on your 20th birthday.
- To do a handstand. We need to form groups. Who has a good memory? We will need a group of eight memorizers. Each one will memorize a line and take it to the corresponding room.
That is absurd. - It doesn't! I checked and the substance is the same as the one used by the Cause. - Are you sure? - We don't have it on the High Seas.
When you called, you mentioned strange behavior. Can you tell us what you meant? It could be nothing. But I saw that he'd been murdered. And you know what they always say on the news, if you saw something, say so. He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it here.
It could be nothing. But I saw that he was murdered. And you know what they always say on the news, if you saw something, say so. He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it here. After lunch, he'd take it outside to the parking lot.
That is a lie. A cover-up. You were rich and powerful. She got access. All that matters is that we had a family and you destroyed it.
- Yeah. - Good. Yeah, that'd be great. You're pretty good at that. Conservation of momentum indicates that as the stone enters the water and pushes it down, the stone is pushed up.
You'll set the village on fire! The carbon dioxide will disperse the oxygen and extinguish the flame, proving it exists! Go, go, go, go, go, go. Our family's land! You made it ashes!
I took it from the shore. It's the thought that counts. - Yes. - Yes. There was a lot of algae and bacteria on the shore, so I actually took it from your parents' driveway.
I can get oxygen from the wheels. And you're just surrounded by methane bubbles, that's your fuel. The flare! Use that for the fire! But when you light it, get out as fast as you can!
What are you doing here? I didn't know you'd come looking for me. You're pathetic. My mom was at the plant. She said there was an explosion. VIOLET: Did she tell you what caused it?
Thank you. Tandy, this is a lot of fun, but I'm worried that people are going to start getting upset about not having electricity. Relax, little bear. We probably blew a fuse due to overload. But the main reason we made this our home was for electricity, and if we don't get it back, I'm worried people will start to doubt this place.
The police linked her to a serial killer during the same period. - We think there's a pattern. - Tony's story at the party? Oh, man. Okay, yeah, they're both crazy. The thing I saw at my house was the same thing I saw at Camilla's crash. And Gabe saw it too. But we're both crazy, right?
I really hope it's some kind of denial. Because even you can't be that dense. Okay. God! I saw it too, Rob. The thing that Heather talked about. I don't know what it was, but I saw it.
He doesn't answer. That old man, that doctor, he found out. - What? - The lights, the illumination. We can kill that thing. The light kills it.
He didn't want anyone to discover his special recipe. Right. You mean he prepared that meal himself? Last night. He usually makes a batch after we close. He keeps it in the fridge.
He's taking a walk while we sublet his terrarium. Is that...? Oxyuranus scutellatus. Yeah, the same coastal taipan from Brian Beale's apartment. That snake's venom killed eight people, including the last person who kept it as a pet.
Is that...? Oxyuranus scutellatus. Yeah, the same taipan from the shore at Brian Beale's apartment. That snake's venom killed eight people, including the last person who kept it as a pet. I thought Animal Control confiscated it.
I've lost sight of him. I see him, but he's not wearing the jacket anymore. It's probably where he had the bag of candy. Where did he leave it? Does anyone have it in sight?
So, once again I find myself locked in a room. But this time it's not a game. This time, lives are at stake, and not mine. No windows, no ventilation, no way out except a heavily reinforced door. And the magnetic lock that holds it shut is made to withstand more than a battering ram.
They have no right to make this decision. There is nothing wrong with the program - and it is totally disrespectful to you. - Maggie... And if they want a fight, they'll get one.
The guy is missing. They say Medina had blood on his hands. Before leaving he stopped in the back room. The door is locked. When the owner arrives, we'll have him open it.
I do want to know. Well, actually I do. It started very innocently. I was sitting here, I was working. He was there, he got up and came over to my table, and he hit it like this and he said:
Yes. And then you went back inside? I called 911. Then that couple came into the store and I saw the gun. - Did they find it?
Mr. Burns, being the classroom contributor is a full-time job. No. No, my full-time job is my full-time job. I have three construction projects going on right now. Good. Why don't you take all that negative energy and use it to make puppets?
- No. Our agreement is over and you can take your dog and pony show - to other new producers. - Julia... I say the show comes first but there is a line and last night I crossed it.
He sells medical grade liquid silicone at a good price. Medical grade silicone... for prosthetics? Remember why no one saw the hit man's every hit man because he was wearing a George Washington mask? Who do you think made that mask? If they find it, I'm going to want it back.
- SMART PHONE - made a movie, - +PLASTIC BAG - and told me he needed an aerial shot to film a scene. - +PERCH - So, - GELATINOUS ALCOHOL - we took his dad's video camera, hung it on a homemade hot air balloon, and launched it into the sky.
If you didn't approve of the operation, why did you agree to go through with it? Who's in charge here? You or Weller? Look, Deputy Director Weller and I trust each other. He made a good case for why we should do the mission, and that's why we did it.
Reade and Zapata. What the hell are you talking about? They won the auction. Nas used the money from Lynn Burton's offshore account, twenty million total, although that's only the first half. Marconi will be expecting the second half as soon as they get there and they don't have it, so they're going to need some serious backing.
But one thing we learned on the farm is that death is part of life. If you tell Joe what happened with the goat, death is going to be a part of your life. You know what? Kids can handle a lot more than you think. And every step, from birth to the end, has its own beauty. So do we throw the goat in the trash or throw it over the fence?
Have you ever wondered where these stories come from? If it happened to me, I would never talk about it. Yeah, I've always wondered that, especially when everyone dies in the end, how do you know what really happened? I heard this really strange story in the field, my teacher told it to me once and I thought it was all nonsense.
What's this about? You own a dark blue van with a white top? Yes. Where... where is this truck right now? I have it at my veramo cabin in the Catskills, but I haven't been there for about two years.
Yeah. Where... where is this truck right now? I have it at my veramo cabin in the Catskills, but I haven't been there in about two years. Did something happen? Does anyone have access to that cabin or use it when they're not there?
My last husband loved to smoke in the front room. Is that the cologne he made me wear? Boxes, right? I have a request here. Why don't you read it quickly?
What exactly did Dana say on the phone? She owns this house, she rents it to her daughter and three of her friends.
What about you and Father Tomas? - Are you going to take a break? - No, no, no. This... test has cleared some things up for me. I've renewed my commitment. My parish needs me and... I've neglected it.
Did you know that? We were loyal and perfect in every way. God got bored. He got bored with our perfection. So he created man, mortal and ugly and... and then He built Himself a sandbox and filled it with tangible, sensual delights.
My wife has given up on me, why shouldn't I? Driver's license and road tax, please. I had a great time last night, you know? And thanks for taking that cake off my hands. I would have eaten it for breakfast.
Jack made my life hell while I worked for him. The way he looked at me, the things he said. I wanted to make sure I could never do that to anyone again. I was going up against a company that had a lot of resources, I needed help. If they think he was set up by someone who could profit from that lawsuit, they should talk to the people who actually paid for it.
But I tell you, I would never hurt him. I would never. Not for all the gold in the world. How did it go at the library? Yeah, I happened to take his copy of the Codex Seraphinianus in 2011 and never returned it.
- Really? It says here that these are the offices of Munoz, Sherman, and Lane. Here's what can happen. Reptilians are friendly, you may be greeted warmly. If they offer you a drink, don't take it.
It says here that these are the offices of Munoz, Sherman, and Lane. Here's what can happen. Reptilians are friendly, you may be greeted warmly. If they offer you a drink, don't take it. I mean, take it, but don't drink it.
Wow. Really settling down. Yeah. Maybe I'll start using the pool. We'll drain it tomorrow.
You look as if something is bothering you. No, I'm fine. I had a little breakthrough. I buttered my toast today. I didn't eat it, but I felt good about it.
So why are these thorns adorned with corpses? What kind of creature could be responsible for creating such a gruesome scene? There is a mysterious killer at work in this desert. It is a butcher bird. This little songbird uses the thorns as a butcher's hook... to hang the prey as it butchers it.
For such a tiny beetle this is equivalent to climbing twice the height of Everest for us. But even more impressive is what it will do next. Completely still and facing the wind, the beetle does the pine tree. Mist begins to condense on its body. Microscopic protuberances on its elytra direct the water into grooves that channel it into its mouth.
Ready? We're ready. Yeah, we're good. That went well. I threw it in the yard.
If he was alive, they should be charged with murder. But there's no way of knowing. I have 10 minutes, I have to relieve my mother and look for my son. Prosecutor, have you seen this rock? I think the motorcyclist hit it and went into the other lane right in front of the truck.
- What the fuck is wrong with him? - He doesn't feel well. - What's this? - It licks and heals. If someone cuts your hand, do you lick it?
- What is this? - You lick it and it heals. If someone cuts your hand, do you lick it? He also had a broken leg. Did he see a doctor or does he just lick it?
- Yeah. - No, that's crazy. Listen, I can't believe you memorized that whole huge binder. I didn't. I didn't. I brought it with me and hid it in the hallway.
But we won't actually attack them, so they're just racking up a lot of habitulative nautical miles? If only it were that simple. A couple of hours before the leak of the fake attack, someone hacked into the ASN and downloaded two hundred gigabytes of data. We don't even know exactly what they took, but do you think someone stole a cyber weapon and is now using it to start a war?
It makes sense. Even after everything we've been through, you still don't trust me enough to want me around. I don't trust you? Riley, we wouldn't be in a mess if you had trusted me enough - to ask me for help when you needed it.
Forget it. Let's get to it. I examined Captain Green's computer. He had an account with a car-sharing service called HomeStretch. But there's no record of any pickup requests the night of the murder. Well, someone picked him up. Yeah, it looks like they infected his account with a worm that intercepted the request and sent it to a third party.
They clearly show that he was nowhere near a computer at the time the secret documents were stolen. He was framed. But by whom? Someone who got his password and logged in remotely. Even the bank account in Crimea... it was a trap. It's in Green's name but he didn't open it.
So Logan was the nephew of the man my mother knew as Balthazar Kilmeany? Her last Christmas she thought she saw her fiancé at the theater. Well, they look alike. My mother loved The Nutcracker. Apparently he comes from a family of grifters. Balthazar's identity was like the family heirloom and passed on to whoever needed it.
Father taught him what a real job felt like, as if being an admissions tutor was a real job. Come on, should we? No, we shouldn't. But I love this story, so shut up. Honey, you act like I haven't heard it a dozen times already.
Why? They're two murderers. What are we waiting for? Agent Christopher said we need to find out what the key is for. But we don't know where they got it from, who it belonged to, or what it opens.
God. It must have been mind-blowing. Well, I got down on one knee. I took out the box with the ring. The bad thing was that I opened it upside down.
Hi. I suddenly feel underdressed. Suddenly? Where did you get the tiara? Jill gave it to me.
That is of little importance. Not only do we have plenty of forensic evidence... We also have a statement written by the suspect that says.... And I quote, "I want to kill Johnny." It's rare to get a written confession but here it is.
- Just out of curiosity, what movie were you watching? - Jingle All the Way. Wait. Don't miss your chance to see this movie. I've seen it three times.
But the grain shortage? That was a calculated act. Are you implying that he wanted my people to starve? I will not claim to know the mind of a man. But I know that this shortage was not a natural occurrence. How do you explain it, Cleander?
And is it only because I stand before you as a freedman that you do not unload your sword upon me? With only my dull sword to protect me? My friend? Pick it up. - Pick it up!
Well, the backpack belongs to one of his couriers and contains cocaine the size of a soccer.... I'm not good with quantities... and a cell phone. And you think that cell phone might contain information that could lead us to Flaco. Now I believe it. Great theory! But the backpack is missing, so... What difference would it make if, I don't know, I never found it?
No, but I did find C.J.'s wallet, badge, and gun on top of the toilet paper dispenser. I guess he doesn't know he's lost them. Why are you helping this guy, sir? He's the opposite of everything you stand for. His favorite expression is, "That's gonna leave a mark." And he doesn't even use it right.
*You have the right to remain silent* - *Tonight we're partying* - *We're partying* This guy's got a march, doesn't he? Wait, who's that? El Flaco must have sent someone to get the backpack and he just walked in and took it from a police station.
- He failed - his lieutenant's exam. - How do you know that? Let's just say my little birds are everywhere picking up rumors. The letter was left on his desk and I read it.
Why can't there be four in discord? Is that what you do when I'm not around, make really good observations? Look, just come in and help me put together a baby rocking chair. Thank you. If you're hungry you can eat your Chinese food, no one touched it.
My name is Holder. I was wondering if I could leave you something. Sherlock's not a big fan of hats, so I don't think he's going to want a crown. Technically, it's a tiara. Holmes calls it my "beryl tiara."
Girls, you know Christmas is the busiest time for an international arms dealer. It would be a miracle if he came here now. There is one more thing we could do. Release a song online called "Daddy, Come Home for Christmas." I've already written it.
I'm going to cross my legs and rip them off! I have come to peace in my relationship with my parents. That was a huge accomplishment for me. Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn't swallow it, but Amy says it counts.
Hey, Scott. It's fun, isn't it? I love field hockey. And your jersey's great. Where'd you get it?
There is a personal perspective. Did you know the victim? It was the description of one of the men who fled that got my attention. African American, approximately 6'2" tall, shaved head, beard, last seen wearing a green army jacket. When I got here, the science unit was photographing a chain that got caught on that fence when he climbed it.
Maybe he was worried that the police would use it to track him down. Or he forgot. He also forgot to close those drawers, as one might do when packing in a hurry. His toolbox is missing. I gave it to him as a housewarming gift.
Tell them where you are. Tell them you want to talk about what happened last night. Call them, or I will. Let me tell you a story. If you don't believe it, you can press "call".
Yeah, the police showed up right after we did it. But we ran. Which one of you guys dropped the gun? Me. Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.
Which one of you threw the gun? I did. Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago. He said if I was going to hang with the ASBs, I had to be protected. So I took it to Whitlock and told him I didn't want it.
Me. Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago. He said if I was going to ride with the ASBs, I had to be protected. So I took it to Whitlock and told him I didn't want it. He told me it would be too suspicious if I didn't keep it.
The DEA has already been here. This is part of their investigation. She's not even a real cop. True, but I'm not asking as a police consultant. I'm asking because I'm Dr. Joan Watson. Which means I either wrote the prescription, in which case I know everything that's in it, or I didn't write it, in which case the DEA could decide to sanction you for filling it.
And we would all agree that it had suffered enough. It was a silver Lexus. It had been left in a parking lot and near a light; there was a guy and a girl in the car. I opened the driver's door, yelled at them to get out, but then the guy yelled to lock it again.
Well, the stress I was under, the time and effort to care for Ethan, I could never have done it. And I could never hurt him. Where's the gun now? In the garage at the house. I kept it in my tool drawer after I shot the man who attacked Janine and me.
And I could never hurt him. Where's the gun now? In the garage of the house. I kept it in my tool drawer after I shot the man who attacked Janine and me. I haven't had it since.
It's hard for me to imagine that I missed a gun. Well, it must have been. It's either that or... Or what? Or someone grabbed it.
It still doesn't feel real. But she would want me to continue. Ethan, I'm here because my colleagues are with your father in his apartment. The gun that was used to kill your mother and Dr. Krieg is registered to him. The police are looking for it now.
You know I'm a big fan of crafts. Well, recently, I had an idea for a project that now, looking back, might have been a bit morally questionable. Or as the cop said, "despicable". Cut to the chase. I made a copy of your handicapped card and laminated it to make it look official.
This was a daring and difficult escape, but despite the planning, he was arrested again. We have our last two stories left, Balloon Escape and Oflag. And both escapes score a 10 out of 10 in degree of difficulty. Secretly designing and manufacturing a hot air balloon under those conditions is an incredible feat. As is coordinating an elaborate escape from a prisoner of war camp while filming it!
A little bit of both. He was crazy because he wanted to put a pigeon on a missile.... ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGIST ...to guide it onto a ship and blow it up. Putting a pigeon on a bomb is really crazy, as well as immoral. But in theory, it should have worked. A pigeon pecks at the ball as it approaches it and hits it toward the other.
I'm back. But it was not a call of nature. In one of the cubicles, an accomplice with a computer is waiting for him. Player one plugs in the camera and then returns to the table. Meanwhile, in the compartment, the computer guy uses software that analyzes the footage and turns it into a cheat sheet.
Al Capone? It takes a brave man to rip off Al Capone. Okay, well, how much money did he get for the Eiffel Tower job? At today's values, he would have sold the tower for a million dollars. Just the first time he sold it.
Very sophisticated technology is used to do this. The ink has to survive its vaporization, being ejected at 48 km/h through a nozzle measuring one third of a human hair, at 300 degrees. 300 degrees. That gives me an idea. Instead of using the ink for this printer, why don't we inject it with three ink-dyed accelerants?
Very good. So now you're flying close to here. Awesome. It's looking for the wireless signal between the drone and your iPad. And it found it.
But the predatory mistress is on the prowl. The creature's mortal enemy. Armed with a sticky net, it tries to get even closer. Stunned and trapped, the creature is helpless. She will take it back to its nest... And put it in the drawer.
AC/DC. Metal, baby! Cahill's dream was to create an electronic music machine capable of mimicking the sound of a full orchestra with enough resonance to be played through a telephone and fill a room with sound. So, he began experimenting with gears and magnets. If you take a gear like this one here with all these teeth, and you spin it... and you pick up an electrical charge, and you bring it close to that... you get... a tone.
Do you still sing? Yes, I still sing. You still sing? You loved that song; I hated it so much.
What do you take me for, girl? What do I do that seems to get under your skin? I want the best for Star and Simone. What's best for them is the music we're making. Have you heard it?
Save him! - You must fight Jim. Rule three. What? By the grace of Deya, he found it!
Leave... that... that... kitty. What a killjoy. That's not Enrique! By the glory of Merlin, the light, under my command. Do you know how much fun they have here?
Is it in the Void? I don't understand that word. It doesn't say anything. Are they good ghosts or soul-sucking spirits? They don't suck out her soul, they just look at her.
No, I don't think so. What a pain! What's in the box? It doesn't matter. I won't open it.
But aren't you curious? And if it's a creature, it'll suffocate! Or a troll king whose kingdom we must save! Or my soul mate! Never mind, because at lunch I'll take it to the post office.
About trilogies... triumvirate variety? - That's not how you talk to a queen. - This informality is fun. No, trollbuster. We don't have it.
Gunmar betrayed him and stole his army. They fought for weeks. Gunmar lost an eye and Orlagk lost his head. It will be the hardest rock to find. They had a hard time stealing it from the Krubera... they won't let it go easily.
- No! - What, my breath? No, no! Now I know why he stole my wallet! He's got it!
Should we go look at something downstairs? - In the arcade? - Yes. What's the game room? You haven't seen it yet?
- In the game room? - Yes. What's the game room? You haven't seen it yet? - You haven't seen it?
The game room? You'll see. What do you think? - You'll see. - Will I know when I see it?
- Have you already eaten? - Just a little. Do you want some nice meat? I'll pass even if I wanted to eat. - Will you be mad if we use it all?
The day before yesterday we decided to have that meat for dinner. We didn't have anything to eat besides rice. But there was the meat, and we decided to eat it. - Uchi meat? So the three of us cooked it and ate it.
She was always trying to get us to have a threesome with Jay Mclnemey. What happened? I focused on my career, but for Anabelle, the party never ended. I tried to get her into rehab. There's so much you can do for people who need help, but they don't want it.
Good luck, David. - Hi. - Hi. Did you get the art tablet for the Happy Vegan cookbook? Yes, I'll resend it to you.
Yeah. He's all yours, big boy. What happened to the door? We... we broke it wrestling. We're using it as a table.
- Yes? - Liza. I'm at The Monkey and I left my wallet on my desk. Oh, okay. Uh... Well, I need you to bring it to me.
Well, we have a little problem on our hands. Yeah? Cheryl Sussman doesn't think her $2,000 blouse is dry cleanable. Oh, I'm so sorry about that. I'll pay for it.
Nelson? So he knew the book. And he bought Suzie Colebrook's illustration. Every artist has an agent. Find out which gallery sold it.
She didn't want to lose him again. Did her father say where he had been for the last three years? How did that make her feel? The dagger. I turned it over and pulled it out.
Good morning, Pol. You! You! You've been throwing your garbage in my basket! I don't want your garbage! Keep it in your basket, and if you don't have any more room, you'll keep it in your damn house!
If I get a full house in the bowling alley, it's one pitch. Not 10 pitches. Jim, my men aren't bowling, even if he thought they were. I'm not finished. If you insure your house for 100 000 s and a tornado takes it, it takes a house.
Food is already scarce and everything is falling apart. There are gangs, and the rule of law is less established there. Don't go near the wall. On the other side is a strip with no buildings. They call it the "death strip". If you cross it, you will be shot down.
You can use the First Lady's window. It looks directly into the Oval Office. - Is it possible? - Sure. A lot of eager first ladies use it.
Hey, I need a shirt. This ain't Die Hard. Hey, butterscotch boobs, did you read the Standards Committee the book? Yeah, totally. Egan was going to screw up, but I got it out of him.
- Selina Meyer is old news. We need to close a GMJ client and he'll be lured by your access to the White House. We'll get him, won't we, Ames? If they want access to that madhouse, we can get it for them. Tell him White House, our clients... - still respect it and still want it, okay?
Band of Horses. I thank them for their support for the men's health campaign and for letting me say they should touch themselves. Easiest job ever. You remember my line, don't you? Remember it?
My grandmother survived the Dust Bowl. And before she died at age 89, she told me a secret she kept for almost 50 years. The story is about-- Ladies and gentlemen, Tom James. How do you see her?
Did you put the balls on the table? - On the table. - On purpose? I don't see how it could have been by accident. Richard, I got an email from Midland-Oak. There seems to be a line, and I crossed it.
No, it wasn't pink. But it was covered in "My Little Ponny" stickers and glitter.... Lots of glitter. It was horrible. I actually got used to it. but then my dad took it off and gave me a boys bike instead.
It will take time... to make him understand. It will take time, but I will. I'm not asking you... You don't have to... because that life you imagine for us... I want it too. I won't lose it.
I thought the party was inside. I just came to get the sign-up sheet for karaoke. - Did you see it? - Yeah, I got it. I'll unfold it.
That's not what we're made for. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Karen uploaded another picture. I'll send it to you right now.
No way. Are you kidding me? That's what you should have done the first time. I know you've been thinking about it. It's the ideal solution. You get my infrastructure, I get your speed, and I get it today instead of in a month or two.
We can buy them in Sierra Vista. I'll need more money. Beer? What? Then don't drink it, you idiot.
Oh, for God's sake, is that my gun? I mean, it's bad enough I get jacked up with the cat around the premises, neighborhood watch, but now you're gonna point my own damn gun at me? Being that it's yours, I certainly don't have to remind you that it's loaded. Can you bring it over? Yeah, sure, you want to hold it, too?
I was the last to enter. We sat at the table with our hands joined, by the light of a candle. The candle went out and the bell rang. The bell on that little table? The spirits use it to communicate with us.
But, first, we have a crime to solve. And what's that? It's the ghost of Mama Beth. And you? What have you found out? Well, Elias Thomson had a distribution company in England. But when he made his fortune, he got bored, sold it, came here, met his wife and bought the distillery.
It senses thermal radiation, like snakes. I thought there were two. There was a sister in case this one didn't survive as a baby. Where's the sister? She was eaten.
Extinct animals have no rights. They are no longer extinct, Hoskins. Exactly. This is a gold mine. And Masrani's using it to make a zoo.
- I was able to wash the windows. -Where is the carpet? - The what? The carpet. I put it outside so the kid wouldn't pee on it.
-Where is the carpet? - The what? The rug. I put it outside so the girl wouldn't pee on it. I put it there for the party.
If you have time later, I'd like to show you around. I mean, show you around the hotel. We have a new suite called Inari. I didn't name it Inari because I'm obsessed with you. I named it Inari afterwards, from the municipality.
You still can't find that bastard? No. Did you check the station? I checked everywhere he could go. Hey, maybe he took his allowance and spent it on drinks.
It's already in Assemblyman Seo's hands. There's no point in tracking down Chief Kang. You piece of shit! Call Youngdeung, tell them to bring Chairman Hur's deed. They'll bring it, if they want to save one of their own.
"Where could it be?" "It had started to snow and a cold wind was blowing." That happened to Peter and me once. We lost a goat. - Could you find it?
I can't go through with this charade. - And I don't want you to. - Okay. Do you have a match? I'm not saying you need plastic surgery, I'm just saying if you want it I could pay for it.
You may not know it now, but it's out there, waiting to be found. Wanting to be found. And it's almost always simple. So simple it's almost silly. And when you find it, well, there's no feeling like it in the world.
Your turn, "Einstein", the saddest thing. Well, there was a scientist who lived 300 years ago, who wanted to find out how much the Earth weighed. And he theorized a series of measurements using pendulums, weights and counterweights. He spent years building his ingenious apparatus and then died. He knew exactly how to get the answer, but he never did.
Shut up! Or I'll empty it! Well, all right! Fine, I'll put the gun away. But I'll pick the next song. I want to sing "Silent Night" and I want Mandy to play it.
- But they're into all that crap about God aren't they? They'll be fine, I'm sure they've prayed themselves to safety. - No, no, um... No, they were at home when we played the song. Look, they must have heard it for sure, okay?
♪ I'll do crazy things, yeahóeh ♪ in lonely situations... ♪ Dear Peter, well, I'm home. I have your picture on my desk where I do homework AND everyone in my family has seen it at least 3 times.
♪ you're playing with me ♪ "David, honey, I quit four months ago. "I'm with a new group I got Janis back. "She's deliciously crazy, but I love her. I have our picture, from El Salvador and every time I see her, I see myself as a woman.
I support curiosity, but... I feel like something saved me, gave me a jolt and woke me up. And that someone is God? Mike, he didn't save you, because you weren't dying. Okay, okay, okay, okay. "Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life in my name will find it."
And that someone is God? Mike, he didn't save you, because you weren't dying. It's okay. "Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life in my name will find it." "Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life in my name will find it."

Are you all right? - Michael? Michael? - I have to go. Why did you call me, Michael? To my friends trapped in homosexuality, I want to thank you for your comments and your observations about my story and my revelation that I am no longer gay, but straight. The gay identity has been packaged and you have been fed that, and if you identify as gay, you have eaten it, and that keeps you from growing more and understanding your true self.
I know a guy. You're a guy. Suck my dick. He'll come in through the tunnel on Wednesday. He'll sell it for us.
It is very pretty. I like to look at it. Yeah, well, say goodbye, because this Wednesday, that shit goes down the tunnel and goes on sale... like a Romanian baby. Let's fucking do it. I take this ball of blue energy... and I pass it on to you.

What is Russian roulette? - Explain. - All right. You take a bullet. You take a bullet. You take the bullet and you put it in the chamber.
A few months ago, my life meant nothing to me. I found no fun and no pleasure. I would have been fine if that game of Russian roulette ended it all. But since I planned and executed the plan to eliminate Judge Spangler my life had taken a new turn. I understood why people loved life and saw it as something blissful to experience.
No, we're fine, honey. You have to do what makes you happy. If we had more money, I could buy a little happiness. We had an American startup at work today. He took a picture of us and posted it online.
Well... a friend. And which bulb did you get in the end? The 15. Ah. Okay, let me know how the light is. I'll tell you when I see it in the dark.
No way. Just your mania for turning lamps on and off. It's a habit that works. Depends. But where did you read that list? I haven't read it anywhere.
William Popley tells me I may find you useful. He says you are a man of many talents. An extraordinary memory? There is a technique, my lord. I learned it in Italy.
He has always coveted to rule over others. The cardinal is a public man. Would you see him back down as a result of public power? Well, I think it's a little late to give the cardinal a lesson in humility. His real friends read it to him long ago and he ignored them.
She knew what she wanted from the beginning. The soul in question confessed albeit in cautious terms in Rome in the Holy Year, although I'm not sure the priest understood English. Do I look like a car thief? My child, you have already been given absolution for this particular sin. I have given it myself on several occasions.
Where is the key? - What key? - The car key. I kept it. Well, I don't have it.
- No. I read a good review the other day. - I was told they were all good. - Yes, I'm sure they were. We enjoyed it.
I've had flowers bigger than these. And with ribbons. These don't compare. Music. How are people supposed to avoid it?
And with ribbons. These do not compare. Music. How are people supposed to avoid it? You see, I had it at my fingertips.
These do not compare. Music. How are people supposed to avoid it? You see, I had it in my fingertips. I had it in my bones.
Remember that box of things I asked you to keep for me before I left for Afghanistan? - Your mother's things? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. - Yeah. Can I see it? Sure, if I can remember where I left it.
Not so good. I'm going to focus on my work and try not to think about the fact that my parents are getting divorced. Even just saying the word, I'm feeling a little dizzy and... No... okay, okay, hey, hey, hey. Don't say it, okay?
I'm going all out. So am I. Wait, what's that? The bet's $200. Is that old watch gonna cover it?
Cause I'm thinking fire, huh? We burn the bottom and I bet she won't be able to hang around much longer. My friends are in there somewhere! And yours too! We can't burn her!
- I'm sorry. Is it my fault? - That's what we're trying to find out. How did you do that? I hit myself bragging in the pool, ended up in the emergency room. If I left it on, if it's my fault...
I discarded that. That's all you'll get for now. - It's a good thing we came. - However... I found this metal plate in his skull. The scar covered it, that's why I didn't see it the first time.
I wouldn't worry about it. It's just one of many scars. Will I ever know why? From the possession. What attracted her?
Referral, please. Thank you. The uterus is getting a little hard. Let's remove the Dardik clamp. Okay, the shunt is in and I'm passing it down to the left common iliac, distal to the tear.
See how the hair falls here? And now here. Did you take a tox screen sample? No. I just combed it for fibers, debris.
The Peshwa has ordered paan. Here, it's your excuse to see him. I don't need an excuse. And that dagger? The Peshwa gave it to me!
I don't need excuses. And that dagger? The Peshwa gave it to me! Oh, God! And you accepted it?
The Minister is right, Peshwa. The step will be taken once the situation is well analyzed. We will discuss other matters tonight. Better leave that sword in its sheath, Peshwa. If you are not going to Delhi, on whose neck are you going to put it?
- Start the screening, honey. - But are you all right? - We've mutinied. The acting profession is strange. Here... it mixes with life and confuses it.
No, get out and get in the back, with the children. With the children? Yes, and this way you keep an eye on them during the trip, so they behave divinely. This is unbelievable, this has no name, come on... I left the dead rat in your room, I don't need it anymore!
Not much peace these days. For anyone. Then I'm lucky to spend my days here. Still think immortality brings luck? Why else would it have given it to you?
They're doing some pretty tough botanical work here. Hybrid breeding, seed manipulation... they're combining traits from different plants to create completely new variants. You mean like transgenics? They don't have the technology... They don't need it.
- It's very good. - Just like when you were a kid. That song you were humming yesterday... it reminds me of something. I used to sing it to you when you were scared.
- What is the project? - A world in which only one field was fertile, while the rest was sterile. Infertility? That's right. Michael has perfected it.
Search parties have been active throughout the night. So far they've only found four of the infected. The others have been hiding somewhere on the grounds. Have you seen my grafting knife? - No. I keep it in the second drawer. It's not there.

Her? Michael discovered mother by accident when the orchard was suffering from a terrible blight. Only a few trees survived by absorbing the fungus instead of being consumed by it. Later, Michael discovered a curious effect on the fruit. It made mortal men who ate it incapable of bearing children.
You cannot enter the room if you do not have a tie. I'm ready. - What is your name? - Juan. Look, Juan... That's a very nice tie. - My girlfriend gave it to me.
From leaf to pulp and from pulp to powder, they produced 10,000 kilos per week. At $50,000 per kilo, they earned $5 billion per year. They were doing serious business. Pablo's cousin, Gustavo, brought chemicals from Germany to liquefy cocaine. They added it to alcoholic beverages, to coffee, and for fun they put it in Coca-Cola.
- Bury the money. And cut the bullshit. Do it, faggot. And that's what they did. They buried it in fields... They hid it in coves, hiding places in walls and ceilings.
- I'll take care of it, boss. - Are you crazy or what? Asshole. It's a lady with a baby. Take the picture, we'll send it to the newspapers.
What choice does she have that we don't? We hide her until the dust settles, and give her immunity for her statement? We'll get that too? [whispers] We'll go to jail if we get caught with that woman. Next time your wife decides to invite a human bomb, she better pass it on to you.
He believes the DEA and the Cali Cartel can be good friends. There are many people, in all walks of life in Colombia, who have been victimized by Pablo Escobar. The relatives of Moncada and Galeano, the relatives of judges and policemen. People with resources who need to unite. They want revenge. - And will you give it to them?
So the little house in Cartagena, what? That money is lost. Do you want your little house in Cartagena? - Of course I do. - Well... you're going to get it.
Are you telling me you didn't do shit? Like I'm an asshole. Is it my money or isn't it my money? No, Pablo. Did they take it and bury it in Rionegro or not?
Oh, there's pizza here. You want some? You want my slice? I'm good, but thanks. Okay, well, you can have it for later then.
Wow, you smell good! My God! OK, tell me. Did you leave the lasagna? It's in the oven, I didn't put it in the fridge, because it was hot.
It's what originally led me to the magic, the romanticism that I had. The stories I heard when I was a boy. When... When she... When she died, I was collecting folk tales, writing them down. And that story Lady Pole told last night, the lighthouse keeper and his cupboard, it made me remember I'd heard it before.
When she... When she died, I was collecting folktales, writing them down. And that story Lady Pole told last night, the lighthouse keeper and his larder, made me remember I'd heard it before. It sounds very much like a story told by the fishwives of Flamborough, about a man called Bloodworth, who used to light the lighthouse light in the 16th century. Is it a common story? No, and from the way it's told, it's not exactly the same as I have it in my book.
Your Honor, first of all, he didn't throw the chair. He kicked it. It was an old chair, unhinged. It wobbled. He didn't throw it like a projectile.
You're going to have to give me something more concrete. You want something concrete? How about that? - Viv, what are you doing? - That storm, I've seen it before.
Really, that's not ours. Yeah, who would leave marijuana on the wall? Who would leave marijuana on the wall? A marijuana genius! And he'd leave it there indefinitely in case of emergency.
You first, buddy. Suck in. That's it. And here we go. Yes, I've invented an application..., well, okay, I haven't invented it yet, but soon.
Accompanied by the famous Sherpa tenzing, Edmund hillary climbed the summit of the highest mountain in the world. When tenzing norgay reached the summit of everest, it is an incredible moment. It is one of the most beautiful moments In the history of climbing. That is the moment when the word "sherpa" has the meaning of mark in the way we understand it.
- Are you alive? - Well prepared. - I have something to show you. - What are you gonna show us with that junk? Well, most people who see it like that call it a shotgun.
That... that brown stain, that's his blood. We've all been looking, but we never found the boy's body. And the Marine? He was shot, the night he was coming home from the war, the whole family's gone. It wasn't long before he picked up a gun, put it in his mouth, and joined them in the afterlife.
That's all you need? Just my she-wolf blood? That's all we need. It's not going to happen. If you don't give it willingly, I'll take it from you.
Why isn't it easier for me, as it is for you? Pain is the same for everyone. Morphine. I don't want it.
I know it seems strange, but this component of the ritual must be done alone. Whatever it takes, I'm here to help. Why are you building all that out here? Jeremy wanted it out back, close to home. If you need solitude, I thought this is where you'd find it.
Before we go... I have to ask you... the way Savannah doesn't keep control over her powers, is that normal? It's a powerful force. It's like a grenade with the pin removed. If you throw it in the right direction, everything will be fine.
I searched his room. I found these. Plot maps. He cut this corner. Looks like he took it with him.
Ruth made it very clear, it's black magic. When Aleister took possession of her body, he destroyed Clay's soul. No. No, I don't believe her. If there was any other option, we would have taken it.
- Great. - Okay. Hey, maybe it's a good idea if you wait here for them, while we make a quick stop at the hardware store. And maybe you can take them to the corner where they sell crepes. The hardware store is horrible, the kids hate it.
- You can't do that. Take it off. - What's your problem? Just let me use it for today! No, I haven't even worn it yet.
I come here 10 years later... to have tea with my family? You have a bar like the Americans. Brother, wine from 1972? Are you a collector? I bought that bottle from you 10 years ago, and you still haven't opened it?
I can barely move in this. It'll do you good if a rubber bullet hits you in the balls, believe me. I want to apologize, Mr. Pencock, and assure you that kids throwing bottles and selling crack in Sunnyvale Mansions is not a normal thing. I want you to keep that in mind when you make your appraisal. I make an unbiased assessment based on what I see and give it to the client, ma'am.
It's deep, it's ambiguous. Hmm. It's about... It's like a poem. I directed it like a fucking poem.
It's not there. Do you realize how bad this looks? Yes, I have a gun, but I really don't want to have to kill anyone today. - Oh, shit! Oh, shit! - Never mind, I'll find it.
Good morning! Has someone been moving things around? I don't know, why, where's the box that was supposed to be delivered to Buffalo today? Oh, the guy who ordered it came by this morning to pick it up.
I can't find it. It's there. On the L. No, it's not. Where did you put it?
Where did you put it? I don't know! Shit, Emma! This isn't a fucking game. Do you understand? If we don't find her, we go to jail.
- Of course. You clean the beach at my favorite spot. At your favorite spot there's a lot of trash. What does that mean? It means there's a lot of trash and I'm picking it up.
Like this one. It has rotating fins for surfing in any direction. Or this one. One of my favorites. It's my suitcase surfboard. You fold the board, put it in the suitcase, take it up as carry-on luggage, and when you arrive, you're ready to surf.
How are you? How's your dad? We don't know yet. Patterson's office keeps calling about the call. See if you can move it to next week.
Okay, put it in the oven. All right? - Oh, no, he wants a turkey burger. Why? I don't know, I offered it to him.
- Would you look at that? Aw, man, I'll tell you what. I'll give you a beer on the house, come on in. - Oh, that's nice! - No, I'll take it here.
Aw, man, I'll tell you what. I'll give you a beer on the house, let's go inside. - Oh, that's nice! - No, I'll drink it here. - No, actually, we don't have a license to serve alcohol outside, so we're gonna need you to drink it inside, okay?
What?!? You're kidding me! There's no such thing as werewolves, it was him who made the print! I bet it was his mother who made it!
Well, what was his name? Oh, Sam. He's a great kid. How about you write him a letter? And I'll hide it under my pillow?
I'm sorry, I don't feel so good. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. Many people are sick. Mi-chan and Sensei have it.
Mount Fuji. Melon bread. Thank you. Is that gun real? Why didn't you use it before?
I'm going to throw you out. Come on, let's go. I've got a free game here. Well, I'll tell you what. You bring me that case of beer and put it in here, and I'll let you play your free game.
Victims 4 and 5 were foreign exchange students who were reported missing two months earlier. Add Megan and Donnie, and that brings the total number of victims to seven. We'll consult with the profilers at Quantico, help expand the search, and see if there are any other congruent patterns with the other victims. What do we do about the press? Well, we'll contain it.
I studied criminal law on the mainland, came to Fortitude, and married a policeman. And we live in the only place on Earth... where we are guaranteed a quiet life. Our honeymoon was a night of excitement and magic. Eric took me to the glacier in a tent... or rather a bivouac, really. And the temperature dropped to minus 30 degrees, so that night, we saw the most spectacular aurora borealis... I have ever seen, the fireworks of the gods, as we call it, the heavens singing.
And the temperature dropped to minus 30 degrees, so that night, we saw the most spectacular aurora borealis... I've ever seen, the fireworks of the gods, as we call it, the heavens singing. Today you can hear them, the northern lights outside the city. And now we build a hideout in the ice. We're going to build a hotel carved out of the glacier itself, where nature lovers, northern lights lovers, or just lovers... can witness... the wildest things they've ever seen... in the safest place on Earth. I'm very proud of that line, actually, so I wouldn't mind if you used it in your pamphlets.
Of course. Do you know him? I put the cake I bought for Shirley in the fridge... and went to bed. How would you describe your relationship... with Shirley's mother? How would you describe it?
It is clear to me that the autopsy... is going to show plaques and blood clots... and blackening of the coronary muscle, which is what happens when you have an acute myocardial infarction. The only visible wounds on Shirley... are self-defense wounds on the arms. That was it. And the blood on the wall was Dr. Allerdyce's. Shirley transferred her there.
Listen, Dan. The ice drill's gone. What? Jason's taken the ice drill. He stole it.
He stole it. Why the fuck would he do that? He's out of his mind. He stole the drill. He took it.
Do you think Jason might have stolen it? Maybe. We won't know until Eric locates the thing. Well, if it wasn't Jason, then it's someone ruthless enough to crack a man's skull just to steal a... stupid machine he can't even get off the island. Eric intends to make the arrest and bring the drill back to town regardless of who took it.
I was raised in religion. It was laborious for me. Do you have religion? - Are you offering it? - Do you require it?
Now let them move. Cree. What do I do now? You'll know. Shall I turn it?
May the angels bless the Lord Protector, Mr. Cromwell. He granted me the land in perpetuity. Not even the most excellent Sir Geoffrey can steal it from me. As long as there is Parliament, this dung heap is mine. When did he say he granted it to you...
So they have achieved what they came for. Absolutely. I know totems like that. It is of the utmost importance to have the flesh of the enemy. If you consume it... you absorb its power.
And they saw me with you... and they laughed and pointed and said, "How can someone like her be with someone like him?" And what did you do? It was rather what you did. You took my hand... and you held it.
And what did you do? It was rather what you did. You took my hand... and you held it. And you looked at them. Then you raised my hand to your lips... and held it there.
He can't leave it alone. - It's dangerous for him. Yes, the Demon, the Hound, the Scorpion. They form an eternal circle. Mr. Lyle won't give up, he knows. If there is any logic in all this he will find it.
When the devil knocks at your door, he has no hooves. He's beautiful and offers you what your heart desires in whispers. Like a siren, luring you to its ruinous shore. And what do you do when that siren sings? Either you save your soul... or you give it to her.
Tomorrow is our Super Bowl. Tomorrow is when we win. So you get your damn head in the damn game. You got it? Throw me the ball, I'll catch it and score.
I must have forgotten. Not an easy lyric to forget, Mrs. Winning. Well, Folk Moods came out years ago. Mrs. Winning, whoever killed your husband knew that ballad. Well, it's a folk music classic... and I'm not the only person who recorded it.
It was made from a phone booth near that house. And? I wondered if you could think of who might have made that call. Look... that house was Johnny's. I only inherited it after he died.
I convinced Frank to tell me. At least he tells me about Johnny! You called Toby from the booth. He told me to take the tape to his office. - You didn't listen to it?
You called Toby from the booth. He told me to take the tape to his office. - You didn't listen to it? ~ No. ~ He promised me he'd listen to it just once... and then give it back to me the next day.
- I would expect more with a close shot. But those things vary. It's a shame it happened to him. Let's say Winning was killed because he had the tape. Presumably, the killer would have taken it from his house.
I didn't arrive until Christmas '53. By then I was back. Pull up a chair. No, I already have one. I'll tell you one thing about Korea. You can have it.
And it would be super fun to work with you. Although I'd have to talk to my boyfriend first but.... Yeah, sure! This is perfect, and everything is working out just as I'd hoped. Hey, this is why they call it Beantown, right?
Was he injured? No. Then how does this qualify as an emergency? The mother was over the top, unresponsive. There was a dirty needle within reach of the child. I mean, since he didn't grab it...
I made a list of everything I know you like. Playing with our dog, watching contests, having sex with me, etc. And then I lost the list. So I made a new list. I had no paper and wrote it on my leg.
- Death is natural, Andrew. We are born, we survive as long as we are useful, and we are killed either by decay of the body or the younger and stronger. Speak for yourself. Before I die, I'll freeze my head like Ted Williams. They'll wait a thousand years, thaw it out, put it on a robot, and move on.
Congratulations! I gave that to you as a birthday present on your fifth anniversary as Parks director. You told me it was a genuine partially deactivated Claymore mine. It was. I bought the casing on eBay and then filled it with balloons and papers and stuff.
I'm going to get out of here once and for all. No, Ron! God, no! That alarm is only for sprinklers. April was setting it off all the time and the firemen disconnected it.
We are very good. And if you don't like what we do, you don't have to use our stuff. We have to. The Internet is no longer optional. It's necessary for everybody. And I think you know that data mining is not okay because you hid it in the 27th update to a 500-page user agreement.
I didn't like the first Harry Potter movie. The book was much better. brainy alert! A book could never be better than a movie. If you want to tell me a story, have pretty people act it out while I eat popcorn.
Just read the book. And then we can celebrate by watching the movie. - There's a movie? - Yes. Travis has it on DVD.
What is this? My future! Not so... Man, it was in the parking lot with a "for sale" sign on it for the whole month. I'm so lucky no one's ever taken it before.
I can't step in now and crush your dreams, but do me just one favor. The next time you two get so excited about another genius plan, I want you to take a step back, take off your "mommy glasses," and look again, because I think you're going to be really surprised Roger Frank screwed you over, and we're going to screw Roger Frank over. Here's the plan. We need the key to Roger's office, but the only time he loses sight of it is at his weekly massage.
- Trav, stop. This idea... it's terrible. What are you talking about? We love this idea. No, you love this idea, and you love it so much that you made me love it too.
Jelly, you look ridiculous. Is this a gift for me? I love it. No, it was a gift for me from my Uncle Doug, whose passion for fine women's clothing made him an expert dressmaker... and also ruined his marriage. Jules, my giant sparkly thing disappeared from my store again. Did you take it?
You're lucky we're friends or I would have just killed you. Remember our friendship when I tell you why I'm here. Finn sent me to get your blood. Why does Finn want my blood? I guess he needs it for a locator spell. To find your daughter.
No. You haven't, but by all means, brother, prove yourself. It's not too late. Finn wants your blood. He promised to cure me if I gave it to him.
It's not too late. Finn wants your blood. He promised to cure me if I gave it to him. Do you know where it is? You have to tell me why he wants it.
Tell him. Get married. Save your wolves, but remember what I say. If you ever betray her, I'll find you, and I'll nail your head to a stake. Maybe I'll leave it in your grandmother's garden.
-Let's go. -All right. Give me a fucking drink of this shit. Randy, I got glasses. Now you've got drool all over it.
- Here you go. - Thank you. Oh, my God. What have you done? It's a long story, but the band still works and that's what matters. It just looks like someone tried to cut it and you found it in the trash.
- Not from the dish. - I'll make the washing easier. It gets worse than you. Maybe if you cooked the meat more and without blood, it wouldn't bother so much. - That's the way I always cooked it. - Yes, you did.
I'll go secure the rest of the house. We've only been here five minutes and the fridge looks like a slaughterhouse. What are all those boxes? I ordered additional security. I'll put it up later.
' Luke Altman. It was not an attack. I didn't touch the man. I grabbed his camera and threw it on the ground.
I play basketball with the Attorney General. I convinced him that he would be better off in a Catholic institution. Besides, you're the one who had to take the insanity defense to make this work. Look. I received the official notification from the Vatican and they ordered me to turn it over to you.
When you talk dirty to me like that... Yeah, I know you've been sniffing around Angie. Just so you know, the only piggy bank I'm interested in is my own, and the only things that go in there are cocks and tampons... and sometimes other things, but only if guys put them in. Got it. Although when you call it a "piggy bank," I find it downright irresistible.
Alex, it wasn't your fault. And they call me crazy, for God's sake! We'll probably never be rich... and most likely we'll live in a small place, but we'll work hard, we'll love each other and... we'll have so much happiness we won't know what to do with it. We will share it with our child.
-We'll go to Caputo's office? -No! ...and he'll tell you exactly what he told me, every word, even that weird Al Gore thing. Luschek, I'm sure you misunderstood me, okay? I'm fucking with you. Of course I'll sell it.
What the fuck? Okay, listen. Remember when I said they stole the heroin? - Yeah. Okay, well, I stole it.
Okay, listen. Remember when I said they stole the heroin? - Yeah. Okay, well, I stole it. Okay, but now... now the druggies have it and we have to get it back.
Well, not really, not for me or anyone close to me. Didn't that shit kill you? Didn't it stop your heart? Man, it's not a rational thing, you know? But I want her out of here, I really do.
I don't make a lot of Italian food, but what that woman does with the matequilla? What am I going to use it for, to hold a door? Hey, perpetual deprecation... You need to stop thinking about that shit. You're right, the food is disgusting, and I have a thousand different visions of hell when I put it in my mouth, but your face isn't one of them.
I don't make the rules. They take away all my power as a woman. My job, my family, my money. I am left with only one tool, the one I was born with. Maybe it's vulgar and degrading, but if I'm forced to, I use it.
Charlie figured it out. "Worst comes first." Charlie and Dee were drawing Frank's blood when Charlie realized that Dee was born first. Therefore, she is the rightful heir. Then I drew some more of Frank's blood, because it seems to me that we're probably going to need it in the future, and he'd already been slashed, so who cares?
- You know what? - Heads up... I have something to say, okay? Thanks for rallying for me. I'm wearing a mesh shirt, and I like it. You probably want me to burn it, but I don't want to, okay?
Excuse us. I am your husband. You mustn't embarrass me in front of my family and servants. You're already doing just fine on your own. You have a sharp tongue, Claire, but there's a time and a place for you to use it.
Maybe a little. She's a Fraser. Their hearts are as big and soft as their heads are thick and strong. It was Jenny who took care of me after I came back from France with a wooden leg. Jamie told me you lost it while you were both fighting in France.
An orange alert lets the world know that a child is missing. Make it quick, folks. They've been missing for three months. I wonder what condition the house is in. Well, the Kitchener police department left it as it was.
I was painting before I came. Well, that's weird. Okay. (chuckles) It doesn't look like the kind of neighborhood where people throw old furniture in the street. So that could mean there was a van in that neighborhood today, and I want to know who was driving it.
This is the second time I have called you. I hope you hear this soon. We'll be in touch. Okay, Sylvia. Look, if you don't open this door right now, I'll break it down.
Just do it. Just do it. Just shut up. I'm gonna burn this letter. Oh, you're not burning anything here. Well, I'll shred it or even eat it.
We need a name. - My house. - Word of advice... next time you steal technology from someone, make sure your boyfriend isn't a genius bomb maker. - What are you talking about? - He stole Julie's research and sold it.
Where can we find you? Santa Monica College, the science building. Who are you? Friends of Julie's. So Castellano channels Julie's research to Pica, who sells it to Applied holographics for a small fortune.
- What? - No need, Andy. Oderno started this case and he's gonna finish it. Yeah, Mike? Shell casings confirm that Lisa Lewis and Gary Erwin were killed by the same gun. You think we'll find it?
Because of my sister's ex-boyfriend. He stalked her and she didn't want to leave. - Where does she keep the stunner? - No, she had it at first. But then she threatened Raul with it and I took it away.
I won't let Sam die. Look. The captain... he left on foot. It takes time. If there's medicine to be found, he'll find it.
Before you go, let's take a picture with Phil and Hal. Don't move. Today Mark was an eccentric billionaire, but I had spent six years taking money from people. Banks, college endowments, teachers' pension funds. If there was a penny to be made, it was my job to make it. When I was filled with guilt, I covered it up with ambition.
It looks like we're in his house. Look at this technological marvel. Isn't that a burnt-out lawn mower? I bet you I'll make it work. And you're going to put it on your bike?
Come with me. Does that house of yours run? - Does it have wheels and an engine? - Yes. Where did you find it?
Does that house of yours run? - Does it have wheels and an engine? - Yes. Where did you find it? We built it ourselves.
No. We give you a 30m head start. You too, it's 70m. - It's 60. - Yes, it's 60m. Put the ball on the ground, and then, when we look for it, you'll already be far away.
Do you think you need to go home? - Yeah. Okay. Why don't you go home? And when you get there, why don't you do the world a favor and cut off your dick and then eat it?
I'll keep all your fake weed, I'll come by anytime I want, make sure you're not cheating anyone else, and you're not going to jail. No. Your official lab report says that what you tested is fake weed, but do you have a report that says what you tested is what I sold you? Did you put the weed in a sealed bag as proof as soon as you bought it?
No. Your official lab report says that what you tested is fake weed. But do you have a report that says what you tested is what I sold you? Did you put the weed in a sealed bag as proof as soon as you bought it? Or did you take it home first and smoke it?
*This moment we had* *I'll talk about it* *forever* *forever* Mercedes! We have amazing news. Remember that movie Artie wrote for you but you were too busy with your own tour so they gave it to me?
He's not listening. That gypsy said everything but that he would keep performing that song if it would make him money. I have to believe that a man who looks you in the eye and gives his word will keep it. That itinerant will keep using that song. So, you will sing it and they will sing it.
He wrote "will you marry me" on a shell. No, I wrote "please let me make you happy for the rest of your life" and then hid it on the beach. And there's Oscar telling us he's engaged. I must have run it 20 times through that shell AND then when he finally saw it, it was totally smudged so I had to read it to him.
But I realized that you're the second person in a week to tell me I'm unbearable to live with. So, if I don't want to spend the rest of my life alone, I think maybe I need someone to teach me how to loosen up a little. Felix? We're here to see if you're okay. Besides, we couldn't find anything in the kitchen since you rearranged it.
We cannot abandon them. You have contacts on the Russian-Korean border. They're looking for someone to blame Joon-Soo, it's time to choose sides. There are whispers of a high-level attack in Europe. Well, we've brought the fight to North Korea, now they're bringing it to us.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop a little bit, we don't want him to see us. Scott, you'll get your chance, buddy. - Trust me on this. - Yeah. - And when you get it, give him a big slap on the wrist for me.
Sound familiar? Yes, it refers to Security Council Resolution 2094. Which you co-wrote. - We offered them help. - And then they withdrew it.
But, Social Security? Benefits. Social benefits. Let's not present a new face and then dig ourselves a hole. So let's not pretend to unite the party let's unite the party behind this legislation. Republicans will not pass it.
I want to understand what justice is. That's a lot to understand. I know that. There is our righteousness, the righteousness that men create. We base it on things like the Ten Commandments.
Do you understand? I can't lose my gun. Okay, okay, okay. Let's go back to the bar and get it. Maybe you lost it at the bar.
I can't lose my gun. Okay, okay, okay. Let's go back to the bar and get it. Maybe you lost it at the bar. Maybe you lost it at the bar.
No, you saw me reading about the play. Well, no, how can you appreciate one thing and sail at the same time? That's no way to live a life. It's an insult to actors to do that. Because it's a great play and I wanted to know more about it while watching it.
What is all this? What have you done to my dining room? They're destroying evidence, Sandpiper's people. They wouldn't let me in, but I could see they were shredding. I wrote them a demand letter and gave it to them.
We're inside. Inside? Where's inside? Take a picture when you get to the moon, okay? I'll put it on the front page of the school paper.
By a rule! I break one rule in my life and end up on a rocket to the moon! Yes! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a mission to accomplish. Commander Goldwing, go and get that flag... before Carson destroys it.
What about the baby cam? It was disconnected and locked. Disconnected? It's the fastest way to erase all the information. Detective Cho, please treat all devices, including the baby camera, as a body. Don't touch or move it until we get there.
And put Blythe in the presidency? They know he's not qualified. They'll wreck Congress by neglect. As dishonest as you think I am, you know I can handle the pressure, but Blythe cannot. Pass the bill, and I'll veto it.
I declare war on atrophy. But nowadays, who can tell the difference? How about this? I'll order a pizza. When it arrives, I'll bring it into the room... with a paper towel over my arm.
Great, great. I farted in the fourth. It's an inside joke. - I'll miss them. Let's all imagine our own version of season seven and share it with no one.
- So, on our own? - Of course, of course. - I've loved being with you guys. - Gay. You saved my life, and changed it forever.
I don't even like Mark. He has HPV. He has HPV? I mean, the disease itself is no problem. It's kind of crazy that he has it when he's 14.
Hello, Cleo. Hi, Mr. Parker. Great T-shirt. Oh, thanks for that. Yeah, my mom bought it for me.
Look ahead. That's the way to do it. I want to know more about the future... of your cock. Excuse me? Yes, I want to know more about the future of your big, hard cock when I hold it in my hand and it gets so hard and then I stick it in my slippery pussy like a.... pickle.
- Yes. Thank you. Oh, Fin, hi. I'm Jackie Collins. And, uh, I know your wife wrote a book, and, uh, it was very good, but you, you have a great story to tell, and I want to be the one to tell it, and here's my card, you call me, okay?
- Oh, here's a letter. - Let me see! No! It's for your brother. Ma, why don't you open it for me?
¿Y? I saw Ramu Sood. He made me an offer. That I stay on as manager of my uncle's land, making Armitage tea, as before. But the land is still his? Yes, but I will manage it, that's the point.
Yes, their older material is trite, but, well, they've moved towards a more alternative sound. Less and less commercial, yet another reason to change. Look, could you at least listen? Jeff, the only reason I said yes to this deal is because you said I'd get the last word. Now you do... "no."
Previously in Nashville... The energy, the connection, I know you've felt it too.
God. Good. Then he can help fix your teeth! Sir, if I may, I have a nephew your age. You finish that right now. Listen you little shit... this is my first real vacation and I'm not gonna let you ruin it for me.
She looks like me after eating Mexican. Hannah... No, but her vagina. What's going on? I didn't see her vagina. Adam, did you see it? I didn't look.
The consul told me that the cholera season was fast approaching and that his government could not wait that long. So he agreed to buy Numoral, hoping it would be as effective. Unfortunately, we all know how that turned out. It's tragic. Come on, you had inside information that the old vaccine was about to be withdrawn by WHO, so you paid the consul to accept it.
You planned the fraud together, didn't you? - That's ridiculous. - It was a win-win for both parties. Sloan sold a warehouse full of vaccines no one wanted, and you got a nice kickback. It's only a matter of time before we find that offshore account and trace it back to you.
Okay. - Good night, Gordon. - Good night, Gordon. You can take my husband's truck. I haven't driven it since he passed away.
He was in love with you. That you always had to be at the meetings so he could masturbate thinking about you You are very foul mouthed Take responsibility for failing. That account was given to you and you wasted it because of your lack of character.
Well, I don't think Ferg Donnelly is a good choice. Ferg is very important here. Frankly, you're lucky he's taken an interest in your affairs. I understand that, but it's not necessary. Not to brag, but I've been managing this account by myself since I got it.
For a few weeks. Do you want me to go with you again? Not right now. But soon. Now that she's gone, I just need a little time to think about selling her.
Bail is denied, and you must remain in the custody of the sheriff. - We want your statement. - Fuck it. - They let me out. - The judge gave you probation. And when you break it, you're coming right back here.
But we didn't understand the impact it would have on the town. The chemicals they use on the grapes, the increased traffic, the trees they cut down and the fences they took out. Look what they have done to the local lagoon. And what did they do? They diverted the stream that feeds it without consulting anyone.
Great. Draw some fouls. Harvard, what do you have? Rampant rage. And right now, these panties are feeding it.
Colleano's could be closed within a month. I hope I'm not going to be disappointed. We could make a lot more money. Let's say we lose the roulette wheel in the back room. We take it out front and make Colleano's a gambling club.
So you played me. I protected you. From what? I handled the paint in case it fell into the wrong hands. I couldn't risk Zee using it against you.
Please be seated. The court is now in session. Roxanne, you're up. Max and I started Tech Talk Great Development. And he stole the software application and sold it to our biggest competitor.
I wanted this application to be part of Tech Talk. The company that I put years of hard work into being the success it is today. Thank you. No further questions, your honor. Your witness, Ms. Dennis. Mr. Pearson, you stole ownership of Tech Talk and sold it to Brebner Tech?
He cuts your hair every month without charging you. You call that parameters? I tell you what. You hide your weakness. You wrap it up in a flaccid, magnanimous, pseudo-humanistic speech. But the truth is you're afraid.
We should help them find their place in society again, those brave men... who gave everything for king and country... who have returned to a world that has turned its back on them. Let's bring them out of the shadows and into the light. Thank you. Isn't the writing familiar? I don't recognize it.
Standby. M.E. Wagon en route to Sunset and Highland. Hey, 7999 on Sunset, that's... that's the Café Hut. That's Art Gladner. Sal, you were here when the call came in. Who picked it up?
Wait. Jimmy, come back. I have to inspect your vagina for sand. Did you take a look at the door? It was locked before the brats broke it down.
He has bipartisan support. Dunbar will publicly support him. - And Jackie? - She tries not to get involved but if it comes to a vote, she must go with the flow. She must not lose ground in the polls now that she's closing in on Dunbar. If they pass the bill, I'll veto it.
- So act like it. - I beg your pardon? My husband formally approved a humanitarian package for 80 million. Zimbabwe will withdraw the amendment tomorrow. And when the resolution goes to a vote I expect Israel to support it as the loyal ally it is.
Well, the people's national treasure died. People are very sad and stuff. Nobody wants to buy a house when they are sad. It has a very high value. In the city, we value it 25% lower.
We gave you away. What are you doing? ! Making sure you don't bleed to death. If your leg gets infected, you'll lose it.
This land belongs to you. But it is our home... all we know. Then take it. I have no use for it. I give it to you.
Is there a God? Go away! You didn't answer my question. Is there a God? If you talk about the big thing again we'll rip out your tongue and feed it to you.
Instead of walking on the right path, they want to fly. The Labyrinth is not a "labyrinth" but a path. To navigate it requires total concentration. Some will find our methods harsh. But those who need help very rarely ask for it.
We are only 15 centimeters above the fuel supply. We flooded the core. Why isn't the water level rising? It looks like somehow the flooding never got there. How is that possible? The only way is if someone stopped it manually... from the inside.
For himself? For you, Dr. Phelps? For mankind. Eugenics is, in my opinion, a very legitimate and necessary study. So much so that I have added it to the curriculum of my own medical school at Columbia.
You are as interested in finding a cure as I am. Help me and maybe, with what I learn, I can help you. I'll work as fast as I can, you can bury her in a few days. You won't cut her face? I will guard it with my life.
Please, please. - Please don't. - You know what you've earned. The Polish doctor discovered the secretion gland. Doctors at Johns Hopkins thought he crystallized it. But it turned out that he had only isolated a benzoyl derivative.
- Please don't. - You know what you've earned. The Polish doctor discovered the secretion gland. Doctors at Johns Hopkins thought he crystallized it. But it turned out he had only isolated a benzoyl derivative. So this Japanese guy from 103rd Street really crystallized it.
The Polish doctor discovered the secretory gland. Doctors at Johns Hopkins thought he crystallized it. But it turned out that he had only isolated a benzoyl derivative. So this Japanese guy from 103rd Street really crystallized it. Cool. No, what's cool is that he patented it.
Doctors at Johns Hopkins thought he crystallized it. But it turned out that he had only isolated a benzoyl derivative. So this Japanese guy from 103rd Street really crystallized it. Cool. No, what's cool is he patented it. That's who called it adrenaline.
- Yes. You're staying with me. I've fixed up my house. I've put an extra bed in the living room for you. I asked a lady next door to make a curtain around it.
This is the last place I expected to see you today. looks like I missed a black show at the dance. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to see another one. Now that I have made the transverse elliptical incision around the hernia and umbilicus, I will now deepen it to the base of the hernia intromission.
I'm fine. It's your food. God, Harry. I don't want your sympathy. Then I won't give it to you, but for God's sake, enough of letting everyone think I'm hurting you.
- No. Come with me. Now. This is Molly's face. I want you to hit her as hard as you can.
Well, we went down there. - We found a lot of narcotics. - A lot, John. There was no way Danny had that much dope. Unless he stole it from Wayne Lowry.
I'm gonna need you to help me with this. With what? Why didn't you get rid of it? I thought it might come in handy. But I didn't know I'd use it for this.
With what? Why didn't you get rid of it? I thought it might come in handy. But I didn't know he'd use it for this. After he took it off your property... Looks like he kept it.
It was a domestic case. The husband had locked himself in the bedroom with a .45. Edgewood had a shotgun. Kiko and I were at the door. Kiko breaks it down.
So I left her a note. "Wake me up at 5 a.m. to go to work." It's funny the things one remembers. I have a picture of her here. I carry it with me everywhere.
We are trying to protect her. Not punish her. She's telling the truth. Now she's "telling" the truth? And not "making it up"?
The heroine of the girl's backpack. No, she isn't. No, Mitch Pendergasst is in Baraga. He started a ten-year sentence six months ago. Yeah, I didn't say he gave it to her.
- from the evidence room. - Wait. What? - Commander, I told you... - Shut up. We know you took it, but we can't prove it. We know you took it, but we can't prove it.
Okay. How did you...? I heard you talking on the phone. While you were making lunch, I snuck into your room. I took it from your closet.
And with surprising intolerance. - A fucking mask? - Viv, ma'am, just think about it. Majid had the door closed so he could easily sneak in the back... and get to the gas station. He makes sure he's seen loading the gas, pours it through the cat flap, and in the rush, drops his phone.
Let's see if we can't convince this motherfucker to... to come out of whatever rabbit hole he's hiding in. I'm sorry, ma'am. There's been a problem with the warrant for Readies. I'll pretend I didn't hear that, Joy. So, uh... you know that you filled out the application for the warrant... and then passed it on to me to take to the judge?
High level education. Shot from a 9mm Baikal pistol. Sleek, beautiful and if this summer's excursion...to the Palm Springs gun show is any guide, it will be a heartbreaker. The gun that killed Tierney was used in the Fordhuck neighborhood in...a number of recent gang shootings. We never found it, but we're ready to break into the gang den.
I am no ordinary man. I carry a demonic curse... a curse that I have passed on to my son. What kind of curse? A prize from the gods. He will feel it when he comes of age, just as it happened to me.
Didn't you know that? No, I knew she was brought by the sea... and that her father was a fisherman... but he kept names and places for her. I was protecting you. This is that shell. I've kept it close to my heart ever since... wondering about it every day.
Guard! I need help here. Where did you find that bird? It flew into my room, Your Majesty. And who were you taking it to now?
Just a moment, sir. Do you disagree with the laws of this land? I can't help but think that, in this case, justice would have been better served by clemency. Luckily for justice, this court is better at interpreting the law than you are. Then the law is savage and you interpret it without charity!
- And for yours, George, especially given your recent acquisition. Oh, my Wheal Leisure stock? You should take that as a compliment. I do. You clearly know a good investment when you see one.
Five. Jesus, John. What? Five? He's selling a lie and people are buying it.
What about The Walking Dead? They're not rushing the romance. They've spent five seasons letting Daryl and Carol fall in love. Because we all watch a zombie series to see if the redneck and the housewife will sleep together. That's why I watch it.
Lieutenant Backstrom? Yes, Madam Chairman You are simply reading your statement. That is because my statement is what happened. The truthfulness of your statement is precisely what this committee is questioning, so we would prefer that you put it aside and answer our questions.
That's good! And now $325... I grabbed the bottle for a bargain. I had a buyer, some old queen... but instead, I gave it to Jason.
And now $325... I grabbed the bottle for a bargain. I had a buyer, some old queen... but instead, I gave it to Jason. You gave it to him?
My God! How much fun is this? Well, if I had known this kid was your son, I would have asked you to sign a permission slip. If I'd known it was so he could date you, I would have signed it in full.
Thank you. Have a good time. What's up? A flash drive that looks like a credit card. Shaw already pulled it out.
Now look at you. Hand over the flash drive. I can't do that. Then I'm afraid you're of no use to me. I know you still have it on you.
I know you still have it on you. You don't do anything but what is predictable. I bet it's in your left back pocket. Now, hand it over. Or I shoot you in the head and take it anyway.
Rats. Human flesh. But it takes its time... devouring... digesting.... Leto, my favorite surgeon, is most skillful. When he makes a small hole in your belly... you will feel very little pain... and after he inserts his black snake... into your stomach... and has sewn it up... you will feel as if you have eaten a very heavy metal... that's all.
There are people... There are people who go around killing people who look like you. Because of the color of your skin! Because of the way you behave, the way you dress... because you wear a fucking hood! He has to know this! He has to hear it! And you take this disease... and you use it in your own cynical game!
please, just... just prove that my Talia is alive and well and we will give you whatever you ask for. And, hmm... we will welcome you back safely from my daughter. Thank you. The FBI is demanding proof of life. They're not going to get it.
This became his favorite game. One for every time I screwed up. Look, all I ever wanted was to go home. Please... just leave me here. I'm sorry about what's going on with you and your sister, but I still have my order and a girl will die if I don't finish it.
- Doctor... - It's my fault. You mustn't blame yourself. It was me. You had the perfect life, and I ruined it.
It fills me with joy to see you cooking again. You never knew how to hide your feelings. What worries you, my son? The medicine... The man who gave it to me...
So why did you come? I don't know. I could have died. I didn't know where to go, so I went home. I was worried about Amanita missing the life we had and wondering if we would ever get it back.
Well, a business of this size could never have this many transactions, that's how we know there is illegal wheeling and dealing. So you bought the wheel from the victim? From her sister, Celia, two weeks ago; I still have the receipt. Why would you sell it to her?
Lieutenant? This photo points to a big fight. Every fight has two stories. Well, we know Gu lost the fight. But we don't know that he started it.
We believe that our book "Human Sexual Response" will put us back in touch with our natural self free of fear, but with full understanding. Thank you for coming here today. We appreciate the interest in the book. May I... Really? Why ask for the floor if you monopolized it all afternoon?
I needed to reevaluate myself. By then, I thought I wasn't happy with the project, but in retrospect I realized that I just wasn't happy with myself. So I think that's what I've been working on. Well, Joe is being modest. What he didn't tell you is that he took that small regional company and turned it into a national PC competitor almost overnight.
Well, there's absolutely nothing automatic about a bond hearing. - That... - But it could still come out. - Yes or no? - Even if bail is granted, I imagine they won't put it at a level that I...
All very casual, rolled up sleeves. They can't be spontaneous if they're planned. No one needs to know how the sausage is made. I'll take the jacket. I'll leave it on.
That. We're not going to allow any more banners - in the council chamber. - You. Anyone carrying a banner will surrender it or be evicted.
Hey, Martinelli is here. Excuse me for a moment. - Congratulations, Nick. - Thanks, Angelo. Well, the voters have taken a tremendous burden off my shoulders and put it on yours.
It is beautiful. It is. Thank you. She really is. I fell in love with her the first time I saw her.
Protesters have rallied here at the Grinton Will Library to demand its reopening. It was closed by Mayor Wasicsko in compliance with the city's financial emergency status regulatory board. It's bad enough that the mayor won't listen to people about housing. And now he wants to close our library? Yes, that's right. Yes, I have closed it.
It is no longer a negative thing for me. I took a brave stand. I was the only one in town who did the right thing. Nick, courage is not the kind of word you can use to describe yourself, even if it's true. It works when other people say it.
I took a brave stand. I was the only one in town who did the right thing. Nick, courage is not the kind of word you can use to describe yourself, even if it's true. It works when other people say it. It's being said by other people, damn it.
Not anymore. At least one of us got promoted, right? What the hell happened? A pipe bomb. A watchman found it on his rounds.
Collateral damage or something? You want to confess, Trey? Confess to what? The gun we found next to your bed... When was the last time you fired it?
That's his gun, okay? That's his gun. No, the other gun, Lid... that one. That's the one they found in the trailer. Right, that's because I put it there.
No, the other gun, Lid... that one. That's the one they found in the trailer. That's right, that's because I put it there. That gun right there, that's the gun I found next to his body. Why did you put it in the trailer... to blame Holden?
* ♪ Doo, ski-doo-doo-be-dop... da-dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum da-dum * * Doo, ski-doo-be-dop * * We were at a party * * Her ear fell in deep * * Someone came and picked it up * * It was a lobster * * ah, ah, ah, ah...* * lobster * * lobster *
I also signed the visa. If they can't find him his sentence is automatically transferred to you. N'oa. You have to find him. I put an order on him and I want you to take it.
I'm a concerned parent. Mr. Hardwicke, please... Your articles say he was fired for sexual misconduct, but you never said what exactly Dr. Rawlings did. I never specified the nature of the sexual misconduct because... I didn't know.
Why did you have that idiot agent snooping around? "Who am I married to?" - "How many kids do I have?" - I didn't, I assure you. I'm warning you, Bacchus. If word gets out about where I was that night I'll rip that ugly head off and shove it up your ass!
What do you want, anyway? We would like to take another statement from you regarding what those three men did. Rachel will take the statement. There will be no male officers present. But, before that, I would like to ask you about the previous time when you made a similar accusation but withdrew it.
Quiet. Indra, please. Don't you worry. My electric truncheon will have your back. How about sticking it up your ass?
According to your neighbors, they have been bringing in extra food after meals. That's not true. Is it true that you have refused treatment twelve times in the last fifteen years or that you have refused treatment 30 times? Are they going to deny that? We take blood when we need it.
Two of them... in the dam and in the mines... are already on their way to their positions. The third... inside the mountain... is freeing the imprisoned Earthlings as we speak. It is our job as the fourth team to keep the enemy's attention away from them as long as possible. To do this, we must be in position here at the main gate with our entire army. The mountain men believe the gate cannot be opened from the outside, so they leave it unguarded.
I haven't had a look at it either. Still, I'd like to be able to see it. Maybe you can. There's an airlock. We used it to hold Emerson.
Don't call her Ginny. - Here. - I don't want it. I made you a cup of coffee. No, I don't want it.
How irresponsible. Balan, I called you a thousand times. Without calling me all these days, suddenly you talk to me like this. What did I do wrong? Balan, you had given me your word, I expected you to keep it.
I don't get it. I gave you a key piece of evidence, and you're not interested? A blue jacket with a bloodstain on it... I'm very interested. Now, I don't know how Matt got it, but I assume the jacket will have the DNA of Tom's killer on it.
I thought you'd want to know! And it's missing. Yeah, it wasn't there when I got back. You see my dilemma...you heard I needed evidence, you gave me evidence, and now the alleged evidence is conveniently missing like your flashlight. I'll find it myself.
Heroes? Do you know what they did? No. But the judge did and he thought they deserved bail. I just provided it.
Why are we leaving? The job is not finished. The account will have £7,000 in it today. I'm a signatory. We empty it and go to New York third class.
isn't life a bitch? This is the worst idea I've ever heard. You just slaughtered a house full of people and it was when the Blade wasn't around, and now you want to have real contact with her? We don't know if I need to be in contact with her. All we know is that we need her.
Moose. You're the sane one. Are you okay with this? Wings of Titania, take my eyes aloft as I ask you..... This is insane. They want me to get the most dangerous gun on the planet for Dean Winchester, the guy who goes crazy every time he touches it!
I need a firm chair. I see. I've got it. This is my responsibility. I will deliver it to the king alone.
What would he do with something of such high quality? It was seen hanging around at the time of the appetizers. And? I went looking for my knife. I thought it might have fallen somewhere... or in the locker room, but I couldn't find it.
You know, he went to Berlin for the Olympics... and had to withdraw because of injury. Maybe he'll relive the glory through Dennis. What about the other team's rivals? I mean, don't they benefit with Dennis out of the way? And, if Dennis used testosterone, where did he get it from?
*With every step we take* *From Kyoto to San Francisco, casually strolling* *We're so different and the same* *I'll call you another name* *We swapped batteries* *If you gave me a chance, I'd take it* *If you gave me a chance, I'd take it* *If you gave me a chance, I'd take it* *I'd take a chance* *I'd take a chance*
It was... Right, left, right, left, left... Wasn't it? No, I thought it was left and then right. Well, I don't... I don't know. I mean, how are we supposed to do the choreography I mean, how are we supposed to do the choreography if neither of us know it?
Well, it's time for you to tell us what you know. Don't look at me with those faces. None of you are mothers. Kansas City moves most of their dope through a front called Legit Trucking out of Cincinnati. My information is that they hide it in the tires.
Today's your lucky day. I have Dodd Gerhardt in the trunk of my car, do you want him? I woke up this morning with the sunset shining I found my mind inside a brown paper bag I traveled on a cloud and fell twelve kilometers upwards I tore my mind against a jagged sky I just happened to see what condition my illness was in. I pushed my mind into a deep dark hole and then I followed it myself.
Welcome to Girls Camp. It felt good to laugh after crying so much. I even whipped something up. Instead of complaining about how old and cheesy your Camp songs are, I decided to write you a new cheesy song for you to learn. It's the first time she sang it in front of an audience, so be nice.
You don't think my boss has anything to do with that missing girl, do you? Turn it off. Turn off the TV. But I'm watching Doodle Law Order. I said turn it off.
When did you discover it? I was diagnosed nine years ago. Wait. Is that why you left me? My grandfather had it.
Show it to me again. Wait. How did you...? Where's the rock? I left it right here.
Go prove that they are not legitimate. Didn't they give you any warning? Don't they always do that when they hand out termination letters? What about Peter's adoption? They won't give it to us if you're unemployed.
It's always the same, always the same lists. Where did you get this? I found it. Really, just like that? I'm going to find out, even if I have to rip your meat off with a dull fork, so where did you get it?
The two of you have endured all the traditional werewolf rituals and tests. Only one remains. Jackson, you may kiss the bride. I know that look. I've seen it too often. What are you planning?
I have nothing against you. Esther did this negotiation a long time ago. It is very unfortunate that you were dragged into it. You talk as if you have no choice, but this is your business. When I give my word, I keep it, and I expect others to do the same.
There's really only one question here. What exactly are we doing? This wasn't my plan. You rushed it and made a single weapon. Of course she snatched it from you, and now we've lost the advantage we had and used all the materials we needed to kill her.
You said yourself you wanted to hear it. And you yourself said it was stupid. Did I? Well, it sounds like I did. Regardless of whether there's a chance Freya has information that could protect my daughter, I'd rather you tell us on my terms.
Young Freya is here, though powerful, she lacks the charm to put Rebekah in her true body, and that's where you come in. I need you to be generous and dig deep into that ex-witch mind of yours. Give me the spell to put Rebekah back. You know, even though you betrayed me, I don't blame you. You just couldn't see the light, but you see it now, don't you? And now that your body was stolen by the same family of vampires that are trying to steal mine!
My plan worked perfectly. Easy, Elijah. I can see how you're getting carried away with anger but our work isn't done yet. Should we just kill her and be done with it? To be clear, I want her blood, but I want it on this sword, which I have bound with the soil of Dahlia's homeland, not to mention Viking ash.
Thea knows nothing about Sara. And she never will. That's where she's wrong. I know her. She will know the truth no matter how well I think I hide it from her.
You have 23 hours, 59 minutes. I suggest you get off your sweet asses! Captain Lance? Brick wants all cops out of the Glades or he's gonna start killing his hostages. We need help, we need it now.
Councilman, get back! Where's Zytle? Hi. You still haven't told me... what did you think of my session last night? Because the fans on Vine called it "epically epic."
I guess you were planning to leave without telling me. Well, I knew you wouldn't approve. You saved my life. Thank you. Maseo saved it.
And on rare occasions, legends say, those waters have been used to bring the dead back to life. You offered to use the Lazarus Pit in Thea, didn't you? Lazarus, like the one in the Bible, that Lazarus? That pit is real. I've seen it.
No, but Merlyn assured me he would be flying the white flag. I'm sorry, I forgot the flag. I forgot the flag. That's too bad. Because I would have told you where to put it.
- How will we find Simmons? - A light bulb, literally. I... no, actually, figuratively. Just before Simmons hit me, I attacked him with my compressed light beams, and he thanked me for recharging him. It absorbs energy and converts it into plasma as a weapon.
That I knew it would be hard, but I wanted to be friends. She's two years older than me, and she thought she was going to be my stepmom? I had to make her take me seriously. That's why you brought the gun. My mother bought it last year when there were some break-ins in the neighborhood.
Jake believed in me when very few people did. Jake was the one who gave me the knowledge... and I was nobody then. Dallas came into wrestling very late. Starting out as a wrestler at 35? If you want to talk about work ethic, DDP has it.
Can I get you something to drink? Coffee or... Not coffee, how about water, Gatorade or urine? Yes, I officially retired a little over a year ago. My only passion was wrestling and I had to give it up. I had a life, but I poisoned it.
I'm serious. Come here. Didn't you say you had something to do tonight? I was thinking of having a poker night with the guys. I'll tell them we'll do it next week.
I know no one wants to talk bad, but, come on, guys, a man died. That's why we're here. Not for the free tap? All right, let's start the fight. Anybody see it?
You're saying whoever did this did it from inside that room, connecting. - It was a frontal intrusion? - Yeah. That explains the direction of the security camera. I'm guessing the intruder moved it before entering the control room.
I started the panel, but the train won't stop, damn it! It has to be connected to the subway computer via Bluetooth. First, carefully... remove the Bluetooth radio from the motherboard. You'll find it in the USB port.
It's so good to see you. How are you? How's school? You're not wearing my bracelet. You know what, I was wearing it.
Yeah, see... a guy like that... rich, famous, handsome, gets more cookies than a baker, why does he need to hit a woman? Let me talk to him, find out. Let the detectives handle his case, all right, you've done your part, honey. They don't have a case. They'll get the description done and then they'll drop it.
I was paralyzed from the waist down in a high school gymnastics accident Your driver's license was used in the prison visitors' office. - Was it about three months ago? - Yes. How do you know? It was about the time I lost my wallet. Do you remember where you were when you lost it?
This is your way of putting all the blame on me. You need to act like the good guy so you don't feel so bad about running off with that dirty bitch. - She got what she deserved. - You disgust me. I put a bag over her head, and I squeezed it tight and watched the life extinguish from her body.
I didn't leave the motel because I was waiting for the mystery woman to show up, and I didn't want to miss the million dollar photo. Well... Here he leaves the motel with a to-go cup. But here, when he comes back 45 minutes later, - he's not carrying it.
Well... Here he leaves the motel with a to-go cup. But here, when he comes back 45 minutes later, - he doesn't have it. - Maybe he lost it?
No, no, no, no. I don't think so. Look... At 5:15 the next morning, he leaves the hotel empty-handed. When he comes back, he's got a to-go cup again. Maybe he found it.
I don't think so. Look... At 5:15 the next morning, he leaves the hotel empty-handed. When he comes back, he has a to-go cup again. Maybe he found it. He didn't.
Look... At 5:15 the next morning, he leaves the hotel empty-handed. When he comes back, he has a to-go cup again. Maybe he found it. He didn't find it. He got it back.
Good job. So you think Dylan Blyer snuck in at night - and set up a camera? - Uh-huh. And then picked it up the next morning so he could see what Ward had done.
If we had fired them, the government wouldn't be about to fall. Stop talking! Act! And the amendment to the Suburban Renewal Law for the Ostia waterfront? That's almost settled, considering who's backing it....
Because this time I won't shut up. What's in your hand? Don't worry, my cards are good. There's nothing in your house. We cleaned it when you were arrested.
I only own shares. But you own the majority, so it's yours. Not exactly. I'll give you a week to give us the mansion, the house, the car, and all the money you can get. I'm furious with your father. So if you don't leave now, I'll cut off one of your legs, keep it, and give it back to you when you pay up.
- What do we want? - The truth. I want my friend to be released. Then maybe you could start by telling me about the letter. Well, that obviously had no meaning to me. And Archie didn't leave it for his colleagues either, which meant he didn't trust them.
It must have been the night you dropped me off to catch the bus. Eric O'Bannon had a job, so he included me in it. And we went and stole the gas, and... What did you do with the gasoline? We took it to the mangroves.
In addition, we were able to determine that the call was made approximately within a radius of about 600 square meters, 32 degrees south, southeast of the breakfast table. How... How the hell do you know that? We accessed the cell phone antenna, tapped it and triangulated the origin of the call.
I don't need to see it green. Russ, have you ever thought about why you hate technology so much? No, I haven't because I don't hate it. I just think the human brain is so much better. Maybe you don't like technology because I have it and you don't.
The anklet, - I mean, he was monitored, right? - We caught him last night. This is unbelievable. - He took it off.
- Let me see. - What? Stop it! - Jane, cyanide poisoning stops the body's cells from being able to use oxygen. That didn't happen, and that stuff hurts my eyes, just like the last four times you used it.
I noticed that. No, look, Carlo, I'm giving Karen a huge diamond. That's a given. I'm talking about the proposal, okay? I want you to film it for me.
- What did it say? - I don't know. It was left under the door of the house. It was addressed to Ron. He read it, folded it and put it in his pocket.
Yeah, except if you do something wrong, it might kill you. Well, there's a big difference between dropping a ball - and having another woman. - Maybe. We need to find the murder weapon, or find out where he bought it, or place it in Boston at the time of the murder, or all of the above.
Come on Tasha. Let's get you something non-alcoholic or something to celebrate. Good job. Obviously Barry's scholarship was sauna revelation number 2. Well, I only had it because you wouldn't let me call the admissions office and help her.
Let us help you find the culprit. Russians are dead. Russia will find the murderers. I don't understand why you refuse our help. Because I don't need it.
- Waves. Waves, on its own. From a breeze? I wish. - Did your father read it?
Death... or restitution. That's it, no more. Thanks for your vote. I'm glad you came. I appreciate it.
Oh, right. Yes, yes, that's right. Yeah, I remember after Papa Gene crossed his face, he ripped the star off the hood of his car. Brought it home and put it on his Caprice. What did you call it? He...
What could it prove? What can it prove? Nothing. And I wouldn't worry about the video. Pernell Harris doesn't have it.
Shane Caldwell secretly recorded it. - Oh, my God. - Do you see it now? That video is what set me free. And I wouldn't have found it if God hadn't led me.
The certificate will be somewhere. In the monastery, I tell you. But I wouldn't know how to find it. I don't know what the paper looks like. Besides, that place is scary. Why don't you look for me?
Yes, we are going to buy three. Too bad we can't even buy him a cardboard one. I know how I'll do it. By the way, how did you get such a good horse? Picó gave it to me.
Are you hungry? - What are you hungry for? - Let's go eat. Well, I'd love to, but I have to go get the check. Have them send it over.
Well, for several years, I've been thinking about the summers I spent here. You remember what it was like... that green, that shade of green. It was the prettiest I'd ever seen. And the swing. It used to break every summer and every summer Grandpa would fix it.
Yes, I helped Julia with Persikoff's bail and she was kind enough to give me my percentage. And I... well... Here. Why? Well, just so that next time there's a field trip, you won't miss it.
I would say that the fight will start very soon. I hope you're wrong. Earth knows the price of escalating things as well as we do. You said our job was to prevent a war with Earth. Did you ever wonder if we got it backwards?
I am not here to draw conclusions. I am here to find objective evidence of a parallel nuclear program. Excuse me, but I have my doubts about your objectivity. Everyone knows you supported a deal with Iran. Just like everyone knows that you are already convinced that they are betraying it.
Yes. Thank you. You must be pleased. And you're upset. Just because I believe in the benefits of the deal doesn't mean I'm any less worried about Iran betraying it.
I am not on their side. Sekou is facing 15 years in prison. You are on one side. You gave him $5,000, which you say was for a man in Africa, a jihadist. And if that's what the money was for and Sekou took it, tell Simone and me about it and we'll listen to you.
Very... close. You should know that. There's a video of it. It was... it was all over the internet. You've never seen it?
You're twenty years old and angry, so I'll forgive you for saying that. What do you want? I told you, take that video down. I can't do that. If you take it down, all it will do is wave a red flag in front of the FBI and belittle all the people who believed in you.
Sir, we're looking for Carrie Mathison to comment on the attack. Can you tell her? She's not here! Are you aware of what's going on at your house? Wait. What? They're calling it a hostage situation.
Who knew I was coming to New York? No one. No one? Then who knew about our meeting in the West Bank? The Israelis suspected it.
We are in the hands of Saul Berenson, that is, if she is willing to offer you a deal in exchange for your testimony. More than willing. Is there a legal basis for it? As long as you go through the proper channels in Justice and the National Security Division. In that case, FBI Counterintelligence would make the first approach to Saul. Do you think she will?
That is not true. He was running toward a comrade to save his life. That act, witnessed by six soldiers who were there... cost my son his life... and earned him the Silver Star. Whoever made this video is not only trying to nullify that and damage him personally, but is trying to damage my presidency. I call on the real cowards, the people who did this, to come out and show their faces.
I'm told you took a video of Mr. O'Keefe and me. I didn't. Where is it? It's nowhere. You deleted it from your phone.
I didn't. Where is it? It's nowhere. You deleted it from your phone. Did you... send it somewhere?
Nowhere. You erased it from your phone. You... you sent it somewhere? How could I? I never recorded it.
So, here I am. You know it's not slander if it's true? It's not true. It's not true. Have you seen it?
- Is it really? Yes. Managed from this studio. It didn't just produce the fake video. He faked the hate and the lies that go along with it.
And with guests. And a woman. How nice. I've forgotten your name, silver monk, but not our price. Have you got it?
Yes, you are. That's right. Do you intend to build an army? Last night I was still a slave. Build an army and I will command it, but only if you intend to go against all the northern lords. Kjartan.
I came to pay my respects. I was a friend of Michael's. Hey, John! I read your book! - You did? Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom. - Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I read a lot of it in one sitting.
- Yes, Kevin left it in the bathroom. - Yes, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I read a lot of it in one sitting. It's exciting. Have a nice day. I didn't leave it in the bathroom.
- Whatever. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I need you to call Kurripa Hospital, Kur-rip-pah. Find out if there's a patient there named Christopher Sunday. Matt? Did you dump him?
Come back and pass again. - Enjoy your flight. - Thank you. Give it back to me. You can't keep it.
You brought your book. It's not mine. It's Matt's. But it's about you. Will you finally read it?
We will be back. But there is a very special man who is supposed to be with us, but he is in Melbourne. And because of this unexpected event, he's stuck in Australia. He's just lying there. God has put an obstacle in our way, but he wants us to overcome it.
- Please, Laurie. It will be better for you if I don't involve you in this. Whatever you have to tell us, you can tell her, too. No one seems to care that I just witnessed a murder. The man who committed it just attacked me.
- No. She just shows up. She won't even tell us how she knew we were here. You want to tell us why you have a black eye? Nora did it to me.
Where's my lighter? Can I have it back, please? You said you left it. - I did. - Then you don't need it.
Please give it back to me. Like I did with Lily? - Give me the lighter, Nora. - Come on, Nora. - She said she didn't need it.
- You did what? - That's right. When you went to that UN drill, I forgot to fucking feed him. I went home an hour before you guys got home and he was dead. I went to the neighbor's house and threw him in his trash.
What price can be so high as to stop it? Drastic measures have to be taken, of which, I fear, this will only be the first of them. What do you mean by that? The damage this alliance has received was caused by Billy. It is possible that the only way to repair that damage is to get rid of the one who caused it.
I'll be home soon. Is everything all right? What happened? It was a big misunderstanding. I'll tell you when I get there.
I don't think he'll ever understand. No, probably not. He lives in a different world. He will never understand the work we do. Sometimes I don't know if I understand it myself.
You will be fine. Your father was a brave man. Yeah, but how do you condemn a man's entire life... in five minutes, Huh? There's probably an app for that, right? You have to download a template, put his name in... and then the system, it writes it for you?
Can you keep the garments? Look. How's the eulogy coming? Harder than I thought. You want me to write it?
They have revealed themselves. A man named Julius started it. He is now forming an army out there, destined to take Nassau. The damage done to this alliance was caused by Billy. It may be that the only way to repair this damage is to eliminate what caused it.
They are strong when Flint and Silver are together. But if you separate those two, if you turn them against each other... their world will fall apart. I tried it once and failed. But I didn't possess the instrument necessary to make it work. And now you do?
Mr. Oliver oversees our business. Before you can convince me that your proposal is plausible, you will have to convince him that your proposal is plausible. - When Richard was a little boy, there was a cat that lived in the woods behind the house. And he would spend all night scratching at the windows. Richard, who was four years old, would go outside still wearing his pajamas and feed it.
What will you do when the cat fights back? She just arrived from Nassau. She's alive. Held hostage in Nassau by the governor. Unless we get the cache to him and deliver it to him before the deadline, she dies.
I let you try it your way! I've trusted you. But I'm done gambling with your life. If to secure your release it is necessary to deliver the cache, I'm very glad I brought it with us. We had it.
I trusted you. But the gambling with your life is over. If to secure your release it is necessary to deliver the cache, I am very glad we brought it with us. We had it. We had it in our hands.
Your plan has failed. Now we continue according to my plan. Go get it, bring it here right away. Bring what? We had it in our hands.
But I don't think we're going to have that much time. He gave me that time for his benefit, not mine. He's getting ready to make a move. I don't know what, but he's getting ready for it. And there's very little he can do until he secures that chest and has it to negotiate with.
Is that okay with you? We have found him. I don't see the chest. The trail goes back about 200 yards. He buried it here.
More. He would never have been so far ahead of your men carrying that chest. The chest was never here. He left it behind. You think they'll find out we left it down here?
Good day. Thank you. I love our coffee. It's one of the few things Kenya does well. I missed it in England.
They are my people. We don't kneel for anybody. Your fucking mai soli and the three Fuchs thugs can go fuck themselves. I will enjoy scraping you off my shoe like the dog shit you are. We'll see about that, bitch.

Isn't that a manly thing to do? - That's why you need to publish his book. - Thank you. The girls at our publishing house are struggling to get it typed. I've read it several times myself.
- A pretty nice one. Give me that. That baptism was like our wedding, wasn't it? Don't blaspheme, please. We must take an oath... That no one will know.
- Mrs. Wislocka? - That's right, I've read your book. You read a book that doesn't exist? The whole Party is reading it.
And by contracting their muscles... I have to send my patients to sanatoriums. It's very inspiring. - Why don't you write a book? - Who would read it?
- You can't freeze the book. - Leave the lady alone. It's for you too. Are you doing so well at home? It's a user's manual, don't you understand?
That's why two billion dollars worth of these little guys are sold every year. Because they bring the reassurance that when the time comes, you'll be up to the task. Some of you take them. A little steel blue is nothing to be ashamed of. But if I throw this bottle into the audience right now, no one will catch it.
- Which part? - The scar thing. I think I would have noticed. Well, maybe if we ever got naked with the light on, or if we were even in a bed. Hey, do you think your dad was pissed that you took his car or that you took his car to be with me?
Yeah. I'm the same way. And I should have mentioned it to you last night, but, well, she's got a lot to lose, and I... Anyway, her phone's in my fucking car, okay? And if anyone finds it...
Anyway, your phone is in my fucking car, okay? And if anybody finds it... And, look, I'm getting the fucking third degree, okay? And Bo said if I go near the tank, he's gonna rip my lungs out and shit in the hole. And I can't ask any of these guys to do that, because they know her and they know her fucking husband and they'll recognize her phone because it looks like it belongs to fucking Liberace.
Well, the place is cleaned every day, isn't it? Usually, but we were understaffed this last month. So how many people used cubicle 2 after Miss Palfrey's death? No one. We closed it, out of respect.
Change is as good as rest. Here, give me one... THREE DROWNED POLICE SAY MURDER ...the unexpected defeat of Russian scientist, Professor Yuri Gradenko by the Jason computer in a game of chess at Lovelace University. Professor George Amory, who led the Oxford team, predicted that, within a generation, few compartments of intellect would be outside the realm of machines and that the problems of creating artificial intelligence would be substantially solved. We are no closer to catching this son of a bitch, and now everyone knows it.
"Muse case. Look, anyone can make a mistake. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna make coffee. Well, I'm gonna make some coffee. I have a feeling we're gonna need it.
His sister, she's dead. I just found her again! After all that time, I can't let it happen again! He's sick. He had... he had a breakdown, and Dr. Nielsen knew about it.
Who knows. Maybe a coordinated terrorist attack. Turn here. I'm doing you a favor, you know? I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday.
Full? But... - ...clearly, there's no one here. - There's no availability. There are no cars parked outside. We have a dress code here and she doesn't follow it.
We learned it from Nemeton. What kind of price? A big one? A big one. You let him out.
Let's face it, you're an easy target. But that's... well that's because you've been honest about what you love. And all in all, that's... inspiring. And I'm sorry too. Not about the sex, I really don't even remember it.
The problem is the photo. The photo. If we leave the helicopter there, blown up or not, the bad guys take a picture with it. And it pisses me off, if you'll excuse my language. But if we bring it back, we can turn this accident into a victory.
- Set up a tent for the wounded. - Yes, sir. - Maño. - Yes, sir. I want your vehicle On this slope, Covering the area of this rock A this way, got it?
Ever since Anup told me about it I've buttoned my shirt up to the collar. Can you imagine? Really? Who started it?
And the greatest thing, sir is that you will understand everything but you won't be able to explain it to anyone. Hey! Do you think this is a game? You started this game while everyone watched it but I'll finish it.
Silence. I'll do the talking. My friend's phone was stolen. Did anyone sell him a phone today? We'll never find it!
But guess what? No... you can't fuck with me anymore, okay? I'm "un-fuckable" now. So, yeah, maybe you threw me off a little when you showed up, but not anymore. Because I've... I've taken my ball, I've walked down that court and I've slammed it in the basket.
- Okay, bad example since you lost your virginity at 13 to a lifeguard or something. You know when you're a little kid and you're not ready to spend the night at a friend's house? - Yes! - Yes! In kindergarten or first grade spending the night at a friend's house is the thing to do and everyone does it every Friday and Saturday and you think, "No, I can't. I can't do it.
Marn, call me back, okay? I have a real problem in real life. Please. - Rice. - I know it's so traditional to throw rice, but I don't think I want them to throw it at us, because the pigeons eat it and I hear they die, I don't want that.
I couldn't leave without seeing you, Zelda, I thought we had a week! I couldn't talk to you about your book. It doesn't matter. Scribner turned it down, he's dead.
But always changing her mind. She was madly in love with life. But she loved herself a little more. At the age of 6. She played a bee in a play. She loved her costume so much. That she wore it for a week.
She was madly in love with life. But she loved herself a little more. At the age of 6. She played a bee in a play. She loved her costume so much. That she wore it for a week. A week later... She threw it away like an old toy.
At age 6. She played a bee in a play. She loved her costume so much. She wore it for a week. A week later... She threw it away like an old toy. She never wore it again.
Tomorrow morning... Give her some flowers. And propose to her. From the moment she couldn't spell "love." Let alone understand it... I love her. When that girl says yes, I could feel my heart burst. I rewound that moment and replayed it over and over in my head.
Don't you know? Oh God! Not again. Try to forget about your album please. Abhi, you don't understand.
In our time, I was a freak. Today, I'm an amateur. Give it up, John, right now. Do you know that here you can walk into a store and buy a rifle or a revolver, and it's perfectly legal? These people encourage it.
"It's true, H.G., don't be silly." "Believe it. I wrote this, but... What does this symbol stand for? I've looked for it but there's no record of it.
To have our own house. Make love whenever we want. To be free, damn it. You'll love my town, you'll be able to paint in peace there. It's better not to go to your village, it would be the first place they'd look for us. You'll lose this course, but you'll make it up next year.
- No other friends? - No. I cut up a rabbit once. What? When I was eight, I found a dead rabbit. I picked it up with a plastic bag, then cut it into little pieces and put them in a bowl in the shed.
- What are you doing? - I need you to do exactly what I say. No time for questions. Just listen. When I start walking down the carriage, I need you to grab that bag over there. See?
In fact Dr. Bancroft never spoke to Hodgins' doctor. It was Zack, emailing and calling from a disposable cell phone. Zack is the one who developed the protocol you've been following. Zack is the one who's going to get Hodgins to walk. Look, Aubrey, I'm not saying Zack didn't do it.
Dr. Brennan. I think you need to come with me. Let's find a place - to sit down. - No. Dr. Faulk warned us that someone would meddle in the case and manipulate it.
So, Ms. Baker has stolen Stephen's work? That's pretty brazen, isn't it? Dr. Klein isn't quite sure what happened. But when they finally spoke, Stephen deeply regretted the matter. He said he would talk it over with her.
Well, now that you've discovered my sordid little secret, is there anything else you want? I'm afraid we're not done yet. We think Stephen may have had a change of heart. He was going to discuss it with you. Maybe republish it? We talked about it.
Thank you, JP. Florence... Do you have the number? And who does the phone belong to? It belongs to all of you. And I think they put it up there on the seismograph.
Florence... Do you have the number? And who does the phone belong to? It belongs to all of you. And I think they would put it up there on the seismograph. And then they would call it intermittently for three nights to distort the readings on the extremely sensitive devices and that led Stephen to think it was worrisome.
Stephen was gassed in his own room. How can you be sure of this? The phenolphthalein. There were vials of it on Stephen's desk. I'm guessing he was using it to test some kind of soil.
And with his continued state of drug addiction, I'm sure it wasn't complicated to make him abandon his scruples. And Emer. I think he really cared about Stephen. I guess Victoria found out his secret, didn't she? And used it to coerce her into joining the plan.
That is, they did. And that's why they did it. They may have had their own motives for taking Stephen's life... but it was you who provided the extra incentive. The final nail in the coffin, if you will. If it wasn't necessary before the fact, it clearly was after the fact.
And I'm the best surfer in Pen Gu. Who else would they ask? Hey, Lani. I told my mom you told me you were joining the Hang 5. And she told me to ask you for your autograph... to sell online.
He will show me my destiny. Gus knows what I'm talking about. The coyote. My legacy. He knows.
It took me two eyelashes. I wasn't thinking straight. But you're going to have a lot of time to think now, because you're going to jail for a long time. Booth, the sodium nitrate in Ian's neck wounds doesn't prove conclusively that Randy is the killer. Yeah, but I knew I bought it.
He's telling the truth. ...then I wouldn't have had any trouble finding the product. It's low quality but there's a lot of it and the dealers aren't very picky. Hasn't anyone read the report? - We did read it.
And we keep looking until we find this guy, and we don't stop. That's right, Seeley, I knew you had him. I've been reading about this type of torture. They say they still exist in the Balkan countries and parts of the Middle East. Yeah, I heard that.
They say they still exist in the Balkan countries and part of the Middle East. Yes, I heard that. Your unit served in both. McKinney was there. There's no chance McKinney did it.
You didn't choose the cheapest option. Well, why would you have a cheap phone in your purse? "It's kind of an invitation to an affair, isn't it?" "It's pay-as-you-go." "Obviously, don't link it to your email account."
Well, why would you have a cheap phone in your purse? "It's kind of an invitation to an affair, isn't it?" "It's pay-as-you-go." "Obviously, don't link it to your email account." "And don't do the same thing twice, because it's important not to establish a pattern, which is exactly the opposite of what you do."
It won't. We're not like that. He's not a jealous guy. It's important to imagine the worst-case scenario. "Well, I'll tell him it belongs to Liz, from work." That she left it at a meeting and that's why I'm taking it, intending to return it to her.
Okay. You know what really bothers me about Gary? His haircut. I hate his haircut. He's had the same haircut for 30 years. And I hated it 30 years ago.
I'm just saying that the idea of marriage is crazy. I don't know why people do it.
Just a moment. I'm receiving information. - Yes. - Damn it. - We got it.
- Well, we don't know yet. I'm trying to get it back. Frankie Vargas passed away before he could inhabit the office he was elected to. But his accomplishments, his selfless work and his dreams shine a light for all of us to carry on. And although we don't have the message, we have the cell phone number of the person who left it.
I can't get it out of my head. Yeah, me neither. No. Man, I... I mean, I literally can't get it out of my head.
Bodies without DNA? Or bodies without DNA that somehow make you feel fear. I don't know if the body is actually causing the fear. Maybe it's amplifying it? You still feel it, don't you?
Why would I do that? She was missing. I don't see why that matters now. You have the ring. Then why does she keep putting it off?
Addison Derringer is making very serious accusations that I have behaved inappropriately. And if this is about me breaking down and admitting other things to Hackett... Wait. What other things? I took a shortcut to get my degree, okay? I had one final exam left and A.D. did it for me.
Did someone send you a finger? - Are you sure it's from...? - Archer Dunhill's, yeah. Prints match. Do you have any idea who sent it or why?
Hello, Miss Harper. I'm calling from Mr. Hastings' office. What happened? Nicole found the book. And she threw it at you?
For the donor. What? I beg your pardon? You asked us to save this for the egg donor. We personalized it and everything.
A.D. It's my turn. You haven't slept either? No, I've been waiting for that phone to start ringing again. Well, have you hidden it?
It's my turn. You haven't slept either? No, I've been waiting for that phone to start ringing again. Well, have you hidden it? If Caleb finds it...
You haven't slept either? No, I've been waiting for that phone to start ringing again. Well, have you hidden it? If Caleb finds it... No, I put it in my purse.
No, I've been waiting for that phone to start ringing again. Well, have you hidden it? If Caleb finds it... No, I put it in my purse. He's not gonna find it.
Who is it? It's you. You say you're in on it... The game started a couple of days after the blind school. We're hiding it at Spencer's house.
Well, there are some little figures that look like the five of us. If you're not on the board, I don't think you're invited to play. I don't want to get on it. I want to get into it. If I figure out how it works, maybe I can find out who made it.
I was nowhere near there. I was at the Radley Hotel. All I did was bring a couple of drinks to Caleb and Mona with a message. Why? Jenna sold it to me as a joke.
Your hands are bigger than when you were a child. They're a lot less purple too. I can see why she wants to quit. It's been there for years. They left it that way after Gloriana died.
I have to take a shower. Why doesn't A.D. pick up this hard drive on his own? Because it's probably a weapon or something. Hanna, stop pacing. How do you know it won't explode as soon as you plug it in?
Caleb, this person saved me. He gave me and my friends an alibi the night of Charlotte's murder. It's not Lucas. Hey, Marco. Your apartment is different than I imagined.
- Good night. Good night. - Good night. Are you absolutely sure about that? Mona's got the game. Not only does she have it, she's accessed the inside of that thing.
Think again. Because we're going to get out of here and we're going to go to the police. You're going to tell them how you've made everyone's lives a living hell. But first, let's pick up the game so they can see your talent. I don't have it anymore.
Because we're going to get out of here and we're going to go to the police. You're going to tell them how you've made everyone's lives a living hell. But first, let's pick up the game so they can see your talent. I don't have it anymore. Someone stole it from me. Someone always steals my game.
You're going to tell them how you've made everyone's lives a living hell. But first, let's pick up the game so they can see your talent. I don't have it anymore. Someone stole it from me. Someone always steals my game. If you don't have it, who does?
Open the door. - Oh, God. Mona said she didn't have the game anymore. - She told you? - She said someone stole it.
Of course. Well... I killed Archer Dunhill. I ran him over with a car I stole and buried his body in the woods. Then I moved him to where I told them they'd find him.
In a small place. We'll be able to say, "We liked each other before." Hey, I tried to add you the other day, but I couldn't find your profile. Is it hidden or something? Yeah, I deleted it a year ago.
Well, I think it means Fillmore-Graves wants to make Seattle a zombie-friendly city. "Zombie-friendly"? As in, "Eat all the brains you want, we'll make more"? I didn't go into details. There was a bit of a rush to get out of the building before they blew it up.
Well, if I owned it, wouldn't I make it my money? Chief is dead. I've been shot. It's our money. I don't want to sound like your mother, but where was the last time you saw him?
Does it help you carry the guilt, given what you are? What did you say? Keelin, you must listen to me. - How do you know my name? - A friend told me.
Are you offering me a deal? One you can't refuse. Alistair and his kind hate me for my strength. Now they hate you. Creatures like them only respect one language, and I speak it fluently.
Well, this should be good. Something's coming, something unlike anything we've seen before. What's coming? You know the fire that ended the world. Lexa called it Praimfaya.
Are you into that? I don't know what you're talking about. Niles. Well... If you're referring to that hanged rustler, now that you mention it, he might know something.
You asked me for a map of this site. Bajie always delivers. Are you sure it's accurate? Who knows? I got it from the oldest Collector here.
Get the bottle! Oh, my God! What was that? Two beings merging in a single fleeting moment. Don't ruin it, honey.
- I thought we had a deal. - We did, but... - there's your money. - I don't need the money. I need someone to launder it.
It was Grammie Davenport's. He named it after her. He was reading it to his schoolchildren when the Titanic sank. Oh, boy. And Mom read it to me.
He named it after himself. He was reading it to his schoolchildren when the Titanic sank. Wow. And Mom read it to me. I read it to you.
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. And it used to get so hot that we thought it might set the whole house on fire, but.... - It's true. - you wouldn't let anyone touch it.
Don't you want to go ahead and finish it? No. If you're done, I'm done. Your customers seem to like the rainbow. Don't you think they'll miss it?
You put it in the patient's chart. Oh. Okay. Right? - Because they never look at it.
I'm a SEAL and my sperm can't even swim. Joseph... Joseph, this isn't about you or God. It's a simple medical problem. We'll discuss it with the surgeon.
I killed seven. Why? Because they were my enemy. And when you kill someone, you take their spirit. You claim it by its secret name.
Well, whoever hacked your phone used your fingerprint, so unless you're missing a thumb, it was you. I don't know what you're up to, but if I were you, I'd be careful... When you were in the hospital, the woman who attacked us came back with her partner. What? They tracked me using my cell phone, so I took it to Jep's to try to find out.
Of course you defend your stupid boyfriend. Since Wes died, all you've done is point the finger at Annalise, suspicious behavior. The first thing guilty people do is try to blame someone else. Like a fart. Whoever smells it first, has it underneath.
You are wrong. I swear on the graves of my son and your husband, it wasn't me. You offered me a deal... Seven years if I ratted out Annalise. And now I'm telling you I'm taking it.
Take it to court. Costly. And extremely damaging to HHM's reputation. Not my first choice, and I imagine yours isn't either. The firm could decide to buy me out... for an amount that would almost certainly bankrupt it.
One day you will be, honey. Yes, but not for a long, long time. Honey, have you decided on a hotel yet? - We have to make a reservation. - Alexis is looking for it.
I don't have it! Nobody talks to me like that! I don't know what I'm supposed to have done wrong! You took my money out of the catalog and spent it on fucking weed!
Okay. Kinchie's making you tea, Peter. I won't be long, love. I'm not eating that, it's a goose! It's an egg and you'll eat it.
We've charged Mick Donovan with Shannon's kidnapping. Well, that's it, then. But you're telling us that you were in on it with him. How? You're saying that the two of you planned it.
How? He's saying that the two of them planned it. That he agreed that he'd take Shannon from school, keep her in his apartment, and they'd split the reward money. Well, he's lying, isn't he? He didn't even know.
That's not going to happen, is it? I mean, she's one of them, they're worried about her... I think they should have counseling. And what did the director say? That he wouldn't do it.
Please, please. I can explain. Listen to me. I was very worried. I had to protect you, protect our family. I picked up your phone at the store and took it to Andrew Nelson, my friend in the IT department.
No, no, no, no, no. No, this is not the kind of thing you want to do off the record. Listen, Lincoln, he's going to need a transfusion. Michael is B-negative, okay? About one percent of the population has that blood type. You won't find it where you're going and he's not going to get it while you're watching.
All right. Which friend? He's at Patrick's house. What happened to your grandmother's ring? I'm an idiot. I took it off on the way over to keep it safe, because I didn't want it stolen, and when I looked for it on the way back, it was gone.
Please wait. Heart Enterprises. Please wait. I got the job! They offered it to me on the spot!
- What's that? - Come on, let's go. Give me your phone. - No. I can't check your phone without you noticing. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Yes, I'm sorry. Wow, do you have the newer model? It can take 5 megapixel selfies. The clarity is supposed to be amazing. Yeah, that's why I bought it.
Alexis? Look up, sweetheart. You're with the family. Seriously, put the damn phone down. Do you have it or not?
Did you do something with my money? - I knew I could make you more. - More? What do you mean? I invested it in a house, okay? But listen to me.
Note the past tense. When Reggie's wife Maria became a vampire, she killed Reggie and created a lair inside. What does this have to do with me? Do you really think love is going to stop you from hurting your family and friends? No matter how hard you fight it, demon blood will make you kill.
What happened? Alec... Someone took my spell book. Are you activating your shields? No one leaves until I get it back.
Look, all I know is that Gideon said the motorcycles Darhk and Merlyn stole are here. So what, we just ride around until we see a sign that says "this way"? Good idea. Subjugating the world under you is not saving it. You'd create a wasteland and call it peace.
And when his father finally found him, the way he cried. That's real. Yes... her parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man erased the pain of that night. But that's not life, there is no love without suffering. You couldn't touch the love your mother and father gave you, that is still in you, you still have it here.
Hungry? You buying? Give him a whip. This is the logo for my new club. What shall we call it?
Thanks for believing in me, H. R. Hey, I've been looking for the right time to tell you. Tell me what? Just before he died, H. R. asked me to give you a message. Tell Cisco... It took a lot of courage and he was the one who gave it to me.
I will return with an order signed by the president. I can't wait. I've always wanted her autograph. You know how people hate to say "I told you so"? I don't hate it.
- Thank you. And Catherine Wallace called. - She didn't say what for, but it sounded a little bit.... - Okay. (phone ringing) - Did she leave a number? - Yeah, I put it in her address book.
Hey, it's just a simple party, okay? Relax. Oh, my God! I wanted to get a haircut. We'd already discussed it.
Yes. No, I'm still here. No. I'm not wearing that dress. You wore it in the first part of the scene they already shot.
Yes. - Very good. Yes. - I don't like blue cheese. - Why did you accept it?
Did you notice how I hugged you last night, and then you hugged Grandpa? That was so sweet. Oh, my God! Bertie leaves half-eaten yogurt here. Who eats half a yogurt and keeps it?
I think they like to be called background actors. They call her Natasha. Natasha? That's cool. - Oh, that's cool. - I would have invited her to my room, but I share it with Arya, so I can't.
How are you? - I almost died today. - What? Are you okay? A car hit my shopping cart while I was pushing it.
Did you see him often? At the beginning of the month. He'd pick up his check. That was the deal. I'd cash it for him. That was it.
I love that our marriage...is recognized by the federal government. I know we don't need anyone's permission to love each other, but you know what, it feels good to have the same rights as a straight couple. To be included. To be protected under the law. God knows that right may not be infringed upon, but, as long as we can have it, I want it.
And after one of the most uncomfortable conversations I have ever had in my life.... Jesus is now ready to resume sexual activity with some limitations. Thanks for the help, Doc. So... if we get this far, does this mean we're agreeing to him having sex? Well, he's going to have it anyway.
Jesus is now ready to resume sexual activity with some limitations. Thanks for the help, Doc. So... if we get this far, does this mean we're agreeing to him having sex? Well, he's going to have it anyway. What worries me is where he does it.
The thing is, he has nowhere to live and if he doesn't accept that job up north, he's going to have to live in his car. I think he is depressed. Well, I could have said that. I wish I could make it work. Anyway, he's got a new number and he wanted me to give it to you.
Well, and where... where's the chicken? Do we need chicken? I'll be back. No, you've done enough. I'll tell mom to bring it when she comes.
Nothing. - Did I hear something about Emma? - What? No. She's pissed because I... I didn't refill the car the last time I used it.
- They couldn't use it in court. - You said you weren't at his house that day. - I lied. I was there in the morning, I saw money on the counter, - and I took it.
Just stop this guy. Whoever he is, he's not in the system. How about instead of tracking him we track the weapon he used in the assault? It's a rifle. And Oliver took it.
What do you have? Wait a minute. That... that doesn't make sense. This is the AR-15 assault rifle that was used in the attack on city hall. Which one of your men did it?
I will keep you posted on the status of this investigation. I wouldn't panic just yet. We don't even know if the report is legitimate. I think it's safe to say yes. The question is: who sent it to Pike?
The attorney general came to see me and... You mean Adrian Chase? That's correct. He instructed me to rewrite the report indicating that the star killer had been responsible. This report. And he says he signed it, even though he knew it was false and passed it on to the police.
Very good. Look, I appreciate what you're doing, but I'm fine. I appreciate what you're doing, but I'm fine. Mr. Mayor, with all due respect, your head is bleeding and our serious injury protocol is much stricter than the NFL's. Well, since I'm the mayor, I'll suspend you.
Yes, I already stated that. What have you got? When I hit Vigilante with my sonic scream, I tore a chunk out of his visor. It appears to be full of circuitry. Well, that means it's manufactured. Maybe he can lead us to where he bought it.
But first I have a gift for you. This tattoo of yours. Being an American and being made a captain in the Bratva, you must have done something extraordinary. When you look at it, it must... remind you of a great victory. Now, when you look at it, you will think about our time together and the secret you confessed to me.
See you later. The pain. It's fascinating, isn't it? Some men will do anything to avoid it. Others accept it, even enjoy it, like you.
How's the tooth? It hurts. Do you want some ibuprofen? No. Look, I know you're treating it. And I really appreciate it.
Are we supposed to believe he's the heir? Look, I don't blame you for being cautious. And I would never trust a dragon, but I feel he's telling the truth. It's the bond. If he feels it, and Drago feels it, it must be true.
I don't want to drag them into this any more than they already are. I don't like it, but that's okay. We are still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we have nothing. We've already checked several blocks around the parked car. He left it there for us to find.
We checked all incoming and outgoing calls to Burkhardt's phone. Apart from the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has a certain frequency. What is it? It probably doesn't mean anything. We checked it.
The chief is considering transferring Katie Pine...to the Office of Children's Rights Protection. - What? We got a murdered Indian girl... - We've got a murdered Native American girl... who slipped through the cracks. Everybody's watching. I'm trying to give you a chance here... but you're gonna have to work the case in front of you... or you're gonna lose it.
We could pretend. I don't want to pretend! Wait, honey, come here. Listen, calm down, will you? It's all right. I'll fix it, okay? I'll fix it, okay?
It's totally acceptable these days. I just remembered that Jean wanted to play, what was it? It was Cinderella. Yeah, she didn't get the part. She was part of the chorus. She was furious with the girl who got it.
No, he... He's... We're together. It's gonna get cold. - What's that? - The tea. My mother only drank it by burning.
Richard, tell me you don't plan to go home and tell the guys that, even with the increase in users, you want to change. I spent the last 48 hours trying to rewrite the mother code and I really cannot. Instead of typing, I'm biting my nails. On a subconscious level, I'd rather rip my fingers off than work on it. I know people who spend their entire careers looking for an app with this growth and don't get it.
Colleen's gonna kick my ass if I don't bring home Chinese food tonight. What the fuck is going on? Don't you get it? Yeah, yeah! Dude, your car likes dick... pee-pee... so I'm fucking with it.
Yes! So you're a thief. Just some coffee. You have a Jacuzzi. Have you ever used it?
Someone screwed us. I talked to Adelstein this morning. Fuck, I told you not to do it. And he told me about the deal. I won't take it.
They thought it belonged to the dead woman. Yes, it belongs to the dead woman. I'm the dead woman. Where's my fucking car? - The police took it.
- Any preference? The closest to disinfectant alcohol you have. Coffee, please. Black. I'll bring it to your table.
They feel my warmth on their hips and it warms them during the night. God bless the believers. Come with me to Wisconsin. Stand by my side and let the world open up to us again. I was on the bus before you painted it yellow.
I thought about turning around, but curiosity got the better of me. So I walked in its direction, although, the closer I got, the farther away it got. In the end, I turned around and had gone so far into the wasteland that I couldn't find my way back. For three hours, I wandered in the dark and nothing rang a bell, but then I remembered what my grandmother used to tell me about goblins. So I swallowed my hunger, picked up my bread, laid it on a moss-covered stone and lay down to sleep beside it.
I could give you some of mine. Do you have any gold? I had some. Quite a bit. They're holding it for me.
The world is watching. And live in three, two.... Mayor Cobblepot, while Gotham has experienced a historic uptick in job growth and prosperity, it is also at one of the safest times in its history. And I'm sure everyone is asking, "How did he do it?".
An exaggeration. People love to make up scandals. But it was murder that sent him to Arkham, a prison for the criminally insane. I rescued the city from the lunatic, Theo Galavan. Some call it murder.
I want it to be a slow... and painful death. One of a thousand deep cuts. First we make him lose his head... That's the part I like. We destroy his empire and take it over.
You must be the first person in history to commit multiple murders to find a life coach. Maybe you should give up riddles. No. A good riddle reveals its author. To solve it is to solve the mystery of the person who possesses it.
My enemies took everything from me. They tried to assassinate me. You help me achieve my revenge, and when I regain my throne, I will give you every resource you need to free yourself from this icy prison. Even if I wanted to say yes, I can only survive a few hours out of the cold without my suit. And you don't have it because it's been locked away in a secret location of Enterprise Wayne's since he escaped from Indian Hill.
When I find out what you did, I'm going to make sure you pay for it. And I'm gonna enjoy it. Jim, hey. - Where's the riddle? - Lucius and I tried, but you might have better luck.
All this time, and you don't know anything, do you? Right. There you go. Wait, is this the owl? What happened to him? Jerome Valeska smashed it into a thousand pieces when he snuck into the mansion.
He trains them. What I have done to you, he has done to them for 200 years. But progress is more than eliminating all feelings. Cut off your little finger on your left hand. Shall I tell him to eat it?
He's not going to shoot you. He's weak, Bruce. You're not. Bruce, please. Give me the detonator, son. No. You'll push it.
And when his father finally found him, the way he cried. That's real. Yes... her parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man erased the pain of that night. But that's not life, there is no love without suffering. You couldn't touch the love your mother and father gave you, that is still in you, you still have it here.
Hungry? You buying? Give him a whip. This is the logo for my new club. What shall we call it?
It's growing on me. And this rifle is growing on me. Search heat bullets are just the beginning of what this bad boy can do. How did you end up with the looting rifle? Barry stole it for me.
- What's going on? We're going to move the train. How are we going to do that? I'll vibrate it. I'll vibrate it fast enough that I can get in phase to get through this.
I couldn't defeat Solovar in combat, but you could. You did and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City and all the gorillas will follow me. Solovar never wanted to attack Central City. You did. You took my home from me and now I will take it back!
I don't know... it was spontaneous. I knew you'd say yes and I wanted to surprise you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. There's a triple fire alarm at the Raab building. The fire department's evacuating it now.
Wally. He doesn't deserve this. Let me guess, you do? I know what my hell looks like. I've seen it in my future.
Yes, I'm burning it all. What? - Everything? What...? - My job. Well, I don't know why they call it "work," because none of it works.
It's just that I saw you two ready to fight. Okay. (chuckles) Well, from the angle I saw it, it looked like you had a clean shot. Okay. [Laughs] You had a clean shot, Cisco, and you didn't take it.
You. All of you. I mean, love is the only thing we have in this world. Without it, nothing really matters. And who knows what we would become if we didn't have it?
- How was Earth 3? - Yeah, dating Jesse was great. I mean, love is the only thing we have in this world. Without it, nothing really matters. And who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?
- We don't have time to test it now. - What is that thing? This can send electrical charges through the transmitters in his suit and should theoretically jolt his memory. You want to "electroshock" his brain? Won't it fry him even more?
That's what you get with mercy. This must be where Waller keeps his suicide squad. I think this is it. Cisco, we found it. Cisco, we found it.
You've delayed the crew and postponed the production. If you don't show up tomorrow ready to do the performance of your life, don't show up at all. Who died? I asked Paige out. She said no. I gave her a necklace and she gave it back.
Leave the labels at the Dolce and follow this with Rainer. So Meryl Streep, huh? Yeah, you should start preparing your Oscar speech. Hey, where's your bracelet? I took it to the jeweler, it was a little big on me and I didn't want it to fall off.
Actually, that was my agent. I have a meeting about my script in an hour. I called him first to let him know I might not be coming. Wait? As in selling your script? I already sold it.
Because every debt that Aidan had, is now mine. And if I don't pay them back, they'll kill me. When Brandy Michaels needed bail money, she spoke up. And you're going to hate your best friend now because I got the part? Because I didn't think you would but you walked right in and got it, like everything else you do.
I feel much better. It's not so bad. You've sold a script. You're going to get paid. Don't you get it?
I don't need your sympathy. I'm trying to help, Jake. I don't... I don't need you to solve my problems. And, Paige, if I get the job, I'll take it.
Maggie! Maggie! I didn't tell Maggie we'd come looking for her. Where's my phone? I thought I left it...
My role. I want to be the only time sorceress in Locked in America, in China or on Mars. I don't even want to hear Xu Yifei's name again, okay? You didn't even want that role, remember? - Ida wanted it for you.
Two million tweets have been written. It's all over Instagram and Facebook. Okay, I can't see it. Who would have done it? Well, Rachel was the one who recorded it but I can't imagine....
The strange thing is... losing those people is what brought us together. That's how we found each other. It's what made us... a family. Where did you get that necklace? You gave it to me. No, I didn't.
Like the kind of energy contained in hellfire? Bonnie, is everything okay? Listen, Stefan, I know I've been hard on you. But I also know that you and I are just as willing to do anything to make this right. Of course. Why? Do you have something? I think I do, but the only way to get rid of Katherine Pierce is if she's in hell when I destroy it.
- Sure. - Maybe his last name, friends, family, where he stayed when he was in LA? I'm a lover, not a Rolodex. Detective. I found him in the tunnel.
I was desperate. I'm broke. When the stewardess let slip how much money I was going to make on that delivery, I... I thought it was drugs. I was going to sell them. So I opened it.
We were looking for a... special package that was smuggled in. - All right, - We didn't find it. It must have been the poison. Kleinberg must have been the one who stole it.
She will show you. Don't listen to the click. Feel the click. Hush, hush. Almost got it.
If it breaks, there will be consequences on a cosmic scale. - Cass, what have you done? - What had to be done. Yeah, you made a deal. You made a stupid deal and I broke it.
Site 94? It's a government facility, secret. Shadow operations. One of those places that doesn't officially exist. So how do you know about it?
I will not let any of you die. And I will not let you sacrifice yourselves. You mean so much to me, to everything. Yeah, you made a deal. You made a stupid deal, and I broke it.
All of these dumps look the same. So this spell, I'm stuck in some sort of "memory" loss? Right. The solution seems simple enough. We need to find the witch who did it and kill her.
My name is... my name is... My name is... My name is... Gideon Loughlin's address was in his accountant's file. If the book is there, I'll find it.
Rowena, now! ez loh, say tah! mah tay, ez loh, say tah! i managed to pervert the spell. So that your essence was not sent to the Cage, and instead, we found the vessel discarded a few years ago... repaired it, and upgraded it, making it a perfect final home... for you.
From... before the lake house. It wasn't Wally. They brought me that case. You've been running errands for the British. You kept it from us.
Look, I didn't choose this place for its ambiance. Obviously. This? It's a fortress. No one gets in without me knowing about it.
Here. Here you go. - What are you doing? I'm trying to track Dean's phone. - Trying to track Dean's phone. Okay, I got it.
How nice. I mean... we're not exactly the kind of people... they write about in the history books. But the people we saved, they're our legacy. And they'll remember us and then I guess... we'll be gone too. And that's okay, because we leave the world better than we found it, you know.
Grace extraction. The tracking spell failed, didn't it? But... but the extraction ritual worked. ? Y? ? What if Cass used it on Kelly's baby?
- Yes. One for Kelly. - They're close. - That celestial pulse we felt, Joshua has traced it to a nearby house.
- Crowley, I guess. And now he's dead. Well, that's what Hess said. But Crowley's a fucking cockroach. I'll believe he's dead when I see the body and burn it.
In a... real rat? Actually, it wasn't so bad. It gave me time to think. You know? I've been focused so long on keeping my job. I never realized I hate it.
Sammy. Where's your big brother? He's right over here. Nice toy. Yeah, I got it from an old... new buddy of mine.
The gasket's already blown. I just got home this afternoon, myself. Oh, my God! You can take the can, though. We'll take it.
Hey, I was wondering... if I stop by, maybe in half an hour, would that be okay? I just need the old laptop. What for? Oh, it's got some files on it that I need for school. I'll get it back to you later tonight. Is that okay?
Yes, I sent it. It was on your computer. I used your card. I didn't know that. When I sent it, I didn't know I had been raped.
Show me your phone, Mark. Why? Show it to me. Do you think I'm stupid? You record me and give it to the police as new evidence.
- Yes, I know. And we can't afford new ones, so from now on no cell phone and you use the library computer. Where did you get that porn? Michael Lucas. - Where did he get it?
I was about to close. - Do you have your wife's laptop? - Yes. Yes, I do. - How did you get it?
- Power Points for what? Well, several things. Osmosis, reproductive systems, the cellular life of plants... Well, we'll take the computer now, thank you. We'll examine it for our research.
Why aren't we enough? What did you expect from him? I just needed to hear Joe say it. Confessing like he would never confess in front of a judge. I tried to record it with my phone, so I could give it to the police, but he took it away.
What are you doing? Get out of the way! I was trying to find out where Michael got the porn. Here! Your computer. He got it from you!
Your computer. It got it from you! That's not what's going on. What are you doing with it? - Look, everyone has it!
More than that, there's traces of DNA from one of our men on the sock. Who? What's so urgent? I was moving things around and I came across this I've never seen it before.
Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! Paddle! One day, Osbert, I'm going to kill that bastard and I'm going to enjoy it.
I'm sorry. What are you saying? What's a zombie? The term has a negative connotation. - I don't like it either. - Let's not use it.
Are you going to spend the rest of your life making excuses - for their behavior? - I don't make excuses for anyone. She's telling the truth, sir. There is a link, she explained it to me.
What about yours? - When we take him to trial, the defense will tear our case apart if you're involved. - You know that. - I promised Anna. - Who's running it now?
With you doing things you shouldn't and me having to cover it up. Suri, if I knew anything else, I'd tell you. Ever since he showed up and you started wearing that bracelet. This? I've had it for a long time.
Suri, if I knew anything else, I'd tell you. Ever since he showed up and you started wearing that bracelet. This? I've had it for a long time. Richard gave it to me as a gift.
I can help you. I can help you defeat Harry. - No, you can't. - Yes, I can. There's a second bracelet and I know the woman who wears it.
- Do you want to be transferred? - I'm not trusted. Harry! - This bracelet will ruin him. - I won't let it do that.
Klaus, what is that? Uncle Monty wrote it. He must have copied it during the movie. We were right next to him. We would have seen him get a message.
Mr. Leonard, did you know that "Wright" comes from Old English? It means "woodcarver." And here I thought it meant "adulterer". Well, I'm intrigued that you don't know the meaning of your last name given that you chose it.
There are very strict rules that I can't break. So... This will be an unofficial consultancy. Is there anything I can do to protect myself? Should I consider extreme measures... I will have to ask you to collect the money, and put it in your bag.
- Yes. That's fine. I'll give you the capital to expand the business. That's great. We'll put it in your name.
Lieutenant, I want to charter a boat to Santa Cruz Island. Do you authorize it? Looks like you're already on a boat. Excellent. I take that as a yes. Bosch, what the fuck? I think that's where Woody Woodrow hid the money. Dobbs is following him.
Put the knife away. It was hidden under the seat. It's not mine. I didn't know. They took it apart in the lab today.
Homicide thinks the fire at Riverwatch was Caffrey's doing. Someone wanted to take him out, along with the stuff in the apartment. His lawyer had the yearbook. Yeah, and Caffrey kept my mother's murder file somewhere safe. And they found it.
"Welcome to the agency, Agent Wish." Give me desk and badge. Pronto. I forgot they're assholes. Caffrey had it in a safe deposit box.
- It is not possible. I'm trying to save you trouble. Because if you run this story without confirmation, you'll regret it. Are you threatening me? Not at all. I'm telling you the reality. The tip is false. If you believe it, you'll look like a fool.
- Get out of my way, Remnant. I thought you were trying to help. Move or you'll never get your body back. Isn't that what you want, to get back what she stole from you? She didn't steal it from me.
- It is... It's an illustration. It's poop with... That means. Well, I didn't see it.
I went after him until I crossed the border of... Pay attention to me, dammit! I'm listening to you. I found him at his sister's house. And he comes at me with a field hockey stick, I see this bat and I grab it.
It's my wife, I'll take care of it. Then tell your grandson to pay Tony for his food. And here. Give him back his shitty watch. You can keep the bat, I bought it ten minutes ago.
Do you need help? Mrs. Bergstein? I'm sorry, I have a phone around my neck and sometimes it activates itself. It's Japanese. I doubt you know it.
Did you have a hard day? Every day is hard on the farm. It gets earlier and earlier every day. Is there such a thing as sunrise? I'm kidding, I knew it.
Now I know it wasn't, but if it had been, I would have been rabid and I would have saved your life. You hang fruit with signs that say "for bats". They have to eat. And this is your panic button? Yeah, this car didn't come with any luxuries, so I use it as a help desk.
You saw it yourself, there are thousands of drones on those walls. Didn't you see their damn nest? What does it matter if we decipher their communication? Put that audio file on a USB. I'll get it to Hennessey and see if he can come up with something.
As long as we don't make mistakes, you and I will get out of this hell. I promise. Extra security for the shipment, coming up. It'll be in good hands. We'll download it here.
What if that file had information on where they are holding Bram or how long they will hold him? - Or when they're going to release him...? - I know. I know. I know. I know. All right, I'll take it to work. I'll take it to work and try to open it there.
What do you have in mind? I have a document from the deputy representative's office. It's protected, but it has a lot of data on the population of the area, including information on where my oldest son, Bram, is captured. How do you know that's in the file, if it's protected? Because my sister showed it to me.
May 18, 1969, the fourth manned mission to the Moon. NASA still does not know what the source was. Many conspiracy theories. Here is your file. As soon as I heard it I recognized the similarities.
And why are we suddenly so anxious to find a way "in"? Your husband, Will. The collaborator? He let the kid get away during a raid. Occupation found out.
Get us some of that suit. Wow! It worked. Hey, why are you taking the gauntlet? Hennessey's going to keep it. I'll take good care of it.
Keep digging. If he's right, we may be able to use Bowman to catch Broussard. But be careful. Where did he keep the gauntlet? Who else knew Hennessey had it?
I am even puzzled by the payment system for the toilets. It's simple, take the receipt for the relevant toilet to the purser.... You may have been fun a hundred years ago, Burnsie, but now you're a cheap, mean old man. And believe me, I know cheap. That's right, I bought a suit, photocopied it, returned it and used the copy.
Let no one forget that in this gleaming spot there was a place where I ate a lot. I don't see how you can blame a 97 year old man for retiring. - I thought we were the same age. - So did I. Well, I hope you didn't sell it to a clown.
Suddenly, this sausage-covered locomotive looks like a joke! Take my hand, son. It's strong from using the can opener so much. Was your chili store-bought? I didn't say I paid for it.
We'll do everything we can to find your daughter. Why was Strickland treating her? She has a genetic disorder. Myers-Skelton premature immunosenescence. We're not sure what causes it.
Few things are evil, but most are hungry. Hunger can seem evil depending on which side of the cutlery. Or do you think your bacon sandwich loves you? So what is it and what is it doing on Earth? Well, there were scorch marks on the cement where we found it.
Search the place. You are one stubborn son of a bitch. The catalyst that launched you into hell. Hell can be a little extreme. Well, what would you call it?
How are you doing? Oh, we're winning so far. There was a British agent asking for you. I think he might finally catch up with me. The money's good, Martin, but I don't need it.
We'll go and have a chat with this shepherd. ...be sure of a plentiful harvest, and bless us with good things throughout the coming year. Sergeant! What were you doing with Laxman's sack? I found it under a hedge, near the woods, by the Americans' hut.
What were you doing with Laxman's bag? I found it under a hedge, near the woods, by the Americans' hut. So why didn't you report it at the time? I find all sorts of things in the woods. I didn't know anyone was missing when I picked it up.
I stay calm in a crisis. Eric gave me a ride in his stepfather's car. Don't tell him. He loves his car. He covers it with a blanket and that's how I'll end up if he finds out.
Well, I have one with two heads. Maybe it's not Wesen. What do you mean, it's a real monster? Don't tell me you really believe they exist. Wait, I think I found it.
- Has anyone approached the car? - Not since I arrived. - Do we know which apartment it belongs to? - It's parked in the spot that corresponds to apartment 64. - Stay here, we'll check it out.
- How do you know that name? - Daddy said his name a bunch of times last night. - Why did he do that? - I don't know why. Sometimes he said it really loud like he was mad at him.
Forget about it. Monroe, when you met Rosalee, was it love at first sight? It would be hard to say. No, it wasn't. She didn't know it yet.
Not as long as it helps us. How long have you had that mirror? I've had it forever. It was my mother's. I remember my father brought it to the store for me, so I could play with it while my mother was in the hospital.
Nick! What the fuck was that? "In the morning, happy, I see my enemy lying under the tree." So, you felt the arm go through the mirror in the tent? First I saw it and then I felt it.
And it shattered and all the pieces started to come together. It's not a magic mirror. It belonged to my mother. It's been in my family for as long as I can remember. I think, as long as none of us look at it, we'll probably be okay.
"Human-Reptilian: Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment". Yes, Vle di Bouyi. It smells awful and is really only detrimental to scaled Wesen. Grimms in the south used to use it to lure Galenchidas from swampy marshes and trap them and cut off their heads.
Look at what David is holding. Oh, my goodness. I thought David killed Goliath with a slingshot. He also had a staff, but for some reason, that part of the story was not promoted. Apparently, David left that same staff to his descendants and the Davidic kings used it as a scepter until the destruction of the temple, when it miraculously disappeared.
So how did the Zerstöerer get his hands on it? I just read about that. There's a prophecy about a staff with the power of the gods and it can't be destroyed. Wait for it. Right here, I've got it.
Because after seeing you more closely, Allie preferred her ex. You popped the question, and Allie said no. She was leaving to make amends with Trent Myers, is that right? And then she left the very expensive blue coat back in your hands and said she didn't want it.
What do you want to bet we can match them to your car? That Tesla is filled with DNA, proving that Allie dumped you, then you dumped her AND she kept her keys so she could get into her ex-boyfriend's house, where YOU put the Burberry coat. The Burberry coat that oh! you clearly described then when we found it in your ex's closet, we would arrest Trent and no one would know that Allie King dumped you.
Now, this, uh... this wig, does it belong to you, sir? I mean, what's left of Halloween? I teach sixth grade music at Ramsdell Hall. They don't allow my hair below my collar. Well, then why don't you just cut it off?
I have to hand in my work at midnight, it's 11:30 and I haven't even started. - You haven't started? - I was thinking about how to do it. But every time I tried to write the stupid paper, it became difficult. I didn't want to fail and disappoint everyone. So I procrastinated and sat down to watch cartoons.
I am not the mother of time, never will be. I am a failure. ALEX: You're not a failure yet. Look, the paper is due at midnight, but I probably won't read it until 12:30.
- What the hell is that thing? - BOB: Where are my manners? I'm Bob, head of Intelligence at the NSA's Indigo base. Why is it made of meat? Well, imagine the NSA built a giant cube of nutrient-enriched meat, created a giant human brain, put it inside, wired it up, and used it to monitor every person on Earth.
-Right. -Right. Right, definitely, I can't take that money. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If I were to accept it, would I be compromising my...?
Don Francisco... If you are going to say something, make sure it is not a lie. I don't care about your motives. All I care about is how much it would cost to recover the original will. Assuming that were the case, and it's a lot to assume, why do you think I would have kept it?
Ah. Better that than public scorn, of course. That's nice. Oh, that's nice. Well, well... Look, I have my cousin's phone number here. I'll give it to you.
Okay, let's get to work. Come on, let's go. You really weren't kidding when you said you were doing this for you. No, I wasn't kidding. I've been trying to put someone in this position for this salary for the last ten years and now that I have it... I'm going to make the most of it.
$3,600? That should be enough to pay the three months' rent. - I don't understand. - The clinic has a fund to help in these types of situations. We do it all the time.
- And you know what you are? - I'm awesome. Hey. You want to grab a coffee? I think we've earned it.
- Oh, God! - All this gristle and bone was tangled in my hair, and his skin was all over my skin. I didn't know where the turkey carcass ended and began. Well, if it makes you feel any better, your skin looks amazing. My coffee was destroyed by a giant frog, then I opened it again and it fell into the sinkhole.
- based in Silicone Beach. - But he's not a federal employee. Uh, close to the government with pretty high security Could be why he was murdered His wife gave me the password to his laptop, but there were encrypted files that I need permission from D.C. to open, so I secured the computer and sent it downtown with CyberCrime.
Aren't pay phones a thing of the past? With all due respect, my son misremembers that night. And Danny handing you his cell phone and you walking around the Port Grill pretending to try to make a call. Is that your son's misremembering, too? Danny... told you he gave me his cell phone? But I didn't use it to make a call.
With all due respect, my son misremembers that night. And Danny handing you his cell phone and you walking around the Port Grill pretending to try to make a call. Is that your son's misremembering too? Danny... did he tell you he gave me his cell phone? But he didn't use it to make a call. You used it to look at an application you installed years ago on your son's phone....
You don't know what you're missing. CLUB KITTY CAT That suit was so tight. It's going to be pretty hard to get out of, I imagine, isn't it? Unless you never take it off.
- Northern Virginia. the Muslim dies. If you call the bomb squad, he dies. We have surveillance on the building. If he leaves it, he dies.
- Well, use it. To write things down. Pyke has a plan to catch him, but he hasn't told me what it is. No. I don't want you to let him go.
What are they talking about? The woman who was walking on the overpass. Apparently, she was very lucky she didn't get hit. What about the baby? Did she lose it?
The woman walking on the overpass. Apparently, she was very lucky not to be run over. What about the baby? Did she lose it? - Has it been found?
Look, Margo's here. Remember Lasaro? The creep who did the Margolem? I twisted his arms and/or balls a little, and he gave me the spell. Living clay is hard to find, but Fogg left his stash so unprotected, it looked like he wanted me to steal it.
So I did. Let's make another you. Hi. I made you a sandwich... half an hour ago. Then I ate it.
You guys! You've made a lot of friends, haven't you? I heard you guys were dead. So I threw this massive bash in your honor. The fact that you called it a bash makes me sick.
I am... ill-equipped to be a king. I am no better prepared to teach one. To be an adult is to recognize your responsibilities. A handful of my students went and conquered another world. More like they gave it to us.
He cut his eye! He's not well! - Where did you park the car? - I'm trying to remember, Christ. - Didn't you use it last?
- Only to find out what happened! What happened? I tampered with his penis. Yes, someone else's penis, but that's as bad as the story got. I pulled a man's penis out of his pants and... and looked at it.
Please give me a dream Put a ring on my finger And take this.... All the songs are amazing. This album is going to be a hit. Did Babyface produce it?
Excuse me, miss. - I see that book For Beginners. - You don't know what you're talking about. I saw her take that book. I'm sure you didn't pay for it.
- Doctor, would you be here if you had insurance? On my way out, I'll buy painkillers with a rewards card. I wouldn't know how to get health insurance. Everyone gets it with their job.
Bring the dogs here. They'll kill themselves. - What do you want? - Office space. When do I want it?
When asked the year you were born... - ...you just have to... - Oh, right. You talk too much, as a woman. I don't like the stereotype, but I accept it.
And you're a little under the weather. So it'll be great. Whatever. That monkey. Where did you buy it?
I'm sorry. - Yeah. I'm fine. I almost didn't recognize you without the computer. I left it at home.
I know. He accepted a severance package and signed a confidentiality agreement. That has nothing to do with this. We were all made to sign. If one of us breaches it, it invalidates them all.
You go in with strength like that, and believe me, that woman will be impressed. Okay, Donna. Here goes the show of force. Holy crap, the first Otis Redding album? You sure Harvey won't mind if I bring it out?
Oh, I remember a few days ago, I think it was last Wednesday. Yeah, it was last Wednesday. Will said he felt like this car was following him. He said he'd seen it a couple of times...in Vermont, at school, near here.
I mean... I mean... I'm very, very glad to have a lot of your confidence. And my affection, Lieutenant. Whether you want it or not.
Well, since it's a murder, why don't we ask Chief Howard? You're going to have to think of a new tactic pretty soon, because one of these days, "Let's ask Chief Howard" is just going to be a thing of the past. Well, while we're still in the present.... If Major Crimes insists on special treatment, by all means, they'll get it.
Yeah, let's make sure we have your shoes. This is your helicopter, right? Our helicopter. Danny. Why don't you let me do the talking? He flies it.
If you help Ghost, you'll protect everyone. I'll get you the money. That'll be perfect. And you sure this is clean? Petar turned it over from the security company, so on paper, it looks like a refund.
- Then it looks like you'll have to find your own way out of here. All clear, Freya. This is where you have to do a locator spell? Well, when I first moved to New Orleans, I prepared this place. I marked it with my magic, made it mine.
- We have to find the book, do we know what the title is? It's a long name in Serbian, which according to one forum translates as, "Pozica: never go in your life". An Anton says he has it.
- is to lose a hostage. - I understand - but this witness is different. - We'll try to negotiate. But if we get a clean shot, we will.
Very good. But you will continue to inform me. It was you who delivered the plate of food to Madame de Reynaud. Yes, sir. You took it from the kitchen - and brought it directly to the cell?
Monsieur Marchal informed me that you have been his eyes and ears in the salon. From now on, I wish you to perform these same duties with regard to your husband. If he says or does anything which you consider to be contrary - to my interests, I wish to be informed of it. As for love, if that is what you are looking for, I suggest you look elsewhere.
We sold for $23 million. right-search optimization. That was five years ago. Look, uh, Beth got her number from a private investigator, but, uh... I still don't get it.
Okay. Now I want my money. $5 million. Well, there's a problem. The Millers don't have it.
Well, that narrows it down. Wait. I was near the airport. All right, we'll find it. We'll find him.
Yes, it is. No, I'll... I'll do the procedure. I... I don't know what happened. Prep a drainage tube. Seriously, I thought I had it.
I tried, but nothing worked. It just hurts so much. I know. Gabe... we want to be able to give you a new medicine. And I'm afraid if you don't take it, you may die.
I could only see. I was useless, weak. - And the suit? - I saw it by chance on the net. I don't know why I asked for it.
I was useless, weak. - And the suit? - I saw it by chance on the net. I don't know why I ordered it. But when it arrived, I tried it on, and...
- But leaving the country? No supervision. The bacteria that caused your abscess probably came from the treatment. If it's to get rid of the wheelchair, it's worth it. He touched Nick's abdomen and felt it.
It's for Mr. Kessler, the man who saved your son. They need to operate immediately. But they promised us! We've been waiting for it. Besides, that man would want Dustin to have it.
It wasn't good. And the point of this? The point is that I understand compulsive behavior. You know, it's not rational. You can't explain it.
Mr. President. We don't know who survived...but we have our best agents searching for the Quinjet. Agent Burrows has the package... but we don't know if he was on board. Yes, sir, we do. Let's hope Director Mace has it.
We couldn't have known she'd be ready. What if someone had called ahead? - Guys. - No, you always do this, Phil. I give you the benefit of my experience, and you ignore it.
You put too much faith in them. Man is the ultimate machine. And I... am the ultimate man. I'm told that you refuse to talk and that you accept pain. I love pain too. And I love to make others feel it as it has always been felt.
Please be patient. While we wait, maybe you can tell me why you dislike inhumans so much. Yes, some are monsters, it's true, but.... These Inhumans did not suffer or work to be what they are. They have great power, but they have not earned it.
Oh, my God. Is it possible? What? Talk to me. Radcliffe made a map of another brain. I've seen it. I've seen him do it!
! I specifically said it was mine to examine, to decipher.... You said it would help me find a solution... - to eliminate the Inhuman problem. - I said don't touch it!
Nonsense. Where's the truck? Forget about the truck. This guy has never seen the Terrigen in his life. A Hydra citizen's card. But I know your name isn't really Jason Rajan, so I'm wondering, who did this?
You've never helped anyone, bitch! Give me the Terrigen and I'll show you what a threat is. Has anyone from Hydra done this? Your name is Vijay Nadeer. Don't deny it.
I knew if anyone would understand, it would be you. I would have figured it out a long time ago if it weren't for the mind control soap. Oh, right. Wait. What? That blue soap everyone uses? Hydra loads it with chemicals.
Dad, help me! Dad! Dad! Dad! She's just a kid! Let her go! No! The hangar was a total wreck when we found it.
We're leaving in 10. Sir, the plates have been switched, the transponder is fried. There's no way Hydra can track the bus. Quick work. What about the satellite radio? Well, I realized the bus had a communications system... so I decrypted it and synced it to this.
Do you think I don't know who you are? Where do you come from? You come from that other world, just like them. You're just as sullied. You want to talk about that "other world," as you call it?
The facts will speak for themselves. It's done, Ophelia. I've completed the design. You won't have to live like this much longer. I had my doubts about the project, but I finally see it.
- ...eliminated? - Yes. We've located... the two agents threatening the Framework. They're aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet. Once we have a lock on them... my men have orders to take them down.
It's not your fault, okay? We all lost our way there. And yes, it may take you a while to forgive yourself. But speaking for the whole team... you have nothing to apologize for. If there's a price to pay, we'll pay it together.
Make it look professional. Well, smile like you love me. God, she's so mean. Paul's stuff. We're cleaning out his locker because someone needed it.
Who is this handsome stranger? I feel strangely brought by him. As he is with all attractive strangers. I'd spill gold in his lap if I were sure of his love. He has it.
Is it the powder or did you see a ghost? What crime were you planning to accuse me of? Miss Lacey, perhaps you'd like some tea? I've come to have more than that. You threw me in his hands like a piece of meat and you'll pay for it.
What's the point? That's up to you. Amelia Scanwell, a girl of impeccable virtue, told me that she saw Sir George Howard's lifeless body being carried out of his house. The Scanwell girl is lying, and I'll tell her as much in court. You put his corpse in a carriage and threw it into St. James's Pond.
My car doesn't work. No. Did you call the insurance? I called a friend who knows how to fix cars. He's almost done with work, so he's on his way. - He's already fixed it.
He kicked it as if it were a soccer ball. He stomped on it like a madman. Then he started kicking it towards me. And he said to me, "Beatriz, kill it." I looked at the octopus and touched it.
- So do I. I believe we all have a destiny to manifest. And, if we don't, it hurts the soul. If the brass ring is there, there is a reason. If we don't take it, we regret it eternally.
It's Cal. You have the testimony. - I'll answer inside. - All right. - We just hold it?
Tangled Up in Blue. Blue Oyster Cult. Blue Monday. Nuestro coche era azul. Lo compramos en Craigslist.
We are almost there. Okay, we're here. We're all right. Hello, yes, can you help us? There's real coffee, can you smell it?
Okay. Did you sleep here? Just trying out my new office. Will a bike rack fit on this wall? Put it up and on your first free case, you'll represent yourself after I shove it up your ass.
- Donna told you, didn't she? - Probably. Did she tell you what we're going to do now? She didn't have to because you're Harvey Specter. You've got one trick and you taught it to me years ago, so come on.
Thanks for dinner, Harvey. If you need a session, call the office. Unfortunately, I can't treat you anymore, but I can refer you to someone who can. - Louis, what can I... - Do for me? You could say that when you have a problem with me, you'll fix it with me instead of going behind my back.
I couldn't control myself. There's the street. What if someone sees us? What are we going to do? There's no one, it's dark and there are no security cameras. We put the body in the car, in a bag, and put it in the freezer for you to eat.
What are we going to do? There's no one there, it's dark and there are no security cameras. We put the body in the car, in a bag, and put it in the freezer for you to eat. I'll throw disinfectant on the floor so there are no stains. We don't touch the car, so we leave it there, understood?
And the truth is, it was practically for Mike. And I want to tell him, but... You don't know how he'll react. No, I don't. I haven't even told him yet that I knew Mike's secret before he got caught, let alone used it to make partner.
We made him guarantee to pay you what he promised and hire you at the end of the quarter. - Why would you do that? - Because I don't want you to just schedule that hearing, I want you to crush anyone who wants to stand in my way. Look, it's your call. You take the job, the money and get me in or you stay on the sinking ship and wait for them to find out you were the one who sank it.
I didn't fly all the way out here to force myself on that woman. And I know the story of the wind and the sun. What the hell are you talking about? Aesop's fable. It basically says if you want a man to take off his coat, don't blow it off.
And I know the story of the wind and the sun. What the hell are you talking about? Aesop's fable. It basically says that if you want a man to take off his coat, don't blow it off. Make him feel warm and he'll take it off himself.
To make sure that life and death remain separate. But if he crosses that bridge... He won't! And why not? Because I will destroy him.
Jeff. Jeff! We gotta go. Where's your car? What? You didn't bring the car? Yeah, Matthews, the valet's bringing it in now.
Where's your car? What? You didn't bring the car? Yes, Matthews, the valet's bringing it in now. No, I didn't bring the car. You and Sally Razor left it at the front door.
You do understand me, don't you? So... What do you think of our little club? Why did you bring me here? I thought you'd enjoy it.
Blessed day. I have a nice cut of meat for Major Waterford. Praise his generosity. Blessed the day. I saved it for you.
We've got to get those miners out. I've got a job to do. I need a cell phone. Who let you wear the uniform? I gave it to him.
the joy of doing what you have to give. - Where is Jeremiah? That's a story for another time. Here and now, I want you to keep an eye on your peers and identify their individual potential, and help them discover it. Help them notice it.
You can't hesitate. - When. When we sell it-- - And that will be enough money? We all know he overpaid. GABY: What about the garden? What if it's supposed to be here and we lose it? What if it's supposed to be here and we lose it?
We just wanted to thank you for sheltering us and thank you for your generosity. We will repay you. Thank you. We have all lost. We share that. And grief is hard, but it is important that we process it....
As time went on and freedom came the districts changed and now blacks can have fun in them. Grilling is something that blacks and whites have always done. Grilling used to be something that was done just for fun. Now it's something you can do business with. I found this place and cleaned it up by myself.
Just bacon, eggs, sausage. The basic shit. That's a roast. It's not like making a hangi that takes hours and hours. A rotisserie you turn it on, turn up the heat and you're done in half an hour, so everybody sits down to eat.
The best lechon is in Cebu. They come to Cebu from outside to taste lechon. The best lechon is made in Cebu. I cook with my heart, that's how I do it. When I cook lechon, I cook it with all my heart.
For many it is a welcome. What the asado means is community. We have a community that keeps it alive. What we do is give it as much love as we can. And we... I try to show gratitude to the people who I learned it from and who they learned it from.
Make an appointment with him. Then I'll know if I have an enemy. Your locker, Mr. Rhoades. Thank you, Domingo. Some people, when they age a cigar, keep it at 70 percent humidity.
Aluminum. Or at least it tastes like it. Fear, in my throat. Most people try to stay away from fear, try to get rid of it whenever they get the chance. I cultivate it.
- The zoo. - Wildlife conservation. I think so. Anyway, tell them I accept, and include a large donation. All I ask is your word that Jack Foley will be named their man of the year and that I'll be the one to present him with the damn award. A package came for you, I put it on your desk.
It's within my reach. But I'm short on cash. And your warranty period is running out? You said you wanted to do something for me. Now I need it.
The last time I did it, he fired me. Do you want me to check it? Would you? It's not that I don't know how to calculate but, if I'm going to put my neck on the line I want to make sure I'm not wrong. Send the report, I'll review it.
It could be fun if you find a way to screw it up. Yeah, a lot of fun. I'll be sure to take a lot of resources. Would you have a front? Yes, I take the money up front I return it and get over any remaining transactions.
- Mr. Mulligan. Five shillings for two inches? That's armed robbery. Honestly, I don't know why you buy space on that piece of paper. Nobody reads it.
They will have to wait a little longer, just as I have to wait for a stipend from New York to pay them. - We can't wait! - Don't use that tone! - Gentlemen, please. - We will block the road with our wagons, we will block it.
Well, he doesn't know, sir. He knows that Caleb is a friend of mine, that he's my right-hand man and that I handle the spies, but he doesn't know anything about Culper senior or junior, Brewster does. Brewster does. He would never rat out the circle, sir. He has already destroyed it.
Lady Washington. Ingenious, don't you think? That dreadful winter at Valley Forge, my husband had to make do with only a spoon. But with this, he would have had a full set of silverware. Why don't you take it with you?
Fuck me. Are you all right? I feel like shit, and I just want coffee, but I can't even do that. No, it's okay. You need it more than I do.
That's why my mother sold my horse. - Oh, yeah. - Write it down. What? No, your dad sold it to keep the IRS away.
- I'm going to a cell phone store. We won't watch the camel races. I hear Hamlool is the next Al Misk. And the day after daylight saving time one gets out of control. One day, mom brought me breakfast an hour late for idiot and I threw it on the floor saying:
We won't see the camel races. I hear Hamlool is the next Al Misk. And the day after daylight saving time one gets out of control. One day, Mom brought me breakfast an hour late for an idiot and I threw it on the floor saying, "Mom, if I wanted to eat this, I would have done it by now."
- Now I'm going to dance next to mommy. Sure, love. Everybody eat. Danny, I've been calling you all night. It's Dan and I don't have a phone because today's guest dropped him off the ferry acting like Melanie Griffith in "Working Girl".
- Right. Really? Well, now he's controlling you. He knocks out your teeth and makes love to your face. They don't know my diary is the source. They've already scanned it.
I'm about to go viral. The ball! Did you record it? No, I don't have my phone! I left it in the car!
Of course. Come on. Oh, man. It's not my phone. I found it in these pants, so...
Citizens of Charm City, say goodbye to your precious organic juice bar! "You don't need to have superpowers to accomplish great things. Love, Dad." He gave it to me when I was little. - I always carry it with me.
Love, Dad. He gave it to me when I was little. - I always carry it with me. - It's so sweet. And now you're smelling it like a stranger.
Can I choose the color? It's seven o'clock in the morning. What am I doing here? Van, this device we created just alerted me that Jack-O-Lantern is in the area, giving us enough time to get to safety. It uses advanced chemoreceptors to detect Jack-O-Lantern's unique scent profile. We call it the "Jack-A-Alert."
show her. Mm-hmm. I know they're in Chicago... Just have a little faith. So, we figure they're using a paper map, they're probably touching it.
I am assisting Detective Babineaux with a murder investigation. An anonymous witness sent me via Snapchat pictures he took of the possible suspects. As soon as I opened the images, they disappeared. You could have saved us both a lot of time if you had taken screenshots. When I want your advice, I'll beat it out of you.
The mother who bore her. [What do you want us to do? I want my money. Go get it. [man] What if he doesn't have it?
To make a person believe that he was out of the country. - Who is this person? - What difference does it make? I want to know if you're in danger, Alba. I owe money. And if I don't pay it back, I'll go to jail or worse.
With all due respect, Mr. Uhtred. You still haven't explained why you crossed the street to Daneland. I never remember your name. I am Aldhelm, I am the commander of Lord Aethelred's guard. Would you like me to write it down for you?
Look, I've read the report. I know you and James Hicks got into an argument and you shot him. But, please. Tell me some off-the-record details, won't you? Why do you think he did it?
You know what? After watching that piece of crap, I don't want Barbara to be a part of Hollywood. Yeah. You know, she could be a big shot, like a real estate agent. All right, I sewed it on with a rubber band and a fisherman's knot right there.
Bobby, don't ruin the suit. We can't afford it. Oh, my God, this is awful. Can I see the ring again? I've licked it and it's not candy.
See what they're wearing? - Metal? - Metal. They pick it up and trade it for food. Then, Nos passes it through the tunnels to the Badlands to the black market.
You can dress a little weird, but that's impossible. Oh, like the headless man? And hell, like John Wilkes Booth? Jake's right. I took a little piece of his jacket and sent it to the carbon-14 lab for dating.
So, did Banneker work with the founders after all? A story for another day. We don't have time. You think J Street is a cul-de-sac, if we lure the Horseman in, we can use Banneker's disc to block his exit. But you said it was enchanted, how do we open it?
Well, well, well. You're full of surprises. Where did you get this book? You can trust me. Father. He gave it to me before he disappeared.
- It's kind of homey. - If your home is hell. Look, Bob, don't patronize me. I know this place is a dump. Not as clean as you know who would keep it.
Stay out of sight. I was a fool. I realize now that... all that is gained can just as easily be lost. The book is safe, Professor. We'll go back and get it as soon as we get out of this.
No, no. I understand. Believe me, I do. Running this country is the hardest job there is. The problem is, with everything that has come your way, you're not running it.
But then I realized it had to be at the FBI. I had to get to the director himself, so I went straight to Alexandria. And I was almost there... when I lost control of my car. Yes. It got hacked somehow.
Impressive resume for someone your age. Come on in. And... if I bring you more of that Kona specialty coffee you like so much, will you tell me the real reason you gave it up? I might. I'll think about it.
Well, now he's reaching out. I want to remind you, this bill is not about taking guns away from people. It's about making sure they don't fall into the wrong hands in the first place. The initial social media response to the bill is mixed. Well, they don't call it a third rail for nothing.
...I'll go see Mrs. Kirkman now. - All right, thank you. - Speaking of numbers, Sir, we need to get 51 Senate votes in two days, which is not going to be easy. The language of the bill is not ideal, as you know. That's why Senator Bowman chose it.
That's fantastic. I'm sorry it had to be this way, Tom. I wish I could have said yes, when you asked me, but, anyway, I wanted you to hear it from me. You can count on my vote. I really appreciate it, Walter.
The tail number was obscured. And there's no FAA air traffic control in the area. It's like flying in a vacuum. Did we get the munitions, at least? Yeah, the task force was on the ground two hours after Hannah called it in.
Hey, Dan. Shore. Nice work, man. Give me a break. I called you about a comment. Yeah, and you buried it under four charts of innuendo.
This was a fair deal. Every person in this room has something to crow about. I'm not going to let you hijack that, sir. And if you're willing to play politics with people's lives, trust me...I'm more than willing to walk down that hallway to my press room and embarrass you in front of everyone for trying to hijack our judicial system when we need it most.
You hadn't even noticed. It looks the same on you. You always look great. What's... What? I had it done for the trip.
I burned my best cartridge today before the committee. What makes you think I'll do any better before the House? That it will give us time to organize a campaign. We'll profile you in the national media. We'll spread it as far as we can... until public opinion swings the vote in your favor.
Mr. President. You have a considerable problem, sir. What's up? Abe Leonard is going to run a story that says FBI Deputy Director Jason Atwood was detained in the Oval Office for the murder of Majid Nassar. He says the White House covered it up.
Thank you. Ready for tonight? Happy with your speech? I'd better be. I wrote it myself this time.
Don't apologize. You are a welcome sight. I know it's been a long time since we were sent to the continental side. And I was telling you that your position is filled. And now you have it back.
I need to 3D print some spare parts for the new equipment before they send me somewhere else. I hope it's a nice place like Cleveland. Are you sure Blair has no idea that Linus has it? Positive. If Linus is half as smart as I think he is, he found a way to keep it.
Question: What are we talking about? There it is. I lent Linus my smartwatch. He still has it.
I thought you guys were in trouble. It's like a country club! We're being moved, not tortured. Okay, well, Blair plans to continue the program. I told her I wouldn't do it without you guys.
Well, I'm not sure what you did. I'm not sure if I want to know, but well done. All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places. Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion. Well, just because I was offered Blair's job doesn't mean I want it.
I think the break has been good for you. I'm not taking a break. Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend shot you, then tried to give you a lethal injection. I think you're entitled to a couple of sick days. You've been working on that leopard tattoo for two weeks... Maybe Sandstorm removed it from Jane's body because it's bullshit.
The one who built the wings for Icarus, right? Stop looking at me like that when I know things. Smug college kids and lithium. Doesn't make sense. Maybe they're mixing it with Jäger to make shots?
A piece of paper that cost me billions of dollars, okay? Are you happy now, Mom and Dad? - Why don't you take that piece of paper... - Rich! Rich! roll it up and shove it down your...
Yes. What happened to the fuel you promised? The fuel's there, as much as you want. The silo, right? Maybe the vampires opened it?
Are you serious? Look at his belt. It's the winning ticket. It opens any door in this place. That's great, but how will you get it?
Thank you. Thank you. It's hard to concentrate when he's watching me. Did you find anything? There's a shipment leaving today a few miles from here. I want to see it with my own eyes.
You want to know why my marriage ended, Jack? Yeah. Okay. Since forever, I've been getting up every day at 6:30 to make Shelly coffee, with a little milk and two sugars. I'd make it for her and take it to bed.
Honey, our precious children need a precious dog. All right. - Get them a dog. - Oh, that's perfect. And then get them a new mommy to walk it.
So... thank you. For being a jerk. I needed it. Like I told you, your voice bothered my horses. That's why I took it.
"From the team." And for all of this, Tyler, I thank you. You see, for days, I've been nagged by this question, "How do I honor my father's legacy?" And I've realized that I honor it by taking what I've learned from how he lived his life and having it determine how I live mine.
Fresh chicken meat that you could go and choose. - They would kill the chicken... - What? They'd pluck it, clean it, - and then they'd wrap it up for you.
Well, he believes he is mentally ill, but at the same time, part of him knows the power is real. And are we clear on the extent and nature of this power? No, but if the readings are correct, he may be the most powerful mutant we've ever encountered. After what happened in Red Hook, I think that's an understatement. So, he has the power, but he doesn't understand it or know how to control it.
And are we clear on the scope and nature of this power? No, but if the readings are correct, he may be the most powerful mutant we've ever encountered. After what happened in Red Hook, I think that's an understatement. So, he has the power, but he doesn't understand it or know how to control it. I'd like to dig deeper, see if we can figure out what triggers it.
We may never have the opportunity again. That would be a mistake. We've never had a guy like this before. I need to... Just give me the rest of the day and you'll have the gas if you need it.
Dev, how was the fast today? I didn't eat anything from sunrise to sunset, so I'd say it was good. Must be hard to fast with those tasty cupcakes at work. Did you know that Hakeem Olajuwon fasted during the NBA Finals? - Fun fact, Navid? - I already knew that.
I understand that for you religion has a cultural value. But not for me. They call me a terrorist, they pull me aside in airport lines. Because you lost your passport three times! I lost it twice.
For God's sake, I'm pissing myself. Tie her up. What happened in there? Since when is it my job to do yours? If you leave the report on my desk, Sergeant Flynn, I assure you I'll look at it.
The map also shows the location of Hana Reznikova's abduction. It looks like her man wasn't in the right place at the right time. Just because the phone was there doesn't mean Farmer was. And there are no witnesses to Farmer loitering near his grandmother's residence for an hour and forty-five. Did he leave it there all that time?
Agreed. The search of the apartment failed to find neither the cell phone nor the laptop. So we assume the killer stole the cell phone and the laptop. No trace of the cell phone? The last recorded location was from Tim's apartment, so whoever took it was smart enough to turn it off.
I ordered you a pint of that cat piss that you youngsters seem to like so much. - This whiskey is probably older than I am. - Yeah. And that's the best of it. No, I just thought this would be a... better way to talk about your ambitions. I know if I put myself in your shoes, you'll see the bitter end, no matter what.
- Amen. We never got married. She wanted to, especially when you were born. She took my last name. She wanted you to have it but I always thought it was some kind of bad omen.
How many times must I tell you not to call me that? Nunez disappeared. Only Rita and I are still here and she called in sick. So did Warren and Franks. So, I guess the job is yours if you want it.
Too much. I live and work here. Just as I remember it, dusty and crowded. Not as charming as your old bus, but it works. Hey, don't reject what you don't know.
"Then the tiniest mouse came out of hiding and stood in front of the others. I will free Princess Rodent from the cat's dungeon." It's boring. - I want the dinosaur book. - Sweetie, we don't have it here.
The one this morning? No. No, another one. I've been trying to produce it for years. No one understands it and no one wants to pay.
Look, it's going to be all right, Gabby. I mean, DCFS will find this man to be a mere riot. Oh, what the hell? Who took the top hat? Why would anyone take it?
- I'm fine. - Take a break, Gabby. Yeah. Did something happen that I should know about? We'll fix it so it's good as new, Chief.
- Good morning, Chief. Tell me again, when is the meeting room door going to be fixed? Oh, yeah, uh, Capp was supposed to get - the new piece of glass, but.... - But it's silly for Capp to pay for the glass when Otis broke it.
Perfect. I'll take my desk with me. That's what I thought. Obviously a small desk. One that can fold up. That way I'd have it while I make the world safe for democracy.
Cancer. He tried everything. Chemo, radiation, operations. You know what they do with a tumor when they cut it out? They put it in a bag and burn it.
...you may be tempted to do the same. We will also steal these. Let me give you some advice, even though I don't know you at all. Don't steal a sailboat that doesn't belong to you. We're just borrowing it.
I'm the boss. What was I saying? Yes. There's a reason this town will never forget its fathers. They're the ones who burned it down.
- No. No, I don't need a third eye to be able to see that this is all a mistake. Mr. Cole, the window is closing. I will transport you to the Emerson Hotel, 2007. You will devise a plan and execute it.
Now, hold on. I'd love for you to blow her brains all over the wall, but she knows something. Something real. Cole, Cole, there's a map. A map of the Red Forest and everything. We can use it.
I happened to be writing about the future in the past tense. #PrimaryProblems What's your point, Ms. Goines? The Witness also kept a diary. I saw it with my own eyes at the Monkey mansion.
This led us to Titan. Ramse ripped that from a document in Berlin. They've been chasing the Monkeys for years, but this Word is their chance to get ahead of them. We'd have to go back to Berlin. But if we go back and steal it, we'll never have the piece to locate Titan to begin with.
Cedar and pine house? 1957. Us? That's how Olivia knew. It's all in that document. - If anyone else sees it...
When was the last time you slept? I'm not sure. What time is it? My watch isn't here. Do you see it?
Well? I own this place now. It took me forever to find it. It's complete bullshit. Why do you want it?
It's a lovely invitation, but I think I'd prefer one of the other men who will be coming this way. I don't know about that. I think you're quite handsome. So what happened to your wedding ring? Did you lose it?
I feel a strange sort of resemblance to you, Enrique, so I know you're not the type to give up so easily. I haven't given up. I'm just waiting for the right moment. And what is that moment? I'll know it when I see it.
I have not seen him. The king put him under arrest. The privy council meeting is tomorrow morning. Did you find the missing money? Darnley spent it.
I was told that the ambassador from the English court was waiting in the throne room, insisting on speaking to the king. They were also at arms drawn, but Henry took charge. He used the situation to his own advantage. His speech was very exciting, something about the English being pigs and how France would never grovel again. Our French nobles were cheering for him, but the ambassador, well, he didn't take it very well.
If Darnley is no longer motivated to share your power, he will try to take it. He is a threat to your throne and to your life, Mary. You need to get rid of him. I'm not ready to talk about killing a king... or having my son without a father. There must be another way, and I will find it, as long as I have you by my side.
Are you ok? Yes. I'm sorry about that. That took forever. Were you having sex with Sting, or...? It's the brain I ate. Ravi dipped it in a blue liquid, part of his memory research.
Scalpel, please. DID THE ABOPHETATOR KILL HER? That's the woman I told you about. About 9:30 p.m. she came in and... Did anyone recognize her? And believe me, everyone saw it.
He had a crush on Yvonne, but she put him in the friend zone. He wanted her money, but he didn't want you. He didn't even take the money. Why not? I don't know, he said he didn't need it.
So... - I'm not... - Be sure to include whether or not the dryer was already plugged in when you got there. why? If it was already plugged in, it's murder. If he plugged it in, it's murder.
Maybe you can make him understand the seriousness of the situation. - Okay, I'll take care of it. - You know where his bar is, right? - Yeah, I know where it is. Probably closed it a few times back in the day, right?
Then play at home. I can't play at home. My dad has antique frames, trophies and stuff. Is that a real mustache? No, I glued it on to give me more authority in situations like this.
I know this is probably confusing for you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Don't even think about it. What are you doing? You need money? Winslow's mother owns this place, but his stepfather runs it.
Thanks, Dad Brain. You find anything on those old Chuck Burd shows? Not yet, no. Well, get back to work. There's a shiny five dollar bill waiting for you if you do.
Shall we get started? While you're waiting, have you heard the story of the poor woodcutter and his wife? I don't think so. One day, a poor woodcutter and his wife found a crane caught in a trap. They felt bad for the bird and released it.
Died? He built this place with Cary 30 years ago. Before the Divisions. Before anyone knew how fast the world would change. They built it and went out looking for people like you to fill it.
I'll give you what your boss wants. Or you can continue to torture me, but you wouldn't be ahead. In this game, you're only as good as your strongest asset. I can be that asset. My superiors didn't approve that deal coming from the Brigadefuhrer, why would they approve it coming from me?
Survival. You have tried to keep this bunker for yourself, yet here I am, ready to talk. The Trikru alliance protects the temple. Of course you're going to talk. And the Azgeda alliance surrounds it.
I'm not giving up. Thanks for understanding. Where's Monty? Unloading the SUV. By the way, we're leaving it behind for you.
You don't have to kill all 12 warriors. I just have to kill the last one. Octavia kom Skaikru is victorious. Skaikru will not take the bunker alone. We will share it.
The water is cold enough. Your pulse is already dangerously low. Tell me again how you are going to decrease the electric current to revive your heart once it stops. A wire attached to a timer that will shut off 15 minutes after it dies. I rigged it to send exactly the same charge as the defibrillator in the rocket's emergency medical kit.
one champion per clan, one death instead of thousands. Then, whoever wins, gets the bunker. I was fighting for all of us. Skaikru will not take the bunker alone. We will share it.
Breathing is important too, what's the plan for oxygen? Based on what Murphy said about the lighthouse bunker, I guess? Let's pray... there's an oxygenator in there. We'll take it with us.
What is the plan for oxygen? Based on what Murphy said about the lighthouse bunker, I guess? Let's pray... there's an oxygenator in there. We'll take it. You hook it up.
Let's go. 51 minutes to go and counting. Put it down. I've got it. Go get your gloves. I can't find my other glove. I can't find it!
No, actually, it's a different scary picture. I was running tests on the synchronizer chip that they recovered from the Arkani factory, and it's far more impressive than anything we've seen from the BNM or any extremist group for that matter. In fact, it's as good as anything the U.S. can do because..... - Good grief... - More specifically, the Defense contractor, Blackthorn Kincaid, did it.
In fact, it's as good as anything the U.S. can do because.... - Good grief... - More specifically, the Defense contractor, Blackthorn Kincaid, did it. Well, they make everything from our intercontinental ballistic missiles to Israel's Iron Dome. And how did Arkani get it?
Well, that won't happen. Everyone here has dedicated their lives to protecting the American people. Tell us about the timing chip. It was manufactured in the last four months as part of a surface-to-air missile remote control system. Can you tell us who manufactured it?
The attackers all wore ski masks. We have a proprietary mapping program that can recognize enough facial contours through a tissue mask. - Amazing. - Another trade secret. Tell your leader I'll add it to my account.
Bring it back. Now. Agent Ressler, no word from Agent Navabi. - Do you have the system? - Yes, we have it right here.
Ressler, move your team now. Hands in the air! Hands where I can see them. Get him down! I'm not in control.
Sir, sir. What's wrong? Sir, there's a... problem. I'm very sorry about that. I would have told you before, but...
"And they'd give you chopsticks to stick the food in and then stick it in the chocolate so you could then put it in your mouth." "And then you'd yell, 'Another drink! ', And they'd bring you another drink, and it would drip and end up in your belly button. And you'd hit yourself." "And you'd put it in your mouth."
"Is there anything I need to know?". And the woman just sat there... "Well..." "Well..."... The kitten... got hit by a car... and died." And the gorilla understood immediately.
And he said, "That was very sad." "Very beautiful, but very sad." And I said, "Get off." "Get off." And I closed my laptop, leaned it on the bedside table, got up, and I paced around.
We got to the house, and she checked it out, because she's smart. She notices which rooms the sun shines in and all that. I, like the idiot that I am, went to the garage. For some reason, I was attracted to it. I went, opened the door, and saw that the other owners hadn't cleaned it.
Three hours later, I had cuts on my arms, dust, sweat, cobwebs.... I wanted to set the fucking house on fire. I wanted to go to hell. But, out of nowhere, my wife appeared with a huge smile, and she had made me a sandwich. She'd cut it diagonally. That's love, isn't it?
I wanted to set the fucking house on fire. I wanted to go to hell. But, out of nowhere, my wife appeared with a huge smile, and she had made me a sandwich. She had cut it diagonally. That's love, isn't it? If they don't cut it, they throw it at you like a frisbee.
"Here you go, you piece of shit." "Wash yourself with a hose! You should live here! You should live here," right? But he cut it diagonally, put Doritos on it, and brought me an ice-cold beer.
It comes back to me all of a sudden. Sometimes I'll be in the car and I'll say to myself, 'Remember when he made you that sandwich? It was amazing! "He cut it up, put Doritos on it and gave me an ice-cold beer - I felt like a king!".
I would like to ask you a favor. Wait there. Here you go. I'll be honest with you, Father, I don't trust myself with this. I'll put it somewhere safe.
Maybe I should go see her...and show her that she's not smart enough...to outwit the great Father Brown. Did you ever hear the tale of the eagle and the jackdaw? I can't say I have. A jackdaw sees an eagle swoop down on a little lamb, lifting it up to eat. The jackdaw, believing itself equally powerful, flies over, landing on the back of another lamb... grabs it with its talons and flaps its wings with all its might.
- Yes. - Yes, how did it go? I can't say. What do you mean? - I'm sure you nailed it.
Who would say such a thing? - A local guy described someone. I thought maybe it was him. - It wasn't. If Eddie had gone to Peru, he'd know.
Put it on the table. Where are we going to find Roman? I'm using Patterson's system to automatically dial Roman's cell phone every fifteen seconds. - But he's not picking up. - But we're tracking him?
That's just... what every girl wants to hear while being tied to a table with wire. Chris lived to help others. He improved the quality of life all over the world. He helped build the hospital where he died. And it only lasted a month before an unauthorized U.S. bombing turned it to ash.
Wait a minute, where was that book found? In Borden's apartment. Can you zoom in? That book is book one of Livy's "Ab Urbe Condita." Jane said she saw it in Shepherd's office.
Which... which dress? You know, this one. I... I don't know. You don't know? Because you've never seen me wear it?
- I'm looking for. Oh, okay, maybe this. Okay, "Locate the defendant using his..." Yeah, no, I still need the number. - Okay, I found it!
Well, a neighbor called 911 and the fire department broke down the door. Listen, they saved your life. Damn razor wire. I had pulled most of it out and then I fell off the ladder on top of the whole pile. You were pulling it out?
I'm sure there's more to it than that. Well, it's not right what Bailey did. You can't put just anyone as chief of general surgery. Keps is good, but Grey worked hard for that position, okay? She deserves it.
I know you feel responsible. Because I am. There was no way to know you broke that glass. Dr. Robbins didn't see it. Dr. Minnick didn't see it.
The vessel is prepared for anastomosis. The bag is ready for implantation. Time starts. Stop! Have you attached it?
So what would you do? Look, if we could wake up the mother and ask her what she wants... We can't. She'd need to be awake long enough to be competent. The kidney wouldn't hold out until then. I know, but if we could, I'd say give it to her son.
You haven't been demoted. From Chief of General Surgery to Trauma Attending? - Sounds like it. - April, April. A title is only as good as the person who earned it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. You're what? I'm the foundation's representative on the board, right? a position that you gave me, that you made me accept. Yeah and you kicked and screamed and whined every step of the way. And then I accepted it.
Jackson, stop! Stop! You keep saying, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery," but you're not, not the way you're trying to be. A title doesn't mean anything. It's the person who holds it.
Well, not yet. So when? Our surgery is tomorrow. Later. I can have the surgery and then I can tell him and I can tell him that I had cancer and not that I have it.
I understand why he's mad at you. That was much worse than what I did. How could it be worse? You took his job. And you put your mouth on the person who took it.
I'm going to give you too what I never got. I'm gonna get from you what I couldn't give to my children. I'm gonna get you everything you couldn't give your first dead child. My baby is not a thing for you to correct all your failures before. This child, it will be good, it will be pure, and I will not expose it to your darkness.
The Rindells have $13.8 million in cash and come from an initial investment of $8 billion. They never invested a dime? Not after 2008. The real estate bubble. There was a deficit and they made up for it with money from new investors.
No. - All right, what is the crime? - An attack on the power grid. Cyberterrorism. And how does your client know that?
The client has asked the lawyer not to tell. And who is this lawyer? Why? I'm just trying to get as much information as possible. Look, if we don't want to close the deal, let's not do it.
Well, it's... 555-0193. Oh, that's great. Thank you. Do you have a pen? I need a pen. I just met the man I'm going to marry and I need to write down his number before I forget it.
I just met the man I'm going to marry and I need to write down his number before I forget it. But that's permanent marker. Hey! You're destroying my property! Oh, please, it's just a piece of an old canoe. You wrote my number on a canoe from the restaurant so you wouldn't forget it?
- We don't... - No, I want to hear what you said. - What did you say? - It wasn't us. You said to leave it in my account and ask for a loan.
We are family. I don't know if he's lying or not. About the cancer? No, about the background. Do you think your father did it?
You can check them. That's not necessary. If you say they're fair, they're fair. Okay. I thought we'd have it at Elk's lodge?
How come we didn't know about Cujo y Cia? Well, the Norteguayans must let the dogs roam the perimeter freely. Veronica and Paige never saw them. And isn't the barking a problem? The press noise will cover it up.
That won't cause enough movement to bring it down. Not an option. The door is smashed into the floor. There's no way out. Then we need to open an escape route. No, the vibrations will shake him and he'll fall.
Let's sit you down. The ambulance is on its way. This is not environmentally friendly. There go the chemicals. Permeability in this type of geology is less than 30 minutes before they reach the aquifer and contaminate it.
You have Lucca's office. I don't want to lose Lucca. She has to feel that we need her. See, that's the problem with power. You have to take it from someone to give it to someone else.
The laboratories recognize that they transferred an egg to you. And why do they want the egg? The owner wants it for fertilization. Unfortunately, that's the problem... Has it already been destroyed?
And why do they want the egg? The owner wants it to fertilize it. Unfortunately, that's the problem... Have you already destroyed it? No, we have already fertilized it.
The problem, Laura, is that the remaining egg has already been fertilized. - By whom? - That is the question. We don't know. We've located it at Chicago Polytechnic and we're going to sue them.
And that's why you screw us. Under English law, the sale of those eggs is invalid. What difference does it make, your honor? You have already ruled on the ownership of the embryo. For the purpose of being taken to England for processing, which they are now prohibited from doing.
Here we have. There's a newspaper article about one of Reddick and Boseman's lawyers. She has spent 350,000 on jewelry. Where did that money come from? Who gave it to her?
Basically, some people are better at doing things than others. That's what the program shows you. Number seven is number seven. If you call it number eight, you won't actually make it number eight, you'll just embarrass yourself.
If you call it number eight, you won't actually make it number eight, you'll just embarrass yourself. Likewise, men are better inventors than women. That's a fact. Well, that makes the GJSs worry. They think there's a mistake in the fact and they want to change it.
And you are always welcome. I'll see you in court. Both courts. We'll see which one finishes first. Putting something on top of the pile is a good way for me to put it underneath.
What did Mike Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony? He said he would recommend to the judge a ten-year sentence instead of life without parole. No further questions. I had no idea about the deal. No, I did not authorize it.
And you're the new management. Is that it? Really? Yes, I'm taking over my firm again. You've run it into the ground, and we can't afford to go nowhere today.
- You don't look well. It's time for you to rest. Wake up Snow and get some sleep. I said I'm fine! If I wanted advice I wouldn't ask a pirate for it.
- Knock-knock. I almost forgot. Kimberly, Richard wants to get married with his grandmother's ring... I don't have it. No, his grandmother has it.
I think he and Ash had some kind of shady deal. He's the real criminal. But if Ash had this big divorce settlement, then why was he sleeping on a couch? Where did the money go? Maybe the mediator took it?
What is this? Well, where do I start? Missing memorial scissors. Looks like we found our huge knife. Or I didn't find it, but, you know.
This. I didn't think this was possible. It wasn't part of the plan. So, maybe... maybe we make a new plan. This time, we do it together.
The thing is, despite all that, she went out of her way to help him. Yes, she's right. The doctor has seen a part of me that I was hiding because she's, well, terrifying. But she accepted me nonetheless, and has helped me overcome problems I thought insurmountable. I appreciate the testimonial, and will include it in the notes.
Do you think our two sweet legal cleaners are into something not so legal? Hey, bro. I noticed you've changed your appearance. Where's your pretty necklace? I put it in a safe place. Ah. (Chuckles)
Right. The place has already been taken. While you were eating that sandwich? I can do several things. May I ask who took it?
- Stop it. - It's true. Think about what you said about my report. I didn't know it was you. You were the only one who read it and hated it.
- Time to go. - It's really good to see you. Same here, man. Big hug? We'll save it for after the flight, okay?
- Hi. Hi. I'm sorry for stealing your car, man. - No worries. We found it.
Seriously, how many more times do you think this woman is going to let me off the hook? And now, what happened? I'll tell you. I've let her down. Then I'd appreciate it if you'd... light the match and throw it on me.
I thought they were going to tell me to vote against the upcoming referendum. Okay, so if that's why she went to the cafe, then everything Matty told us, all the CIA information was wrong. Okay. I've seen the pictures, I want to believe you, but you have to go back and explain everything exactly how it happened. A waiter...he gave me the phone, and there was a man on the phone, and he told me, take the bag from the planter, take it down the street and when he saw somebody following me,
Okay, so if that's why she went to the cafe, then everything Matty told us, all the CIA information was wrong. Okay. I've seen the pictures, I want to believe you, but you have to go back and explain everything exactly how it happened. A waiter...he gave me the phone, and there was a man on the phone, and he told me, take the planter's bag, take it down the street and when he saw somebody following me, drop it and run.
- I know how to clear our names. - Yeah, something like that. At the cafe, I was camouflaging our wireless communications and camera signals as normal cellular traffic routed through the local Dutch telecom towers. Well, now you're just using difficult words that no one else understands, like he does. That video we lost... he was routing it through local cell towers.
I think they're here to steal something. What kind of a building is this? PHOENIX FOUNDATION According to my sources, that building is a front. The Department of Defense calls it Facility H9.
It's protocol, okay? Calm down! Well, I'd like to know what it is. I can't remember. I'm trying to remember the protocol and if you stop asking me questions, I might remember.
- Well? - I know. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I thought I had O.R. three booked for my colectomy this afternoon. I did, but I have a valvuloplasty, and I wanted O.R. three, so I took it.
Okay, at least you have to hydrate. Are you staying here? Let me take care of that. - Did you get the proximal end? - Yeah, I got it.
It has taught me how to... How to forget the past and find my way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think I've found it.
I knew for weeks that I wanted to hurt him. Then one day after practice... He smiled at me. And then what happened? I hit him. I took his arm, put it behind his back, and broke it.
From the fridge to the trash. I'm having a great day today. There's even an awards ceremony at the Embassy Suites. The trophy is a crystal palm tree. We'll attach it to a necklace so you can wear it when the relatives come over.
All right, are you shitting yourself? - No. Er, yes. Dad wanted me to do it.
All of it. The wake. Porchetta Ariccia. The specialty of a small town north of Rome. You take a piglet, intestines, and debone it.
The wake. Porchetta Ariccia. The specialty of a small town north of Rome. You take a piglet, intestines, and debone it. Stuff it with garlic, rosemary and fennel, roast it slowly over a wood fire.
I never understood what made Gina truly happy. But the Penrose played a role in it. Well, she has it all now. Maybe she got what she deserved but will she get what she justly deserved? All this time and I owned it.
Frank, Frank. Hold on a second, man. Hey, look... the parking guys are looking for you. They still can't find your car. Yeah, but they were supposed to have checked it yesterday.
Hey, look... the parking people are looking for you. They still can't find your car. Yeah, but they were supposed to have checked it yesterday. All right, I'm just telling you what I heard. Yeah, well, they're gonna have to wait, 'cause I left it at home.
But the baker's son won't want to throw me in the mud when he sees me with her. - Bae, listen to yourself. - I shouldn't have asked you to give up your power. Now I understand how hard it is. But we need it.
- Is that so? - No, we don't have a piracy problem. Our port in the Gulf has a piracy problem. It's a loyalty issue. I suggest you take care of it personally.
You should save up like me. For what? I'll own a Dairy Queen franchise in South Florida - it's sunny there every day! I'll go to my store, get an ice cream, and then eat it on the beach.
It's like Chewbacca's mask can't allow you to read. Something tells me you and I have very different definitions of "creepy." Come on. Check it out. This guy I follow posted it an hour ago.
I think I know how it has been spreading. My date was telling me about this video he saw, before he got sick. It was posted by someone named Logan MacDonald. I think someone hacked into his account and put the pamphlet curse in the source code of the video. Which means that anyone who saw it could be infected by this flu that burned Washington.
Oh, my goodness. That's the suit I made. It's lined with vermiculite, see? That's the material the specialists use. I sewed it myself.
It's so cool. I don't know what I'm supposed to... This goes around the... No, no. No, you squeeze it, and you actually put it through the... and you're... open to the public.
Crane! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, I'll walk you through the Banneker mechanism. Okay, I think I've got it.
- Fuck. We're in this together for better or worse. Right. We came to town to get this talisman. If Dreyfuss took it, and Crane, we could...
Do you think it's over? Was that the last we heard from Dreyfuss? I'd like to believe it... but evil has a way of rearing its head in the least expected ways. But if it should... We'll face it together.
No, it's not. He has a problem with that. Just keep going. There's a whole world out there. Yeah, I've seen it.
One had a gun. They forced me into the hallway and started shouting, "Where's the money?" Nobody noticed. What money? They said they had given Adam half a million dollars and wanted it back.
Half a million. Was that true? If it was, I never heard of it. But they didn't believe me. They just kept hitting me and yelling, what if I had it, or Owlsly had it.
Okay, I got it. I've already cut the video feed. It's a... It's a British tradition, sir. Flight, I had radio contact for a second and then I lost it again.
We will be at Ray's launch position in 18 minutes. We have only one chance to intercept before the moon's gravity pulls us back to earth. Henry. You need to understand how time travel works. My grandfather understands it well.
How rude! Well done, ladies. Star City owes you a debt of gratitude. Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor. Yes, but you do it very well and with a lot of... style.
No, I don't want to do that. Dad is still paying off his... loans from medical school. Until I was in high school. I'm gonna be in debt for the rest of my life. I'm so sorry, honey. You know if we had the money, we'd give it to you.
I think you're right, and... But... also, you have to own what you do, though. Because at some point you can become who you are. If I'm honest, I have a young daughter, very young, only two years old, but if she, when she's your age, decides to do this, I would be very upset as her father. I think the important thing is whether...whether the person is doing it by choice.
Here's sand in my shorts and umbrellas in my drinks! I'll drink that. How'd it go? Easy. It smelled like a distillery, so I rolled his car, fired it up.
Malotru executed by Daesh is a bargain for the Americans. They avoid the scandal. Their problem is solved. And ours too. Once we release him, what do we do?
This is his file. Go on. What if this Cochise was now... a high-ranking Islamic State official... and he had reactivated the code to contact us? There are many Islamic State officials... who come from Saddam Hussein's former Ba'ath party. And he left this for us to find?
They will change her clothes for a niqab. She will wear another GPS in her panties. They may have a GPS detector. How do you know that? We buy it from Al Qaeda, who knows from the Saudis.
- Okay, Marie Jeanne will be in the first follow-up car. Marie Jeanne will be in the first follow car. Will Rex be able to send an SOS? His phone will be bugged. - They'll confiscate it.
But we didn't leave him. Otherwise there would be no one here. Come in. On the contrary, you will get over the hump as soon as possible. Before you ruminate on it too much.
- Yes. She summoned you here because she knew I was here. I think you've been working for her a bit, without realizing it. Our meeting is not by chance. - Why did you do it?
- Can you explain that to me? - It was just the two of us. But calm down, I'm here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast. You're not even paying for it.
So we took advantage of the meeting between Rex... and the woman in the niqab... to pass her another coded turnout scheme. It was like throwing a bottle into the sea. We thought that... Cochise would see Malotru's video with the schematic... and understand that we wanted to get back in touch with him. And now, forgive me for using the term because I think it's silly... and I never use it, but... bingo!
Useful. And above all you will be perfect. The mold of your teeth. It's old, I've had my teeth changed since then. I'll have it redone.
- See you around. - It's a joke. You're not gonna kill my happiness. Hey. What's up? I found this charger at home. Maybe you left it at my party.
I want to keep an eye on Jack Barker in the sun and shade. Not with ordinary listening devices. Maybe I'll find them. A colleague on Facebook has a laser microphone. He points it at the window from a mile away and reads the vibrations.
The trees of the earth are used for shelter and fire. More than that. Is it love, Father? For God's sake, can't you keep quiet? But, yes, the bastard got it, it can only be love.
- I'll overlook it this time. - You know what this is? If it's not fries, you're fired. Fluid link K57. I took it off the TARDIS the other night after your class.
No! What happened? I can't move. Your suit went on automatic. The Doctor hacked it and got you out.
When they steal all that is on land, they will steal the sea If their enemies are rich, they will take all they have. If their enemies are poor, they will enslave them. Their job is to steal, kill and plunder. They do this work and call it empire.
Oh, stop being brave. I can't stand brave people. I'll write the story on the rock. I'll write your name here. They'll see it for hundreds of years.
Yes, the girls should have the bedroom ready by now. You have permission to approach. Congratulations on your citizenship. Thank you. Hong Kong knows talent when it sees it.
Guido, don't... Kimberly, use your key! I'm getting even! You're not answering your phone. I threw it in a public pool while I was doing track one.
You put me on the spot. You bring a guy in for sticking his hands in the till, and he walks away beaten. Makes us all look bad. And you know about this place now? She mentioned it on the therapy tapes.
It looked like it was stoned. It's not old. It's an unworn shoe. Okay, um... You haven't seen my keys, have you? I put it up on the wall anyway. See if anyone comes back for it.
- What shoe? The shoe this morning, I told you it was outside the house. Well, what's it doing on the table? I thought I'd bring it in. And you put it here?
And you put it here? Well, we don't know where it's been. It could be covered in dog shit. It's new, that's the thing. Well, if it's new, don't put it on the table, it's bad luck.
Well, we don't know where it's been. It could be covered in dog shit. It's new, that's the thing. Well, if it's new, don't put it on the table, it's bad luck. Okay, I just didn't want it to get stolen.
It could be covered in dog shit. It's new, that's the point. Well, if it's new, don't put it on the table, it's bad luck. Okay, I just didn't want it to get stolen. Wow, so you stole it?
That is the question. We don't know what happened, do we? It could have been an accident, a fall, the shoe came off. It could have been an elderly gentleman with, say, Alzheimer's disease. He went for a walk, doesn't know where he left it.
They took their father's shoe outside. - Maybe kids asking for money for fireworks. - In March? - Okay, so it's a bit of a mystery. - Exactly. You want to see it?
I understand. Let me talk to Lawrence who is my public relations. See what we can do. Thank you. Finally, someone gets it.
Jacqueline, someone has lost a shoe somewhere and if we can put that person and the shoe together, well, I will have accomplished that. Okay, David. Let me tell you for a moment, okay. Let's say I'm the person who lost the shoe. Now I go back to look for it, but it's not there because you, you have it at home.
Thanks, but no thanks. I'm happy as I am. I don't believe you. You're just saying that to hide the real reason why you didn't take a chance on love. You don't think you deserve it.
I'm going to move on from double glazing. To the publishing world, to selling advertising, magazine space. No more stooping as a door-to-door salesman. And when were you planning on telling me about this new job then, Mr. Advertising Executive? Right after they offer it to me.
He said he didn't see me before batting, but my brother was always a sore loser. - Renee played defense. - The thing is, I was very close with my brother and my dad. I always had to be like one of the boys. I tried to play softball but I hated it.
There is a program called Lotus 1-2-3. It would save you a lot of time. Maybe I could propose it to my boss, if he knew what I was talking about. I can show you how it works. Ten minutes of prep, and you put it in the oven for 35 minutes.
We would never do anything like that lightly. Evidently. Where does your last name come from? Jennings. Well, before we got here, our people fixed it up.
"Do you enjoy doing it? Great. Good. If you enjoy it, keep doing it. Keep doing it and If you don't enjoy it, please stop.
And she told me no. Whenever we go to see Cheryl Hirsham, we always forget the code to open her door. "Is it 4-0-0-0-2?" "Wait, is it 2-0-0-0-4?" "You had written it down!
I left furious with myself. That's all I had for Dad? A bland ornament? "Maria! She hates it.
Shit. Defensive. "I don't like sailboats - I had nothing to do with it!" Emotional withdrawal. And they gave us a magnet that looks like a microphone. You give it to your partner when you're done talking and say, 'Now you have the floor.'
We can't tell him how bad his food is because that would destroy it. So when I heard Chef Dumont was coming to town, I signed us up for his class, so he could do it. I know. Pretty strong, huh? Now I take the sensor and I put it...
It goes without saying that he didn't want to. You don't look as good in that story as you think you do. So, in order not to make a fool of himself three times, he proposed a business deal? Well... not yet. Actually, Melcher approved it, but his fiancée wanted to certify that our product complies with his safety protocols.
Well, now that you're both here, we can avoid meaningless chatter. I'd like to be the first to offer you both the opportunity to take me off the market. I don't understand. I'm saying I have a lot of respect for what you're doing, and I wanted to offer you my services as a partner. And I won't do it over the phone.
The 36 HooliPhones that blew up at Hooli-Con and the 17 around the country all had our code. Richard, these are real people, with real crotches and they are burning. We have to say something, it was our fault. Keenan's demo was created for a $10,000 helmet, Jack adapted it for a phone in four days.
One. It's always something new, unexpected...except the first one they used. They went back and forth through that clock all summer long, right? Until their mother died and their uncle sold all their stuff. I think I saw it.
I think I saw it. During my interview at Yale. It was the same one that was on the cover. I mean, the guy died. Probably... sold it, but... what if the watch I saw was the watch?
Finished, Stay-Puff? Sorry, I had some setbacks. This isn't even the new system. I tried that system and it was a lie. Maybe you built it backwards.
I couldn't help him. But it doesn't matter what I said because he realized then that he couldn't have them and me. He was trapped. There was no way out. And before I knew what he was doing, he grabbed a knife off the kitchen counter and plunged it in.
I tried to save him. I tried. But there was too much blood. Be honest with yourself, Sebastian, whatever it is. Yes, there may be sin inside you and that's how you treat it, believe it.
Yes, hello, Alex. You... you haven't kept your end of the bargain. This can't be all you got. I put the name in and that's all that came out. Okay, well, did you spell it correctly?
I'm just... No. I'm just saying... herpes is forever. It binds so much more than marriage. And maybe if we'd had it, we'd still be living together. If you keep trying to sell me on the herpes thing, I'm gonna think you have it.
I saw her throw her makeup and stuff in the trash a week ago. Does her mother trust you about her experimentation? I saw him buy a makeup kit. I'm sure it wasn't for Maggie. It cost twenty dollars and he threw it away.
What if you can't live with it? I know I couldn't, not forever. Maybe not forever. I... I talked to Meghan and Robbie about the case. We got through it.
I suppose it's possible he left himself a back door or something, but I doubt it. Would it be okay with you if I had an expert come in and take a look at your code? - Just to be on the safe side? - Sure. I'll have IT take a look at it.
This is amazing. You picked, what, 20 locks? 23, counting the one I picked to get in. When did you find time to practice? My deal fell through. Actually, I called it off.
You can rejoice in that. I just remembered I had it in my car for weeks. The kerosenes would have killed you. I'll get you another one. Aldous was so proud when he published this book..... NEOLUTION ...and yet, P.T. Westomoreland told me that he wrote it and Aldous just simplified it.
Find the phone! Jay, I gave you - the phone in the raid. - That's right. And I pocketed it.
It's Epp's phone... - What's wrong with it? - I just don't know how he disappeared. We break into the house... Yeah, you arrest Gerry, you take his phone. - Then I give it to you.
I'm sorry. I know he's your partner, but... He means well. You know what? The guy hasn't changed since high school. I go out for a pass, he throws it into the stands, and it's my fault.
From now on, you'll have to be honest with both of us. We should talk about it inside. Come. I've come to tell you that Noah got the plane out of the lake without the help of the road demons, but they still want a new price. If they don't get it, they'll take their business elsewhere and Eli Voss will lose his biggest customer.
Not that a judge is going to care, because if this case gets fucked up, - the shit will hit the fan for all of us. - Especially me. I didn't lose the phone, Jay, okay? Somebody lost it for me.
I figured Khazar's men would take the briefcase. They figured out whose money it was and sent it back, didn't they? Where's the diamond, buddy? You got it in your mouth?
His name was Kip. Kip Tully. We weren't friends or anything, but I know he lived in town too. We'd both take the train to Mount Pleasant. We'd put our suits on in the woods and then use it as a shortcut to town, but never on the same night.
Just in case this guy keeps causing problems, did you see anything? It's a link to a Photobucket account. Schmitt's cell phone was never recovered. Supposedly the killer took it and his wallet.
It's a virus, but one you've never seen before. Well, now that we have his picture, someone is going to know what it is. He thought it was very suspicious that it was resistant to both UV light and chlorine. He can't rule out it being a natural mutation, but he said it was much more likely that our suspect engineered it in a lab. So someone specifically created it to survive the challenge of the city's water safety devices?
I always thought I had some kind of... divine luck. True, you've only used it instinctively, but now I'm here. I can teach you to use it at will. Easily. And once you master it, that's how you'll get Cowden's vote.
Are you the bird that loves man the most? The pious bird with the scarlet breast. Is it a "yes, I returned the bird feeder to Marvin" or a "no I did not return the bird feeder to Marvin"? - Yes, I did return it.
It's not racist? Racist? You can't use that color to represent African-American people. - No one else was offended. - Did any black people see it?
You can't use that color to represent African-American people. - No one else was offended. - Did any black people see it? I haven't had any African-American guests. I'm the darkest skin tone person who has seen it and I'm offended.
There can be no blackout or incident during the duel. So directly, how do we guarantee it? - It's too much... - What? There is something, but we beg you not to do it.
They can. And in return? A real child from Torresblancas. The fairies want a baby? They're not going to eat it, are they?
Hello, Ravn. My condolences. I did everything I could. I did everything I could without breaking the law. If I had believed in treatment, I would have considered it.
Don't fucking tell him. You just got off the hook. You think when I drive drunk I call the cops when I get home? No. I stop, pick up the mailbox I threw away, throw it in the trunk and keep going.
You'll have to leave me a garment. Okay, okay, okay. Take the keys to my house. Pick up the mail and feed the cat. Who do you want me to feed the cat?
Says who? Your little phone? Yes. It says there's been an accident. If there had been an accident, I'd know about it.
Your time with Colt will come, and it will be just as special. I felt better when I thought they weren't going to have the baby. Am I a bad person? You're a wonderful person who's having a hard time. But you won't do it alone.
Let it be clear that we will not go near each other's houses for anything in the world. - That's it. - Good. You got a check from Neumann's Hill yesterday. I'll use it to light the fireplace.
Beau, it's my cabin now. I don't have to tell you anything. We're divorced. Nice haircut. Who gave you that?
Did you fix it just like the brakes on the truck? - Come on, guys. - The brakes work fine, Dad. Not your reflexes, your eyesight or the gate you crashed into. That gate wouldn't have closed if you'd leveled it right.
What's his name? I don't know. Horse? It's beautiful. - Beau, did you make it? - My father made it for me.
I don't know. Horse? It's beautiful. - Beau, did you make it? - My father made it for me. I gave it to Rooster and Colt.
- Yes, what do you mean? - What's your point? As soon as Colt and I had a fight, you slept with him without protection. You think I was looking for it? If the condom doesn't work for you, don't wear it.
They played Patsy Cline on the radio, and I thought of you. It's only been a few weeks since you left, but it seems like an eternity. I grew a mustache. I don't know if it looks good on me. I'll probably shave it off in a week.
Yes, Colt. That's exactly what it's for. By the way, I hope we catch 328 fish today. The same amount as your intercepts. Maybe a fish will eat your cell phone, and we'll catch it.
And you're the first person to look at it. Most people just look at the booze, and I look at anything else. It doesn't look like it was bought at the corner store. No. My grandmother gave it to me when I was little.
- He's six years old! - Fuck. So I said, "Look, honey, it's Elsa from Frozen!". She turned around to look, I grabbed her cell phone and threw it overboard.
It is a proprietary system. It becomes accessible to the man in the street and that makes its product eminently American. Consumable, yet of undeniable quality. Capra wanted his next film to be about the American Revolution with George Washington as the hero. But Harry Cohn, Capra's boss at Columbia, turned him down for a reason Capra had not considered.
There had been no other situation where people in Hollywood... DIRECTOR ...could sell the war to Americans and help them win by building morale. And so they were looking for what form those films should take. The idea of propaganda films is to propagate, to disseminate ideas. Each of the five men we're talking about dealt with it differently. John Ford approached it on a mythic, epic scale.
And then they were looking for the form that these films should take. The idea of propaganda films is to propagate, to disseminate ideas.

Each of the five men we are talking about treated it differently. John Ford approached it on a mythic, epic scale. John Houston treated it almost as an adventure. Wyler and Stevens treated it in an incredibly human way. And their experiences are different from Capra's...who treated it in a conceptual problem-solving way.
Ford understood that, in wartime what the American public wanted was to understand and get a real sense of the conflict without mediators. And what this film was doing was recreating a Hollywood semi-fiction and that didn't work. And Ford did the same thing he did with scripts. Ford was famous for taking a script and changing it, altering it, taking the phlegm out of it, the froth out of it and getting to its core, to its essence. So he cut it in the middle and made it true to the facts.
What a difficult age. You did a good job. Thank you. But there's a bag missing. I gave it so we could escape.
When her father was killed... Cortez, the Conqueror, took her as his own and gave her... land, a new religion, another name. Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Do you think you're the only murderer here? If you say my daughter's name one more time, I'm gonna carve it in your skull.
Happy Birthday. I asked Pote to check your car to see what was wrong with it. If you're going to belong in this business, you should drive something more... reliable. Come. I bought it from Isabela.
A lot of people thought I was crazy, including your mother, but I saw something in her that made me love her, that I wanted to build... to leave her to you one day. I'm sorry that's not going to happen anymore. What are you saying, Dad? Didn't your brother tell you? We're gonna sell this old place... as soon as you fix it up.
In 12 to 25 steps, you can become a tax-free worship site. The Church of Aquatism. Inventing a religion? I don't know. Hey, look, I don't like it either, but if it means keeping this place open, we'll do what we have to do and take it to the grave, okay?
Man, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes. Whoever you take to Fenway, the other two will get mad at you. I don't want to take either of them. Those guys are way better at baseball than I am. They'd make it obvious and blow it.
Hey, Todd, do me a favor? I'm kind of busy right now. Well, I was hoping you could go get my accordion. I left it in the elevator, and I'm having a hell of a time with the stairs.
Because I have to get my accordion from the elevator. I guess you're not going to do it, so I'll do it. No, I'll get it. Okay, don't do me any favors. Look, I said I would, and I will.
Well, you could think of it as a kind of alternative therapy. My clients use the service for any number of healing reasons. "Curative"? Yeah, I mean, sure, some people do it just for kicks.
Yes, he mentioned he was on parole. Man, Hayward. You're not going to have his number handy, are you? No, I'm afraid not. I just drop it off when it needs fixing.
You're being silly now. Come with me. I honestly think you're going to dig this place. It's a family cabin. My dad built it in the '70s and...
- Wasn't it destroyed? - He was a hatter. He had many. They contain portals to all the realms. I used it to flee Oz. Flee?
I came to make sure everything is as it should be. You know the saying... A mayor's work is never done. Madam Mayor... what an honor. I brought you lunch... and a little job if you'll have it.
Remember to be strong and brave. Don't forget that I love you. Gideon... I know it's not easy to talk about Belle. But this book... it was very important to her. - She really wanted you to have it.
- No... It can't be. - I'm afraid it can. Your storybook... or what's left of it. - No, my mom would never have burned it.
Let's go... Come on, let's go! - You made it. - Not quite, it won't last. The Black Fairy has his heart. Gold will make it and everything will be fine.
I appreciate your optimism, son, but we must go. - Do you think her heart is here? - I know my mother. She must have hidden it here. If I find it...
At least we hurt something out there. I needed the creature's body, dead or alive. That doesn't matter, because until we get every supernatural entity you guys let into the Triangle, I'm stranded in this town of "living anuses". Willa is the Earp who let that crap in. I was the one who slapped the tentacle, stepped out of bounds and sliced it up like sausage meat.

Willa is the Earp who let that crap in. I was the one who slapped the tentacle, stepped out of bounds and sliced it up like sausage meat. But did you kill it?
The massive amounts of vomit, the expenses we will incur, just to name a few things. Hey, Dawson. You don't want to involve Molly's in the evening tour, do you? Whatever you want. - Yeah, good, 'cause we're gonna do it.
- Okay? You did a lot of good last night. You took a big risk and you stood up for us. I did what I had to do. If you were trying to earn a spot on this team, I'm pretty sure you would have made it.
You haven't said much. I know, I just... I was trying to be less impulsive. Well, I'm a good soldier. I follow orders. You needed time, I'm giving it to you.
Do you want to hear the story or not? Yes, yes, okay. I'm sorry. One day, the tank was empty, but I still had to get to work. So I ignored it and moved on.
What is your ex-wife doing here? - I'm her emergency contact. - Come on, now! Don't freak out. I'm sure she hadn't changed it yet.
I can't do this anymore. I need, I need to get out of here and get some space. I'm moving out of the apartment. What? I couldn't find the trash can, so I flushed it down the toilet.
Like when I put a can of pasta in the microwave - Doc, it was a human being! But where did he find the slime? Come on. Well, I found a compound that shocks the nervous system, makes the demon think it's in a dying body and leaves it.
Then we ask the Stone Witch. - She is lost. - Juan Carlo? You're not strong enough yet. We'll find him.
- What? They're looking for something. Yeah, a seal. That's a known fact. What happens when they break it?
Yes! Great hunting, everyone. After eating some treats, be sure to get a good night's rest for the Meat Boom. Time to strap on your eating backpack. I'm not even tasting it, mmm.
The landlords call them "the fire starters" I'll try to remember to let them know before my friend Inocendio Daly comes by. Hey, let's go find the egg. Yeah, uh, we're gonna find it. It's just that it's well hidden because I hid it.
- It was probably me. - No. It was me. - No, me. So one of you hid it, but none of you remember where?
- Five dollars. - Oh, no, thank you. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit. It's in the restaurant. We don't even feel it anymore.
Pudding, he steals it. From who? From me, in the alley. Why are you eating pudding in the alley? Where else am I going to eat it Bob?
Oh, God, this egg. Agh! The smell. Give it to me. I'll throw it in the ocean.
Okay, so... can you tell us your name? It sounds like we're dealing with a deaf person. Or a case like the one in the movie Nell. Okay, let me try. I'm going to say some common names, you just let me know if I get it right.
As soon as we get that huge rock off our scanners, we can locate Captain Marvel and bring her back to your crewmates. Right now. It looks like the asteroid is destabilized. I can't risk shrinking it. Then we won't touch it until you and Tony have done a full analysis.
Okay, Quill, maybe your equipment not working quite right isn't all your fault. I know, right? Wait. How could that be my fault? Hulk, take care of the asteroid. You mean crush it?
I know, right? Wait. And how could that be my fault? Hulk, take care of the asteroid. You mean crush it? How about we pull the plug first?
Check behind the cash register. God, what are we dealing with? I got another one! And a bottle of oven cleaner. If he sprayed the oven and didn't clean it, could that have caused cyanide poisoning?
We didn't know what we were up against and Harris figured it out, sir... boss. If they say it's true, it's true. I want a case report. - Yes, Chief. - You got it.
It either caromed into your trunk, or it traveled through the venous system. Right. Grab an LPD. LPD? A diagnostic peritoneal lavage. We're going to insert a needle into your abdomen, fill it with fluids, then drain it to see if there's any internal bleeding.
I'm afraid to spend the last years of my life alone, you know. Yes, I know. How long have you owned this car? About two months. I bought it used from somewhere in Hillside.
- Are you sure? I've said it five times! I'm sure! This house will get your money, okay? Hey, how long did you have it for?
I just... I can't... Look, we're not getting anywhere with Eli, so tell me you found out anything about the missing kids or their foster mom. I wish I could, but it's like they just vanished into thin air. The music teacher... any idea why Eli was trying to find him? He's been on vacation in Rio, had no idea Eli was camping out at his house and the man who took Amber's body from the morgue managed to do it using fake transfer papers.
"Catch the bug," "Unclog the latrine." Oh, crap! Those weren't games at all, were they? Quill, I hate to interrupt your walk down memory lane, but we have to find the sarcophagus before it falls into the hands of the Believers. Right, Rocket? Hey, is it my fault Yondu stole it?
I think I'll get free. Quill! Eyes on the enemy! Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus! He doesn't have it!
"If he tests negative on the breathalyzer test, I'll give him the keys." I thought. "Set it up, buddy. Let's play." And I blew into the device. It made a sound, and I got scared. The cop looked at it and said:
He empties his wallet. Two dimes and a nickel. He puts the dimes in his wallet, puts the nickel under a bottle of whiskey. In the kitchen, there is a box of matches with only one inside. He puts the glove inside the oven and lights it.
Not Mr. Brady? That's right. What if it's Mr. Mayer? He just sent this. He'd like to know what you think. You know, there's no guarantee he'll read it endlessly.
Do you think Sally Sweet's script is bad? I couldn't tell you, Mr. Brady. I haven't read it yet. I do like The Wizard of Oz. Mr. Mayer sent it for Mr. Stahr.
Every first night of a foster child is like this. Well, I can still help. I have experience. I could write a book on raising a teenage girl. What would you call it:
The rest of the unit helped rebuild, every day after work they collaborated. Well, guys like that don't do this! Christopher. Let's take it one step at a time. Well, we know Kelly had the fentanyl, and it looks like he put it on a cargo ship.
The FBI seized my equipment. The mission cannot be compromised. Well, it has to be. I need my equipment. And now you have it.
- Your equipment could help us find Krilov. - How? The EEG device you stole from him is state-of-the-art. It's designed to receive updates from the main server. So, it's part of a wireless network. Which we can use to locate the device and Krilov when he turns it on.
Werner made a big impression on me at the time. An international arms dealer, a smuggler, a participant in just about every illicit deal one could imagine. I wanted an alliance to become Werner's most trusted partner. Raymond devised a plan based on an ancient principle. If you want your enemy to become your friend, you create a problem for him and then solve it.
I wasn't fighting for Skaikru today. I thought I was fighting for myself, but now I know that's not true either. I was fighting for all of us. Skaikru will not take the bunker alone. We will share it equally because we are equals.
Look, okay, don't explain it to me, just type it in. Okay, typing typing typing typing typing. I've got a Yakuza enforcer ready to kill you and bring me that truck for ten million. And why don't I kill her now... right now? Because I've already ordered the hit, and unless I contact him and call it off, you're as good as dead.
- No. The satellite initiated its preliminary firing sequence. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I won't hack it in time.
Turn left at 22nd Jane, take MacArthur Boulevard. It's the only way to get to the tunnel before impact. Copy that. Look, it might be risky, but I'm sending an app to your phone, I've reprogrammed it.
Do you read me? Can you move? Yes, I think so. Then you're going to have to keep looking for the locator. If you don't find it in the next two minutes, the glider will cross the security zone.
If you don't find it in the next two minutes, the glider will cross the safety zone. - I've found it. - What are you waiting for? - Destroy it! - Shepherd swallowed it.
- All they need is a name. - We know Dowd is wasting money. That's fine. I'll delay the paperwork until the end of the shift. But then Homicide will take it.
What happened? Didn't he put the money in the bag fast enough? Was he going to set off the alarm? I've never robbed a bank. I'd never commit a federal felony to get locked up until I had gray hair. You know? what disappoints me is that you and your boy steal half a million tax free and spend it on chicks?
What you did for Corey Jenkins, protecting him so he would deny his confession, I don't know many, if any, cops who would do that. You know? I've got an officer on leave. I could use your help around here. What I'm saying is, I've got an opening in Intelligence if you want it.
Black people, sex offenders. I have to admit one thing, Craig. You're an enemy of equal opportunity. I have a constitutional right to express my opinion. You know? I don't get it.
You see, I'm very sensitive to extreme flavors. No. Don't worry. I won't drink that. That's the moody cold talking and I won't drink it.
Doyle is clean. You're clean. It's all over well for us. Your job is waiting for you when you're ready. You really don't understand.
It's... it's been hectic. Oh, no need to apologize. I just wanted to take a look at you. Gabriela, I know, you blame me for the divorce. Yeah, well, you're the one who wanted it.
No, yes, yes. I'm good. Listen, I need to talk to you about next semester. The managers say your phone interview went really well. The job's yours if you want it.
So, Mr. Halstead, the results of the cardiac catheterization showed that your heart has been under stress for so long from mitral valve regurgitation...that it's basically giving out. This is why I told you to have it checked regularly. If we had known about the regurgitation we could have gotten ahead of this. Yeah, so what? I'll fix it now.
Can you fix it? Like before? No, we can't. We need to operate, and quickly. If the other half comes loose too, the clip could end up in your brain or somewhere else you definitely wouldn't want it.
And you escalated things! You have no idea what you're dealing with. Is this some kind of game to you where you get to be the hero? Is that what this is? No, this is not a game. You made a mess and I'm fixing it.
Allison just got braces. Dentists also use triazolam sometimes. After you die, they will rush you to the operating room where they will remove all your organs and tissues. When that happens, will it hurt? No. The bleeding from your brain will deprive it of oxygen.
A native Hawaiian. Must be fate. You may be right. Mrs. Goodwin wants you to have the nail. You know what? I don't need it.
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Hello, we are the Croods of the Valley Ahhh! Or we were, until my dad got fed up with the place and decided to retire.
Unlike Langley fans. The government's cutting them off. They want their money back, - or what's left of it. - What? And they're pulling me off the task force if I don't get it.
They want their money back, - or what's left of it. - What? And they're pulling me off the task force if I don't get it. No, not now. Now is the time when we need it most.
Look what I found in the stable next to his carriage. The devil wears a pitchfork, doesn't he? Yes, like the stable hands. Well, what about his hat? He never takes it off!
No, that's the sourdough that started it all. It has fed us for 140 years. The bread that comes out of it is succulent and firm...the flavor lingers for days. I hate so many of the words you just used..... Charles, if she's so great, why did she give it to me?
- Nothing. I just realized that I love stale, sourdough bread! - Come on, Gina. - Okay, okay, okay! I put it under my desk and my space heater burned it to ashes.
Ready? I'm sorry I got scared and ran away. That's okay. Just because you got the practice test wrong doesn't mean you're going to fail the real thing. I didn't get it wrong.
You've even taken back the pool table that nobody uses. Wait a minute, you liars! What's that nice couch doing there? The old couch didn't make it. As soon as the sunlight touched it, it turned to dust.
Now nobody wants to know how it went? This is crazy. Okay, I should be back in an hour. If my desk phone rings, ignore it. - That's what I do.
Not unlike the fork you use to turn a sirloin steak on the grill - a meat fork! Sam, explain to them about the meat fork. Again, "meat fork" is funny, but under no circumstances should anyone say that in court. We have it if we need it.
The mortgage is paid. You can give this place away to whomever you please. I don't mind. Actually, you do. Don't give it to Hitchcock.
Proceed. The money that was deposited was sent through five banks. Well, I can't link it to Hawkins, but the original transfer came from this shell company. Doesn't ring a bell. I'll text the team, see if anyone recognizes it.
all men are created equal and born with undeniable and inviolable rights. That's the United States! Love 'em or leave 'em! You either love 'em or leave 'em. You take this stick and you hit it, and the candy comes flying out. Okay.
Do you think so? I do. I do. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. There you go, healthy baby.
You can't see the bride! My dress is in San Jose. I picked out something beautiful. I can't afford it. You'll wear it once, then return it.
Well, let's leave it here while we decide what to do. No, no, that's not an option, because pretty soon, the toxins will seep through the veins into your heart anyway. I have seen people rescued from the rubble of an earthquake after three days and they lived. That's because they were trapped in an air bag or under something heavy that didn't compress their muscles. Scotty's forearm is producing these toxins, and when the pressure is strong enough, the diffusions at the molecular level will put him at the point of crushing.
Is the boat on its way? Any minute now. The flare went up pretty high. Hey, the flare... Walt got it, okay?
Were you raised by women? Yes. Brad likes to get outdoors more. This morning we took a nature walk, picked up trash and saw a fox. Well, Brad saw it.
What? What's wrong? - You have a lump. - ¿Y? I don't think he had it before he came here.
When I'm gay, I want it to be on my terms How can you sit around stuffing your face with ice cream? I wanted a snack before I walked The Green Mile. Adam offered to lend you the money. Why don't you take it?
I don't either. You know, in four years, Katie's going to college. And then, in 12 years, they'll all be gone. Well, maybe we can be one of those couples that gets a small dog and pushes it in a stroller.
Nurse, aloe? Keep putting this on, three times a day, and no physical activity. Come on. I feel like I have to earn my keep. You earned it when you landed a plane that was running on a sports drink.
Ralph! It is not here. The copper wire is missing. No, it's not. Ralph must have taken it to the needle.
You must really like this Hannah girl. Well, she's funny, - she's beautiful.... - Mm-hmm. And like me, she understands mid-century design, but I'm over it.
bring me another Candy Ring. This one's about to run out. Van, I want my office back. Emily, once another space opens up, I'll happily give it to you, but right now I'm in the middle of something... very important.
Give the man credit for consistency. He was lazy and inept in all facets of his business. Still, C. Gibson's full name has got to be in here somewhere, right? Yes, finally. Did you find it?
Charcot is a surname, as are Tooth and Marie. They are the doctors who first described the neurological disorder now more commonly known as CMT. CMT attacks the peripheral nervous system, arms, legs, hands and feet. It is degenerative and symptoms worsen over time. If Carter Gibson had it, that would explain the orthopedic braces and probably the medications he took.
And you think it's because the killer took it with him after he used it to smash two skulls? He grabbed it from there and started swinging it around? Blood evidence would indicate that. A curved motion like this...would result in blood spatter like that. Now we know how this mess was made, but who made it?
Um, uh, getting better. Everyone looks amazing. I hope everyone is comfortable in their attire. Hey, my uniform is itchy and smells musty. As it would have been in 1900-something when a maid your size would have worn it.
That was a lot of doors. Wow, they made good time. Where the hell did you get that pocket watch? Oh, it's on loan from the state. My character Oliver wears it, so, yeah.
Don't worry about it. - Sam had an accident, I understand. - Yeah, it was pretty bad. NEWTON PREP I think my hair did this, and he took it...
Here's a pekpek. You want it? It's free!". "Pekpek" means "shell." Some understood, but others wondered, "Does he give away chickens?
You want it, it's free!". "Pekpek" means "shell." Some understood it, but others wondered, "Does he give away chickens? Does he have a chicken every weekend and give it away?
But the fucking spout never formed. So you'd turn it over and start again. And there was too much glue on it. That shitty side wouldn't open up. So you cut it in the middle.
The knife? Yes, let me have it. All right, here. Thank you. What are you going to use it for?
Here it is, Gene. The planetarium. So this place was your only friend, huh? Basically. Looks like they're renovating it.
Home! I mean, maybe. Hey, it's your birthday, so... Don't worry about it. I won't enjoy the show if you don't enjoy it.
Very good! - Thanks, T. - I don't sweat. So, the laser show, it was good, right? I mean, you've never seen it before, but you could feel it?
- What? I'm sorry. Speak up. My hearing's half-affected. I said I loved him, Dad!
And always remember to breathe harder than the others. Adios, much chacho. She has asthma too. The town without moms is going to have to change its name. Because of one mom, who saved all the moms, they called it Villa Mama.
And we got the guns. Ha! Come on, let's go. Yeah, take that, alien. We have to be careful and brave, because that alien is super tough. It's got acid in it instead of blood, so it can hurt you even if you've killed it.
If they said, "Here's a guy who has the best penis. The best penis ever. His penis has been in olive oil since he was five years old. We've been feeding him nothing but butter and penis his whole life. He's got the best penis and you can suck it right now."
Shit, I shouldn't have looked at it. Bring it closer. I don't know what I'm going to do, but bring it closer, please." I think, at that point, you put it in your mouth, don't you? If you're looking at the best penis there is, and you're not sure... if you want to suck it, you put it in your mouth.
At first, I was a little surprised, I had to say it or I would see him anyway. He doesn't seem to be self conscious. He just got better. Shot after shot, he tried to reach a goal. There was goal he tried to reach, And when he reached it, it was beautiful.
Missing persons, now. White female, 30s, recently deceased. Your asshole partner's around. Our what? Glasses, black hair, gray temper, mouth like someone took a tomato scoop out of a pig's asshole and stuck it under his nose?
Johan Schmidt, aka Red Skull, from my Nazi kidnapping and rape fantasy. - Right? - Shut up. Tonight your brother is dropping off the ransom money at the Griffith Observatory. Archer will pick it up and bring it to me.
No, silly. These are ways to fix a leaky radiator on the spur of the moment. What? Put a piece of potato in it, or some pepper. Cover it up. The steam pressure pushes the hole out and seals it.
What? Put a piece of potato in it, or a little pepper. Cover it. The pressure of the steam pushes the hole and seals it. The same with an egg. You crack it in there and it cooks in the hole.
Believe me, I know. - Well, this isn't very Casper. - Poovey! Where's the money? And the bag containing it.
I guess bad news travels fast. My job is to keep it from getting any further. That trafficking route belonged to the Russians, the Federal Security Service, to be clear, but last year, Hugh Meachum, on behalf of the CIA, took over those routes and took over. The CIA is in heroin trafficking? They learned it very well during the Vietnam War.
Someone will come for you. - Do you have his phone? - Yes, I took out the SIM card. Well, put it back in. We need it.
Doesn't the location seem odd to you? We have three cartel murders a month, mostly infighting. And it sucks when it happens to a good man, but this case is closed. Listen, I'm really sorry, Bob Lee, but I'd be lying to you if I told you that investigating would do any good. Okay, well, let's say for example, if you did investigate, where would you go first?
More than 400 deaths have been counted. The intelligence ran out around 2009. The Russians wanted it so badly that they sprayed gas all over the village. They killed hundreds, mostly civilians. And they never found his body. Well, if it's up to me, they'll find him here.
Something to drink? No, we just need... Peter, how's your father? I haven't seen him here in his rightful place for a long time. If you've come to kiss the ring, I'm wearing it now.
It means that no one knows what the members look like. Stealth is their priority. Donny. He took Solotov's ID and wrote that damn report. I told him to burn it.
Stealth is your priority. Donny. He took Solotov's ID and wrote that damn report. I told him to burn it. Zehnder kept it.
You would have trashed it by now anyway. Are you coming or what? Where are we going? To a club in Dallas. The club's for you guys. The girl who runs it...
Let's fight for real, Gohan! Next time on Dragon Ball Super: A wall to overcome! Goku vs. Gohan Don't miss it!
That's why you're here, isn't it, for a safe conduct? Yes. Werner's death has cost me my travel routes on and off the continent. And I'm sure whoever has my plane right now is trying to decide whether to keep it or at what astronomical price they'll sell it to me.
Wait, you guys know each other? Donald was the public face of the search for Raymond when he was on the run with Elizabeth Keen. Everyone in my world knows Donald Ressler. We're here to make a deal with you. If there's a deal to be made, I'll make it with Agent Ressler.
If the information you give us leads us to your brother, we are authorized to shave five years off your sentence. It's a deal. But before I'm interrupted, I was going to rat that asshole out for nothing. He's got a place in Baltimore where he keeps his loot. He's gonna check it often.
It's ringing. Why is your pocket ringing? It's Kate's phone. - Why do you have Kate's phone? - I think I grabbed it by accident when I was over there this morning.
Excuse me? I don't know what you know about me, but, I'm a fixer, Mr. Bull. Sometimes I make things happen, sometimes I make things go away. It's how I became Managing Partner of my own law firm with offices in three states. The person has a problem, I solve it.
He hit that monster right in the jaw on video. I could have hand delivered him another victim to kill. I went to the dump...I-I have no idea what I was thinking, I was desperate. Then...being there, I was looking at the decomposing skull of this naked girl and that's when I saw him.
I could have hand-delivered him another victim to kill. I went to the dump...I-I have no idea what I was thinking, I was desperate. Then... while I was there, I was looking at the decomposing skull of this naked girl and that's when I saw him. Ah... what did Benny call it?
I thought, "That's it." "There is a God." "We're going to be able to put this animal away." So I put on the gloves and... but God had other plans. I went back to the suspect's apartment and put him under the couch.
"There is a God." "We're going to be able to put this animal away." So I put on the gloves and.... but God had other plans. I went back to the suspect's apartment and put him under the couch. I figured I'd go back with the whole team and we'd all find him together;
You're going to stay away from her, forever. Understood? I went to see Roy yesterday. I asked him about the report they filed against me. He told Gorham to do it.
This is the security footage from Birchwood Grove. That's Roy. He was actually outside the club when he said he was. He was an hour's drive away at the time of Chantal's attack. He didn't, and yet his DNA is at the scene.
Someone killed him. At first, all forensic experts agreed it was suicide. There was gunshot residue on Roy's hand. There was no sign of a struggle. We thought maybe he did it because of everything that was coming at him.
We would like to know the name of that man. Why? Do you think he had something to do with this? It's a possibility we're exploring. Given the work you do here and the kind of clients you do it for, that man could have been hiding millions from your wife.
Ardy Gulbenkian. So he hit Chantal Milner and framed Roy, so when he killed him, people would think it was suicide. That's... that's unbelievable. And if I understand them correctly, all they're relying on is that they discovered some clerical errors and they found money that I touched. Which for all they know could have my fingerprints on it because Roy stole it from me.
It's "HUMANS" AND "MONSTERS" The bathroom issue, for example. From my point of view, they should be genderless. They should be well equipped, safe, comfortable and genderless. When I go to the women's restroom, I try to leave it cleaner than I find it.
She was wearing a totally slutty little dress. A micro-dress. Gold sequined. Buying that for me was something deep in my obsession. I walked by the store and saw it on one of those hideous mannequins.
Robert. Robert Svane. Well... Robert. When you have a message for me from Wyatt Earp... you will tell me... in private.
There is no time. She's here. Sooner than expected, damn her. She's looking for the third seal. I don't have it and I don't know where it is.
- Made of silver. - Do I know you, friend? We are not friends. Tie that ring to this thread. And when I have it, I'll throw you a rope.
- This is not a game. Give it to me. They made sure I didn't. And, no, I don't have the combination. I'd say give it to me, but you might not like what that means.
What's in the briefcase? Seriously, Waverly. Poker face. Sing, birdie. If you don't know what's in it, why steal it?
It was a big blow to him. But he was in a car accident three years ago. He didn't get a transfusion and died. His blood type is MkMk. It is a real blood type and only about 20 people in Korea have it.
Spit it out, motherfucker! What's wrong with you, mister? I'll scratch your eyes out! This was my car. But some idiot stole it from me and sold it here.
Do you work here? I usually write in the upstairs studio, although sometimes I do it here. What are you imagining when you look at the piano? Nothing! I've already forgotten!
Hey, Sagiri, I have a dream. A dream? Yes, a very big dream. One day I will publish this manuscript. Since it's not feasible right now, I'll revise it, propose a draft and get the editor to approve it.
There's a chip in your hood. Here you go, girls. Girls, we're doing a vodka slide tonight. What are you saying? What the hell is a vodka slide? Well, you make vodka ice and then you eat it.
I mean it. I'm serious. Fuck you! I've been here, sitting here... for years, and what you're asking me now... I couldn't pay it off, or look at me for years. What's a swan like you doing out on the street with your Prada handbag... telling me to pass it to you like you're asking me to check the gas meter?
No. I'm sorry, but no. There's no way I'm going to let them jeopardize such an important case. And for the record, Mr. Wilcox has already testified about Ms. Zelaya's murder. Duane Pryor did.
I try to dare to make my life and the lives of my family safe. I saw when the Widows destroyed the second seal. It takes demonic powers that I don't think even you could control. You've seen me before for coffee, haven't you? And if you break it and Clootie emerges, how do you propose to kill the powerful demon that Wyatt himself couldn't command?
- Please! - What are you so afraid of? - Damn it, woman! - I told you to shoot me. - Doc, listen to me! If I don't break the seal, the Widows will find it and kill you anyway.
- Clootie the demon. - Our baby. I have to do it my way, but I promise I won't break the seal until after. We need a plan. And when that plan is made, I'll break it with you... by my side.
- Oh, my God! What are you doing? - What are you doing? You idiot! What's that smell? We didn't catch it; we just inhaled it.
So Mercedes attacked Nicole. Why? Widow Mercedes thought Nicole had the third seal. That's not possible. The seal is safe and sound and it's the only thing keeping Clootie from resurrecting. The Widows won't find it.
I never confessed. I didn't tell him anything. Why do you think I chose you to keep the ring? Yes. It's safe and sound in my coffee cup at the station. You hid it where?
- I know you didn't feel valued at Pearson Specter, and I want to apologize for my part in that. Also... I wanted you to know that it was never my intention - to get you fired. - I hope you didn't come - to offer me my job. - And what if I did? I'd say I wouldn't take it.
She accepted it instead of suing. And I can tell you that she regretted it for the rest of her life. Oscar, there is no price that will make the pain go away. And what will? Do everything possible to make sure no one else ever feels it again.
"I can handle this." I decided to go get my yearbook from my mother's attic to put a face to this. Then I could close the chapter. So I pulled out the yearbook. When I opened it, I saw Magnus' face.
Those were the cases with which we could achieve something. We believed them. We had a credible case. It's what we call a hot case, meaning a case that gets national media attention. You have to work with the prosecution. So we would take it straight to Sharon May's office.
The best word to describe Maskell is slippery. Did he think Maskell was guilty of child molestation even if he couldn't prosecute? He didn't disbelieve the victims, but he didn't have enough to go on. So maybe in the back of his mind, yes. He did.
I looked at the clock in the foyer when he came in and said, "What are you doing home? And then I noticed right away that his white shirt was full of blood. I said, "What happened?" Ed said, "Nothing." He said, "My boss wouldn't give me my check and I know how badly we need it.
He said he was going to go buy this engagement gift. When they searched the car, the gift was not there and was never found. The Christmas after Sister Cesnik disappeared, Ed gave me this necklace as part of a Christmas gift. And he just walked up to me and put it around my neck.
That's absurd. How..." He didn't say that. After my brother's death, Abbie sent me the interview of him. SHARON'S BROTHER And I never knew until I heard that interview that this subject haunted my brother. I never knew.
He didn't say that. After my brother's death, Abbie sent me the interview of him. SHARON'S BROTHER And I never knew until I heard that interview that this subject haunted my brother. I never knew. We never discussed it once.
We heard that, in August 1994, WJZ showed a video retrospective of journalist Jerry Turner receiving a call from someone who said he had information about Cathy's murder and who had her rosary. We were told that, in this news video, they played an audio of the call. We haven't gotten it anywhere else. We're hoping it's on one of these tapes, but there's a pretty big box with the tapes from August.
Bob and I cleaned out his apartment and I was no good because as soon as I started tidying up... Fatal beating of nun Missing for a month ...we found all this. There were boxes all over the apartment. I was trying to go through everything. There I found the items my mother had cut out. She kept it all, but she never told me.
It's a dead end. DETROIT, MICHIGAN Diane. Can you come here a minute? Can you look up the file on this case? - Did you find it?
People always tell us that the Baltimore County Police say that some of the details of the Unknown Student's story were not possible or true. I often wonder if, when the Unknown Student came forward in 1994 and said that Father Maskell took her to see Sister Cathy's body, the Baltimore County Police must have thought her story did not add up. I cannot comment on the credibility of that witness in relation to another investigator. I never spoke with her or interviewed her. One of the details she always said was that, upon finding Sister Cathy's dead body, she removed the maggots from her face when she saw it.
Why would I have bought him a green stone that is from August? I have no idea. We know that Sister Cathy went out to buy a gift for her sister. And that, a month later, you gave this necklace to your wife. Did you show it to Cathy's sister?
Yes, and Cathy's sister wonders if it could be her necklace, because she knows her sister went out to buy an engagement gift that night and, you see, that necklace has a wedding bell on it. It has a birthstone that is the same stone as Cathy's sister's sister's then fiancé. So she thinks that necklace might have some significance and she wonders if you might have gotten it from Cathy's sister that night. It doesn't mean anything to me, did you meet Sister Cathy that night? Now, if people believe that that was the necklace that Cathy bought the night she disappeared and you gave it to your first wife, do you understand why people are suspicious because of that?
A very cheap trick to scare away all my customers on the busiest weekend of the year. Hi. I'm Dwight MonkFish. I'm the owner of the Reventon Beach Pier. That wooden thing that sticks out over the sea. You may have seen it.
- They have no proof. - It is totally absurd. - Is it? Mrs. Holdout, when we were searched, I noticed that you are left-handed. Mr. Holdout, you can remember the ridiculously long name of a parrot who died long ago, along with the details of the pirates, but when we asked you to recite a poem that might incriminate you, conveniently, you forgot it.
"She's obsessed with squirrels, and kind of got me interested in them." But I moved on to the main joke. That's a running gag. It makes it cooler. Now I blew it because I went back and went back and talked about it.
You're welcome. Next time you want to tell me like, "Yeah," or something like that, let's go like this. You can go like this: Okay, the denouement, did I say it right?
Which I like, because sometimes I think about two or three. I don't want to spoil them. I post them spaced out. Many years ago, in the early days of Twitter practically, I scheduled a tweet. I scheduled it for 8:05 p. m. Pacific time.
- Nothing. Louis, what's going on? Well, look, Donna, I'm only gonna tell you this once. Harvey asked me to handle a matter for him. It's personal. He confided in me.
But we still don't know who was involved. The president or others. Anyone could be guilty or innocent. I can't believe Harris is complicit in this evil. If NASA launches the gravity tractor then the Russians will shoot it out of the sky.
Anyone could be guilty or innocent. I can't believe Harris is complicit in this evil. If NASA launches the gravity tractor then the Russians will shoot it out of the sky. Because they will think we are weaponizing another asteroid. But if Tanz Industries were to launch it as a private entity with Russian oversight.....
- You're a raccoon, exactly. And, all of a sudden, they stand on two legs, straight up, that's very rare. They have tails that look like dyed Swiffer dusters. Did Swiffer dusters even exist in the 1960s? With little human hands that will gouge out your eye and eat it like a grape.
Anything you want. Do you have a souvenir from a movie? Anything you took with you that is special to you? Tell us what? I have my Three Amigos costume. - Do you wear it sometimes?
Do you have a souvenir from a movie? Something you took with you that is special to you? Tell us what? I have my Three Amigos costume. - Do you wear it sometimes? - If I wore it again?
What's up, everybody? - Hey, space grandma. - Hi. Well, you hired the caterer I like. A melon that spent three weeks in the fridge and when you eat it, it looks spicy.
- Even if that seems like, as I see it, you have the opportunity to make one more friend or one less friend. - Donna. - Rachel. Can I get you anything? Coffee? Tea? Your article in The Sunday Times? I don't need it.
There must be an incident report. There might be, but you have no right to see it. We're a private corporation. It's confidential information. How about giving me the names of the guards who saw it?
I'm so sorry, Donna. I'm sorry too, Rachel. - Harvey, it's late. Whatever it is... - Did you pass that thing on to the clinic? You asked me to drop it, and I dropped it.
- Harvey, it's late. Whatever it is... - Did you pass that thing on to the clinic? You asked me to drop it, and I dropped it. Bullshit. You gave it to the legal clinic you're affiliated with. You gave it to the legal clinic you're affiliated with.
I wanted to make sure you don't have a conflict with anyone. Does your client's grandmother shop at the grocery store across the street from number 12? I'll take a look. Because I want to be clear that if I had known about the conflict, I would never have taken that case. - I appreciate you dropping it.
Does your client's grandmother shop at the grocery store on the sidewalk in front of number 12? I'll take a look. Because I want to be clear that if I had known about the conflict, I would never have taken that case. - I appreciate you dropping it. - I was forced to drop it just like I was forced to sign this.
This is good, isn't it? Where is it? Bite that. Please trust me. I've found it!
I like them... a lot. Are you having fun with the color? Oh, the color. The color is amazing. At first, I didn't understand it, but now it amazes me.
- She has everything on record. - But she didn't prosecute the case. You didn't hear right. She prosecuted it. But she didn't want to pursue it.
- Did you believe what he told you? - Of course I did. He was beaten and was in the infirmary for two weeks. - Then why didn't you prosecute the case? - I did prosecute.
- Yes. My name is Harvey Specter. I hear you're filing a class action lawsuit. That's right. How can I help you? Our pro bono work means a lot to us. We take it very seriously. - I have a difficult question for you.
- Which one? I need to know if you are comfortable with the way your case is being handled. If Mike Ross isn't doing everything he can to help... Wait, wait, wait. Mr. Ross has dedicated himself to seeking justice for my son. And not only that, when I was offered a settlement, he convinced me to turn it down and find the truth. Tell whoever's in charge that I don't want anyone else working on this case besides Mike and Oliver.
Your Honor, the lawsuit revolves around the testimony of a convicted felon. Not to mention that the entire lawsuit is about criminals seeking an opportunity to get even with the prisons that did their duty by incarcerating them. This case does not hinge on the word of Frank Gallo. It hinges on the word of a federal prosecutor who had reason to suspect abuse in those supposedly upstanding prisons. That file is inadmissible. It was not presented to us during discovery.
It's a test of how much you can hit without getting hit. The brutality is inherent in both its charm and its demise. Once upon a time in America, everyone loved boxing. When boxers like Dempsey, Louis, Marciano, Ali and Tyson were the kings of the world. For American boxers who still believe in boxing, why do they do it, and what does it take to be a champion?
And they all get desperate and angry, and he says, "I'm Cam F. Awesome. What did you expect?" They say, "What's he doing? That's horrible." FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION They don't understand his style, but the fighters he faces...they do.
Five without chili. Here we say chili. It's the same thing, isn't it? We take the perico out of here. We take it to Cuba. And directly to Miami.
My memory is not the problem. That unit requires a single crystalline piece to operate it. We extracted that crystal from a meteorite that Darius had. And it's the only one of its kind on Earth. The most unique and important device in human history, and no one at Tan Industries thought to properly investigate the man who built it?
No student loans and a mom who can't pay her own bills. This job would literally change my life. Yeah, it's a big deal. Can I tell you something that will probably sound crazy to you? Before I moved here, I took a hundred dollar bill, and I put it in an envelope.
Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Here is the manuscript, as promised. On the agreed date. I will read it carefully.
Apparently, 400,000 copies have been sold. Really? That's fantastic! Isn't it great? A lot of people are reading it.
Excuse me. Oh, hello. Please accept my condolences. Let's see. This was found on the victim's body. You can keep it.
It didn't cost me much, but it ruined my plan. Your plan? It was Midori Suzumura who had to die. If the victim of that fire had been a teenage orphan, people would have liked it more. They would have enjoyed it.
It took me a while, but I'm with you now. And the distance and the money and Sam.... We'll figure it out. Speaking of which... Sam! We're going to Clayton today and I'm not giving you your lunch money. But Beth, Evan's sister, will have it, and she'll be looking for you during fifth period.
It really gives it a lot of shine. Nothing can give that much sparkle. - A diamond? - A very big one. - But why don't we see it?
How's it going? How's Doug? We went out last night. And it was a disaster. Every time there's a special moment, I ruin it.
Don't do it. - I need your permission to jump. - Get the hell out of here. - Not without your permission. - Okay, you got it.
- Not without your permission. - Okay, you got it. Give me my breakfast. - I want it in writing. - I'll tattoo it on your face, if you want.
What's with the fuzz? Confidence crisis? Fuzz? It's a mustache. - Is that what you call it?
Time to go to the bathroom. This is the common area. Good for relaxing. As you will see, I prepared everything for a long stay. The aquaponic system purifies the air and keeps it fresh.
What I just gave you is called pancuronium bromide. It's a paralytic. It's a little pinprick. Don't worry, it's safe. I tried it myself.
Yes, for now. Not forever? We are not prophets. When are you going to tell me what we are? While the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we wizards protect it from mystical threats.
You think of Indians. Or Germans. Or any road that leads to glory. Stop it, Jack! I'm not finished, Mother. You're coming back a failure. The papers say so.
Get up, everybody. Right now! Let's go, let's go. Hurry up. Robbery is a very serious crime, my boy. Mr. Turner was very angry last night when you reported it.
And you abandoned that baby before it learned to fly. Books don't fly and babies don't fly. How do you know? Tell you what? If I had a baby that flew, I wouldn't tell the press.
Welcome back. Thank you. That's nice. Let's get this equipment out of here. They probably want it.
The 4%! Abby, Abby... We all believe in the scientific method... I've devoted my whole life to it. And we... in fact, we did it.
I am very well. I'm glad you found my tube. You found my tube. I pulled it out of the dumpster yesterday. I'll use it for my proton gun.
You're Alan Larsson, yes? Yes. Have we met? No, I've seen your picture on the back of his book. Your memoir. I studied it at Northwestern University.
Stable Relationship Vagina. You really need to take care of that. What are you talking about? I barely have any hair. It looks like a hairbrush fell out, and your vagina caught it.
Good Lord! A noise? A high-pitched one, like... the sound of a bunny in a bear trap. You'll understand when it comes. Because you'll be the one to do it.
Tell Jeff to meet me at his father's building. We'll get in the pool. And I'll go naked, so he won't worry about me having a gun. Because I'll bite his dick off - and spit it on his wife.
You know, Bob, I think I'm going to introduce you to Pablo. But first I need you to solve a little problem. Alcaino says that Don Chepe's $10 million is frozen, that it's actually Pablo Escobar's money. And he doesn't care that our government did it. He wants his money and it won't be over until he gets it.
She'll be fine. - Are you okay, sweetie? - She's fine. These people are crazy. I know I sound like a broken record, but I've heard it and I've seen it.
You have a purpose. You're always happy. How's your book coming along? I've never written about myself before. I think it's some of the best work I've ever done and I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Hurry up! - Jim! - Okay. Computer control restored. Venting the reactor. But we fixed it!
Very smart, Holly. Thank you, Holly. Seemed the same to me. Why did you throw cold coffee at me? I got it in the hallway.
Rewind. Pause. - What did he take from the table? - A jar of red caviar. He took it from the store in the front.
Have you ever eaten fat-free cheese? What cheese? - Fat-free. Your hands. - What cheese is like that? You'll taste it.
Doorman. Well, thank you. My dear sister De Sasha was hanged with a belt. If we find it, we'll reenact the crime.
- Alone? With Mr. Guskov. What? Is it illegal? Mr. Guskov is a suspect in the murder of Novikova last night. Are you sure you don't want to change your testimony before I write it up?
Please believe me. I am listening. I forgot this amulet at Alyona's house. The night she was killed. I remembered it on my way home.
Call me right away. If it had been another guy instead of Boris, the girls would have worked it out. But instead of paying, Boris probably tortured Liza and she told him everything. What about Sergey's amulet? Boris probably took it from Alyona's apartment and planted it on Liza's body.
Wow, now you have money? You don't even work. It's not too late for you to wash your plate. If you want it clean, you wash it. As for the money, Mommy, I'll ask my dear, loving Daddy.
Maybe he got something wrong or didn't hear me right. We agreed that... We agreed it would be a table by the window. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. There was a mistake, we'll fix it now.
The x-rays and medical records were also missing. It was as if the patient had never been here. That was in the report. Tell me something I don't know. When we were taking x-rays of the spinal cord, we discovered a foreign body in the stomach. We performed a gastroscopy and removed it.
But it was soon discontinued and banned. Why? Even in cases of mild overdose, the drug caused convulsions, psychomotor agitation and numbness. Now, it is only manufactured in clandestine laboratories. They call it "angel dust".
- Hey, hey, let's hear it. Uh, I think we're ready for registration. No, really, that's the smart way to go. Okay. But, so, so, just to be clear, it takes money directly out of our account and invests it.
You're too late. I'm already drunk and horny. Oh, sorry, I forgot to turn you on. I had to finish the paperwork you ignored. I didn't ignore it.
Now, you've been faithful Ray, a loyal fucker, but in this matter, I'm going to require a level of loyalty that may be a little off-putting to you Are you prepared for that? I hope so. Now, this girl, do you know how she came to have our product? I don't think she bought it.
But I won't let that misstep ruin his life. That boy has a bright future ahead of him and not even God or the damn federal government is going to dim that light. Now grab the gun and do as I tell you. Don't forget your money. You've earned it.
Well... I hope you enjoy our little slice of Heaven... as much as we do. I hope you enjoy our little slice of Heaven... as much as we do. - You'll be all right? - Yeah. I'll be fine, it's just, it's just a kid. I've got a first aid kit in the car, I'll get it.
It's too traumatic. I don't want to talk about it. We like traumatic stories. I mean, not just me, but in general. Plus trauma brings people together...so you can totally talk to us about it. Trauma brings people together who experience it... not the people who tell the story...
Just like... Just like the angel of death (grim reaper) I guess I'm going to die in these mountains anyway... so... I don't know... Just a nickname. I didn't ask for it.
Check it out. Suck my fucking balls! No, thanks. How am I supposed to work with... this fucking second-rate equipment? Is that what the ladies are calling it now?
I have to... Damn man, can't you see I'm busy here? Shit, that's a lot of woman. Yeah, what do you want that's so important... that you have to spoil my show of love? You're gonna give that man a heart attack. Say it again, I didn't get it.
We will fuck their pussy. We'll fuck their little brown hole. Turn that shit off. And we'll fuck their eye hole too! What's that sound? Do you hear it?
Let me read you some numbers. Tell me what shows up on your screen. For the genetic mapping rate, I have 3021 atoms per microsecond. - That's what I have. - Are you running a diagnostic? - I'm running it.
All this, of course, perfectly evident from her perfume. Her perfume? Yes, your perfume, which brings revelations to me and disaster to you. Why? Because I have recognized it and you have not.
Pardon? Not "he", "she". Yes, yes, of course. Well, thank you very much for the fascinating case. I'll send you a telegram when I've sorted it out.
Darling, you've gone very pale. It's nothing! - Eustace... - Did you keep the envelope? My husband destroyed it, but it was blank.
That watch you're wearing, there's a photograph inside. I took a look at it once. I think it's Irene Adler's. You didn't glance at it, you waited till I was asleep... - and you looked at it.
- It can't be true, Holmes, it can't! - No, it can't. It's called 'Pepper's Ghost'. 'A simple reflection in glass of a living person'. His only mistake was breaking the glass when it was removed.
Dear Jesus, thank you for this beautiful dinner.... - Amen. - Amen. Can you lend JD your car on Friday? What time are you leaving? He only needs it in the morning...but we both have to go out.
No. The hospital has not issued a statement yet. I need to speak to the person in charge, please. Dr. Lynn, do you have the medical report? I'll get it now.
Did he do this to you? Press room. Phil. I have unofficially confirmed that he is dead. - Alan. Thank God! Arledge decided to feature your breakthrough and Cosell aired it on Monday Night Football.
This animal appeared in my dream. Standing on a river bank, as if it were waiting for me! Oh Priest, what does it mean? This unicorn... How did this seal come into your hands? My uncle gave it to me for my protection.
Convert it into vacation apartments. To be fair, they don't want to, but they're also broke. How much do they want, if you don't mind me asking? That's the crazy thing. They are prepared for Dad to buy it for 300k to keep it as a pub, but he has three other pubs with the same problem.
Oh, dear God. Clever title. Absolutely. I meant that sarcastically. Okay, I'll read it.
Oh, silly me. Darren, I think you'll need to readjust my microphone. Mr. Rose, I've read your protégé's effort and I think it might be worth taking on. Look at you, there's strange about him. - Strange? - I can't put my finger on it, but I've given it to Mr. Bonar to read carefully.
- Mom, what is an "attractive fantasy"? You're too young to understand. And so are you, young lady. I want to read Aunt Zoe's book. - Where have you hidden it?
Like I damn well should be. You know what? What was the new deal? Yeah, of course. What you didn't know is that he never signed it.
She'll bring good fortune to our house. Put her there. God, a little female harrier! Did you catch it yourself? Yes, she went and got it.
Reid... not afraid to trust you to go so far? I remember little of the trip. I only know that the days seemed very long... And that we seemed to have traveled hundreds of miles. I think we've done it all.
Really. You want the arm? It's yours, you can have it. - No, thanks. No, thanks. - Come on, you know you want it. You know you want it.
He knows he wants it. Who doesn't want an arm that can throw a fastball? I'm sure you do. Really. You really don't?
Who doesn't want an arm that can throw a fastball? I'm sure you do. Really. You really don't? - I sure as hell don't want it.
- What? Anyway, how's your rehearsal going? Aunt Alexandra in the formation of... I can read it alone. Who wrote it?
You told me next week. It's been five weeks, don't you think? Yeah, he's fucking with you. Yeah... I'll get it. I just don't have it right now.
Yeah, you lost a lot of blood. Where's your bandage? It was annoying. What? So, I took it off.
He will be with you for a long, long time. I wasn't dying. I wasn't, that's a lie. You're full of shit. After he gets his first sip of blood, he'll want it all the time.
But if we can remove the signal, we can take down an entire sector. - Where do the signals come from? - Control stations. A system of servers and communications equipment. So why not blow it up with C-4?
Y... What if it doesn't? Very unlikely. The file has more than 750 billion characters. And it executes 16 million attempts per second. Believe me, it will find it.
Right? She's beautiful and Asian! Michael, will you shut the fuck up? Shut the fuck up! Look, tell the fucking Armenian I got his money and I'm sending it now.
Kieran was inside. It's a small place, in the summer there are no guards. He was locked in a locker on the second floor. No one came out guilty. Whoever did it never admitted it. They never caught him. The kids called it the coffin locker.
Josefina, please. Sir, we are closed, you must leave. Come. She's waiting for her toy, she won't go to sleep. He'll fix it. See?
- He didn't make the Mickey emblem. - He bought it. - Did he buy it? Did he make the Mickey emblem? Did he go to a metal store and make it?
Last weekend. - Good. - I'll tell you. Okay, read it to me. "Dear Emily, I took off the necklace you gave me and put it away.
It will have to fall and fail. We're not as scared as we used to be. I think it will be fine. The future? I'm still looking for it.
Move! We can't allow this. I want you to go out there, find our new friend, and bring him to me, alive. I want to peel the skin off his body in front of his wife, and I want to hear him scream! And I'm going to cut his damn heart out, and feed it to whoever brings him to me.
Your little fire cost us four months of work. What? You didn't have fire insurance? I should have aimed the arrow in your eye. So, let me guess. You were making your product and selling it with these idiots and your friends over there.
Destroyer is the biggest criminal the city has ever seen. And we had him! And now he's on the loose. And where did you find this highly secure vehicle? We found it under the George Washington Bridge, abandoned and empty.
Sorry we're late, April. Can you tell me what happened here? Okay, so I went to see Baxter and Destroyer was there. He was talking about opening some kind of portal to another dimension, and then... He took a purple liquid and injected it into the two criminals that escaped with him.
Listen up. You two by the portal device. I'll take these two. What do you mean, "by the device"? Finish the guards, wait for Donnie's signal, and shut it down.
But I had a good reason not to tell you the truth. I'm listening. Do you know what warranty margin is? Of course I know what margin calls for. Well, I owe a lot of money and if I don't pay it back, I'm finished, that's the end of me.
Well, guess what? Now it's double. And I want $25,000 and I want it right now. - How am I going to get 25...? - I know you have emergency money and I want it right now, Greg.
I like to negotiate. I love a challenge. Turning a no into a yes. But I really like money. I like knowing I have it.
He came running toward me. I should have fought for my life. Mr. Four was 78 years old and had an oxygen tank. Did you have the knife with you? No. I took it out of the kitchen.
What's going on here, Mr. Day? She tossed a lit cigarette by the pump. I put it out. Is that how people put out cigarettes at a car window? Some people put it out in their mouth.
What experience do you have? Remind me. Who are you? Look, when he walked into this room on the first day, he was wearing the cloak of presumed innocence. He still does, and he'll stay that way. But if he testifies, he loses it.
He had the state of mind to flee a crime scene to remove evidence that would implicate him in the crime to operate a motor vehicle without hitting anything but did he not have the state of mind to dial three numbers on his phone? The Prophet Muhammad said something to the effect. "Hasten with all the strength of your legs to him who needs help." Is that what you did for Andrea? Here's the thing, Mr. Khan and you know it.
From that night until now, he has been the only suspect the police have considered. Because... Because he was and is the only killer of this beautiful young woman. This is not a pocketknife or a fruit knife. This knife was designed to cut flesh and that is what Mr. Khan used it to cut sinew, muscle, bone and heart twenty-two times.
They think he's not crazy. He is crazy. I saw him backstage. RZA MUSICIAN He wasn't smoking the joint. He was eating it.
No. And because of that, he never learned to deal with adversity as an adult. How many people here bought my new album, CONNquest? You're all liars! I know you didn't buy it!
I'll never leave this stage! I'm going to die here! That's enough of that. Owen, go get your gear. I've got it right here.
I was never there. Now I remember. Now I remember what happened! I missed and you wrote the whole verse. You wrote it and I never acknowledged it to you, because guess what?
What? ! Sergeant Mims was the first detective on the scene. Son of a bitch. They tagged and bagged him before he got there.
The van leaves, the patrol cars show up, I wrote it down, I mean, if they're not interested, that's fine. Oh, no, no, we're interested. We'd love to see the plate number. I wrote it down.
I don't remember all the details, but... I do remember Mrs. Graham crying in the tool shed. A lot of them were broken and lying all over the place, I think she said your father had lost his temper and wrecked everything. My father wrecked... Yes, but that wasn't the reason for his crying, I'm sure of that. My father had his temper, but he kept it in check.
King Henry's crown? Then keep bowing, and kiss the ground till it also girdles your head. Stretch out your arm, reach for the glorious gold, Is it too short? Let mine lengthen it, and as soon as we lift, together, that glory, together we'll lift our eyes to heaven.
Yes, Marguerite, sorrow fills my soul. Oh, Uncle Humphrey! I see in your face the image of honor, honesty and loyalty. You never offended them, nor others. And just as the slaughterer takes the calf, ties up the wretched man, and beats him if he resists, dragging him to the bloody slaughterhouse, so with the same coldness has he been taken away.
You forget that we put you to flight in combat and killed your father, tender Clifford. I remember it, Warwick, to my sorrow. Plantagenet, I will wring more lives from you, your sons, kith and kin, than there were drops in my father's blood. Would you have me prove our right to the crown? If not, our swords will do it in battle.
You poison my eyes. Thine eyes, sweet lady, have poisoned mine. If vengeful, thy heart spare me not, Show not on thy lips such contempt, For kiss, and not scorn, profiteth them. Behold, I lend thee my pointed sword, which, if it please thee to plunge into my loyal breast, and bring forth the soul that adores thee, naked I offer it to thy deadly retaliation.
Henry VI prophesied that Richmond would be King, when Richmond was only a raptor. A King? Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. My lord, your pledge of the county. Richmond! The last time I was in Exeter, as a courtesy the Lord Mayor showed me the castle, and called it Rougemont:
What happened? I found it. Found what? The wolf. Where did you see him?
You should have left him alone. I did! Come on! Damn it! We'll be leaving soon, and you know... The birds will eat him in the morning.
I'm going to need you to be brave, okay? I need you to be brave. I need you to be braver, than you've ever been. I can distract it. I can use the fire, I can use it.
Communications on the Donnager were tapped during the attack. The only Martians who believed us are dead. So, let's accelerate to Ceres and take our chances. No port is going to let us dock with our transponder off. And as soon as we turn it on, every Martian ship in the system will know about it.
Do you feel safe? Come on, let's let them do their thing and go have a drink in the crew lounge. Are you sure? I could use a drink. We'll put it on Fred's tab.
- Who said you could talk? - I did. Just get on with it. That's not going to help either. If you cut the power to the magnetic seal, the back of the cabinet will engage and keep it locked.
We're about to have company. I'll finish you, before I let you finish them. You got a clean shot. In the back of the head. Use it if you need to.
Get it under control. You are the only one who can. There are things in life worth waiting for. It's like getting another slab of stone. Look, I know we've had a rather bad start, but we got through it okay.
A credible story about reactor failures and an urgent need to dock for a while. We don't think they'll buy it. It doesn't matter. They'll have us out the door in three days and that's not enough time for Fred Johnson to dismantle and hide an entire stealth program, is it? Yes, that's assuming they have it.
Yeah, yeah, I used to spout all kinds of bullshit back in the day. Like how the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Look, when I was kicked off the force I gave you that hat so you'd keep your head and not make the same mistakes I did. I must have forgotten it in Ceres. Yes, you forgot it in Ceres.
But we believe they are deliberately altering your engine signature. What is your ETA? Approximately two days, sir. Keep me posted. You said you cracked it.
Hey, Roach. Roach, come meet these guys. Who stole my fucking burrito? No, there it is, Roach. I just moved it to make room for my coleslaw.
Did you tell them or keep the secret to yourself? Blah-blah-blah. What does that mean? It means blah-blah-blah. - Does it mean you kept it to yourself?
If they're talking about me, I'm here. You've got a problem, Gabe! Please don't provoke him. May I make a suggestion? If you three would change your baritone to a bassitone...and then raise it a half-tone...you'd have a beautiful three-part harmony.
There's mud here. Be careful. What am I gonna...? This mud? Yeah, I found it.
I have a giant donut! That's awesome. - My ice cream! - He dropped the ice cream. How do we clean it up?
It's a weird time to talk about it, but it's a discontinued model. It's got metallic gray on... It's our candidate, guys! I just want to thank everyone for their hard work. I really appreciate it.
Now, you know this nasty old freeloading whore is still on my nice couch. -It's a futon. -It's a professional sectional. Anyway, we can gas up the air mattress, baby, and put it right in the living room.
(laughs) And you! Detention for the whole week. I have soccer practice! Not my problem. I love your outfit. Where did you get it?
It's not my problem. I love your outfit. Where did you get it? Salvation Army? (laughs) No, I got it from someone named Lady Gaga.
Join the club. I've noticed that you've been taking a ... very unusual approach with your students. Well, Principal Wayne, some of the kids are assholes, and I have to treat them accordingly. The language you use I would argue is not appropriate for some. Some of them deserve it.
They didn't believe us. "I don't take care of mice," I told them, "You have rats." We used a wonderful... pesticide, it was thallium sulfate. I don't get it anymore.
No. We had to use other methods. A rat has the ability to learn from its mistakes. When poison is applied, rats act very cunningly. They observe it for about three or four days.
Oliver. Olivia. Come on! Die! We'll try to solve the rat problem or at least get it under control.
Unfortunately that is the problem. We can't keep the boat if it can't work and it can't work if the engine doesn't work. Let's take out a loan. And pay it back with what? We rent it until the loan is paid off, obviously.
Do you have any ambitions other than putting bags of farts on people? I don't have a fart bag. I know men your age who still have ambitions. But whatever. - Here's your shampoo. - Keep it if you need it.
Oh, shit! You scared me. You scared me. Why? Am I scary? I told you you can't stay here. My car's at the Chevron, the alternator's busted, and they'll fix it by tomorrow.
Look at the world, In my dreams, I see it, I see it as plain as day, Goin' from the world's to hell in a hand basket, Charlie sees it, too, And when it comes, Frankie, take your mother and you just come to Charlie,
Hi. - Take care of him. - I will. Where did you get that? Your friend just gave it to me.
- Great. - Come on, my love. That's the guesthouse where you'll be staying. Oh, that's great. And this is a barn. We converted it into a dog kennel a few years ago.
Ali Khan is afraid of them, Mr. Nakhararyan. Not exactly, but what others feel about trees, I feel about the desert. The desert? It's just scrub and sand. That's what I like:
Before that, you know what they did? If somebody had their leg shredded in some battle.... They put the rest of the stump of that leg in boiling oil. And you think this God of yours... What did he do? Did he smell that smell of burning flesh and enjoy it?
But he has the blood of a giant. And you're trained. Fair enough. Benjen always raises his chin when he's about to charge. And he lowers it when he's about to feint, my lady.
Let them go, let them go. Look man, we're just trying to get off the island. There's the problem. Danny. You guys don't get it.
I see it all. However... I didn't expect to find you. The anomalies of my creations are always so fascinating. Jason, you will stand beside me and help me clean up this world, and bring it back to perfection.
It could have been dropped from a ship. There is a lighthouse, so she could have been thrown close to land. We have confirmed that there is a lot of blood on the paper. We know someone's name starts with P. I think a child wrote it. "Man" is misspelled, and it says mom and dad, right?
The original was built by George Washington more than 200 years ago. He liked to have tunnels connected to all his structures. They are all over Washington. The tunnel under the original church was closed in the 1950s. But we reopened it.
New suit, Arthur? Uh, what? No no no no. It's, uh... You can wear it for the rest of your dinner.
I'm sorry, sir. It's mine. Godfrey, get that phone out! I'm sorry, sir. I'll turn it off immediately!
Walker, help him with the phone. Walker, get him a job... Frazer, stop talking and help him with the phone. I've got it. I've got it. I got it, sir.
Walker, get a job... Frazer, stop talking and help him with the phone. I've got it. I've got it, sir. I got it, sir. Shall I hold it for you?
Time is short, so I will be plain and offer you the same terms accepted by Captain Hallendale's men in the afternoon. Surrender, and I am authorized to offer you full, unqualified pardons. If he is to be requisitioned and given a choice of entering my service or being set at liberty at the nearest convenient port, his names will be cleared and his accounts squared. with his pardons and I will grant him no quarter. Do you think they will take it?
We're with the strawberries. Here, I'll give you back the book. What is it? It's an absolutely fantastic text on terrorism. - Yes? You didn't tell me about it.
I thought you could still hang out here without me... with the guys. I don't think so, no. I hope you like flowers. It would be a shame if the garden was abandoned. I've worked so hard!
Right after that I found your diary. I was wondering where I lost it. Yeah, I thought about giving it back to you but for some reason I didn't want to give it to you in front of Cathy. I mean, I didn't read it, I don't know if it talks about her, but I imagine it does, it's a diary. And then, I forgot I had it.
All the time I spent sitting in my car, waiting, and all the time I wasted not seeing you in front of the time I did see you. What you don't remember, but I do, is the time you got home and were so happy to make it, you forgot about everything else. No! I didn't want you to feel guilty for making me drive there. The happier the memory, the less likely you are to remember it. Okay. You know?
- Did he speak? - No, I swear he didn't. He owes me $7,000. Where the fuck is my money? I don't know, but I know you'll get it back.
Just... go back. The 94 is my favorite. It has a combination of scorched earth, and plums and like an incense. I guess you like whiskey. I'd drink nail polish remover if they gave it to me.
If the Unsullied are deployed to reconquer Astapor and Yunkai, who will be left here to defend the free people of Meereen? If we don't fight them, how can we stop them? We can't. The masters speak only one language. With me they spoke it for many years.
So tree-hugger, huh? Well, I'm gonna hug it for real. Oh, come on, Freddie, we can't take down a tree with a gay man on top of it. Ugh, no. I make a homophobic comment, and they throw it right back in my face acting exactly like the kind of tree-hugging faggot.
It's hard when he's away. Yes, I'm so sorry, Kitty. Tell me something... How did Richard Crooks get the record? She gave it to him.
And no one would like to see you... succeed here more than me, obviously. But, this place is just... It's so big, you know. It's almost a thousand, three thousand people. Well, Lily Pons' voice filled it.
It's not going to be like they want it to be. Cheddar already told them, we're not here... Shit! Did you see that? Did he do that?
I mean, I think everyone should have a pet. What's its name? Cancer. Wait, wait, um... Why... would you call him that?
In the bidet. Water was splashing everywhere. She goes in, slips... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The bidet was open? Oh, I don't recommend it for newbies.
What do you think? - Who is the other guy? - Martin. He was a Panther, but it didn't work out. Vernon was labeled a genius as a kid wrongly... and he never got over it.
Odd? Hey. Where's the damn money? It's safe. I put it in the Fireman's Fund.
- Only 99 cents. - Isn't that amazing? David. What do you know about your program? They didn't accept it. So, if they don't accept it... you know, it's over.
You sound nostalgic. It was nice, yes. When I was a kid I had a huge mahogany desk. It's still there. And I remember asking for it specifically for my eighth birthday.
I hope you are feeling better. Hey, are you okay? I didn't get the program, so... Shit, I'm sorry. Yeah, they gave it to another guy.
Damn it. - Are those blocked too? We're stuck in here. Rocky, the remote. You got it?
Any memories? We harvest from the bottom up. We went through this field twice already. Every step we choose, from the lowest level. It's been empty since I bought it.
I have something for you. It's hers. It's for you. I found it for you. How did you get it?
The female body is complex, at once fragile and formidable, vulnerable and courageous. It carries the seed of hope, our youth, the weight of our fears. It can nourish and tremble... inspire and terrify. It oppresses and protects us, contains all that we are, protecting less than desired.
And I believe that in Orthodox traditions, Lent ends today. When I was a child my nurse never let me eat every morsela in front of me. There should always be something left for Mr. Manners. I know Mr. Manners is a myth. And his madness is appeased with delicacies of all kinds. And now we take our right arm and raise it.
No, I was wondering if you could teach me how to use it? I have an LP I'd like to listen to. Oh, how romantic. It's just to soak up the Latin mentality... to speak better Spanish. Of course it is. In that case, rather than teach you how to use it, I'll play it for you myself.
Then you will take a hot bath to help you relax. The heat intensifies the effects of castor oil. He's not alone, is he? Dr. Turner is with him. Johnny's expecting this baby. And I promise you he'll see it.
She must have been a great teacher. I think that's more than obvious. But I enjoy the work. And I can say that you do too. Don't you miss it?
The photo is my souvenir. I've been in Hayward for 27 years. My husband did 30. He got his service watch before he died. Ian wears it now.
Rules are strict in maternity wards. It helps babies get into a routine. Many new mothers find it helpful. Although the baby would prefer to see more of the father. If they were to give birth at home. I want the gas, but not the one at home but from the machine. Someone told me that if you have it at home you get gas from the stove and I think that's dangerous.
I'll be downstairs. I'll have to break up with him before we leave Libya. How do they leave me on the D if the party is here? About the Ambassador story... I don't believe it.
We've got to go. Okay. See you! Okay, bye. The accent on the message, you figured it out.
The miracle is that I didn't get shot in my good eye. Damn it, where's my knife? Milady. Well, where did you get this? My lord gave it to me.
When you played with him, who won? I did. Just because he's dead doesn't mean I should alter the facts. What will happen to this place? Sooner or later, the bank will take it over.
Get my dad's ring back. Remember what he was like before he got addicted? Eddie's a good guy at heart. To me, that ring is what's left of him. He didn't get to pawn it just because I took it from him.
During his absence, Chico Diaz, his informant from the barbershop shooting, disappeared. Scarfe was the last to see him. That's not true. Scarfe left the police station to look for Chico, but he wasn't there. He searches for a witness unsupervised, against protocol, doesn't even search him and has time to get to Genghis Connie's before anyone else.
Do they have lunch breaks like real employees? Were any of them at Crispus Attucks the other night? No, man. I don't need those motherfuckers. Aisha's ring. You got it?
Azie. It was always violent. But people carried the old ladies' shopping bags. Your name meant something. Maybe that's why they call it "back in the day."
I should be out doing my job. Your job awaits you, detective. The question is how badly you want it.
Chris Denby. From the New York Post. Yeah, right. I have to watch my makeup all day. I hate it! - You're doing it for Ian, so...
So I got nothing again? You ruin everything. And you weren't going to use it to pay our ransom? Of course I was. But it's more than obvious you don't need it.
He raised the price. That's the way they are, they don't understand reason. Do you think I'm an idiot? I'll keep the money. I collected it, I gave you half.
I don't even really know her. We need to save as many people as possible before this thing happens. Wait. Where's your Gateway watch? I don't have it yet.
Mmm. Like what? Oh, just some stupid shit. Like why we never signed a stupid record deal. I put everything I had into that record, and then they totally scrapped it.
He is Key Flo, a big-time drug dealer. One day, while working on his alarm, Key Flo got caught. They put his ass behind bars. What they didn't know is that there was a lot of money in his house. And I considered it payment for all the work I did.
I don't know, but you can't stay here. - You must leave. - It's almost dark. They're going to purge my ass. Baby, I saw how they do it.
- And I would be right behind. - God! Shame on you! Look at this. Are you a black vampire? It's ironic that they're called Black, because their name is... Don't say it, bitch.
Let's go. I thought we could get out of here. We gotta go! Does asbestos smell like grass? Cause that's what I smell.
I will take care of them. You go ahead. Be careful, Dad. You stole the money and ran off to California like I couldn't find you. You took Key Flo's money and I need it.
Good stuff. Story time. Well, every week, the fat man...he'd go into the store and collect all the grease. And the grease would be stored in a garbage can. When the fat man came in, I'd take the can out to the street and wash it out.
You're welcome. Hi. Come on in. He gave up the case. He assigned it to me and he doesn't want the firm to waste time on it so I'm looking for outside help.
This is for one or two months. That's fair enough. I said two or three months, not one or two. And where will the money come from? His parents don't have it.
It's an anesthetic that's used in horses. Why would anyone take that? Why would Michael Jackson take propofol? It's the same thing. - He took it to sleep, didn't he?
How's the house? Anything that needs work, I can always come by and fix it. Kyle doesn't do that sort of thing, does he? He doesn't have to. He pays for others to do it.
Kyle didn't like it, so he took it out. He didn't like them? I mean, who likes recycled wood shelves? Jesus. I mean...half of us build the world, half of us destroy it.
What the hell happened here? Kyle had an accident. He had an accident with the door frame? How can you do that? Why didn't he repair it?
If you have a six, then you can ask me if I have a six. Oh, I see! Then you take it and make a pair. If I already have a pair, what should I do? You put it on the deck.
He has heart problems! - No, no, no, no! - Get out of the way! Just give me my money. We don't have it anymore.
Mom. Oh, no. We'll take it back. Well, it's because we're fixing the car. No one was supposed to say anything. She says, she was gonna ask you to fix it anyway.
[Boom] [gasp] [Distant explosion] It's impressive, isn't it? They put on that show a couple times a month. Yeah, I've seen it from my house.
Your bar? The I... Yo... Yoknapatawpha. We call it El Yonk.
So brush up, see you tomorrow. Hi, honey. How did you like the show? - You happy? - You missed it.
They're so much fun, huh? And they get along so well. Yeah, they hardly ever argue. By the way... Did you listen to the record? Sorry, I'll get it back to you soon.
To me, there was a sexual act that may be related to your daughter's death. So what do you suggest I do? You want my advice, Mr. Bamberski? You want to know the truth, but it's unbearable. I suggest you burn this document and forget the whole thing.
Maybe I wanted something to happen. - I'm a bad mother. - Of course you're not. I didn't know her. - I didn't even know she kept a diary. - You haven't read it?
And when will this project come up in committee? I think September. Couldn't they do it sooner? I don't control the program, hon. How will Clyde handle it if you won't be around by then?
She has a jewelry line. - It's not a line yet. - It will be. What do you mean? You mean you did it?
Well, I am honored by your dedication to celebrate my birthday. The other day, Clyde asked me why I insisted on not getting presents, and I said something like we don't need more stuff, which is true. We don't need more stuff, but... I think what I really meant was that you don't need to give me anything, because you're here, and that's a very good gift. But if you have, you know, an albino crocodile, I get it.
But I see her now and she is becoming herself. She's become an artist. Well, I like the sound of that. Say that again. Your work is beautiful. And it makes the people who wear it beautiful.
I still remember watching you practice, you know, there was one time when you were practicing a passage. I think it was Brahms. And you just wouldn't stop. You would do it over and over and over and over again. You were so... determined... to master it, you know. You still do.
Yes. It's not very good, I know. But... I'm just getting started. A kangaroo with a switch for a head. What do you call it... kanguptor?
Give me a reason! Let's see if you dare! It got a little heated in there, huh? I don't want to talk about it. You have to tell me what's going on with you and this case. You know we won't solve it until you do.
The infiltration was easy. Who wants to go to the beach? Don't put on your swimsuit yet. We've turned his hideout upside down and haven't found the flash drive. At best Nafan still has it.
# An old woman came onto the track # # Bobby carried her on his back # # I'm gonna run all night and all day # # I'll bet my money on the short-tailed rocino # And I'll carry him on my back in an old sack or something!
If you want a final judgment against me, you will have to pass it yourself, just as I intend to do myself. - I am not your judge. - Yes, you are. You are the only one who knows me, just as I know you! Do you think the world stops when you leave it behind?
He see us in a store, do not want to say... His whore wears your mother's dress. I gave it to her. Well, Chang's following the trail. And he'll follow it all the way to your contract with Sze Yup.
When I was a child, people didn't talk about miracles. I'm not sure I understood what they were or if I believed in them. A miracle is defined... as something that is not explained by scientific or natural laws. But then, how do you explain it?
I am his mother. I knew it. I knew something was wrong. I'm not sure Anna can wait any longer. I'm so sorry. I want to help her... I really do, but I've been at this job for two weeks and I need it.
That would be wonderful, doctor. However, there is the possibility of certain side effects. Headaches, diarrhea, bloating... and some are more dangerous like cardiac arrhythmia. Because of that, I need to see her every 6 weeks to monitor her. I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't think it was worth the risk.
Hey, beautiful. I like your necklace, but we're gonna have to take it off. But I like having it around. You know what? If we put it here... its power will enter the liquids and protect you from the inside.
What do you do to stay cool? What do you do to beat this heat? Talk about something hot, hot, hot! Janet will bring the heat...with the number one single in the country. I miss it so much when I don't hear it.
No, he didn't. He didn't mean anything bad by it. He's just a little blunt when he talks, that's all. I'm just tired of being two different people. I played that game at Princeton, and I played it again at Harvard.
- Yes. - We can start there. Okay, how about that moment at the church... before the meeting? Which one? I think Bernadette said it, about you finally dating a sister.
Commercial sector 1, secured. Ready 51 for Spartan-7... Bishop... It'll be good to see you back in your uniform, Bishop. Who says I'm gonna wear it?
Where is he? Do we have a visual? Negative, he's gone. Damn you, Bishop! I had him in my sights.
I'm not interested. Did you find out where the other bastards are hiding? Oh, come on, Bishop! We know they're breeding like rabbits for decades, why don't you put up their hologram and find it yourself, Trajan?
I mean you bought this house, right? No. - No, right? Then who's going to pay the rent? Sorry, I was a little busy, I'll send it to you.
I'm going to make tea. Anne... Never divide... here. What's this? I found it on Craigslist.
This helps them listen. All right, people. We got a situation here... One of you motherfuckers stole my money. Nobody's leaving this goddamn hotel... until I get it back.
Guy, what do you know about me? Not much. What's one thing you do know? Do you like money? And do you think I spend it or keep it?
Collins noticed that the camera in the parking lot was malfunctioning. When he went to check, two masked guys with guns were at the door, they had forced entry. Do we know how the cameras were disconnected? The wiring appears to be intact. We're taking it to the lab.
Was Otis selling unauthorized products in its store? Well, the difference may be an anomaly in the manufacturing process. I will know for sure once I analyze the TCH levels of these samples. When you say "analyze", how exactly is that done? We burn it in a controlled environment with proper ventilation.
Let's get you up. Okay, uh... If it's money you want, I can get it for you. Come on, let's go. If I wanted your money, I'd have it already, okay?
Yes, okay. We work in silence. That's not quiet. We've been tapping Joe Harris' cell phone. He may not always carry it with him, but if he has been, it doesn't look like he's gone beyond the prison in Boston in the last two weeks.
Yes. He probably had the phone on him. I, uh... No. No, I'm sure I left it on my desk when I got back from prison.
U... I'll have the office set up roadblocks in front of the tunnels. I'll try to catch him on the way. They found his car in a covered parking lot about three miles from the asylum. Yeah, he must have parked it and walked back, so we wouldn't see him here.
He even brought her flowers. Or maybe it was her birthday. I can't remember. This year's humanitarian award for her work for the homeless carrier pigeons and re-programming of lefties, Emily Atkins. I was so enraptured by her, I never would have dreamed that on June 4, 2004, at 3:26 pm, she would grab my heart, throw it into a backpack, throw it into a van and drive off with it.
Rent. Coming soon. There's a couple of unexpected expenses. And I'm asking for a raise tomorrow at Martin's computer store. Think they'll give it to you?
Do you guys know what chard is? No. It's like fat-free veggie yogurt, which is bad because veggies are like the soy milk in food. Ethan, you need a new lighter for your oven. I'm ordering it tomorrow.
Yes, that's fantastic. Yeah, that's... Yeah, that's... I'm so excited. You deserve it.
Also, this isn't the first time Dorsa has had a nightmare and imagined things. I'm just saying that you're a heavy sleeper when you're stressed. What's that? It's my... annual recruitment notice. Why didn't you mention that before?
And there was little else in the letter. So, I said to myself, "This is for me". I made an ultimatum, you know? However, I would like to say that I bought the deal back from them for $2,700,000. I got the name and the Golden Arches. Basically, I got it because I worked harder than anybody else. I used whatever resources I had. And I would have lost it all if I hadn't believed in it.
Yeah, and then I went back to the house, and I was walking around and, I broke a glass. Yeah. And then one of your guys just knocked. Actually, I cut myself before. Maybe I cracked it open.
She loved him. Well, they were obsessed with each other. And she really loved him. They had hot sex. Which, of course, became a problem after they broke up, because O.J. knew she needed him all the time.
- and even Rockingham? - Who else could do it? Let's take a step back. I mean, isn't it odd that this glove just happened to show up in Rockingham at the very moment that Detective Furhman - finds it?
Detective, could you tell us what you see here? These are photographs of the area I was surveying behind Mr. Kaelin's residence. And in them is what I identified as a possible glove. And then what did you do? I walked up to him and looked at it.
And on them is what I identified as a possible glove. And then what did he do? I walked up to it and looked at it. Did you touch it? I didn't touch it.
What does that mean, Mr. Bailey? That means arresting drunks and ending riots. I'm sorry, Your Honor. We got into a Marine-to-Marine conversation here. Detective, did you take a glove from the scene at Bundy's and then wipe it off inside the Bronco?
We got into a Marine to Marine talk here. Detective, did you take a glove from the scene at Bundy's and then wipe it off inside the Bronco? - No. You didn't? No, I didn't. You didn't put this in a plastic bag, and then put it in your sock?
Detective, did you take a glove from the scene at Bundy's and then wipe it off inside the Bronco? - No. You didn't? No, I didn't. You didn't put this in a plastic bag, and then put it in your sock? And then you placed it in Mr. Simpson's house, so it could be found?
Those gloves are too small. - Yes, Bob. - I tried on the glove right there. It didn't fit. They'll never fit him! I think we should let him try it in court.
By inflaming the passions of the public, in an attempt to exert political pressure on His Honor. In an attempt to pressure the Court to admit... - ...the Fuhrman tapes. - Mr. Darden! This case is a circus! And the Defense has turned it into a circus.
I was raped in Italy by a waiter. And I buried that memory. I didn't forget it. I just sort of deconstructed it. When I had my first rape case, what had happened to me, of course, came flying from whatever rock it was that I had hidden it in and...
So you get in touch on my wedding day. Now you have some very powerful enemies, in the Russian embassy and within your own government. They're watching him... in his home, in his office, in his clubs, in his bars. You'd better hurry or they'll miss me. Where's the money? The Duke's niece is bringing it from London.
Grand Duchess, may I introduce the Shelby brothers? From Small Heath, Birmingham. And good luck with this one, Tom. Give me the money. I was instructed to give it to Mr. Kaledin.
- That's great. Why do they say? One punch around it, always one punch around it? Yeah. Jabs, Jabs, hey, I know I owe you money, I owe you almost everything I have, I promise.
And how are you going to do that? I'll build the biggest fleet the world has ever seen. Good idea, except I'll be the one building the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to harness it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more than all of you combined.
Stark, Tully, a few other houses, we're almost starting to look like a winning side. I'm sworn to protect you, my lady. We need more men and my uncle has an army. We can send a raven to the Blackfish. We can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
The High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancestral Houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity. You are right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every day.
What if everyone demands her independence? She doesn't demand, she asks. Others can do it. Our parents were bad. They left the world worse than they found it.
Others can do it. Our parents were bad. They left the world worse than they found it. We will not do that. We will leave the world better than we found it.
If you think I am pushing you, it is because I am trying to prepare you for what is to come. You must fortify yourself against the Dagda Mor. You push to see if I thunder. It's no fun to have your mind read, is it? Your power may be growing, but be careful how you use it.
Kubo, we both want the same thing. You want to take my other eye. That's what you want! Yes. But do you know why I want it?
Well, we have a missing kidney. I went through the whole bag twice. You'd think Ron would arrange to send us all the organs... to cry his eyes out. Well, uh... what if the person who killed him took it?
I need you to get out of your head for a couple of hours, okay? Give her a hand... let her know that she still has a son who loves her. Or at least pretend... I had to stop by Ron's for the file he forgot and he told me a joke. - Do you want me to tell it to you?
Gloria would like to have a ballet company. Oh yeah? I hate ballet. Take her to do that modern crap you like. Didn't you enjoy it?
Richie... this is Kip Stevens. - Are you ready? - We're ready. Next time, bring me some powder. You don't need it.
What do you think will happen now? When you live in our neighborhood, you sign a contract. Do you understand? - Do you understand, you fucker? - Don't do this! When I ask for the car, you give it to me.
Did we hit something? I saw a deer running alongside the train... No, man, for God's sake! What a thing to say! Yes, I saw it too.
In the same situation is a pleasure boat with three crew members. The strong swell with waves that have exceeded six meters has prevented Civil Protection has been able to help them. As soon as the sun rises and the sea conditions improve.... (Music) I am Judge Vicente Louro. In order to lift the body, I need you to recognize it.
There will be no kurultai. Only war. Your mind wasn't thinking of any war that day, was it? I remember. I remember it well.
This starts with a clean, healthy cut. What we are going to do to you... has been done to your parents... and your parents and all your ancestors. The paste will help numb a little, but not enough. The pain will help you remember Kasa Boyo. And trust me, they will remember.
Mrs. Kimbale. Give me 10,000 shillings, or that door won't open. Of course it won't. The money you earned. I need it now, Phiona.
Give me 10,000 shillings, or that door won't open. Of course it won't. The money you earned. I need it now, Phiona. I gave it to the guy on the motorcycle.
So was the commander. What Clarke did at Mount Weather weakened her. The Ice Nation is emboldened. Their queen wants Clarke's power. If her people think she has it, she will break the coalition and start a war.
Yes, thank you. What was that? You almost gave that poor man a heart attack. Paulina Zander, come here! She deserved it, Mom.
Although your guest, I am sure, will ask for caviar. Myself, my wife and niece have traveled by train, then by carriage and on foot through Ai-Todor in Crimea. On that trip I lost a toe. I don't know. I woke up one morning and it was gone. Suddenly I saw a dog and it was eating it.
It is not formal. It is beautiful. It's made in Paris. It was stolen in Birmingham. My mother stole it from a house she was cleaning in 1901... No, she didn't.
What do you think of that? I don't think you should mix vodka with champagne. Does your wife know that the sapphire you're wearing was cursed by a gypsy? What did you say? I wouldn't wear it for the world.
Members of parliament, army officers. All we were trying to do was to save the country from revolution. That's for the murder of the spy. And an advance for future services. Does your wife know that the sapphire you wear has been cursed? I wouldn't put it on for the world.
If he's involved, I'm out. He has to die. Is he always this violent? I killed a deer today and it pains me to do it. But I treated it with respect and the leftover meat will go to the poor.
Insanity. The murder. I am the only one... who understands you. I found your perfume. I've put it on.
There will be some men coming from Birmingham. And you'll put them up in the house, you'll put them in the front of the house and the back of the house and feed them? Why are they needed, sir? I brought a cursed sapphire into this house, Mary. And now I'm paying for it.
All Russians turn their backs on you and run away. Cossacks don't run away, Arthur. Mr. Shelby, welcome. How's my car? I think I love it.
Which means your suspect wasn't using liquid nitrogen. He was using super-ice liquid helium. It is one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction. This liquid helium, where do you get it? Why do you need it?
It is a branch of physics that studies the production and effects at extremely low temperatures. I understand that there were some promising experiments that were carried out in the program, but, unfortunately, it was cancelled. When was that? Two or three years ago. Thomas Wayne canceled it, along with other strange programs.
She is sick. She is in pain. Everyone who comes here is sick or in pain. Have your doctor write you another prescription. Then I can refill it.
Jim. I heard you were able to save the day. I got lucky. I don't believe in luck. You saw a problem and you solved it.
Put that bag down! Do you have any idea who you're stealing from? Put it down! It's my money. You stole it.
I was there. Remember? When you took the Wayne case. I know what it means to you. You think if you solve it, you can close the door on the past.
I did it once before with Gordon, and I can do it again, because people's brains are a mystery, and once you figure it out.... Look. Helzinger? He can't stand being criticized because of an overbearing mother. He wants love and approval. He goes crazy when he doesn't get it, so I give it to him.
In ten minutes, everything within 400 meters will be dust. That's crazy. If you want to live... which I do, frankly... We've detected radioactive material down there. You got it out first, didn't you?
There was not enough time. I have been forced, but I have calculated that the chances of a radioactive cloud are very low. If you're wrong, thousands of people could die. Yes, yes, yes, yes, but paying that price will be better than releasing what's down there. How do we shut it down?
Nothing. No mail. There's no mail. But it's my sperm. How did you find out I wanted it?
Wow. That is so illegal. He's not going to do that. I don't care. You have 48 hours to do it or I take your sperm and throw it in the river.
Thank you. It burns! Steam burns! Sorry! I'll take it with me!
I'd love to, son. This is nice. If you screw up and hurt her in any way, I'll put you in jail for the rest of your life, and I can do that now, Dad, so don't test me. Okay. I liked the hug even though you used it to threaten me.
You can't give a celebrity case to Amy. The last movie she saw was a spelling bee documentary. You're wrong. It was about the Swiss fountain... and it was suspense and action. You already have a case, Peralta. I assigned it to you this morning.
Guys, listen up. Here's the situation we're in. Bad news: Cheddar is still on the run... and you know that slippery bastard... he's laughing at us. We need a new plan and we need it now.
Look at that. A bunch of old family photos and personal belongings. Pimento moments. I know you're pointing a gun at me I couldn't help the rhyme, sorry. I saved it all when I became Paul Sneed.
Gentlemen, I've just come up with a plan. Fake Pimento's death and go meet him ourselves. Good plan, sargen! No, I was going to say it first. I thought of it before you did.
I just followed Terry into a dark closet. Hi. You solved the riddle before I did. Nerds. They solved it first.
I'm sorry that wasn't Scar-Joe. I don't want to talk about it. Talking about your emotions is for losers. I guess Adele's a loser in your world. Look, the funeral's about to end, so basically, we made it.
Yes, of course, he's here. Who's calling? It's Vicky. Forensics. - Hello, hello. - I just texted you, have you seen it?
- Say. - I just sent you a message, did you see it? No. Please look at it. - Have you seen it?
and walked up the ramp over and over again. Nothing. I wouldn't have given up for anything. I had enough height. I swung my weight around and pulled it back.
- Lots of girls do. But you don't! Remember the little fish? That was two years ago. Not a hard-boiled egg. We gave the dog away because you wouldn't take care of him.
Good. Mr. Ken. We are ready. This is the suspect's number. I passed it on to CIB.
It's against the rules. I could lose my license. I need this oily. I need this to lubricate the world. I need this dog to have some grease on it, So when I eat it the grease will lubricate my throat.
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man? - Did you see that shit? I didn't see! Pay attention, Gary. Stop making so much noise! We can't take it anymore. We can't sleep. You've been here for three months.
He is right. The safest place for this is not behind walls or guarded by guns. The safest place resides outside the realm of anyone's knowledge. If the English can't find it, they can't get it. I told him we were taking it, but not where.
I didn't have to. I drank so much Dom, I was exhausted. Do you know how many funk artists Koronet Records has? They won't even remember your name. He repeated my name a lot. He learned it.
Well, there's no need for that kind of language, ma'am. Okay, well $300 is a lot of fucking money to me, so excuse me if I don't appreciate the fact that you're trying to steal it from me. - I'm doing no such thing. Oxygen sensors fail all the time. If you have a broken one and you don't repair it, your car's gas mileage is going to drop, and over time, it's going to cost you a lot more.
I just knew what they wanted to hear. - Um, greetings. - Greetings. How did you get the money? I delivered it in a suitcase.
I don't know, yes, sometimes, a little bit. I wanted to tell you, I sent the link to her reel, to Adele. - You did? When did you send it?
Must you be very brave? - No, I'm not brave. - No, I think you are. - Would you like more wine? - Yes, I'll get it.
- No, I am not brave. - No, I think you are. - Do you want more wine? - Yes, I'll get it. No, no, no, no, I'll get it.
Maybe it still doesn't count. I have to go. Lip? We're almost ready to start. When the priest asks for the ring, you just give it to me, okay?
What is the next number going to be called? The next number is called William Tell. A distant Swiss cousin. But clearly less pretty than me. - Did you write it or Footit?
What has he done now? He and Anatole Kuragin and that horrible Dolokhov, they found a bear somewhere? - A bear? - That Pierre! And they put it in a car and went to... to the actresses... and the bear ran away.
But do you have his will in a safe place? - His real will, I mean. - Yes, of course. And that other will he made when he was disturbed... naming Pierre, has it been destroyed? He still has it.
- How is what? The act of engaging in combat. Bloody awful, if you're on the losing side. But seriously, it's one of those things that no one can explain to you. You have to experience it yourself, it's like being with a woman for the first time.
Did you hear me? What? Is her voice funny? Or is it funny that Mrs. Welles is dying? It's not funny. It's a beautiful moment and you ruined it.
I should have known you were behind this. I hate for you to see this but I don't have the strength to fight you anymore, Ray. Is this what you wanted? They didn't give me the position. They gave it to someone else.
Damn it. Goddamn it. Damn it. Damn, damn... Every day I make Justin a sandwich and the kids tear it up.
Your son died in that fire. Hand over the man responsible for this atrocity, or else we will consider... each and every one of you... as accomplices to this crime. You have no proof that any of us... that any of us had anything to do with it. You ungrateful ingrates! We gave you a job, and you threw it in our faces!
How did you manage that? It wasn't easy, but now I'm free. Shall we run away? I have work to do and I need to concentrate. But you said the problem was seventh period and I fixed that.
What the hell? Stinky job, but it was worth it! So we can do this... If you try to take it off again... What the fuck! We'll get it further in.
We'll talk tomorrow, okay? Come back after lunch. Here you go. And don't drop the damn things, 'cause they break, silly. The fucking glass didn't break because I dropped it.
But Ian's not ready to grow up yet. Jack. Jack! How did your horse get out? Who the fuck knows. And you're not gonna find out? Or give me the name and I'll do it for you.
Come on, Phyllis, I'll have a beard by the time you're ready. I only have two hands. I can't do two things at once. That'll be £250, please, dear. Have you made me that coffee yet? Yes, I'll bring it to you when it's ready, shall I?
- I'll stay here a little longer. I'll stay here a little longer. Excuse me. Don't put that in my car. My cat's lost. Have you seen him?
- That's what I'm doing, asshole! You can't murder people with a gun. That's fucking boring. What if the murderer strangles somebody? Strangling is scary because it's so personal, because you have to look them in the eye while you're doing it.
I don't know. It went missing a day or two ago... We haven't received any cats like that yet. How do you know? Maybe it's already been killed.
Three flights of stairs. The elevator is broken, but it keeps you in shape. "INTERNATIONAL ORDER AGENCY" Yeah, chicken sounds great, love. A couple of days out of date is okay, as long as you cook it right.
Rob Singhal. IEA. Rob. I want you to get his name out. Big time.
Do you cook... "souvent? Not "souvent", but I make soufflés that make the Mystery tremble. No, no, I meant do you cook often? Ah, yes, I like it very much, whenever I can. Chicken and potatoes, I don't know how many times I've made it.
When she knew that the worst had happened, I managed to convince her, otherwise... she would still be here, at the bottom of the canyon. (MARY) Very easy. The key is to scare the octopus. You put it in boiling water three times.
(MARY) Very easy. The key is to scare the octopus. You put it in boiling water three times. Take it out and then cook it, depending on the size of the octopus, about half an hour, right?
You. Does Spain have a Ministry to travel through history? Who are you going to tell such an incredible secret to? To the American government. I was told to give it to you in secret. Is it serious?
Why all this secrecy? What do you want to tell me? A telegram has arrived from the Ministry in 1924. It's from Amelia and it's for you. I was told to give it to you in secret, is it serious?
Me, Rafael. -You tell me, Rafael. In my bag... In my bag there is a jewel, a cameo that belonged to my grandmother, may she rest in peace. I would like... well... for someone to have it, but I won't be able to give it to her in person, I'm afraid.
Six years later he returned to Spain, returned to teach again and began with that phrase, paying homage to Fray Luis de León who did exactly the same thing 400 years earlier. That's why the students laughed. Ah, right, that's why. That's why. It's incredible, you live a historical moment and you don't even appreciate it.
I have already told you that this is a private matter. But if you want to know... Excuse me. I am here to deliver this cameo to a Tagalog woman from the village. The other day a soldier, Rafael Rios, passed away, and on his deathbed... I promised him that I would do it.
You can't afford to lose cell phones, so every time one comes in or goes out, you check in. You know, when there are bitches involved, we all get very professional about who the number belongs to. Here it is. This phone was taken out by Don Salvador a few months ago and he hasn't returned it.
- Delicious! - Oh, thank you. 85% cocoa, that's the trick. And I make them with oat bran, something... that's not so bad for His Lordship. You look repellent in that apron and... you've worn it too long.
A very smart flower. Think about it. I think there might be a garden here after all. Arthur's book, it's exciting. Where did you get it?
Take care of it, it's the only one I have. I'm surprised you trust it to me. So am I. I bet even Arthur would have... been intimidated by this garden. No, he would have savored it.
Thank you again. The pleasure, Miss Brown, is all mine. I am so honored that you gave me that book. Now I know the story. No, I just lent it to you.
I am so honored that you gave me that book. Now I know the story. No, I just lent it to you. When I'm dead, then you can have it. In that case, I don't want it.
What did I tell you, Lawrence? There's always another level. I'll take my chances, sweetheart. Follow the stream of blood to where the snake lays its eggs. You got it.
Okay, thank you, commissioner. Well, thank you, sheriff. You did a great job. You know, there's a lot of crazy stories about this island. Some true, most not. You know? They embellish an old tale and pin it on the natives. And you get it as true.
Fuck yeah. I'm definitely going to buy one. You might want to get your dad one too, for his birthday, so he can keep an eye on you. Yeah, man. Maybe I'll get him one that comes with a joystick, so he can shove it up his fucking ass.
Deputy Chief Irving. What's going on here? A breathalyzer check, sir. I can see that. Who authorized it?
Oh. Sons of bitches, I'm going to kill you both. The tracking app. The pin will tell us where your phone's at. They would have turned it off after she calls.
Of course he had a burner. His personal cell phone was missing. He got rid of it. Any number of reasons. Or someone took it.
For silver, that text is as good as a signed suicide note. Suicide solves many of the problems on the tenth floor. Two dead cops, friends. One hero, one criminal overcome remorse. They call it a suicide, but both know it's not.
He is as much in the dark as I am about what you are doing. I have a friend who works at a gym near PAB. Rumor has it Irving is there every day at lunch. Hitting the sandbag. He carries it out.
The survival officer is cooperating. She has given a statement. Oh, yeah? According to her, Nash planned her husband's murder, and she and her accomplices carried it out.
So I just settled on it. - I had no choice. - Screw that, no choice. And what about your real name? Do you ever get it?
No, it makes me a survivor. And there's going to come a day when you'll wish you were, too. Here. Turn the solenoid around, saves you the trouble of rewiring it. I take it back, Raymond.
Kaan and Flatterers. Monica... Monica... You would look more handsome without these warts you should go get them removed. And how sad that you're here chasing something you'll never get. We just wanted to see the country before you destroyed it.
Can I see it? Give me your hand. How cool! Where did you buy it? Mom brought it from Vienna.
Look, brother, I haven't talked to my mom in a year. I don't know where she's living or if she's even alive. A few months ago, my dad got in touch and started sending me money. Where did he send you money? Since I didn't have my own address, he sent it to her apartment.
Fiberglass hull, obviously. Hard to tell the model with the damage, maybe mid 80's or 90's? A Bertram or, I don't know, maybe an Albemarle. - Have you seen it before?
[Leonard Nimoy] rarely turned down any paid commitment. I saw many of my actor friends go to work on a series for a few years and live up to the level of their income, with no steady income and no money in the bank. I made a private pact with myself that this would never happen for me and my family. So every time I was offered a paid appearance, I took it.
"Yes." Four days later, on a Friday night, the reiterated demand. My lawyer came to my house with a check. An hour later, the script arrived. I sat down and read it through that night.
Why are you cutting my drug? I don't know what you're talking about. We're not playing this game. You ungrateful piece of shit! I gave you a job when you needed one, and now you fuck with me?
- Go! Over here! Glenn! Can you open the gate? Appreciate it, partner.
Almost 3 months ago. He was volunteering on farms through a few different programs. At least he knew he was getting food and a safe place to sleep. Have you sent him any money? He wouldn't accept it, if not us.
I got this amazing job... What is it? I can't talk about it yet. - Why not? - If I'm lucky... you'll find out soon.
Charly! - You too. - Listen to this. There has been a change of plans. Colossus will explain everything.
You have to give them the code for the formula. That was the deal. Well, no problem. Anyway, the file on the server is empty. I never transferred it.
-I'm the king of the ship! -That's not the way the dialogue goes, you idiot! I deserve to be a partner, Marty, you know that! -You do? -Yes, I do!
-I do deserve it! Guys... -Do you know what "deserve" means? -Yes! -It means you earned it.
You have poop on your blouse. Yuck. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Remember when that crazy lady stabbed you in the leg? I'll cut off your dick and pour it in my champagne.
Nadia's baby is teething, have you ever heard a Russian baby screaming? All the time, in my Putin nightmare. Look, have Cece sign the loft agreement. Nick wrote it, so she'll like it.
- What fun! Yes. Miss Dunhill is our new librarian. Oh, that's great. Hi. I was reading, and I put my bag down, and he so thoughtfully gave it back to me.
Put that down, that's my... Hey, why don't you shut the fuck up? Excuse my language, Miss Mimi. I got the equipment all lined up. Sergeant Pete will bring it in.
Wukong... Wukong! Wukong, I had no choice but to do it. Will you use this incantation to keep me under control? As long as I don't kill innocents, I won't use it anymore.
I've brought a little present for my godson. Oh, that's nice of you, George. Dad! Look, my own horse! Uncle George bought him for me.
I would really like to think I was right to have considered you for Senior Partner. Christine... Call Accounting, and get a log of all the hours we billed to XHP last quarter. Right away. Look it up for the whole year.
- Barbara's car was found. - Barbara Holland's car. Barbara Holland's car. Looks like she just drove off by herself. State found it at the bus stop last night.
Come back here! Come back here, you idiots! Nice gift for a college student... Thank you for your time. We appreciate it.
Oh, shit. Shit, that's right. I've got Nina Totenberg and Tim Phelps... Judy Smith Deputy Press Secretary asking me about Clarence Thomas and sexual harassment. Fuck. Do you know who leaked it?
If they vote today, you would lose. Clarence, it's Jack. It's not that they don't want to vote for you, they just don't think they can with everything that's going on. We need to delay the Senate, hold the hearing, and wait to get the votes back. The only way the delay will pass is if you ask for it yourself.
- No. By mutual agreement, they say. What nonsense. The statement is going into the written record, so Senators will know what he said. If they read it, which they won't.
I've been talking to the chairman of the board of General Electric, and he said they're looking for a new head of Human Resources. I can tell them something if you want. Is there.... any reason why I can't continue in my current job? No. What do you mean? I heard about a job opening, so I'm putting it out there.
Last night was amazing. It was amazing. I'll get back to you about Tuesday. I forgot my phone. Did you leave it upstairs?
Suck it up. Hello? Hey, I miss you already. How did you get this number? You gave it to me. What's the problem?
Did you see the video? Yeah. Look, I... she's gotta get out of here, I tried... I really did. But she's... I think she's in shock and to be honest with you, I don't think she sent that email. No, she did.
Can I get you anything? Water, coffee? - No, I'm good. - Good. And thank you for taking the time. - I really appreciate it.
I just dealt with it. You don't work at Kirkland anymore, is that my problem? You have connections. Find another job and stop blaming me. You videotaped us having sex and used it against me.
Fuck you. I want you to read your poem, Ezekiel. I'd rather not. Why not? Because...I didn't write it.
I am always happy. Sadness is for fools. Let's get a drink. But, Miss Green, your contest was about writing poetry, not reciting. So you did write it.
Do you think they accepted the burden of educating you so that you would drop out of school, die or go to prison at 21? - I don't know. - You don't know. Maybe I was wrong and you didn't write the poem. I did write it.
It's in the ambassador's residence. What's in there, sir? Is it really that important? In a safe deposit box, there's no cell phone for Khaled al-Asiri. Jamal gave it to us.
I give you the magic, Grasshopper. Don't underestimate the crayon. Look at Dizzee. "You must solve the mystery together." - How can you look at it like that, brother?
And the only mystery I know is how you bought that shit. Hey, calm down. Grandmaster is the real deal. I'm authentic. This crayon, I still don't get it, but it's authentic.
Listen. We recorded our own demo. You do your magic. You make Mylene great. And then we sell it to Asheton.
- Cadillac pays me to throw it away. - He's a son of a bitch. I know he is. But it's good money. If we dump it by sundown, he pays us.
- You'll see. Shut that shit up. If that body shows up out of that trunk... Cadillac will be sure to put us all in there. If the cops find it, they'll lock us up even if we didn't do nothing.
No. It's all clear to me now. Francisco said you wouldn't take his money. And... we need the money, Ramon. He said to put it in the brush little by little.
No, man. I want this. I want to sign with Mr. Asheton. Regina, Yolanda and I want to be from Marrakesh like Misty. You will protect me and Jackie will guide me. You'll draw up the contract and I'll sign it, but we want to be in Marrakesh.
And I love it. - Whew. - I think. you don't. You love your penis and all the rather dark hair that surrounds it.
I forgot. I'm so sorry about that. Hey, some stuff came up, so.... So nothing. This space is what you were looking for, and someone will take it if you don't act fast.
You bought them a dog to make them love you? Wait, what? I didn't get that dog. It's Diane's birthday dog. Remember? She asked me to take care of it.
Uh, yes, payroll would have to. - Yes, and you work on payroll. - No, I work on payroll. - I don't work on payroll. - Can you just get it for me? from payroll to ask what you need it for.
Slightly. used lightly. Well, that's the policy when it comes to training gear coming back, Because I guess people sweat in it or something. I don't even take the Zero Runner out of the box. A lot of people don't. They see it on TV and they get too ambitious, but, you know, that thing is not a toy.
You will regret this abuse of power! Now go to sleep. No one listens to my advice, the worse for you. Use mine. I don't know if I have a few minutes left, I only use it for the music.
Some malicious people, probably Romanians or Africans, have stolen our wallets with all our money, documents, credit cards.... Everything. So I thought that what I could do was to leave the car registration and come back tomorrow to fix everything. I don't think I understood. Let's go get it now and bring it right back in the meantime, give our congratulations to the chef who never ceases to amaze, he was wonderful.
I have one more bet to make. Do you still have your 20 euros? Did you gamble it all away? Give me the money I gave you before. I was the one who took it!
- Is everything all right, ma'am? - Yes. Don't worry, leave me alone. Let me come up for a minute. Renato said to give it to me.
- Yes. Don't worry, leave me alone. Let me come up for a minute. Renato said to give it to me. Give it to her?
Yes! Petey Piranha and King Boo drive together in this multiplayer game. - "Mario Kart Double Dash!" - Right! I totally remember that game. Yeah, but you didn't remember it fast enough.
Okay. What's it about? A high school girl enters hospice care the day before her prom. It's a great premise, but that's all I have. Well, what if her friends bring the prom to her and have it in hospice?
Hi. Can I get you a robe? No. No, thank you. I was taking off my dress, but your roommate ripped it in half, like a phone book.
- What? - Are you serious? Yes, of course, there are still a few details we have to work out, but you can take the deal for granted! Oh, my gosh. Now Jade wants to tweet about it for the blogs to pick up, okay?
- Yes, we do. Of course, now he wants a rematch, so we'll step up our game today. We will. Oh, and I did see the press release. Gawker even picked it up.
I'm looking for an amazing release from a psychologist, actually, whose book is basically a guide for people in their 20s. Well, you're going to have to let me know the release date. I have a 19 year old that I want to get online before she starts a non-profit life. I sent the sample chapter to Thad. - Would you send it to him?
Give me. "As she strolls down Bedford Avenue, some Tousle girls notice her hair. One waves longingly across his street, but he refrains from that, for now, his heart belongs only to Inkburg." Well... I mean, he didn't write it.
That's one of the things I like most about you. That's me. I'm a fixer. Guys? I can't do this. Please, I'm not up for the wild.
There he is. Hey, shooter! Throw the ball, shooter! You've got to throw it. I know you're passing it because you're scared.
I think we should see what that was. - Calm down. - Okay, you're right. See? The package cried itself to sleep. I can't take it!
Actually, I'm talking about Seth, remember him? On the one hand, he's very smart about that political stuff but in his personal life, he's clueless. You hate him, but he keeps asking me for your number but I told him to forget it. I didn't give it to him.
You don't have to be ashamed. Seriously, I would really like to get to know you. Really? This is something I learned from our relationship. When you feel a knot... take a deep breath and look it in the face without fear or judgment.
Did you see a school near home, maybe? Well, the thing is... even if I had a good scholarship...or whatever. I'd still have to take out loans...and then that would affect both of us...because we'd be crawling on coals for the next 70 years. Okay, so we wanted to know if you'd like to...give us a loan, actually. Instead of doing it through the bank, right, so...we'd pay it off quickly...because we're both really good at what we do...and we just want to avoid all the interest...you know, and bank foreclosures...or whatever, the fate of the...bank foreclosures or whatever.
Well, the thing is... even if I had a good scholarship...or whatever. I'd still have to take loans...and then that would affect both of us...because we'd be crawling on coals for the next 70 years. Okay, so we wanted to know if you'd like to...give us a loan, actually. Instead of doing it through the bank, right, so...we'd pay it back quickly...because we're both really good at what we do...and we just want to avoid all the interest...you know, and bank foreclosures...or whatever, the fate of the...bank foreclosures or whatever. We'd pay it back, of course!
- Well, why didn't you? Because you wouldn't have wanted me to... and money means nothing to them, Nick. I don't need money. I don't need your father's money. Well, then we won't... Then we won't take it.
You've never seen a greyhound, have you, Billy? I've seen quite a few showdowns in my life. A greyhound is a racing dog. He spends his life running in circles, chasing a piece of felt shaped like a rabbit. One day we took him to the park.
the dog saw a cat. I imagine it must have looked like that piece of felt. He took off running. I've never seen anything as beautiful as that old dog... running. Until, at last, he caught it.
He took off running. I've never seen anything as beautiful as that old dog... running. Until, at last, he caught it. And to everyone's horror, he killed that poor cat. He tore him to pieces.
You probably think you're on this trip because you're some kind of wannabe, something... something that threatens me. I chose you precisely because you would never be a threat to anyone. My sister probably chose you for the same reason. I earned my place. No one gave it to me.
He is an experienced advocate. He has been asked to defend you. I have been asked, but I don't particularly want to. Then why doesn't he go home? Because your case is so bad that no one else will take it.
Did you bring it? Where is it, boy? Okay. (Sighs) I'm an evil genius hiding a transmitter. Where the hell do I hide it?
I work at the practice across the street. Excuse me... Which piece of concrete was it? It's gone. The morning barge took it away.
Two or three days is fine. But this... It's been two weeks. Even if you don't pay, they can't shut off the gas. - They haven't shut it off.
I can imagine it. But I can't talk about it now. I've got to go to work. What... What was that video? Why did you send it?
No, no, no! The last meeting didn't go as expected? When Sean and I were kids, Dad locked us in the room. He told us there was only one piece of candy. Whoever beat the other would get to keep it.
Or what will our daughter's life be like if we do this? Let's say we win. We win. We win. Monica's bleeding out, Skip's a wreck, then what? We pour the blood and the dust into a chalice, and we drink it.
Yeah. Ron, can I have a word? They can't do this, can they? I think they just did. Remember the Hanneman deal you brought in and I said, "Richie, it's a bad deal," but you went along with it because you wanted to do something crazy for a change?
But I own my mistakes. I stay positive. Enough about me. Let's look at the contract. I would underline it but I can't have a pencil.
No, Mom, no... That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the work I do. Oh, I see. It's just that I don't think I have it in me anymore.
It's not that kid's fault you're such an asshole to take a chance with eights and tens. Give me your fucking lighter. I already gave you my lighter, Credence. You know, that blue one that... If you'd have given it to me, I wouldn't be fucking asking for it!
You know, that blue one that... If you had given it to me, I wouldn't be fucking asking for it! - Fuck, man. - Give me the fucking lighter. You got it, man. What the fuck's the matter with you?
Our companies make the finest paper in the world. 100 years of product development, Finnish pulp... - What do you think you should do? - Toilet paper. People always need it.
Now you can calculate how much you need to make per month, so you can pay off your debt in, say, five years. - That seems possible. - Interest is not yet included. The annual interest rate on that quick loan is very high. I took it in an emergency situation.
They taught me how to be organized with my money. I had to vacuum the house and mow the lawn for my monthly allowance. You can imagine the lawn was really high. I mean... - Do you want me to massage it?
- I didn't buy anything. Yes, you did. It must be super expensive. - It's our money. - I thought you bought it.
Thank you. All is well. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Are you going to give it to your dad?
A little bit of this and that. Do you have a lot of friends? I've got a lot of classmates... from when I went to school. Do you remember the first fire you were involved in? Yes, but it's hard to describe, if you haven't experienced it.
Yes. In the studio. For the program... Witchita. - Do you know him?
They have a fucking conviction. They know something about something I haven't heard about yet. Well, you've got this place and... that's something. Yeah. Versailles of Northwest Arkansas is what I call it.
Good, good. "Junkyard dog"... Someone who's going to be fierce in court. Well, I'm afraid I don't appear in court. I prepare the case, I don't present it.
The Court rises. Just walk. - Don't say anything. - The trial took an extraordinary turn... Why did Rampton quit?
Yes. Just to let you know that we've been told... to expect a verdict on Tuesday. Tuesday? Are you sure? You know, I don't think they would have said that unless it was true.
It was your book. Your book held up in every aspect. Every aspect. Every detail. We stood up for it.
I'm flattering you. You have a gift. You're lucky. Yeah, it's just... You don't use it on us.
Are you listening to me? Yes, things you bought. You bought the car? It was Antoine's. Mom bought it.
Here, at that time, to have a car.... But he worked. It was his car. It was old, ugly and noisy, but it was his. On Sunday mornings, he washed it.
But he worked. It was his car. It was old, ugly and noisy, but it was his. On Sunday mornings, he washed it. He washed it from top to bottom.
Yes, I think that's why our relationship is good. Of course, there are those times when he has to get up at six o'clock and he wants his friends to say, "Okay, sleep until ten." I say, "No, you have to get up at six." And he replies, "NJ!" Because I didn't set the bar. He did.
Nurse, come--come here. [Unintelligible conversations] Look upon him with eyes of mercy, give him patience in his affliction, and, in your good time, I will restore him to health. And may he lead the rest of his life... [Weeping] ... to your fear and your glory. Otis: Let me go! It took me a vow to keep you from flying, and I will very well do it!
It's a good job for a loner. Are you sure you don't want to take home an orchid? No, thanks. It would kill it. You can take more time if you need to.
Evan, get the broom to clean all the needles. I can't. I told Eric I'd see him for a while. But you love decorating the tree. Yeah, but when you guys mess it up, then I'll fix it.
And it's cute how it...gives a nice shape to your face. - Thanks, Lonnie. - You take good care of yourself. Thank you, Lonnie. You really do. It's like if you took a huge peach... and a huge wig... and you put the wig over the peach, and you combed it the same way.
Yes. Do you want to schedule your number? I'll send it to you when I get out. I'll get you my number. I will.
There was a time when we talked about moving to Saint John or some other tropical island, opening a dive store and living in paradise for the rest of our lives. Very Hemingway-esque. And that photo was a reminder of why I keep.... Why we keep doing what we do. We take risks and make easy money the hard way but.... I can't do it forever, so if there's even the remotest chance of making that impossible fucking dream come true, I'll give it a shot.
- Ah...who is the groom? - Arun "The Cruel". Is that his name? His full name is Arun "The Cruel", "The Horrible", "The Terrible", "The Miserable". But we shortened it.
Bend your knees. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. Now imagine... There's a big tree in front of you. Do you see it?
Yes. - Is it in your name? - Yes, it is. I don't get it. Well, I, um... I came up with an idea about a game and I sold it. You're kidding me.
Not that I have much choice, Joni. Why don't we ask Ruth about the money? No, no way. How would you explain it to her? The same way you explained it to me.
The money, where is it? Don't lie to me, son. Point it out. Smart little nigger. I didn't steal it from nobody.
He soaks the sheets when he sweats at night. He wakes up with nightmares. He has a burst of anger and then just fine. He seems to be having an adjustment period. We see this with a lot of veterans.
- Where did you get this? - From what? - Your diary. - No, it's a songbook, my friend. His sister found it and gave it to me.
That we're not scared? Maybe we are, I mean, look at us. We got away. We won. We may not have killed the dragon, but we definitely tamed it.
I like this city, but every place I went, she saw something she wanted to forget. I wouldn't have guessed that you and Ali would be the ones to stay. Different reasons, same result. You got your degree, didn't you? It took a lot, a lot of late nights, but I got it.
Ezra? Are you okay? Were you working on the last chapter? I'm done. You want me to read it?
They work in teams and are studying. How can I pay when I don't get the same pay as a man? I go through the same monetary issues and have to pay the same expenses. Right now, it's about the best interest of the children. The next time you can't do your duty, then the state will do it for you.
Then let's get together here. This also concerns you. The Director must have a terrace. The ground must be dug and put gravel and tiles. If there is an even a small border I will look at everything.
He was beaten almost to death. After three days he still hadn't woken up. Although Mrs. Oskanon had begun to get restless. I didn't get my ticket to eternity. I had been waiting for it for four years, but it was not as I had hoped.
- Okay. Did you see a phone? - Did it have a protector? No protector. I didn't see it.
- To bring us luck. - The more the merrier. I'll be the lucky girl. But I want to find my phone. I'm thinking maybe I left it at home.
- The more the merrier. I'll be the lucky girl. But I want to find my phone. I'm thinking maybe I left it at home. I don't think I even brought it, because I want to disconnect.
You want to know what your Uncle Greg does for a living? How? I make all the candy on the planet. No, he's not your Uncle Greg. If you've ever had candy, I made it in my kitchen.
And I leave my phone here because my mom tracks me - like I can't be trusted! Here's the cool part. I tied the phone to the dog's collar so your mom thinks you're moving. Why don't you hold it and move?
You're next, buddy. Jackson and I will cheer you on. No, you won't. I'm not going out, Mom. I need my supermagic scarf, but Aunt Stephanie took it.
Take her to the zoo. Hello, everybody! Dad, you don't have to ring the doorbell. It's your house. I wasn't ringing it, I was cleaning it.
What does our very expensive quadraphonic equipment look like? I don't know. It's still in its box. Let me know when it's working. If it doesn't work, I won't pay for it.
- Enter. - What do you expect me to do? - You're going to cure me. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Tell me... who did you steal this brooch from? Why do you want it so badly?
Two down. - Sorry, how? - Two down. No, nothing goes under me. I don't know what game this is, but we didn't play it today.
"Not Cyrus. He's a character. But I adore him. He hates the fact that I don't hit my kids. He hates it.
"Okay." I don't know what wheelchair shit is. I have no idea. True story. I went out, bought a handicapped placard, and put it up at the entrance.
"Bring me a machiato with caramel. "Machiato with caramel. "Light on ice. Nothing heavy. "If it's heavy, I don't drink it.
That's right. The dress was delivered today. Yeah, right, right on time. It's, uh... It's beautiful. I'll wear it tomorrow.
I'm sure Martin will miss you, Vera. - Shut your mouth, Gitty! - Martin, watch your language. Martin, this chicken is delicious. - Where did you buy it?
- Is it this one? - Yes. What is this place? Some time ago it was a restaurant. But the new owner lives abroad, so it's almost always empty. So in the end, no one uses it.
It is a "blue-ringed octopus". - Blue-ringed octopus... It has the same venom as the puffer fish. You're safe from the puffer fish if you don't eat it, but this bug bites you. So don't touch it.
Very tired. What a long day. An octopus has arrived. A strange octopus. An octopus? It's poisonous and deadly so don't touch it.
- ¿Leslie Nielsen? Wesley Snipes. Has dicho Leslie Nielsen. No importa. Nadie lo ha oído.
There was an old friend there, who came to tell me that my work is done. And this place... where are we? It's a waiting room between life and death. I've been called. No, Abbie, we started this journey together, and we'll finish it together.
Look, if the DA is really coming for you, maybe it's best if we don't make you a target anymore. And most importantly, Garth Sykes from Flagship. Hated to see you on that Post cover with that damn waterfront mansion. The teachers in that pension fund make 40,000 a year. The people who have it spend it.
And most importantly, Garth Sykes of Flagship. Hated to see you on that Post cover with that damn waterfront mansion. The teachers in that pension fund make 40,000 a year. People who have it spend it. The people who don't have it like the bills that are spent on other people better.
Keep up the good work. Yes. They're treating this article like it's an order. Someone wanted to hurt Birch, and they wanted us on the bad end of it. That's why they leaked it.
Average company, has a great distribution contract with that Yumtime bakery. They have 50. The fundamentals are solid. I don't see the short term. I don't need you to see it.
there can only be one. I don't blame you, Ken. I'd do the same thing. But I'm at 32 percent this year, which means, from what I know of your run-and-hide approach, that's 30 points more than you have in green sight. Well, you can call it whatever you want, but I call it "care."
- What is the address? - I sent it to you. And while I remember. I just read your report. I hope you only sent it to me.
We were on the right track. And then those assholes from Reykjavík show up. You sent the report only to the Commissioner. They would have just put it in a drawer. They would have covered it up and no one would have known.
Let's start from the beginning. What happened in 2008? What? Dad just came to you and confessed to the murder? It just happened. And it had to be you? You couldn't let someone else handle it?
So what took you so long? If I'd known you'd feel this way... I would have come sooner. Look, um... I want you to get your prenatal care, get some rest... carry the baby to term. When you have it, give it to Hakeem, and... I'm gonna give you ten million dollars.
I wanted to talk to you about working here at the Bijou. - Is there anything I can do here? - Melea, you're late. The woman who left, Miss Lee, wants to buy the theater. Are you going to sell it?
SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA From that moment on, music was my life. Through music, I found ways to express all my anguish, frustration and insecurities, and make my voice heard. Between the four of us, we moved into a small apartment. FRIEND - AGENT It was like... 46 m2 between the two floors. It was a small place, so we emptied it out and brought in a lot of people.
And I'm releasing my album a week early. I can't believe it's real. STEVE'S STUDIO LOS ANGELES I've been on the road a lot lately. The hardest thing is finding the time to finish my album. And, when you say it, imagine....
Everybody on the floor. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. How much you got? Almost got it. Almost got it.
We have just what you need. Just so you know, I do have a criminal record, but... Yes, we have that information. That's not a problem. The position is yours if you want it.
Slowly now. Trust me. These are M80 fireworks captured by BuscaTiros half an hour ago. See the accuracy? The LookThrough picks up the sound, locates it correctly, and identifies them as firecrackers.
It's a decoy, Ms. Groves. It's a fake. Samaritan planted this decoy in Carrick's computer to frame him for Krupa's murder. Adorably ruthless and elaborate. Carrick has done this sort of thing before, in Ecuador, so it's more than easy to assume he did it here.
Be so kind as to wake me up when you get tired of asking the same question. How do you turn it off? I don't have anything on my lapel, John. No, but there's a switch on it somewhere. You wouldn't give it to anyone but yourself.
We need to isolate the outbreak, find a cure, find out who's behind it and why. I'll stay close to Dr. Mason, see if she can provide us with any leads. The lab sent Ko's test results to the CDC. Until they can test the virus and locate an effective antiviral, we'll have to take care of ourselves. How do we slow it down?
Grab weapons, Sameen. You'll feel better once we start shooting people. There would be a better way to fight this war if we hadn't shut down the system. If I believed that, I wouldn't have done it. What if I said I introduced a little extra into the system before you shut it down for good?
Lie down. That's it, that's it... It's over... I know a poem about birds that I like very much. Do you want me to read it to you?
Because they would leave all the creative control to us and keep the employees which I know you care about, because you love them. Good talk. The Beijing people are here. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Nobody likes Chinese coffee. Well, we sell it.
I had become love. But now she won't speak to me. She blames me for the divorce, so she's mad at me. Y... I deserve it.
Yes. There are many things I want to tell you. Tell them. Tell them! You waste time. I give you a gift, and you waste it!
They can save between 40 and 50%... Let's say that this girl was worried about my invisible side.... She's not, because she just likes to fuck.... But let's say she does... How do I show her that I have it?
We are very lucky. We never thought, at this point, of a baby. We've already prepared her room. Sure. Did you bring the money? Yes, Abel brought it.
Well, I still have the money. Ain't that a bitch? What are you gonna do with your ring and a bill? You're gonna mail it. And you're gonna leave a note to send it to Mandy.
Look at you, you are already a young woman. It's a mistake, Khatun. If you stay, there will be no more suffering. The pain of life will disappear. Soon you won't remember it anymore.
I'm sorry for the violence outside. But you should know that I can't let you go. I can't. Khatun had given me a mystery. I didn't understand it, but I felt it inside.
At that time, I often doubted that I had ever really met Khatun. But Homer never gave up. He had seen something of the experiment. Understanding what Hap was doing became his mission. He took the feeling inside him and channeled it into this mission.
Hap always smelled his fear. Homer would come back with no memory over and over again. But he kept trying. Some days I thought he was just doing it for me. Some days I thought he was doing it to annoy Hap.
I always considered them collaborators but, above all, I like to consider you a partner. Don't. I know we're both concerned about the same thing. Will we find the fifth move? One of us will get it.
Saturn's rings. They sing. There you were. I don't think Khatun is going to give us the fifth movement. I don't think he wants him to have it.
They sing. There you were. I don't think Khatun is going to give us the fifth movement. I don't think he wants him to have it. We'll get it.
There you were. I don't think Khatun is going to give us the fifth move. I don't think he wants him to have it. We'll get it. We'll get it.
What if we don't change? No, that's... We don't change that way. Impossible. Those who seek power always try to control those who have it.
There is a lot of glass. Like the place where we are now? No, the light is different and there is a metallic sound. Like metal, like cutlery. When I hear it, it disappears.
Yes, why do we always try to understand everything? The future is dark. Not in the sense of bad. Just dark. You can't see it.
Let me see your ID card. Oh, God. You're not gonna believe this. Officer, this has never happened to me before. I left it on the table in my foyer.
Well, the red one was obviously the coolest and the leader, so.... - And the hottest. - Right. I thought I knew what I was gonna do with my life. You know, I had a plan and I wrote it down on paper.
- And the hottest. - Right. I thought I knew what I was going to do with my life. You know, I had a plan and I wrote it down on paper. I didn't even put it on the phone.
It can't be, it doesn't exist. I swear to God. I use it all the time. I say "always" as if I'm always being seduced. Actually, I used it like seven times.
I use it all the time. I say "always" as if I'm always trying to be seduced. Actually, I used it like seven times. Six times. I wore it three times. Wow.
Oh, my God! You're so sweet sometimes. It's cute, don't worry. How did Cass get the apartment in the divorce? I gave it to her, like I gave her my heart.
Where is the whiskey now? Safe in the dining room. With the guy from "Mice and Men" and the fat guy? I'd like to consider item 15... I'll have one of my guys take it and bring it to Range 15.
Safe in the dining room. With the guy from "Mice and Men" and the fat guy? I'd like to consider item 15... I'll have one of my guys take it and bring it to Range 15. Why don't you try it here and distribute it among the people?
I'll have one of my guys take it and take it to Range 15. Why don't you test it here and distribute it to the people? Our building was compromised and most of the scientists were killed. The ones that were left we sent to Range 15. Then we'll take it to Rank 15 ourselves.
Do you want us to follow you? Yes, but I'll go on foot. Can you snow the whiskey? -What the fuck? -I need you to carry the whiskey, asshole, and hold it with two hands. Can you handle that, Private Fortune?
Shit! What just happened? I just saved your life. You see, whiskey is the primary element you need to cure zombies. But it requires a proper delivery system. Kill Cliff is a delivery system. The mixture of caffeine and vitamins creates a bond with the snake semen. It protects it as it infiltrates the zombie cells. It seemed obvious to me.
We all saw that video of Gene taken from one of our satellites and I just knew we had to give him another medal of honor. Well done, Gene. What wonderful footage. In the middle of a zombie apocalypse, Gene got this video. He pulled out the camera and shot it himself.
I have no other way to explain it.... - Once the game starts, there are only two paths. Finish it or die. - Can you tell me more about the game? - Very little I'm afraid. Only a very small number have played it... but, every so many years, it always ends up coming back here.
Finish it or die. - Can you tell me more about the game? - Very little I'm afraid. Only a very small number have played it... but, every few years, it always ends up coming back here. - Why do they bring it back?
Yes. So, the radio informs you while you were on the way that they were fakes, is that correct? Yes. And the mail? The experts did not find it in Aguas Frias.
So, the radio informs you while you were on the way that they were fakes, is that correct? Yes. And the mail? The experts did not find it in Aguas Frias. Are you sure that's what you saw?
- What's the matter? Come and sit down! What's the matter with the donkey? He kicked me. So I drugged him, it calms him down a bit.
Look, Stella, why don't you forget about the kids and focus on what you're going to do with your life? Maybe I'm right. I mean, I have a degree in theater arts. It's crazy that I'm not using it. Oh, you're using it some.
Sit down. Desi... Damn little hammer! Why do we have this little hammer? Because mom gave it to me in first grade.
Yes, Bob? Have you ruled out suicide? At this stage of the process we haven't ruled anything out yet, but it seems highly unlikely. Yes? What makes you believe that the Powers Division can properly handle this investigation after the Wolfe fiasco? - I wouldn't call it a fiasco.
Like Mount Vesuvius or like a great... What else? The lividity patterns are not consistent with the position of her body at the crime scene. And she wasn't wearing her flight suit when she was killed. Someone put it on afterwards?
Oh, right, the trick. What's that? How do you get it? It's not a thing. It's just... You just get it.
Filling out forms. Filling out forms? That's how you get caught. For anything in life, you have to fill out a form. And they have forms for everything. You fill it out, it goes to the top, and they make you fill out a new form, just to confirm that it was you who filled out the first form.
No. What? Wait! I've got a subway bunker. This tunnel leads straight to an underground chamber... I haven't dug it yet. Oh!
I want the album to be successful, so that the label will record another one. For that, you had to leave the lead guitar. You don't need Duck. You got the contract in spite of Duck. And you'll blow it if you don't go ahead.
- Casper:? Just a bowl. Scott:. Fuck, now it's like the duck and the rabbit. Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
It's not dope, it's weed and don't worry, he's testing it in his room. I told him not to smoke in here, lest he give you a brain hemorrhage. Hey, uh... Are you going to eat that last piece of sturgeon? Why, do you want it?
Hi! - Hi. - Hi. Have you read the book I gave you? Yes, I've almost finished it.
For her, you are a puppet of the oligarchy that runs this country. And why me and not you? Because she also believes that men keep women in submission. Oh, God, and where the hell did she find such a big poster of Che Guevara? Allen gave it to her, went to town, picked up a bunch of books for her and took the poster.
How am I going to find out? What are you talking about? You may have to get the briefcase back. How am I supposed to get it back? Say you left it there by mistake.
God, you sit here with all these brilliant ideas and I carry them out. - Will you excuse me, miss? - Yes? I've left... that's mine. I left it there.
Look, I'll track you down. Is everything okay? You sent the money like you said you would, so, yeah. Everything's fine, Samar. I took it from Khaled without telling him.
Are we ready to risk our lives for this? Yes. We have to get out of the tunnels. Back to the apartment. We'll wrap it up and take it with us.
File formation, committed mission. Never be more than 18 meters under cover. He may have a tracker. So far you're telling us that? If he's being tracked, why aren't we surrounded by Redhats?
- Let's get back to work. - Grab your feet. I'll grab the head. I need you to trace this number. Should I ask how you got it?
Welcome to the Yoknapatawpha! I practiced that all morning so for me it will always be "The Yonk". I wanted to personally come and tell you how proud we are to have the Yonk open again and contributing to the community once again. This facility is another important example of the progress we are making on the Los Angeles block as we restore law and order. Rest assured that this facility is essential to the Transit Authority's long-term plans, so we will be watching it very closely to make sure everything runs smoothly.
Shoshanna, hi. What...? What are you...? Are you here to look for a job? Don't worry, you don't have to be nice to me. I know I took a spiked dildo... and shoved it in your heart. I'm so sorry about that.
We've got to pack something big or we won't survive another winter here. You make it sound so easy. I never said it was going to be easy. The boat! Where would we hide it?
"I won't keep the tradition because I want to"? - The trust no longer has any money. - What was done? Paid for the Parade every year - did you use it to keep your company afloat?
Before praying at night, he told me a story about a farmer and his sons. A farmer was on his deathbed and gathered his sons...to talk about inheritance. "I will tell them that in my vineyard there is a hidden treasure. Dig. Dig and you will find it."
And much worse than we remember? Precisely. But there were other changes as well, at least from my perspective. Spearhead, for example. In my reality, we invaded, confiscated its core, and used it to continue our mission.
Everything is changing. From green to red. It starts here. This place... I've seen it.
It's okay, the guy likes it that way. What are you doing? Don't ruin it. I won't be able to sell it. I need it intact for barbecue.
No, a lot of fucking respect. Courtesy of Axelrod. I speak first. I answer questions first in front of any reporter. And in the future, if I put you on a case, you take it right away. Who's the confused dog now?
It is not safe. No, it's not. In fact, I'm surprised to see you alive, Dr. Wilkes. I beg your pardon? Now you're going to place the specimen in this box and hand it over to me.
We have talked about this. There are bigger fish than the Soviet Socialist Republic, and right now, they are more concerned about the national security breach than testing protocol. How is the Isodyne accident a national security breach? If the material Wilkes stole falls into the wrong hands, it could be disastrous for the United States. Well...if the SSR has it, it's in the right hands.
Mom, we can't have you crying all through the ceremony. Can I hold back the tears when I'm happy? Where's my damn handkerchief? Oh, sweetie. Let's finish the dress before I stain it.
- No, no, no, no. No! I'm just trying something different! Okay. What would you like? You want me to throw it away?
Yeah, but I've thought about it, and, oh, no, no, no, she's definitely a BLOB. Kaylee gave me her number today. How long do you think I should wait to chat her up? I don't know, three hours? Too late, I already sent it.
I appreciate you very much. I appreciate you very much too, uncle. Oh, yeah, don't forget all this. My phone. I took it from Goose after Tucker got knocked out.
Well, it was the best one yet. Millie... You should be careful about pushing Sir Winston too fast. Oh, he's not pushing me, ma'am, it's him. He wakes up every morning with a plan, he calls it "action this day".
You want Vernon's job. No. I want more. I want a seat on the board. She bought it?
No. I want more. I want a seat on the board. She bought it? I wasn't happy about it, but... my blood's still inside, so, yeah, she bought it.
I'm so sorry, I've tried the best I know how and I... I... You haven't sold the card. I haven't sold the card. And now you expect to be fired? Would it be easier if you... wrote "You're fired" on a piece of paper, and left it on my desk?
He's awake! Please go back to sleep. I never thought we'd find that package of cocaine. For me, it was one of those adventures you just go on, like looking for your G-spot. You don't think it really exists, and you don't know what to do if you find it.
How could you? Yes, Mark. How could you? There she is. You guys are assholes. Why the hell didn't you give her the money when she asked for it?
Never. Because my child will conquer the world. Don't you dare tell her she's not perfect. Of course I wouldn't. I was just saying, I think... She has an important exam this afternoon, that's all... And she'll pass it!
My name is Ben. - Hi, Ben. - Hi. Tonight's special, steak, dry-aged 30 days, Waygu beef with mint, juicy. It melts in your mouth. I had it last night and I loved it.
Finished? No. Your steak has a lot of blood on it. Maybe we can take it back and cook it more. You want me to take it off the bill?
He is waiting. You will call him sir and his wife madam. The Treaty of Versailles forbids any other form of address. His left arm is slightly deformed. You will not look at him.
And the gestapo showed up at the house today. If they knew anything else, they would have been arrested by now. - When can you do it? - I need more time. - You may not have it.
But I said to the Austrians, "You got what you wanted. Stop in Belgrade! I wrote a telegram to Vienna, "Stop at Belgrade!" They never sent it.
- Yes. - Everybody knows. - Hmm? - Kaiser's wife received a telegram. I'll find out who sent it.
And we are very much in the experimental stage. I attended a demonstration recently at the laboratory in Potsdam where ten handicapped children were each given - I beg your pardon? - Phenol. You probably know it as carbolic acid.
He's sleeping. Do you have a place to go? An address. Will you come with me? I have betrayed my country, but I will not abandon it.
Down! Enemy down. Fourteen to go. One more for the team. Looks like your little plan didn't work out so well. They still don't get it, do they?
And now that I have lost my husband, and you have started another war, go pray to the tribes to be on your side. She is a foolish child. Right now we have to attend to the tribes. Call them to the council. Tell them you have the throne as you always have, until you pass it on to your eldest son....
What is my secret? This little gadget. I blow on it a little bit and it tells me when I can drink more. Because when I first got this, it always gave me 0.20, which is being drunk 24 hours a day. But now, I leave it at 0.12, which is perfect. It's got the right balance.
Fuck! You got ice cream all over Lucy's freshly waxed car! Clean it up! You clean it, I'll lift the barrier. You want me to clean it? I'll fucking do it.
DRUG STORE We're doing inventory like crazy. We haven't been paid a dime, and you still don't have the wedding money. What the fuck, Ricky? If Julian doesn't pay you back, I'll get it, and you'll regret it.
We're taking inventory like crazy. We haven't been paid a dime, and you still don't have the wedding money. What the fuck, Ricky? If Julian doesn't pay you back, I'll get it, and you'll regret it. I'll get it, Lucy. I told you I would and I fucking will.
Everything is under control. I'm not going to calm down. It's ridiculous. I need the wedding money right now. Get it. Do whatever it takes.
I can't, Mr. Lahey, I won't get into it. Randy, you don't understand. It's a bad thing. Barb's got me by the balls. She's keeping a secret about me. And she'll reveal it unless I cooperate with her and help her mess with Julian.
We'll buy your wedding dress. Wait a minute, Jacob. We don't have the money yet. It's on credit. We'll have it soon.
Wait a minute, Jacob. We don't have the money yet. It's on credit. We'll have it soon. When I get it, I promise you, you'll have the biggest, best, shiniest dress in the world.
DRUG STORE Unbelievable that it bothers you that I don't want cochinadas between you and the Hollywood fool in our bed. I'm not upset. I just found it more convenient to fuck with him here. If you won't enjoy it and think about me all the time, why do you dress up like you go to bars? My looks have nothing to do with it.
Shit, it's time to go. Let's go, ladies. Julian, don't you want to say something to Snoop? Let's talk about the rest of the money you're going to invest. And when you're giving it to us.
- No, Mr. Lahey. What the hell is going on, Barb? What do you want? I want justice, Jim. That park was stolen from you and me, and I want it back!
What do you want? I want justice, Jim. That park was stolen from you and me, and I want it back! You should want the same thing. But I don't. Don't you understand?
I want justice, Jim. That park was stolen from you and me, and I want it back! You should want the same thing. But I don't want it. Don't you understand? Do you want it?
A grey heron, look! - What a beautiful animal! A grey heron! - Your luggage? The driver is bringing it.
- I was reading it online. It's a treatment for nightmares. A type of cognitive behavioral therapy. They help the person change the ending of her nightmare. While she's awake, so it's not upsetting. So, if you don't like the ending of the story, do you change it?
- Only if you stop shouting. - You're crazy! Sit down and look at me. Enjoy the show. Maybe I'll give it back to you.
What will happen to Crusoe? Pango is right, we can't leave him here. Guys, guys, it may not be perfect. But I think I have a plan. Well, you better spit it out because we're short on time.
You told me about the experiments, remember? Your crossword puzzle? I like crossword puzzles. Yes. I left it with you.
The baroness was sterile. No experiments. A cure. She was pregnant on her wedding night. Before burning her the villagers removed the fetus and threw it into the aquifer.
This is where you started. I don't want to. You know? You look just like her on her wedding night. The night she was taken from me. The villagers pulled out the fetus and threw it into the aquifer.
- Farm Station. - That's the beacon. - This belongs to us. The Ice Nation queen wants Clarke's power. If her people know she has it, she'll break the coalition and start a war.
We know not to make agreements with our enemies. The commander kneels before no one. Stand down, Titus. She even prefers the language of the enemy. And you will use it too, in honor of our guests this evening.
We're working digitally. What are we missing? How would the president remember a number that long? Not very well. Want to bet he wrote it down somewhere?
So we're at an impasse. Does it hurt? It's ready. It pushes the pain away. It doesn't cause it.
Sacred? It's a company logo. Wrong. This is the sacred symbol of the commander to whom I have dedicated my life. Now, how did you get it?
It is a company logo. Incorrect. This is the sacred symbol of the commander to whom I have dedicated my life. Now, how did you get it? I repeat, Jaha gave it to me.
This is the sacred symbol of the commander to whom I have dedicated my life. Now, how did you get it? I repeat, Jaha gave it to me. That must be Chancellor Jaha. Yes. He told me it was the key to the City of Light and that if I swallowed it the woman in red would take me there.
- A twist, something. - Every three pages. Yes, something important. I don't want you to think I'm criticizing your script. God, I appreciate you reading it.
- Okay. You two edit reality shows? That's right. Kyle gave me my first job. That's good. Do you guys hate it or...?
Gus, the tutor. - What? - This is what happened. He wrote a draft. He asked me to read it.
No, it makes me a survivor. And there's going to come a day when you'll wish you were, too. Come on. Turn the solenoid around, save you the trouble of rewiring it. I take it back, Raymond.
- Poem. "And though my soul depart from Earth, I count my days until my rebirth. I will wait all eternity for my love to return to me." The knife. You gave it to me, and the inscription, it was a poem... a love poem that promises....
You know what? It doesn't fucking matter. But at least take my money. You hear me? There's more where that came from, Marlon. You know who wants it more than you?
Six to one in that fight. It was fucking rigged. You listen to me. I want my fucking money. - And I want it right now.
- Ethan, no. - Listen, you son of a bitch. - Ethan, there are other ways. You took me for a fucking quarter of a million. - I don't have it. What can I say?
I don't have a wallet, it weighs me down. See? This is real. It smells, it creaks... they've changed hands, they're full of germs, at the bar I ask for a coffee... and they give me the change. I ask the waiter for it, or not, and, suddenly, I look at the street and reach into my pocket.
So I stopped having such black thoughts. And also your letter, which helped me to understand many things. Thank you. Like the pain a son can feel when he loses his mother. I did it, but... what a risk!
Joe Silverman. Joe Silverman. That's right. He'll be the custodial parent for a few days. She gives the child to Joe, and he gives it back to her.
- Yes, try it. Are we good? I want to do this fast. We'll get the bikes on the new rack in 33, 34 minutes, something like that. - In 30? - We'll paint it orange. It'll look better than black.
It's chocolate. Kids, you're in for a big surprise. Come on, let's go. It's nice to have some real good chocolate once in a while, isn't it? You've earned it.
- Yes. Yes, of course. Yes. What they did was they built a huge wooden horse... They built a huge wooden horse and put it outside the walls.
Don't sleep with her. Wow. It's really amazing, Zack. How can you afford this place? My dad inherited it from me.
Just throw the damn ball. - So, how was your day? - Pretty good. I threw several balls to six different middle-aged men. All right, enough talking, you're ruining it.
Spare me the melodramata! Marge, I can't have a baby. Coordinating our nap schedules is going to be a nightmare. Besides, the only good relationship I ever had was with a hat. Then the wind blew it away.
Cthulhu! Your Spot! Your role in the story is complete. I want to savor this moment, Howard Lovecraft. And I will savor it after slowly devouring and digesting you for thousands of years.
How? I hit the jackpot at the reunion drawing. I don't even remember there being a drawing. I don't remember the meeting. But I'll take it.
You can make trips home. "We will prepare." Did I miss a conversation of ours about this somehow? We bought the boat together. We designed it together.
"We will prepare." Did I miss a conversation of ours about this somehow? We bought the boat together. We designed it together. Yes, but we skipped the part about when we talked about when and how we will use it.
Yes, but we skipped the part when we talked about when and how we will use it. Do you hate this idea? No, no, because I see how much you love it. And I understand why it would be a once-in-a-lifetime thing for them. I'm just... I'm thinking about it for a moment.
No. You can think about it. We could ask for an exception or something. And it's my money. I got it when I turned 25.
Have you ever killed a man before? I have. Paco, bury him. These guys have stumbled on the wrong pile of shit. Don't rub it in.
The only deal is if you don't give me what I want, I'll scatter your brains all over the wall, and then I'll go ahead and kill Mr. Black and then I'll finish her off, and I'll spread her tits all over this room. They didn't bring it. What did you say? There's money. I've seen it.
No. No. I've sealed the cat. If he dies, he'll stink up the whole house. Besides, the kids love him.
Dollar Bill won a $10 million bonus last year. Do you know how much he withdrew? Two thousand. You've known this for weeks. You bring it up now because you want to know something. What do you want to know?
The floor is moving, and you don't even see it. Or you refuse to see it. But if this were a stock play, it wouldn't be about pride. You would have already cut to the chase. Lara, the floor is moving because I'm the one moving it.
Police out east may have come into possession of a video of the incident taking on someone's phone, which purports to show that they hit Mr. Layner. - That should cut us off. - I'm not quite sure. - How bad is it? - Well, I haven't seen it yet, but I've been told it's damning enough that they're thinking of arresting you as soon as tomorrow.
Each of them had a phone out. Holy shit! I fucking love it when you do that. Your love is touching, but what I need now is to find that original video. Find it, pay what we need, get it.
Not what you are looking for ... yet. That's what I want to talk about. You know... There's a movement. Guys try so often, we call it the Bojangle.
What the heck is this? That's our internal audit of Kemlot Biochemical. When Axe takes a big contract on Kemlot, in the long run, that audit is going to be the key evidence that proves it went against the numbers because it knew something. There is nothing connecting that document to Axelrod. Axe sent it to me.
Why would you show him...? I... I tell my dad everything. And when I brought that book home, I needed advice. I knew what would happen with it, and I didn't know if I could or should be involved in it. And he convinced me to bring it.
I have to confess. I am working on my game with a professional. 300 an hour. But hey, at least I don't suck anymore. You want his number? You already gave it to me.
I should know the damn risks. Right. Like I'm a... tailor making uniforms for the Nazis. That's a big contract. Sure, but you don't care if he loses it.
You're mean. You saw it was me. Maybe I don't want to talk to you. Didn't you delete my number? No, I saved it in case you called, so I wouldn't answer.
Yeah. Why didn't you come here when you found the body? I thought she'd be missed at the tavern. Or maybe you thought the body... was too close to your grandfather's farm? Is that why you moved it?
So Anne Marie wrote to Nicole: "Delayed, I'll be with you soon". Only the poor thing makes a mistake. Instead of writing to the secret phone... that they've been using on the sly from you... she wrote to her regular phone. And you took it because you were at home.
You know what? No. I didn't. This endorsement is the campaign. Your father saw it today... the place where Adam was locked up.
Well, it's difficult. On the one hand, you have to keep individuals with criminal records away from important positions. That's how you weed out most people. We have a polygraph in the camp. Maybe we should have everyone take it.
Well, Nate, fair enough. I'm sorry it didn't work out. I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system. Andrew showed them to me, okay? So I know everything and now I just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
And are you going to get acetone peroxide? I know it's not the easiest thing, but I have some connections. I can make some calls and get back to Gerry. Assuming I can, what are we going to do with the cesium powder? Ready when you need it.
Hey, you're not the only one with experience. This is a highly unstable substance, okay? It's sensitive to heat, to friction... That's why I test carefully. Now do you want to see the video? Because I have it right here on my phone.
- Who should we give to? - Dimonda. September 11, 2001... A plane crashes into the north tower. You short aviation stocks in European markets making hundreds of millions of dollars. And you take that money, and you call it Axe Capital.
There's one more thing I'm curious about. Do you want to tell me a little bit about your time in prison? Why did you go there? Who told you about it? Nobody, I looked it up.
She seemed to enjoy irritating people. Cicely is truly a tourist attraction. I can see why Zoe Dyer's dig isn't popular. The agents recovered her phone. They sent it to Tech for analysis.
Ah-ah-ah. You made me suffer... And now, I'm going to make you suffer. And I have such a wonderful punishment for you. You probably appreciate it, too.
And I'm sorry about that, Jemma, because... Because maybe there was another way... and there was something else I could have done. Will died saving me. What you did was kill a thing, a monster. You haven't stopped being extraordinary all this time. So, uh... about this... abyss, as you call it.
I want the magic word. Please. And the video is intact. Thank you. I'm surprised you didn't delete it.
What's up? - Come on, let's go! - What are you doing? What are you doing? - Did you lock the attic. Po-po-why did you lock it?
I demand that you get high again... Thank you. Is that your dress? No. It's crystal. She, uh, bought it for her niece's christening.
- What? You have three rolls of duct tape under your collar. You taped me to my clothes? Your hair came out in the sea. But it's okay, because I taped it back on.
Put down the gardening equipment, Clive. Get out of my house before I cut off that stupid toupee. Where's my car? Don't tell him, Clive. Pete took it for the parade.
Time is what we need. We leave at dawn. We have to disable that SUV. We have to disable that SUV. If they take it, it doesn't matter how many earthlings they kill.
Last chance to withdraw. This plan has a high probability of falling apart. Right. Yeah. I wouldn't miss it.
I'm a spy, Bryan. I've been passing information to... Hey, shut up. I found the bug. Did you put it there?
I had to save our people. I was going to save them all. I wish you had. Shove your regrets up your ass. It took me a long time to get the subset open, but I got it.
How you send is your choice. Here. I recognize the sacred symbol, but what is that? This is the flame that contains the spirits of the commanders, of Lexa. Will you take it and become the next commander?
And you know, we're only part alien...and it's not a disease...it's an awakening. Interesting choice of words. I mean, for me. Terrigenesis made me the way I was supposed to be. I was given a gift...and I use it to stop bad people from doing bad things.
Pasta. If I wanted my illusion killed, I'd be having a conversation with Vause. In here, if you have power, you are in danger, my dear. Believe me. Especially when they demand their money and you don't have it.
Hello, my friend. - I just wanted to see how you were doing, if you were doing well with the truck. It wasn't my fault I got your job. It was assigned to me. I didn't even ask for it, so...
I lead a hard life, I abuse alcohol. I'm in delirium tremens. I needed to get it out of my system before I started. - Delirium tremens? - Yes, I use it sometimes.
I don't give a fuck who's paying who. I don't give a fuck about the money! Eighty thousand pounds is a lot of money. Do you know the ritual? Shall I let you do it?
- No! Drink it! Look, it's starting to freeze! Oh, good. Swallow it. Don't throw it up.
Yes. When we're ready. Because of how much I've put her through. Her life has been... I gave up breath when she was Brona and gave it back to her as Lily.
I'm gonna go home and go to sleep now, okay? - Hey, Sam. - Cause I'm so... Oh, for God's sake, Meg. The desk sergeant just found him.
You don't get divorced. I'm sorry, Dad, but no, that's... Honey, I love you, but all you know is life with me, life with Ken. You think the world just exists. It is made, by men who bend it to their will and the women we care about, either to choose to live in our world or to leave it.
You can leave that here. Well, if you want to. Make yourself at home, man. Any kind of envelope, anybody that shows up at any police station with my name on it, they need to call me. If they see who delivers it and they let that person go, they need to kick their asses and call me.
Is she Jewish? She's... she's Ukrainian, ma'am. It's all... this is all very sad. It is, but thank you for your time. We appreciate it.
- A coincidence, no doubt. - Maybe. But two incidents where customers get hurt, it could be something else. We remove the pot from the shelves in case there's glass in any of the others. But you're sure you bought it here, right?
As far as my father would allow. I wanted to ask you a few questions about the Richardsons. A happy family, would you say? No more or less than any other. Leo earns money, Annette spends it.
-How can you be so sure? -Because we have no choice. -A precious piece. -So where's the map? Atticus Nevins bought it earlier this year, but after he pulled Jimmy Hoffa's act, every relic hunter, dealer, and wannabe came to town to steal his entire collection.
You know what the funniest thing is? I didn't even know I had that map. But when I heard you were looking for it, I made sure to find it and put it in a safe place. So, uh... thanks for the heads up. Tell me you got it.
I tried to convince myself that it was just superstition. But you knew there was some truth to it. So you studied everything you could about the supernatural. All my life I've been looking for some proof that there's another world out there. And you've... you've been living it.
- The Prime Minister has... recently sent his personal assistant, Yuri Krupin, to this place. The reason... ...to end this project immediately. The Prime Minister is against a sanctuary? Yes. Because his opposition supports it...on behalf, the Ministers you see before you.
Dirt under the fingernails, haven't showered in a week. What did you learn from Patterson's boss? Nothing. It's either totally in the dark or part of the cover-up. What's wrong with you? Well, I cloned the corporate e-mail server and sent it to Eric and Nell.
- Did she forget them? Did she forget them? On one of those calls, Jamie left a message. - I never got it. - Yes, you did... because yesterday you deleted it.
I have some problems. I need a place to stay. Call me when you can. Jamie left the message at 8:32 a.m. Tuesday morning, the day he was killed. And according to the phone company, you heard it at 8:36 am.
I need a place to stay. Call me when you can. Jamie left the message at 8:32 a.m. Tuesday morning, the day he was killed. And according to the phone company, you listened to it at 8:36 am. And yesterday you deleted it.
Why did he do that? What was Jamie's problem? I don't know. But whatever it was, he didn't want me to bring them here. But why did he erase it?
- What? The phone! You said you got it on eBay! - I found it. - Tell him where you found it.
My wife made it... This hat... Isn't it illegal to make them work like this? The hat was donated. By whom? ... Who donated it?
All we could hear was her screaming. They left her there? Tied to the bed? Pretty much. Yeah. I took a knife... and I stuck it in her ear.
You kill important businessmen and seize their assets. - It's not... - You mean traitors? I know they organized a coup, but that's not... Yes, because you orchestrated it.
- What did Manny say? - I'll cover your shift, buddy. - And the car? - The Fusion. I'll adjust the odometer. I'll drop it off in front of your house.
I have to make some calls. I'll come to your office later. ... Get me LeAnn Harvey. Milkin will be staying with this man, Anton Khalski. He was the owner of the second largest bank in Russia until Petrov grabbed him in 2013.
It's an old relationship ploy I call "veering the other way." If you play along, sooner or later Lisa will lose interest in her horrible idea. You haven't used that trick on me, have you? No, I haven't. I learned it by observing other marriages.
Hey! Hey. Hey, the residue from the bombs, it's got 'nitramene' in it. I don't know what that is... but your tone of voice makes it sound bad. Uh, Howard Stark developed it after World War II.
Uh, Howard Stark developed it after World War II. It causes implosions. That's weird. How weird? How did they get it?
Hey, it's a liquid, so... - We could freeze it. - How? Liquid nitrogen. There's, uh... we use it in the containment module cooling thrusters.
Why did I quit the firm to become a writer? Because it's your dream. We follow our dreams. Yes. - How was your day? - Exhausting, but I managed.
You better find him fast. I own his tail. You know what? I think I know where he went. All right. I won't be long. I won't be long. Just keep the meter running. Charge it to Monkey Up. They'll pay for it.
- I'm sorry, who are you? - I'm from the neighborhood watch. Did you steal that banana from the Andrews' house? Don't lie to me. Please, I borrowed it.
It looks very real. We could sell a lot of these in the store. We should get one for Sophie. She's always asking for a pet monkey. Where did you get one?
Can you believe someone got rid of that? Well, we can use it as a prototype. He's a little bit fat. Like the Pillsbury character. He could be thinner. - Can I borrow it?
No, I don't have a damn picture of a video.... - Well, there I did it. - Hey. You got the crystal. I sent it earlier.
I just... I need a little more time. I'm not going to wait my whole life. I know, I'll take it. I'll take it. Could you give me a kiss?
- Please. - Thank you very much. It's always the traditional that works, the handkerchief you pull out of your sleeve, the bottomless cup of coffee, a mother's boundless love for her children. They know it's there. Sometimes they just take it for granted.
They are with me. What are you talking about, where? I love them so much, and it's hard to share. It's how you feel about your LEGO pirate ship. Did you see that you didn't want anyone to touch it?
Are you coming out of the psychiatric ward? No. My son had an asthma attack. - I'm sorry. Is he okay? - Yeah. Yeah, he's back to normal now, so I came to buy him this candy... There it is, we'll take it out.
"Fuchi"? Is that a legal term? Do you have a better word? Grace, I'll be blunt, no one wants your case. I took it because I'm the bottom of the pyramid in a place where seniority is everything.
I turned the corner and right in front of me was a church. It had an old sign out front. It stopped me in my tracks. The sign... The sign said, "Who do you say I am?" And as I read it, I heard the Lord speaking to me.
Most people in the jungle try to avoid contact... with the outside world. Their isolation is important to preserve the culture. It's still a good story. Paula, is your steak cooked properly, or would you like me to put it back on the grill?
Charles ran into the yard...to put our daughter's toys in. And I heard him howl as if he had hurt himself. I came out and found him on the ground... covered by some kind of... bark. I held his hand... and we saw flashes... random events ending in a terrible car accident. Does he see it too?
Long story long... turns out Daisy is so confident with her ability as an Inhuman... she thinks she can change the future.... It's funny. We're trying to do the same thing... Power is toxic, right? And she's right... you've never felt it... until you take it from someone else.
Don't go to prison! This way, this way. Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Reynolds, excuse me Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds, what inspired you... to create a hotel full of sharks? I wanted to create the best hotel in the world, and with this hotel, I deliver it, and I did it, with clean energy.
Will it be for wood cutting or household use? Neither. A lot of people recommend the Stihl 3000, but personally, sir, I say you can't go wrong...with this baby. Homelite calls this one the turbo model. That's right. And when those pesky teenagers...start snooping around our property, we take this bad boy and pass it...to my brother Gunnar over there.
- They are very strong. - Mom! Mom! Mom! I'm serious. Why don't we talk about money? Because I don't understand, okay?
One day? If they traveled north. Compass. This trail goes east. We'll follow it while the hawk covers all other terrain.
We haven't got time. I'm going in. Gideon! Where's Savage's money now? Dr. Boardman theorized that Savage entrusted it to the Bruemberg Group, the oldest bank in the world.
Six months. Dad, I'm sorry for your losses. You were right. This sport has no future here. There is a future, but you don't see it.
- No! No chance. Because tomorrow it's you and me. And I'm going to break every bone in your body. I'm going to pack you up and send you to your wife's.
What a good test subject I am for you. So full of neurosis. No, Miss, so full of pain. All of which is true. It manifests itself in many ways, so you can make sense of it.
I've hardly seen it during the past year...especially in such abundance. I've been about the same. Healing myself, in a way. Trying new things, dipping a toe into what this world has to offer. And how do you find it?
- Of course not. - Never. Good. Well, this priceless artifact is yours. If you want it, give me the damn crystal.
Ah, this leader of yours must be a real trickster. We have no leaders. We walk in pursuit of a common goal. That's what they tell you when you join a cult... but it's not really true. Eventually you will understand.
And your wallet, but it was nothing personal. What the hell is that man doing? He has no idea what the core is capable of. Relax. He's the one who invented it.
Don't get your hopes up, honey. I'm not the sentimental type No, but your partner, the physicist with the big brown eyes, is. Get the core back online. You'll turn it back on, or I'll put a bullet in your friend's head.
And if I ever get my hands on you, I'm going to rub all of "Rocky IV" on your ass. I'll remember that, comrade. We must leave, Colonel. There's still one more intruder, and he's got the thermal core. We don't need it now.
The young man with blond hair. He knows something... So what? You want a car, don't you? What if I could make sure you get one?
Without a second thought. Love, Morse. Imagine that. So where's the money? We'll find it at Paul Marlock's.
Why on earth would anyone want to keep a tiger here? How could he afford to feed it, anyway? I don't think he did. I think he was keeping it for someone who could afford it.
I suspect that if we were to put her in an identification parade, her colleagues would soon point to Lady Georgina as that young lady. Her sister discovered that not only was the animal that attacked her life, but that Dr. Lorenz was using it as part of his research. I believe he planned to use the tiger for his revenge, but Goggins got careless and the animal escaped. It seems that it was his sister who stole the tigress musk and impregnated Dr. Lorenz's handkerchief hoping it would attract the animal. But Ingrid Hjort borrowed it.
We'll want firearms, too, in case that comes back. I'll need to use your phone. Isn't it possible this is all a terrible mistake? We found your bag in Goggins' apartment, presumably soaked in musk in an attempt to bring it back. Anyway, how do you know it was Georgie who put it there?
Who parked in my spot? Bastian, I need you to sign this for me... - You want my autograph? - ...one thing. Here, so you can sell it on eBay.
You've done fucking great. Ma'am. - Miss! - Excuse me, miss! We're doing a little cultural event and we're going to have music. Any problems, tell me and I'll bring it down.
- Or for you. - What are you talking about? I was supposed to give this to someone else and he knows you have it, Harry. - Are you talking about the bracelet? - I know you're a good man that's why I gave it to you instead of him, but now he's coming for you!
In a few months it will be cie...cie... go. Phil, stop looking at your cell phone. It's making me very sleepy. There's a new treatment in Prague. It's not covered by the public system, but I'm willing to do anything.
And what is it for? You know... what it is. You've felt its power. Why, then? Why did you give it to me?
Or you can take a leave of absence until the research is finished. You are free to choose. Well, before I do this, I need some kind of assurance that you haven't lost your marbles. Rich, I think this bracelet controls my life. The woman who put it on me...
The woman who put it on me... - The one you fucked? - Did we forget that part? No. The woman who put it on me said it was yin and yang.
I won that money on a rigged roulette wheel. You don't know that for sure. I know the woman from the other night is a crook. She's the one who gave this to me. Then why did she give it to you?
I have a video of him gambling in my casino the night my father was killed after I claimed his debt. And yet Clayton led the murder investigation. Where's the video? In a safe place. When are you going to give it to us?
It was predictable. Turns out you were right about Kevin Grey's suicide. Does the name Golding mean anything to you? Why? An inmate over there told me.
POLICE: A package for the boss. SURI: What did you do with the money you won at the green dragon casino? HARRY: I burned it.
Trust me, Eve. No one wants you to get hurt. You're too valuable. Unique. You triggered it by giving the bracelet to Clayton. Your father... he didn't want you to have it.
Mr. Drake has guests as you well know. However, you should hear this. Frank, save me the soles. I'm sure it's close but new boots are expensive. If it weren't for the fact that I think you'd find this very amusing I'd take this thing and shove it up your...
It's a sight you won't soon forget, unless it was you who plunged the knife into his neck, which is just how I see it at the moment. Do you deny it? Would such a denial seem convincing to you, Inspector? Why don't you try? Every night, they clean it.
Our condolences for your daughter. I'll take the drink, Croker. But I don't think I trust you enough to sit down. A very fair answer. Got it?
Colleagues and I filed the patent for the original prototype, which was designed more than ten years ago. This technology is now used in volcanoes all over the world. It revolutionized the control of gas emissions from volcanoes. That's my baby. I'm happy to see him. It's been two years since I've seen it. Here it is, and it's still working.
Only one manuscript contains it. It is as important to Iceland as the Dead Sea Scrolls are to Israel. The codex was gifted to the king of Denmark by an Icelandic bishop in the 17th century. Hence its name, the "royal codex" or "Codex Regius". In 1971, Denmark returned it to Iceland, knowing that it was the soul of the country.
Another reason to reconsider inheriting the website from a psycho killer. Hey! The Morgue is not your podcast. I'm just appropriating her listeners. And now I'm using it to find out who those pranksters were.
Good heavens, you know I can't resist your muscular chest. Oh, my goodness. Now I run my hands through your hair. Gently stroking it. Until I take a lock and pull it back.
We can't move the body. They have drones. Stop it, Lolly. We can't move it. If I told you I already moved it, would you calm down?
Yes. Describe him to the orderly. Nondescript. Now look at his face. Let your eyes roam over it. What do you see?
No. You think I'm a spoiled bitch. We're not going to engage you in conversation, miss. What's tomorrow's treatment? They call it hydrotherapy.
the strange music I hear. I have to leave, before the day shift colleagues arrive. I'm sorry. One day soon, no one will touch her when she doesn't want to be touched. She'll either put on makeup or take it off.
Then she will be sedated. Then they will strap her to an operating table. Then they will use a drill to open her skull. It's not a medical device, it's a carpentry drill. Then they'll put a pair of tweezers on her skull... and open it up.
Don't you want to see it? - Mink. - Did you steal it? I have the receipt. Thanks, but I don't need it.
Why didn't we do it years ago? The bank doesn't just give you money. They buy the house and let you live in it until you pay back the loan with interest. Or not. We need a $3500 down payment. And we need it now.
No. Why do you get the last word? If you want the mortgage in your name, then take Carl's money. Otherwise, we'll find another way. I'll spend it on a car.
An alpaca farm, possible wolf attack. Could be wild wolves, but there was overkill. Better to be safe than sorry. Clay and I can leave on the next flight out of Syracuse. Let Jorge take him.
Not even after inheriting your father's title. You think we are the same. Fellow outcasts. But if you could undergo this treatment... if you could erase every horrible moment from your memory... every time your work was denigrated and you were treated like dirt. If for a moment you could feel like a lamb and not a beast.... wouldn't you?
- Amen. - Amen. Amen. I've been thinking, maybe we could move back to our old home. I have talked to the landlord and he is available, in case we want him.
- Yeah, they call them Ghost Riders. Wait a second, hey. That's my jersey. Where'd you get it? Coach gave it to me at practice.
Is that okay? If you've done something, we'll get over it. - Oh, sweetie. - We'll get into the program. My parents did it.
The sign that we establish, will be known everywhere. All the aberrations of evil that roam the Earth... will arise... and come here. Wait for it. Hey, guys. My phone, I left it upstairs.
Abbie. You. You, your plan worked. Crane found me. I was trapped in a place, Pandora calls it the Catacombs.
No, please, no! No luck in the land of Nod? Not tonight. Or last night. I thought your retirement from the FBI would make your rest easier, but it's made it worse.
Hey. Sit down? Oh, no. I'm standing two men up, Lieutenant. I'm creating a desert climate in our Mid-Atlantic home. It doesn't make sense, it's not natural, but since I want it, it is.
During and after the failure of the Twins, Franklin experimented with the Twins... undead creations of soldiers he brought to life without the immortality of the Twins. He wanted to study these beasts, to see if he could find a piece of Death, which would allow him to raise the formidable Twin, and he would know how to control it. Wings, but to no avail. Or maybe he just hid it carefully.
In Iraq cave you took more than just gold. Oh, even then I was always looking for something extra to sell. I ran away from my unit and what do I find? I had no idea of the power I had in my hands. And then I felt it, immediately.
How are you? I was confronted by a very horrible ghoul... Come here. Nevins came out with a document that Corbin had kept for 20 years. And then we got him back.
Daisy is not Andrew. I pull the trigger because you tell me to. You're the Director. I didn't ask for the switch for Lincoln's suit. You gave it to me.
Save her. Is she unconscious? - Yeah. Okay. I thought you had her scent. I've lost it.
I left this mountain ten years ago and yes, I was lost. I stole, I shot, I lied, I cheated, I sinned. I lived in a building that was 200 meters high. I communed with so-called holy men, liars, all of them. I got money, spent it on women and poisons.
- What? - Cami, you have to listen to me. One of the Strix witches knows where you are, and she knows you have the white oak. You're a little late. She's already taken it, which means, I guess, the Strix have it now.
But it wasn't funny. I actually wanted to ask you something. already? why did you delete that post about Toby? did you see it?
Did you tell Yvonne to leave her cell phone at lunch? Yes. To show her that she shouldn't trust me. That's what I told her. Yeah, but you didn't tell her I took it.
It means I can't help you. What the hell do you think you're doing? This is the SUV I was asking about. Do you know who was driving it last night? Maybe I loaned it to a friend.
I'm curious about the process, how do you guys do it? We're still figuring it out. Really? I was hoping you guys had it under control by now.
They are nothing... They're nothing but filthy... They're nothing but stinking devils... - They're nothing... - "Take one." "If divorce was an option, I would have done it years ago."
- No, it's still not a possibility. He has a ten year option on my contract and you can bet your boots I will never work in this or any other town again. No, trust me, dear, the only way I can get rid of my dear husband is if one of us is in a box. Are you going to tell us what happens? And bring the ending forward to when we see him at the movies?
Hmm, let me guess... it didn't end up like this? She had an affair. They got divorced. And then Richard sent Dr. Shaw a death threat. It's been over a year, but that kind of anger can spread when you least expect it.
The container is found. I heard you. So why aren't we out there getting it back? Why all the fuss? I guess if someone wants it bad enough to steal it, then maybe it should be done, then.
Not exactly. Ah. Or is it because you think everyone is trying to hurt you. That's because they are. But trust me, I didn't choose it.
I'm not a thief, I'm an actor, Louie Delgado. I had an arc in Party of Five, look me up. I love LA Even homeless people have an IMDb page. You care to explain why you were caught pawning Tim Dunlear's championship ring? Listen, more importantly, why did you take it to a pawn shop?
I can't describe it. He has a new appetite. An insatiable hunger he can't seem to satiate. How do you know? I've seen it before.
If Malcolm sees you, he'll kill her. I'm sorry, but I can't risk it... her life is at stake. Okay. So you're just gonna get them both killed, right? He needs this money to leave town. I won't give it to him until she's safe.
Dad, Mom, just... There are no charges against the young men at the moment, but that could change. Who the hell did you steal that desk from? We didn't steal anybody's desk, Dad. We took it out of a dumpster.
Thank you. Your mom, she picked out that vest for you. It's too small for you. Yeah, well, I'll tell her the same thing. I tell her whenever she tries to get me to wear it.
On your feet! Sing. said the rabbit * Or the hunter will shoot me dead Take it down! Did you touch it?
That reminds me... your presence is no longer required here. You can thank my agents for completing their mission. Your idealism will doom this planet. No. That's what will save it.
- You know exactly what I mean. I'm going to go find their lair. And when I do, I'm going to take off this human cover I wear. I won't freeze. I'll cut his body in half and bury him in the dry sand.
I congratulate you. - Thank you. Shit, I didn't expect the applause. To be frank, I never believed in this crap before. I was going to rehab, but no one told me they were doing it for free in here.
Don't lose heart, okay, and take care of each other. This is a beautiful piece of work. Thank you. I'll believe it when I see it. I'll believe it when I see it.
Just like that? Well, he'd done it before. I just followed him. What about the edge? Every tower has an edge. How did they get it up?
What did that bitch say? - Watch your language. - We found your stash, Eddie. That ain't mine. I've never seen it before.
Starting at the front, through the windshield, continue around the side of the vehicle, when we actually have gunshot residue. The shooter was right next to the car, inside the vehicle. Yeah, if she was trying, then Mom stopped to make a heroin sale in front of the wrong house. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Our victim slowed her vehicle, but kept it in the drive?
- I didn't come here to argue. - Gary, it's okay, you don't... I just got a question I got to ask. II apologize for the zoo thing. Oh, oh, is that what we call it now?
Well, not according to her status reports. They say Sharon Beck has passed all her drug tests, hasn't missed an appointment with her parole officer, has all her AA records checked. She recently changed residences, but it was reported that. Now, I have a new address for her and a phone number. If you need it...
Why don't you lie down on the ground right here, Buddha, and we'll check all that out. That's not necessary, officer. You're a big guy and I really can't shoot you. The work orders don't match the plates on half of these vehicles. I say we shut this place down and search it inch by inch.
I plant the gun in Reverend Copkiller's church. And this phone. You planted it, too. And that's important because? Because someone used it to call both Tamika and Emile just before they were killed.
She always sounds credible, no matter what she says. If your client could tell us where Gary is, it would help us take her version of events more seriously. Gary has one of those disposable cell phones - does that help? If you know the phone number and if Gary is still using it.
Notice the minorities together. We feel safe together. - Congratulations, Lieutenant. - Congratulations, Lieutenant. Marriage is a beautiful thing, which is why Provenza does it so often.
What are you going to do? What are you going to do? We have done many things both good and bad here. - We've lost our seat. - We'll earn it back if we don't fight for Travis.
Its true form? It needs a total of four living souls to consume. And then it will roam the Earth. Four souls, one for each corner of Hell. Where he is trapped. After that, he will be unchained from his suffering. And he will be free to walk the Earth. Well, how do we defeat him?
For all of you. When technology is able to improve and reproduce is the moment when we become inferior to the machine. You have killed someone, Niska! Everything your men do to us, they want to do to you. Dad didn't destroy all his work before he died, he hid it inside us.
Yes? The woman Riphagen was working with. Can I look up her real name? No, the file is mine, remember? You look it up then?
Nothing to worry about. Why is he still in Lengcheng? Everyone is looking for him. What about the shipment? The police are checking it, I didn't expect it so quickly.
Where is your show? I said, "At Pittsburgh Improv." Where is that? I ended up Googling it. And I sent it to him. And the phone rings.
Very dry. Two olives. No, I said very dry. That's too much vermouth. Will you serve it in a cauldron?
- I'm sorry. - Yeah, I'm sorry. What's wrong? Bill's dad was in an accident. A truck hit him.
I don't recognize that accent of yours. But if it's about your sick Aunt Fiona, please. Is that my boyfriend Jack? What do you need? I'll get it, I'll get it.
"Thank you." I called a cab to come get Jack and take him to the station, we can wait outside, and then I can take you to the museum. Yeah? What theater? My dad bought an old porno theater and we're fixing it up to be an improv place.
Even if people get uncomfortable, or angry. Because it's impossible for them to fix these problems, if they don't know.... So what did you think of what Monte said? I mean, how do we expect a bunch of legislators and social workers to know what we go through when they're not living our lives? The only way real change will happen is if we demand it.
Did you talk to anyone about me? Because they took me out of where I was and put me in a group home. I thought you didn't like it there. That's true, but this new place sucks. Well, I mentioned it to a woman I'm working with, but...
Characters like Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse fought to the end. And, of course, in the end, the end came. I am honored to be related to Sitting Bull. We have now reached a point where we can survive and thrive and we have to do it to honor our ancestors, to honor Sitting Bull, because they didn't want to lose their way of life. And we fought and fought to preserve our way of life, and we still do.
The $3,600 was for the reward. The three names you gave me ended up dead. I took a big risk giving you those names. I know you did. And if I had the money, I'd give it to you, but I don't.
And then I got here, and... it's amazing that I survived this long without knowing I was a wizard. I can't go back. Okay. [Chuckles] There's a spell that makes it so that if they interrogate you, they can't read your mind. I'll write it down for you.
Mine too. Useless and toxic. I didn't learn magic formally when I was little. I heard you weren't invited to take the Brakebills entrance exam. How did you even find it?
Okay, okay, okay, okay. First of all, can I... Why did you give me that book? Fillory and More, book six. I thought you'd appreciate it.
"Fillory and More," book six. I thought you would appreciate it. I've lost it. I guess I was wrong. No, you weren't, I... I need to read it.
Drugs are coming in from the rear. It's like this. Some guy probably comes to visit her and gives her long, passionate kisses, but instead of sticking his tongue in her, he sticks a little packet in her. She has to swallow it, because after the visits, they strip you naked and poke you in every cavity. So she shits it out in the shower, where it's easier to get the stuff out of her fucking ass so she doesn't lose it in the toilet.
Thank you. I just have one more question. On the dock, before they took you away, did Aurora have the shot? I saw her. She didn't.
Let her. - That's the way Grace likes it. - Are you all right? Well, no, I'm not. I'd actually like some tea but if you do, then I'll decide we need toast as well.
Baby, do you know where my black bag is? No. Do you get up at night? - What's that? - You get up at night? Oh, you found it.
You go up to the station. - You exchange the briefcase. - I know. My son can do it. Look what the fucking Polack did.
If someone saw something out of the ordinary and tweeted about them, I'll find out. Great. Deepak, I'd like you to take Clara and me to the neighborhood where Will was found. Yes. They call it Kidney Town.
Deepak, I would like you to take Clara and me to the neighborhood where Will was found. Yes. They call it Kidney Town. Kidney Town? Yeah, that's what the locals call it.
The ship from Egypt, sir. Arrived in port in the night. Do you have the paperwork? The manifest? I have it right here, sir.
I am aware that you are anxious to participate. Every day we wait our task becomes more difficult. The Master is building an army. I will not be reckless. I made that mistake once and I will not make it again.
We'll find them tonight. What's the matter? Minow didn't take them to the shipment? He did better than that. He took us straight to the facility where they were holding him.
Here. I'm going to make them pay for what they did to us. This book is the bait. You want the Master? He'll go after whoever has it.
Anyway, thanks for taking my call. Goodweather... I'll do the talking. I've got your damn book. If you want it, you'll have to go all the way.
Okay. Ready? Yes. Very good, little monkey. How will you get this delicious blood? That's right, you take the tube, pass it through the cage and drag the dish towards you.
Neither Tommy nor I can be framed in any way or the deal is off. Ghost told me he will eliminate Milan. He's using Ruiz to do it. I know you had a plan with Ruiz. Ruiz told me, right before I stabbed him.
He's using Ruiz to do it. I know you had a plan with Ruiz. Ruiz told me, right before I stabbed him. Tommy, where's the body? It's under the fucking Long Island Expressway, where I left it.
You see, here's the problem we have, Mr. Jenkins. We know that you couldn't have gotten Mr. Knight's money out of the bank...while he was in prison. Because Mr. Knight was the only one who could get it out. So here's what we're thinking. Once he was sure Mr. Knight had his money, he went to his room... in the middle of the night, killed him and stole it for himself.
When I opened the bag it was just... that. Yes, of course it was. That's why you broke into the room the next night. Because you were still looking for the money. You didn't find it that time, did you?
Did you deny it to him? After what you did for him? You... spent two years in jail. Why did you confess to a crime you didn't commit? Who said I didn't commit it?
Listen, Jackson. This is serious. A man died. This was his phone. For the last time, how did you get this?
¿60? More than 25. Yes, 25 plus 35. Listen. If I make a deal with you, will you keep it?
Yes, although my hair was shorter. What's the name of your kingdom? China. And who rules it?
I told you, you don't have a choice. If you have a thing for your son or care whether he lives or dies. Now, drink up. Here's my bow. Nobody expects you to shoot it right.
- Good. Take me with you. The only other person who knows as much about this case as you do is me. You came to me once, for help. I saw where it was going and I told you to stop.
Yeah, he's hiding something. And how do you know? Five decades in uniform, I know what he looks like. The same way I knew you broke my car glass playing baseball even though you said you didn't. I didn't break it playing baseball.
And how do you know? Five decades in uniform, I know what it's like. The same way I knew you broke my car glass playing baseball even though you said you didn't. I didn't break it playing baseball. I hit it with a bat.
I've asked myself that question. It's something about my DNA that makes the process just... work. And you just agreed. No, I didn't. They just did.
It's beating like crazy. Okay. Okay, sit down, and let's get started. I thought you liked pain. Only when I ask for it.
They stick their heads, I want us there. Go get them. Agent Pritchard, a word. Pritchard, I know some of these other agents will be looking at you sideways for turning your partner and your boss in, but from my point of view, that was damn good work. - You took an oath, and you defended it.
In a deal this big, I want to know everything about the other person. So what do you know about me? I know this business used to belong to Ray Carson. And now it belongs to you. I know you run it better than Ray.
We are prepared to cooperate fully with this investigation. Excuse me for a moment. Something is going around in my head that's bothering me. I thought you just knew his nickname. But it's not that you did.
Excuse me for a moment. Something is going around in my head that is bothering me. I thought you just knew his nickname. But it's not that you knew it. It was the way you told her, and what you said about her.
It is oil of vitriol. It's a toxin, it darkens the victim's liver and it's not mine. It's not mine. Since Francisco's liver was blackened, do you think Narcisse planned it?
Where? I will go in your place. To the Saint-Denis cathedral where Francis is buried. Find the embalmer who removed the king's organs. Ask him if the liver was already black when he took it out.
"I confronted my mother about her poisoned soup. I asked her why she felt she deserved to die." These are my personal thoughts and feelings! You have no right! "I took the poison she used on me, held it to my lips, hoping I was finally going to see the excruciating pain she had caused me all my life."
Didn't you leave after 8:00? May I see your closet? Yes, yes, you may. Last fall your tailor made you a suit out of this material. Do you remember it?
A person on a bus platform burned my lapel with a cigarette. So... did you get it fixed? No, no, I hate damaged things, no matter what. Did you throw the suit away? No, I gave it away.
So... have you taken it in to be fixed? No, no, I hate broken things, no matter what. Did you throw the suit away? No, I gave it away. I took it with me one afternoon when I was strolling along the Seine, as is my habit, and gave it to a tramp.
Where did you find him? - Down by the river. His partner picked up his pants. Monzin could have told us the truth, Chief. If he gave it away a week ago, he couldn't have worn it two nights ago.
His partner picked up his pants. Monzin could have told us the truth, Chief. If he gave it away a week ago, he couldn't have worn it two nights ago. See if he can tell us how old the burn is. And if it's less than two days old, then Moncin's lying about when he threw it away.
It is a dark thing. Maybe an animal. - It's a dog. - A dog? Now, Elena... I want you to take the dog... and get it out of the room.
They also took all our chocolates and toilet paper. This isn't right, Scooter. I have to go talk to Piggy. Kermit, everyone seems to love the show! I think we did it!
Okay, guys. You have 90 minutes. Your time starts now. We all have one thing The memory of that moment that we think we'll never get over.
An admonishing story about handing over power to an impressionable group of smelly, sloppy kids. Something like that would never happen in my classroom. Okay, open the books to page one, please. "The blond boy descended one last stretch of rock and began to make his way toward the lagoon. Although he had taken off his school sweater and was dragging it in one hand, he felt the gray shirt sticking..."
I can't. I'm too nervous. They're going to win. You don't know that. I don't know anything about rugby, but... I feel it in my bones.
- But nothing. If you don't know what you're asking, Pascal, be careful what you imply. Walter, I need your support. Everything depends on it. The team needs it.
That's enough! Do you hear me? Goddamn it. We all have one thing we're ashamed of. The memory of that moment is so embarrassing that we think we'll never forget it.
Janvier? - It's the boss. - Boss? Find out when the blue and cream Citroën broke down on Quai Henri IV. And communicate the details of the vehicle to the press. We want anyone who's seen it to come forward.
I saw it parked at Au Petit Albert. And what is Au Petit Albert? A small bistro, run by a married couple near where I live. The wife stinks of garlic. - When did you see it?
You... you've been seen with him in a video. below deck, opening a container. I don't know what you're talking about, ma'am. Okay, I just need the manifest. I wish you congressional aides would talk to each other. I gave it to another man this morning.
I am fine. We can't stay here. If Vorza got away, he'll be back with an army. All right, we've got to move the body before someone finds out. We have to move the body before someone finds out.
It is a rehabilitation center in Birchwood. He said he lived in a beautiful building with a doorman. Anyway, I also found a video on his profile. I sent you the link. Great, we'll look at it now.
Police have a photo of her riding a bike on the Santa Monica Freeway. On the carpool channel. Just be careful, okay, honey? This is my workbench. The L.A. Oyster King is coming and this little garage won't know what hit it!
I've already coordinated with San Diego PD, so.... Oh, that's great. Well, shit, Knox. I smell a promotion. And unlike Angela, you did it without sucking anyone's dick.
I smell a promotion. And unlike Angela, you've done it without sucking anyone's dick. She didn't suck Mike's dick to get on the task force. The justice department made a deal. If Ruiz takes it, we'll finally have a witness testifying against Lobos.
No. Tommy wants to keep the baby? Tommy doesn't know? I really want to tell him. I just... I haven't decided if I'm going to have him yet.
This one killed Bob and Sue Grant's 14-year-old son. And this is the gun that killed Agent Edward Meechum. U.S. MARINE INFANTRY There aren't many Secret Service people buried at Arlington. I'd say he earned his place. I underestimated how important he was to me, and how much I relied on him.
All right, then. Tell us about that phone. What was Annie Green's phone doing... in your possession? I found it. Where did you find it?
What was Annie Green's phone doing... in your possession? I found it. Where did you find it? In a Lebanese restaurant. Did you tell anyone?
I found it. Where did you find it? In a Lebanese restaurant. Did you tell anyone? So basically, you stole it.
So basically, you stole it. Listen. I've been involved in something. If the cell phone is involved in a death, I don't know anything about it. I find a phone, I turn it on to see whose phone it is... and all of a sudden, they show up at the restaurant.
Thank you, George. You made me win a lot today. Thank you, George. Very well, then. I think I'm going to save my money, just like you, Master. You've earned it.
We've got every armed man looking for him. Is that your boy? Yes, sir. Well, you're a fool if you don't tie him up right. That Nat Turner's a contagion. You never know which nigger's gonna get him.
Good schools. Do you know the gang "Los Guapos"? It's their turf, but we have an agreement. So I assume it will extend to my baby as well. If the baby poops, would you clean it up front to back or back to front?
Wow, you could be in a movie for life. - Thank you. - Let's make this easy. You want the couch? Whoever sits on it the longest gets it.
Thanks to their ridiculous safety requirements. Yes. Unless, for charity, I could undo my restraints. I'd still be in his medieval straitjacket, but at least I'd have a degree of control over the movement of my arms. Hey, maybe you don't get it.
When I lost my medical license I set up an illegal clinic. Before, I often did plastic surgery for idiots who wanted a smaller nose, bigger breasts, sometimes a longer penis.... More to the point, then you became interested in.... Gender reassignment operations, yes. After I couldn't practice officially, I discovered a huge black market for that type of surgery. Most people who wanted it didn't want to go through an endless waiting period, and added to that, they often couldn't afford the huge costs.
The package has arrived. Oh, no. Oh, that's great. That's great. Wait. Why "oh, no"? Guess who signed for it?
All right, let's move on. All right, let's move on. What would you do with a million dollars? What if I told you I had a million dollars? - Then I would steal it.
Okay. You know what? Hold on a second. We have this new heat-activated antiseptic gel. You're gonna love it. Astronauts use it to masturbate.
I love you. But you're going to buy me a real ring. You're getting a diamond the size of a raisin. We can go tomorrow. We'll pick it out together.
Jack, why don't Mae and I ask the deputy minister for help interviewing Malik's ex-fiancée, and while you and Simmons go talk to Omar without babysitters in between? Sounds like the perfect plan to me. The Khan el-Khalili market is the original burial site of the Fatimid dynasty that founded Cairo. Yes. That's exactly what the ancient Romans said when they saw it in 100 AD.
He owes his sister a great debt of gratitude. I wasn't aware that the money came with a debt attached. Of course not! It's what you deserve, Arthur. We want you to have it.
My mustache. I've been growing it for weeks now, and you've both been conspicuously silent. It's very stylish. What mustache? Of course, Jay. Like I'm supposed to believe you haven't seen it.
That doesn't tell me anything. It's a Himalayan jar in the shape of an elephant's head. I use it to irrigate mucus from my nasal cavities. It was in the sink. Then I hope I threw it away.
I remember his bulging drawstring pants. He will help, too. He'll carry the tank to my room. And forget about the body. When I've dropped it off, Skipper will take care of the rest.
According to the latest diagnostic information, the agent has been identified as influenza A. with hemagglutinin 7 and neuraminidase 2, or H7N2, an avian influenza that until now was not known to be transmitted between humans. It appears that the genome of this virus has been manipulated to give it a higher pathogenicity and endow it with the capacity for human-to-human transmission. We discovered a container among the belongings of patient zero that had traces of a biological agent. We must assume that he brought it into the country and into the hospital, where it infected Dr. Sanders.
We are taking orders from her. That's the way this works. The only people who have their jobs under threat are you and I. What, then, are we supposed to take it? I don't like broccoli, but my doctor tells me to eat it, so I do.
Yeah. I'll tell him you're evil, that's what I'll tell him. Also, the satellite phone the thug brought in has a government serial number on it. Lex thought he was calling him from a police satellite band phone. That's weird, that they had it, isn't it?
Did you order a cheese staff? Yes, put it on the table please. Would you mind lending me your work cell phone? - My work cell phone? - Can I borrow it?
That's highly valued on the black market. So you want to get out of the cordon straight to prison? Minimum security prison. It's better than this place. And who's going to prove we did it?
- No. You're hurting the boy. You're hurting him. I don't care. My brother needs him.
Take one. This enclosure was built for the purpose of amusement and study. I converted it into a garden worthy of our splendor. I dare say it is my favorite place in the whole Kingdom. I am pleased that you saw it with your own eyes before you chose to leave us so suddenly.
Are you really okay, Dwight? I mean, I just said it's happy hour at the pussy bar and Dwight eats for free, and you're telling me no? Is that okay? I haven't finished the job. I haven't earned it yet.
- What am I doing out there? You're practicing. We have to surrender all our weapons. - We can't. - If you put it away and they find it, someone dies.
- Maybe. - Then make me a bullet. You're not gonna convince me, Eugene! You owe me and you owe him. And if there's a price, I'll pay it.
Maybe then he would have less anger problems. I would go back and tell him to take the Suez Canal first. Then he would dominate most of the Mediterranean, and the Third Reich would have access to oil. I can't do that. They need it over here.
Who did that to you? Who did that to you? It's done. You can't go around looking like that. Surely I deserve it.
He stole my hair. But isn't that flattering, in a way? What if I missed my one chance to have a physical relationship with someone? For that, you don't need a time machine. That broom closet is right where you left it.
From the ground? I don't know. It was a baby... It was small and slippery. It didn't look like a gummy to me, Flaca. When I swallowed it, I felt its little paws, with little fingers.
Of course, that will involve going through the whole orchard and the whole greenhouse, which we were trying to avoid. What did Caputo say? He didn't answer the phone all morning. Okay, then I'll decide. All right, then I'll decide.
I thought maybe Svetlana or V could help me. They're at home while they're interviewing their vaginas. Wow, what do you mean you got kicked out? I had to talk to a counselor, and he's forced me into an alternative program for teen moms. They call it distance learning, but you know what I call it?
Nothing. I'm happy. Hey, how's To-Go doing to go? What happened to your cast? I let the guys cut it off.
Water leaks take a long time to fix. I feel bad we didn't make it back for dinner. Oh, they're fine. They heard us and left. Yes. I also heard the foil so I think Jessica wrapped our ham and took it with her.
You know, this is the four-minute window on Wednesday afternoon where we have the whole house to ourselves. Louis. I've been efficient because of my bracelet, I even had time to pick us out a French CD. - Very extravagant. - I got it borrowed from the library.
On the phone? Of course, silly. My number is easy to remember. It's 407-555-com. I'll find out someday.
This isn't going to make... A kid can make a mix. What the hell? Where's the computer? We put it away after being publicly embarrassed in front of Eddie's entire school.
We don't have time for him anyway, with the 100 hours of community work we have to do. You'll do it for me, won't you? But you spent all the money on it. Well, the good thing about computers is that they last forever. We'll get it out in a few years.
I'll be the judge. That's a nice vest you're wearing. I wonder where he got that vest. I bet he got it from Structure.
You said I had to be taller. Now you are, son. I'm so excited for you. Are you giving me your apron? Yes, to wash my hand, And then you'll give it back to me.
The guy says, where's your proof? And I say, right here. Eddie, don't make everything about pizza. It's about responsibility. I know if I buy you that watch, you'll wear it for a day, and then you'll throw it away.
We assumed that, technically, medicine was in us. I guess you didn't go to the bar either. No, we didn't. We did. We did. We... we hated it.
- Where is my watch? - Where's my daddy? I lost my daddy's watch! Tell us all the details. I had taken it off to take a shower on Saturday.
- Where is my daddy? I lost my daddy's watch! Tell us all the details. I had taken it off to take a shower on Saturday. I know I put it in a safe place...
In front of the G-Dubs. A witness... Firefly toy. And then, I don't remember. I don't know if I put it back on.
What a twist. Tell us about it. Well, on Saturday, I walked by Eddie's room AND saw that he had left my watch unattended on his bed. So I took it to teach him a lesson.
Tell us about it. Well, on Saturday, I walked by Eddie's room AND saw that he had left my watch unattended on his bed. So I took it to teach him a lesson. And then I lost it.
He moved it to Saturdays because he gets nervous during "American Gladiators." Go! Go! Go! Go! Gladiators, get ready! Oh, no, he didn't. He only took it off for the shower.
Wait. If that's your watch, then... whose watch is this? It's a new one. I bought it. I saw my watch in your room, and I thought you were being careless, so I took it to teach you a lesson.
And I work in an aquarium. Well, I work in... Keep the name. You can have it. I don't want it.
Listen to me, Busta Rhymes. People expect greatness from Topaz Industries. That's what my name means, and that's what I expect from you. When my father died after swallowing all those buttons, I didn't take his rotisserie and turn it into a number one hip-hop, clothing line, multimedia empire to play it safe.
That's not how Erica got the flight information. Instead, she found a weakness: a low-level U.S. Marshal was the victim of a classic spear-phishing campaign. Leaked the flight number and the U.S. marshal transported the witness. What about the witness's name? I don't see it anywhere here.
You can use it to chat with friends, order drinks ... You can use it to send the marshal a warning. I'm on it. Manifest check. All right, got it.
You don't want it? No, it's okay. I'm just asking you to ask me before you get me into anything, okay? You'll have to step over my dead body to publish that book. You haven't even read it, Garrett.
We'll take it from there. Hey. Hey, did you do what he said? Did you put the ipecac in his brownie? Yeah, the idiot gobbled it up whole.
Are you busy chasing a promotion when a cop could have been in danger? I'm sorry, but I'm not going to apologize for wanting a career. Well, I need a partner I can trust. So if you ignore a 10-13 again, you can find someone else to patrol with. So after seven years of asking her for the car, she left it to me in her will.
Okay, I've got everyone's papers except... Jenna's. Here it is. Paper? What, did you write it with a pen by candlelight? Why don't you fax it to me while you're at it?
Maybe we shouldn't take the risk. We can't sell a dead man's items. If it's upside down, it might be flooded. The only thing is really Uusimäki's scooter If his wife wants it back, and we can look for a buyer for that.
He chose to appear to me as Aaron and no, I'm not crazy. It happened. Is that even remotely possible? Yeah, there's some really psychedelic shit that goes with that tea. They would... they drank it and they saw it in their minds.
This was not an accident. The fail-safes have been disconnected. This was intentional. The matrix prism is totally fried. Someone turned it upside down.
Why do we say we love drugs? That I was being cool. I don't know where the "yum-yum" came from. [Sighs] Well... Maybe it's okay if we take it.
Excuse me, what the hell is going on? Sweetheart, is that you? Daddy! What are you doing? ! THREE YEARS LATER So... there's this crazy little ninja thingy and then she rams the knife in her hand through Ted's head. He pulls it out and then grabs the knife, grabs the....
His name is Carne. I'm sorry. Exchupasangre subject. How would you take a nickname like "Meat"? I didn't want to go there, but I reckon he's going to keep it.
To change the world. But in your case, it's the truth. You are. You will change it. But you won't save it.
He said either I would listen to him or he would hit me again. We went in the car... We were in the car for a long time. I never saw the puppy again, though. I never saw him.
Yeah, but Gina Bryant didn't mention a child. Well, Violet could have had the baby before Gina's abduction. Gina wouldn't even know. If we're right about this, that means there's another kid out there. And who's taking care of it?
Wait! Please! Even if you hand over the king and queen to me, they will never pay! Look what they have done to this once proud people. They have plundered it and wrecked it and ruined our lives!
You can publish it or you can write a real book that tells the American people who you are, what you've been through, what you think about what you've been through. A book that is truthful. A book that is hard. This book was easy to write and easy to forget. The book you have to write will be hard, but people will remember it.
It wasn't like me and Noel, or Bonehead You know, we were in over our heads He suffered from nervous breakdown.... "My nerves are frazzled... "Or my tiredness makes me nervous," I don't know. I never had it.
What? "I mean, are we the biggest idiots in the world?" We were not deterred We arrived in New York. Bonehead stood up. "You play bass and we do it as a four-piece."
I enjoyed every minute of it. It meant everything, or nothing. Life or death. I wouldn't change a thing. I would do it all over again, without thinking.... This is history!
Classic dad block. 'Can we have a pony? ' 'Well, let me think about it.' 'And how is that pony? 'I haven't seen him yet.
Dad, can we let Amy switch everything over to the new system? - I'll think about it. - Dad! There's nothing to think about. This is exactly what we need. I said I'll think about it.
Hi. Sorry to bother you. I just wanted to tell you that I love that book. That's good to know. To be honest, I feel really weird reading it alone, I just opened it half way through.
And you can help me. That case is officially closed. No, it's not. You know it's not, Angela, okay? - Cross reopened it.
Well, I'm glad to know that beating a mere mortal still holds a certain charm for you. It was brutal. I've never actually played video games before. Oh, come on. Don't rub it in.
JP? That's very fascinating, but you could look over there. What's that? - Caroline knew about the affair. - She never mentioned it.
I'll be back in a minute to talk about your speech. What is it? Don't send that report. I told you. If you finish this with François before I get on the plane, I'll take it with me.
Mr. Hammond? A few months ago I was interviewed to replace Caroline. Everyone in that group knew I deserved the job. However, they snubbed it. They gave it to some idiot from Oxbridge who had made his career in Brussels.
Those who were marked... those who have been chosen... - often did not choose themselves. - I hear you, sister. The Tate family were cattle rustlers. They stole cattle and branded them as their own.
We thought you would find this place and our appearance less disturbing. And yet you seem upset. My friends, my city... my whole world is in danger. Zoom is ravaging the power he stole from me, and I'm being held here. You were given a rare and precious gift, and you refused it.
And yet you seem upset. My friends, my city... my whole world is in danger. Zoom is ravaging the power he stole from me, and I'm being held here. You were given a rare and precious gift, and you turned it down. No, I didn't turn it down.
Did you hear that Herb Shapiro bought an 80-foot yacht? Herb? Yeah. I tried to talk him out of it. The two best days in a yacht owner's life: the day he buys it and the day he goes overboard.
Rosie, what are you doing? Interviewing witnesses. Mr. Peters has information about our victim. So he was telling me... His dog's been dumping in my yard for years and he never picks it up.
But all that, it's just rumors! - How can...? - Pastor, it's really not that simple. Still insisting... The spirit, have you seen it?
Man, that car has been with him through thick and thin. In war and peace. It was his everything. I mean, I don't even think he had a CD player. That's true but he loved it.
Forget the stupid book. Chasing that thing is just gonna give you a leg cramp. You don't know what you're talking about. I don't? You're the one who grew up your whole life looking for that book, and you never found it.
Stop it! What's your genius plan to get the book back? Have one of our epic parties tonight. And the guys who stole your car will show up. We may not be able to find the book, but we can go after the guys who are looking for it.
Someone read my article and decided not to publish it. Your journalistic style couldn't be more outdated. - Satire? I'd say "throws away." - I never thought they would read it.
That's why I never wanted to do another program. Everything was perfect. BoJack, calm down. C-A-L-L-M-A-T-E. Not everyone will love the show, but people will remember it.
Lord God, it is I, Selina. - Give me wisdom and strength. - Give me wisdom and strength. Give us your comfort. Give us your comfort. I have it.
We were in another boat... We were scared, but we were surviving. We hit the hull when we left the harbor in Long Beach. We... freaked out. We thought we had fixed it well, but we pushed it.
We never need anything. Savings. A home for Celia and Luis. It's a vision for us. This place makes me feel like the rest of the world is gone and we don't need it.
Sometimes processes are accelerated, if you put money in. I'm going to smoke in my room. Special occasion. Damn it. If we stack that loop... to the scrambler we took from Hendricks... and tie it to the routine we were...
baby, stop, I don't think he means that sorry, baby, this ruffles my feathers look, Kyle, I know you try to patch things up with everyone but the truth is, Eric and I are out of it now we are out of it now we renounce social media and all the ugliness that goes with it, and we are in a better place humans, on Mars I am warning you, Skankhunt this video will rock your world could you call me Gerald? ! it is very dark news from the BBC in England hardly anyone has seen it here this is why we have to unite, Skank since the dawn of the internet the forums and chat rooms are full of people.
Sit down. I'll get the documents and my Montblanc. Psst! I found the woman who bought the disk, but she won't sell it. Apparently, she already gave it to her elderly father... and hired Geek Squad to install it this afternoon.
Did you tell them not to touch my Fage yogurt? That won't be a problem. Come and meet them. Ok gentlemen, who starts with the fragment loader? Gleb, why don't you do it with Sanjay?
I know who you are. You're that demon Bill. Sorry, Ba'al! You know that book can send you back, right? And you want to scramble my brain until I give it to you.
But you don't survive a bite. You don't think I was bitten? I don't believe in miracles. - Miracle is your word. - What would you call it?
Not until I know where the book is. - Come on, let him go. - First, release me. Impossible. He always carries it with him, so the book is here.
So what happened? You told me you were tired of pretending to be nice and asked me to leave. I'm an idiot, aren't I? Yes, but you're sincere, honest, you don't pretend to be nice and you don't beat around the bush. Your heart is sensitive, so you protect it. But sometimes you break down the wall and everything is unbelievable.
Yeah. Yeah, man, I was. I'm sorry, Travis. His neck was kind of broken, you know? Like he broke it coming through the glass.
Maybe I should take it with me. - I'll take it with me. No, you keep it. - Yes. - No, I'll carry it in my pocket.
Fooled again. Todd, they're calling. It's time. My phone! No, I kicked it out the door into the hallway.
Todd, they're calling. It's time. My phone! No, I kicked it out the door into the hallway. Now others kick it and it slides across the floor.
Hawaiian. We're having a luau. Yeah, they called me that in school and I got the nickname. Pakistani Denzel. I don't see it, but everyone else does.
I took Gavin's business off the table and at the same time closed the financing for our first strategic investment. We bought a blog! Great. How much does a blog cost? What? We practically stole it from him.
Big Head, are you broke? We're broke, man. Erlich, it's time. You have my number. I left it on your voicemail.
What? And I go on and on about my boring, exciting life. What about you? Well, I started with a project, The BoJack Horseman Show. - I don't know if you saw it...
The ratings aren't great, but for one of the episodes we're looking for a major guest artist. - I thought it would be a lot of fun for... both of us. Just like old times. I brought the script if you want to see it.
- I thought it would be a lot of fun for... both of us. Just like old times. I brought the script if you want to see it. Why don't you leave it in the pile?
We had a drink. Which hotel? Busybody. We have a suite at the Fairmont and they're sending a car. Richie deserves it.
You are very generous, Gilfoyle. There is no need for hateful speech. From the look of bitterness on your faces, I see that Richard told you about the misfortune that forced me... to give up my share of your worthy enterprise. Erlich, I want you to know that I have written a statement. I won't publish it yet, but if I hear that there are rumors rolling around... I'll send it to every... technology publication on the planet, you understand?
I'll take her to the bathroom. She drank so much she won't notice. See you, Richie. Hey, it's CJ. I heard a rumor about something ugly concerning Pied Piper. I've already heard it from three people.
"we did it!" 'cuerdan? - sure, 'cuz what do we do now? - no 'cuerdo Oh, 'cuerdo make sure the worm is in the woman's mouth got it?
Especially in case of due diligence or future reviews by certain regulatory agencies. I also had pictures of my aunt. Anyway, you haven't seen it? No. Richard, see if you can find it, will you?
Randy, you were the last person to see him alive and you didn't tell anyone. Tell me you have an explanation. Why would you even think that? Because Mateo told us. He made a video, we found it at his house, he put it all on there.
None of that matters, Rita. You know that. So a late disclosure, so there's no proof of rape. No, but the maid saw Abby's dress was stained. She showed it to Laura, her mom.
Well, we'll need to take statements from all three of you. We'll also need access to Abby's friends and her social networks. We know there's a dress. There is. Okay, we'll send it to the lab.
I should have made her talk to me. Okay, but when she found that dress, she asked him about it. That was nice. Well, my housekeeper, Pilar, found the dress in the trash on Tuesday. When Abby came home from school, I asked her why she threw it away.
"John Lennon's plans for the future". This record I have in my hands becomes a special object. Do you see it? And don't you know who its previous owner was? Didn't I tell you that I bought it in Porto Alegre in a used record store?
Yes. Except maybe your own patients. - Huh? - Oh. This in-between place... Some people call it purgatory where he goes to be cleansed,
That woman is my chance to get to the Oval. I can't convince Susan Ross to do something she has no intention of doing. I believe you can. I think you have certain gifts... Well, I only gave her a bracelet because you said you didn't want it, so you can't use it against me.
And if they don't have it, well, they just fall apart. Fitz had no fight in him. He didn't know how to stand on his own two feet. I mean, I saw the potential. We all saw it.
The publisher says it will take at least six weeks to hit the bookstores.... Who says we need bookstores? Several pages of the former first lady's forthcoming memoir appeared on Dish's website today. The publisher and Senator Grant herself denied being the source of the leak. The book, however, is described by those who have read it as explosive, revealing, and deeply personal.
He'll shoot. Who's to say, your intuition? SWAT has snipers posted. They're going to shoot that incompetent moron you recruited. They're going to take away our hero's heroic moment and give it to some idiot sniper.
And if you don't, you'll go back to the cell you came from and stay there. So what if I'm sleeping with the enemy by turning a blind eye to what my father is up to with Jake? I'm making a choice. It's a choice. I'm playing the game, and I'm playing it better than anyone else.
A dock with a wire covered by a snake print cover? Lisa, our weekend in Capital City will make us friends again. I don't see your saxophone. That must be a relief for you. Honey, I want you to take it.
- And you are? - Jay Leno. Hey, do you still have the money I gave you for the car? I sure do. Well, I need it back.
Yes. Here's your money. Can I have my car back? Unfortunately, when I went to search it, it wasn't your car. So the police took it.
You are alive. If you're wondering what you hear, it's me, Dr. Tobias M. Curtis, and I'm talking to you because the activity will help keep us both warm...me working my jaw and you working your brain. Come on. I know I've called you cold and unfeeling, but this is ridiculous. But your heart is still warm, and you'll stay well as long as we keep it warm.
We put the Sun Gun panels on it, send it out, and Rahal is now decades late if he wants to make new ones. Remember, he didn't build these, he found them. The Sun Gun could land anywhere. That's why I'm running the numbers to predict the exact time and place so the aerostat crashes in the Mediterranean. When the Navy Seals will pick it up in a waterproof bag.
Like a flying disc? Something like that. I'm not a sports guy, but you have to catch it. We can't let it break. We need it to free the legs from the mortar.
Focus on the main event, okay? Rebecca. Rebecca didn't ruin the day. She brought a party bus and she just wanted us all to have fun. Greg ruined it.
I'm proud to be your son. Something like that. We love you, Jerry. We support you always. I love your support and I need it.
You've done a good job. But I think you should both leave now. Are we to believe that Augustus Dove has something to do with the theft of the Japanese porcelain as well? Who carries the biggest club here? What do you want, little guy?
I haven't. I have a big game on Saturday. I have a big game on Saturday, is there any chance you'll let me pass on it this time? I'll give you one more day to turn it in. But you will deliver it to my inbox before the end of the day tomorrow.
Why are you doing this? Does the name Addison ring a bell? The investment broker. Billy owes Addison a lot of money. Addison's kid says Billy's got it in a locker at the golf club.
The last time I checked there was over $10,000! Billy cleaned it. I don't get it. If he was so afraid of Ed, why didn't he give him the money? Maybe he was giving it to someone else?
Yours and Billy's? Well, at least we'll be safe there. The police are patrolling the neighborhood. Billy bought you this car? We bought it together.
We're selling my car. Thank you. How much? Not enough. I still think Billy withdrew all the money and hid it somewhere.
Yes, but how were they when they talked to you? Concerned. They asked about that man, that's all. What about the car? We covered it up, they didn't see it.
The only way out is through the front door. Can't we leave it where it is, under the tarp? But what if the police come back? What if they take a look? I don't know, do we burn it?
Staple and sort them in order in a single pile. If you make typos or typing errors, destroy the sheets in the shredder. - Do you have a cell phone? - Yes. Do not bring it to work.
You had coffee on top. Was it very hot? It wasn't real coffee. I was kidding... it's okay. See, see? I almost swallowed it.
I don't think we should put all our eggs in one basket, so help the Captain. I'm going to discharge Detective Bell to command the Omar Velez case... Because the person who killed him is probably the same person who put a bomb in his gut. So, this is where Omar Velez's body was discovered. Apparently, the jogger who found him almost shot, was so close to the route.
Or what? Or I'm going to prove it was you. I read the report on Hector's assault. You were careful. There's no evidence hat did it.
Yeah, well, I wasn't paying for it. It always comes back to money. I was a single mother and a government employee. I didn't have unlimited resources. I saved since you were born to give my only child a college education, and you took that gift and threw it away.
The guy didn't have a coat on. He says, he gave it to his son, because he couldn't afford another one. Your dad takes off his own coat.... It was vicuna, I remember. And he just gave it to the guy.
Not since 1992. Yes, that's right. Come in. I reviewed the East Africa report again last night. There has been one change since we sent it to you for approval.
No kidding. Wudang also owns an American subsidiary called KPT Building. It's headquartered in Arizona. That's Stone's home state. The CIA has been all over this report since we started compiling it.
The map I was telling you about... of buried treasure, an underground nuclear missile silo, whatever you were thinking. I wasn't thinking anything. The map is for Dany. Remember Dany? A client of Dany's wants it.
That I'm a silly girl who went crazy for the first man who paid her a little attention. Quite the contrary, cousin. I think you are the most extraordinary woman I know. All I ask is that you stop, just for a second. Ignore your heart, because I have no doubt you've given it to him.
Why not now? Supergirl. What makes you so super? That symbol. I've seen it before.
What was it about? Winn was called in by the DEO. What? Which means we lost our best hacker while dealing with a live alien computer. And now it must be time for Hank to tell me what we're dealing with and how we caught it.
For decades, I searched the Phantom Zone with my mind. Looking for a way out. And then... I found you. I activated your module. I linked it to the prison.
- Yes, but you have to try a steak at least once in your life. - Yes, it's good. - Yes, it's very good. I cook very well. If you're going to eat it, this is the best way.
Do you think they will show up? I don't know. It doesn't really matter. Anyway, I'm doing my shaking. See Cat, I'm still 50-50 if your heart beats now, but I'll stop it anyway.
Turn off the engine! Come out with your hands up! This is a little over the top for skipping a class. What are you doing in Nick's car? I just borrowed it to go for a ride with Emma.
And what better way than to deprive the kingdom of funds when we need them most? Mother, is there any truth in this? I oppose Claudia's marriage to Narcisse's friend, the duke, absolutely, and the rest is amateur fiction. Amateur is the one you paid to commit the crime. They took the gold right after Boinel gave it to me.
I could help you with this. Martin, that's very kind, but I've already agreed to give the child - to a lovely family. - Don't you want it? Of course I do.
You should advise them not to get lost. We don't want a bloodbath. All I want is my gold. Well, your gold, actually. You've earned it.
It's not the same as being innocent. What kind of doubts? Doubts about Amy. Her strange behavior. Others saw it.
A glass full of the warm south? The blushing Hypocrene. You know your stuff. Knowledge is curious. More than one person has been known to have it.
But there are plenty of Wesens that have neurotoxic capabilities. What do you know about the victim? Someone removed his face. Excuse me? It was surgically removed.
Damn it. I'll do it. Let's set up camp here, people. Why are you so interested in that watch? A friend gave it to me.
God, will you stop that already! ! He just showed me the golf course. Yeah, and he bought you a putter at the store. For old white guys, this is like an engagement ring. He only bought it because I told him I always wanted to learn to play golf, which isn't even true.
- Maggie, I just... - I'm already on the hook with Blair. I don't need you to take any chances with this case. - You can't limit me now. - I just did. Let them handle it.
Witness Protection. - Burn it all, start a new life. - For... Come on, now! All right, everybody, calm down. Just get his cell phone before he sees it.
Ah, but he's hung up on the thing all day long, dammit! Everybody freeze! Oh, my God! I just remembered! He doesn't have his cell phone with him, he left it at home by accident, he's in Tae Kwan Do class.
No. Let me help you. What can I do? Come on, let's clean up this mess and tell me what happened. Leave it, I'll clean it up later.
You're just going to have to live with the uncertainty, Because I'm going to be sad and angry, and you're just going to have to live with it, Because I'm not going to quit this job, Not this time, Because I love it and I'm, like, really good at it,
Mr. Shaw is looking for a new foreman. I told him you're his man. It wouldn't be right, sir, with Jack not even on land. Somebody's got to keep this ship afloat. Would you rather I gave it to another man?
Forget about the missile. I'm telling you. Emori. You're making a mistake. The minds of everyone who has entered the City of Light are on that server. 30 seconds. If you destroy it, our minds will be gone forever.
I knew a vice detective... who came home late at night one day and found himself... found himself thinking that all the... all the women he saw were prostitutes. So the next day he put in for a transfer. Do you remember him? It didn't happen overnight. I thought about it for weeks.
Do you remember him? It didn't happen overnight. I thought about it for weeks. You stopped in time and corrected yourself. Tim didn't, so I did it for him.
Don't worry. I saw them before it broke. We have to go to a place called Red Fox. Yeah. Do you know where it is? I'm sure we'll find it.
I called my agent. They will decide between me and another actor. I called Frankie, no answer. But I got another map, and you're not touching it. If I touch it, I'll treat it like a baby.
"The candlesticks melt, but they remain united, "and when they cool, they remain embraced forever. "Nothing can separate this new double candlestick. "Unless it falls back into the volcano, or into a geyser." Or if it is dropped from a great height, then it breaks, then....
Wow, that's a nice watch. It looks nice. Oh, this? It's something I borrowed. I borrowed it.
I didn't have the courage to sit... at my father's desk since he left. I still feel like the little girl... who used to play hide-and-seek under it. Look at this. This is your desk now. You've earned it.
I feel good. As a friend, I need you to take care of yourself. But as your co-worker, I'll help you solve this case. Check this out. I found it in the victim's pocket.
- I have to find out where he is. I'm going to call Martin. It's Ayda. Yes? Turn off the engine. How did you get it?
- Risto? - Yes. - I found the equipment. - I knew you'd fix it. - When you let Adrian go, you'll get it.
Amy, don't yell in front of the children. I'll get it. Don't make me call your parents. - Don't you pick up the phone? - My family hid it.
- An outbreak? - Yes. Another dozen infected. We lost two officers this morning. But the rest are isolated, so we've got it under control.
Those Hyenas have set fire to six of our labs. We've got nothing. It's him. How did you get this? We left him a phone, so he'd know who's been screwing with him. Did he use it?
We have nothing. It's him. How did you get this? We left him a phone, so he'd know who's been screwing him. Did he use it? No, but he kept it.
It's him. How did you get this? We left him a phone, so he'd know who's been screwing him. Did he use it? No, but he kept it. He didn't know we bugged him.
Against what? The future. The project is huge. It is. That's why we call it "Titan".
The report mentions a place called Titan and a man called the Witness. - That's it. - We go back to 1961, find Kirschner before Mossad does, find Titan, find the Witness and rip the head off the snake. That's not going to stop the storms outside. We will save the world by killing the man who destroys it.
Just speak from the heart, and say what's on your mind. I want everyone to see what I have seen. I want them to see that the Powers That Be are important, and that you are going to take their role. You are making the world a better place, a safer place, just like Janice and Harley did. I could give the speech myself, I usually do, but I'm giving it to you.
What? Did you catch Retro Girl's killer? FBI's got him. Where's your uniform? I didn't wear it.
! Go ahead, accept it. This bastard... Is something wrong? Don't you want it?
Go ahead, accept it. This son of a bitch... Something wrong? Don't you want it? W-Well, I guess I'll keep it.
She's not my friend or anything. What? Hey, let's make a deal. My treasure is hidden in an area to the east. I'll give it to you in exchange for my life.
Of course. But lately I've been remembering all the little things about her that bothered me. like what? Like her general appearance and personality. Well, have you thought about going out again? No, and I'm pretty lonely too. Sometimes I make a drink and drink it in front of my three-way mirror just to feel like I'm at a party.
Do you know who doesn't bury words? The Chinese. I know there are many things I can't do. I can't read two books at the same time. I can't put on a winter coat unless I spread it out on the floor first.
Some newbie put up a poster of a missing sock. what? ! It's so pathetic. Did they find it?
I'm going to assume it's nothing bad. Why didn't your mother sign it? I haven't seen her this morning. It's a trip back east to look at colleges. The school's organizing it.
And how many years will that mean for us? It's my fault Linda is in this situation. We can't let her die. We're going to sabotage that rocket. We have to divert it off course without alerting anyone at NASA.
Well, the launch pad is a mile away. Better get those security cameras on loop for when it's in position. Oh, well, good. I forgot to cancel my second follow-up message. You want to read it to me?
I love you too. Talk to you later. Cabe, go ahead. Merrick has the detonator. He demands you come here, or he's going to use it.
Crazy weird. But be cool with it, because it's... cool. Well, then, shall we help you clean up the pegoste in the morning? Actually, no. I was going to make paper mache figures out of the ballistic gel and then dry them in an oven, because the gel changes color when you heat it to 93 degrees Celsius.
Look. Facial paralysis. That's... that's a classic symptom of a stroke, right? Yeah, it could be a stroke. If it's a clot, TPA would dissolve it right away.
- Parents say they don't know. Please help him. Please help him. He was given CPR in the field. We had a weak pulse, but we lost him.
- Good. Take care. How's it going? So, did you get the job? If I wanted it. Is it going to be a problem for us if I take it?
The pond? Why? It's just a pond. It's much more than that. As evidenced by the fact that I've painted it over and over again, more than 20 times.
And while you're gone, the pastor and his wife will have an accident. Hey, Paige. Guess what? - We're going to Epcot. - We're going to Epcot. What? She'll think about it and find out.
Mr. Travis? - Clay Travis. - Mr. Travis. I run a brothel... But I run it according to the law.
I know this is very sudden. But this feeling was so sudden. That day when you left with your date, I didn't like it at all. And when you had this makeover. I was hoping that you had done it for me.
I went to sleep at 2:00 and then at 3:00, we woke up because the tacos hurt us. Did I win this game? Mimi, you look so overwhelmed. Can you make it to my charity event tomorrow? I wouldn't miss it.
Lyme disease? Yes, it's probably from a tick bite on one of his field trips. It explains the knee and the rest of your symptoms. What happens now? I'm going to put you on a course of antibiotics, and hopefully we got it early enough to avoid long-term consequences.
- It's the property of the show. - Well, you know the saying... "The property of the show is your property." That's not a saying. Well, I look good in it, so I stole it.
You don't even touch me. And I find Beth's uniform on top of that? So tell me, okay? What do you do with it? You sniff it, hug it, put it on a rack and dance with it?
I can do that, sir. Well. Now, I guess they were doing it to get my support. Well... You got it.
I miss you, honey. Take care of my Leonard. Yes, ma'am. When we were children, we had to learn this sacred chant by heart and understand its meaning. By the time the weekend is over, I hope you all know it too.
The napkins. Tell me, Nicky, how's the music world working out for you? Not too bad, but I'd do a lot better if I had a partner. My nephew warned me. Don't even think about it.
In 1949 he founded a construction company. And then, just three days ago, at the age of 100, he passes away. So Musaka kills his partner in cold blood. Then he stays here to live under the radar for 75 years. And now, after all this time, he dies, and somebody goes straight to the secret bunker and cleans it up.
They came to power and continue to rule with an iron fist. It was not a world I wanted to live in. So I vowed to do something about it, not just for myself and the people of Wayward Pines, but for all of humanity... those who are awake and those heroes who are still sleeping, dreaming of a future for humanity in our struggle for survival. I was wondering if I could borrow your bikini since you don't wear one, and.... I'm going swimming again tonight.
Basically, yes, but it feels good. It makes me happy. It makes sense. I... I... I... I don't want you to fix it.
A few hours ago they didn't even know each other. Really? Yeah, you wouldn't know it to look at them. Collective trauma. I saw it in the Navy.
Damn it! Are you all right, honey? Yeah. You got the check? I got it right here.
Every night with those damn radios. - I can't even think. - Close the window. It's going to be too hot with the radiator. On top of that you can't complain, you know, or yell at them to turn it down.
Thank you. The dog will love it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's not a dog toy. Well, I'm not gonna chew it. But who's gonna chew it?
You look terrible. Sir galavant, it's me, the chef. Oh, thank God. Why do you have Isabella's amulet? She never takes it off.
Yes, I can sign the contract right now. I am in a foreign country but I can do it with my phone via internet banking. Yes. Then I will send it in an hour and send you a text message.
- See you later, honey. - Okay, see you later. - What's wrong now? - I lost the ring. I clearly put it in my pocket before the surgery.
"When you die in a nameless land for the sake of your country".... "the place of your death becomes your grave"... "and your uniform becomes your veil." "That should be your mentality every time you wear your uniform".... "If you put it on with that mentality"....
You should talk face to face, Captain. Look who's talking. It's always hand-to-hand combat for me. What's this for? Who are you going to throw it at?
Give it to me. Come and get it. Don't do anything you'll regret. Don't you think you're capable? I said you'd regret it.
For some reason, it seems like I should be feeling excited right now, but I'm fine. I like the current Sergeant First Class Seo Dae Young. The Seo Dae Young that I know, wearing the uniform or not. He is just one. Unless I take it off, no one touches that uniform.
Oh, you can't. I couldn't wash my hair today. Why not? Didn't I have enough water? Normally you don't even wash it, so why are you pretending you do?
Oh! Oh? Oh. Why is the car like that? Why don't you know? You hit it a lot.
And I think they managed to understand our strategy as well. The situation we are worried about has just started after all. Lieutenant Yoon! The vehicle that brought the medicine and vaccines was stolen from what I heard. The medicine to treat Lieutenant Captain Yoon was there too. Whoever stole it, we should definitely catch that bastard.
- So... - You said my present is on its way. Can I open the present now? Keep it safely with you. You know I have to buy another one if you lose it, right?
If you want my advice, you should take advantage of this disturbance, give up sleep, and find an activity that tests your abilities. Escape elaborate restraints, for example. If that doesn't bother you, then why did you choose an activity that included noise-canceling headphones? I didn't say I was immune to noise, I simply said I was using it as a boost.
I don't know anymore. Do you want me to talk? I was in love. He died. I heard he left me a message that he loved me, but I don't understand it.
Who else wants a souvenir of this delirium? Are you going to finish this? They didn't allocate budget for food staff. It's our fault we're poor. When we had money... we spent it on drunken sailors.
I have... - Yeah. - I'm starving. Oh, this birdie is to die for. And when you mix it... with the potatoes... and the beans...
but not from the house as Keith the house doesn't exist and you didn't have to worry about leading anyone to it. I never worried about fooling the police or the FBI. Just Richard and Nancy. I had this whole script ready the things I would say or do in case I thought they were suspicious. I just...never needed to.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! My teeth. How much have you got? As much as I could make. When are you gonna tell me how you get it? If I told you, the whole world would know.
It usually takes years to become a life-threatening risk. It never happens that fast. Is there a chance it could be contagious? I hope not, because then a lot of people would be scared. Listen... if I hadn't seen the body with my eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.
It appears that hyper-accelerated aging is not so rare. According to this research, "Medical Abnormalities Associated with Extreme Aging," there have been about six cases in Portland and the surrounding area in the last three years. They call it a cluster of the disease.
I made it the day I realized I was going to be queen. When was that? I was 13 years old. I was in a history class with Lehzen. She showed me the family tree and I looked at it for a long time.
It will probably go away. Unless, of course, your ex-husband is not in the mood. I tried to tell you. Listen, the case survives tomorrow, and it shouldn't, but if it does, my orders going forward aren't going to be to argue the case. They're going to be to tear the man who's carrying it apart.
This is who I am. You haven't always been. Yes, I was. Even when I was a coward, I craved power. The only difference is that now I have it.
Yes, please. Hey, will you promise me something? - Of course I will. - No secrets. Okay? If you have any problems, come to me and we'll work it out together.
We're good, right? Uh, one of my guys found the car abandoned this morning. Abandoned? Well, you know, unlocked. So he brought it here.
Ah chi You let yourself get stabbed because you like me, don't you? All I know is that 2 silver taels are important to you. You like my body? You've earned it with your life.
Push and turn. Circular bar. These are the most basic killing moves. His style of 13 swords Can only kill me if I make a mistake in my 7th move. A swordsman who knows his mistake but repeats it deserves to die.
Ok. I'll bite you like a bean! Stop it, stop it! Oh, God. Oh, God. You guys don't stop this, I'll lock the baby upstairs, and none of you will ever see him again.
Why are you acting like this? You are about to become a grandmother. Isn't that something even you can enjoy? For how long? Once you take the baby to that house, I'll never see it again.
that son of a bitch walked seven miles. that's not a credible number for you, my friend. you think i don't know that? No, that's why I have to roll back the meter before Molly sees it.
Why? Oh, I just go into the app and ration the button and it will find the counter. No, don't do that. Why not? Well, because, I mean, maybe whoever finds it needs it more than I do.
rule number one: never hit "thick" on your phone. you walked seven miles? Mike, that's amazing. How did you make time to walk that far? You know, now that I think about it, this could have happened when I passed it to Samuel for a couple of minutes.
And I saw on the internet that between... received approval for the audiobook... and the time of her death, Grace... replaced her name with a pseudonym. Maybe her husband wasn't as happy with the book as she told us. Let's go visit him. - She took her name off the book? - Grace never mentioned it?
Come on, man... You're saying the rich tech guru... didn't pay to implant a microchip? - The tracker's not in the dog? - You're holding it. We're near the park where our tech guru disappeared. It's likely the kidnapper dumped him.
The publisher sent the PDF. "The little idiot had no idea I put hemlock in her salad." "She sat, her molars crushing the leaves...giving them the shape of her destiny." "The shape of his destiny? She wants me to send it to my editor, but I can't do that to Lerna.
You sent that e-mail. Your nurse, Todd, confirmed that you had a flower pot in your window. A week before Grace's death... he ordered you to throw it in the trash. You didn't. You gave it to another one of your patients.
Your nurse, Todd, confirmed that you had a flower pot in your window. A week before Grace's death...he ordered you to throw it away. You didn't. You gave it to one of your other patients. Now we have it.
Hey. Liv. What's up? Clive didn't tell you? - About my lottery ticket? - That's the first I've heard of it.
Balls. So the prediction for me is.... The McDermotts, together in life, until their tragic accident on Route 520, will be united for all eternity in their custom double casket. I bet they were that kind of couple who would finish each other's sentences. Who would order dessert and share it with one fork.
If I loved you, would I have asked you to do this? Our forensics are examining the apartment. All they need is a trace of DNA. A hair, a skin sample, a drop of sweat. And when we find it, your chance of a deal is out of the question.
Liv, sometimes closing is a bad thing. It didn't work out too well for poor Cassidy. Nick is our guy. His ankle monitor puts him at the time and place of the murder. We'll use it to track him down and stop him.
-Well. -Why do you have to make everything emotional? -I have a body, okay? I have a body, okay? Can't you think of me as a sex object? Fine. Whatever. You want to back up that booty, back it up.
I do. - "Almost any..." - Wait. If Bailey was making a big purchase from Steve, and he pats him down ... - He discovers the wire... - uses it to strangle her.
Oh, I've got news for you, Steve. The money Bailey went to use to buy her lucky T, the money she stole from her after you killed her, those were marked bills. Guess what's going to happen to you when you find that money? Save me some time. tell me where you got it.
It was self-defense That kept so much of our lives Maybe they don't denounce it And we, uh We, have smuggled the body out, and dumped it in the bay
It looks like a fucking IKEA schematic for building a piece of furniture. I gave you some estimates. Use the original. Borns Tech has it. We haven't found it in the docs yet,
Is this where happy hour starts soon? A big find in the tunnel collapse. A belt? How do you get a belt into the tunnel? We're guessing someone threw it out after using it in a murder.
On U.S. citizens. And that crossed a line. Larry and I decided that the potential for abuse was too great. So we mutually agreed not to tell the NSA about our daemon. You developed it at the NSA, so it's considered classified defense material.
ISI activates your network, coding in the application. See, that's the weird part. Eric scanned this afternoon's application, and couldn't find the daemon anywhere. That's because it wasn't in the application this afternoon. It wasn't even in the code Callen showed, but I was able to dig deeper, and I found it.
Or maybe you dumped Overson's Portable at the marina. And maybe the Coast Guard fished it out a couple of hours ago. And maybe Overson waterproofed his hard drive. Because he did use it on a boat after all.
Good news. You are an asteroid. Please tell me what I should say. Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid and I named it after you.
Don't fire Callahan. Kill him. I'm not gonna kill the son of a bitch just because you say so. We got your product too, pal. I'll require them to sell it in your nightclubs.
Supposedly at Joshua Tree campground spending the weekend with friends. - Joshua Tree? - Yeah. Have they checked to see if he's actually there? That's where his cell phone puts him when you track him down and the agents assumed, from his record, that Amanda's probably with him.
And it would be great to be able to access her phone. She just turned 16. Maybe her parents have her password. It's 9566. We check his cell phone regularly because we pay for it and because that horrible kid once sent him a message that....
Yeah, yeah, we had a fight, and she was mad that I was going to Joshua Tree instead of her anniversary party. Didn't you just say you only lie to your parents? You didn't go to Joshua Tree. Your phone went to Joshua Tree. You gave it to a friend and fled to Mexico, which is where criminals who want to hide go.
We ended up moving to another house. We started from scratch. And you hid your basement door in your own house because...? The basement wasn't up to code. We didn't have the money to fix it, so we locked it up as well as we could and eventually rented the house.
No. And, by the way, we've made a decision. Oh, that was fast. You have until nine o'clock. We don't need it.
Is there anything we can do to this being to change it a little bit, to get it to do something else? We are not scientists. We are experimenters. My implant is a microchip in my left hand, which is about the size of a grain of rice. I use it to access the office.
Sure, there's danger in upgrading Sometimes you get ahead of yourself before you're ready. However, if you don't change, you're going to die. I am pleased to see so many volunteers wanting to try this new technology. The RFID chip is supposed to have a lifespan of over 120 years, so it will definitely live much longer than you will if you keep it in.
I'm sorry about that. Hi. Yes. I was a little surprised that it was so quick to accept the chip as part of me. I still get this "Wow" feeling every time I scan it and it actually works.
The device is doing it for you. I don't care, and I don't have a family. It's my heart. I want it out. That's not possible, Because if we take it out, it will die.
The child is allergic to Keflex. H-he's fine. D-he couldn't... he went into anaphylactic shock? No, luckily, they caught it in time.
It made me think of Landigal. When we went into the mud shelter with the kid. I don't want to talk about that day, man. Yeah. I just brought it up because it reminded me of...
He is an expert in the field of transgenesis. With transgenesis... we take a gene built in a laboratory... and introduce it into the genome of the animal. You'll see that the snout has a yellow tint. Piggy, piggy! So they took the fluorescent gene... which is naturally present in jellyfish... and used it in these pigs with a marker... to find out which one is transgenic.
Four. Looking for eggs. Sixteen eggs. You did great! We take a sperm... and inject it into the nucleus of the egg.
As time went on, the more I got into this, I began to find more people who had been involved in some part of this or had witnessed some part of it. And that meant talking to the Americans, talking to the Israelis, talking to the Europeans, because this was obviously the first, the biggest, and the most sophisticated example of a state or two states using a cyber weapon for offensive purposes. I came to this with a little bit of history, understanding the Iranian nuclear program. How would Iran get its first nuclear reactor? We gave it to them?
"Mike, I don't want any president to be faced with only two choices, bomb or be bombed" OK? He -- he wanted options that -- that made it -- much less likely that he or his successor or successors would ever get to that point where that's -- that's all you've got. We wanted to be forceful enough in pursuing this problem that would make the Israelis certainly believe, "Yes, we got it."
He came, but he's back. - It's hard to keep track of him, isn't it? - Yes. It's all very clear. We implant an egg in a viable body, fertilize it and a baby comes out.
Now I have something to talk about in the meeting with Condé Nast, and she's talked about publishing excerpts in Vanity Fair, which would be amazing. It's not my favorite thing to do, but for now it's okay. And then, the money. It's not bad at all. Now I have to spend more time with her to design the first chapters so I can present it and see who wants it.
- Your dress? Don't make fun. I'm not making fun. It's beautiful. You wore it when I saw you in Hamburg.
- What do you think that means? - Hey, Luke. My mom took my advice. You know what I mean? The advice I gave her, she took it.
Liz Taylor rises from the grave and is confused. Claudia has even called him "your boy," like at a beach party. We've been together steadily for nine years. Luke hardly ever comes over for dinner. I didn't have his number until I asked Rory for it.
The one that's been after you for so long? Begging you to work for them? - BrendaBlabs? - SandeeSays. Get over there. - Have you seen it?
I'll do it! - Hello. - I have to see the permit. One moment, please. I thought I had it in my pocket.
I waited for him to yell at me, to punish me forever, to tell me how disappointed he was. But nothing of the sort happened. I finally mustered up enough courage to look at him, and there he was, standing there with a pretzel. A giant pretzel covered in mustard. He handed it to me and said, "Come on."
So you need money. - Yeah. I'll get the checkbook. But, Mom, I want to use the money from Luke's branch. He doesn't want it.
But, Mom, I want to use the money from Luke's branch. He doesn't want it. It's simply not for him. He wants his empire to be small. I know Dad left it to him and I want to honor his memory, but maybe I might as well honor it that way.
- No, don't worry. Rory is with her. She looks very grown up, but she's still a child. She wants Rory to take her nose ring off. I'll take it off.
- Is it an actor? - No, the computer operating system. I know it from Halt and Catch Fire, and I didn't follow the show. I have the instructions Mr. Roundbottom gave me. "Turn on the computer." You turned it on?
It goes on. You're like me in pants And you're like me in a dress It fits me a little wrong I've tried it on, I confess
I asked him. He thinks we can imply there was someone else there. Well, it'll keep the jury busy. Looks like they want to go after the killer. The question is whether Cuesta will allow it.
- What is it? - It's a cigar, Florence. Like Tosh used to smoke. Tell us, Mr. Farrell... why did you clean the floor of your ship? It was dirty, so I cleaned it.
The knife, too? - Tosh's phone? - It must have been in his pocket. So what did you do? I brought the boat back to port, cleaned it.
Not too hard to get. He was already drunk, as he was most days at the time. So a few more shots of liquor would push him over the edge. And once he was unconscious, I assume you went and found his dive knife...and planted it somewhere where you could easily retrieve it...when you needed it later.
Because that wasn't the last time Sam saw Tosh, was it? Because on his way to the bar, Sam took a little detour to Newton's boat. Didn't you, Sam? You followed your dad along the dock... and then to Newton's boat. And once there, with Newton out of the way, you took Newton's knife... and used it to kill your father.
I mean, not rubbing it in or anything, but my CV is basically bombproof. While mine'll look like a poster for a lost dog. Just take the bench job, then, JP! The suit is clearly your destiny. I can't wear the suit because I sashimi-ed the suit. If I put it on it would look like I was in an explosion in a cartoon.
It's not too hard to believe. I'm still trying to come to terms with the fact that you like me. Come on, Ben. You've got a charm button. I've never seen it off.
Tell her I know what it's like to sit in that room, waiting to find out if everything is okay. Explain that the procedure is called.... Heterotopic transplant. Deana's heart will remain inside her. We will take Thomas' heart and attach it to the top of Deana's, with a tab.
That's what you get for being better at school. When you're done with the dishes, mop the floor, Paige. That'll probably be Stan. Tell him there are no leftovers. Henry, if you haven't picked up your plate in the morning, you'll be using it for breakfast!
I'm so sorry. Let's go. What did I miss? An owl. Have you seen it?
I offer to lead an army against them in battle. Benedict. How exactly did you know where to find his answer? Hidden in the binding. I checked the book twice before you arrived and you found it right away.
I can do that hairstyle from memory. Your new orders. Details of duties as garrison commander. Commander? New York may appoint a new man but since you held the position when I was a prisoner I imagine they will allow you to keep it.
Oh, didn't I tell you? I have good news. I sent the $800 to Erin, my love, in the mail. You're kidding, right? You took our money that we've been saving all year and gave it to your girlfriend?
What have you done? Nothing. You guys... I think I'm doing that. The phone is telling the door to come down and when I put it in the Faraday bag, the signal is blocked and the barriers go up.
Can we trace these components back to the person who made them? There are no fingerprints, biologicals or forensic trace of any kind. Whoever assembled this hardware was very careful. I've made an image of every component. I'm sending it to the lab now.
- Yes, I'm with Raven. Jake contacted a lot of people about the breach. Check out this hacker forum. That's how you start. You do your first big hack, you start bragging about it and no one believes you actually did it.
I'm so sorry. Go away. Call 911! Are you Wizard? - Yes. - Do you have the hard drive? Achilles has it.
On screen one, that's Jake in the Internet cafe at 3:04 p.m. Can we zoom in to see who he's writing to? No, I've tried, but the image is pixelated. My guess is that it's the fake Wizard, Echo. We tried calling his phone, but we could see from the images that he has it in airplane mode.
Hang in there. You'll be fine. Chicago PD S03E18 "Kasual Whit a K" What can you tell me about Jess? How long has she been here? She runs it.
Big, huge, definitely a guy. Okay, does he have hair color, eye color? I told you the lights were off. All right, show me the profile. Ella, he's already deleted it.
Oh... available throughout the city. What about the fuse? One of those old Zippo lighters. I wonder if it's really covered by that lifetime warranty. So the suspect put diesel all over Kayla's office, lights it and hopes she gets caught in the explosion when the gas line ignites?
Fraud. The last few weeks. Small amounts at first, a few thousand here and there and then, yesterday, after Captain Grant was killed, the account was completely wiped clean. A million dollars. You think Tyson Reed stole it?
I know what they are, I wrote half of them. You and Captain Grant were having an affair. Not technically. What does that mean? It means we never acted on it, we just talked about it.
- Thane! - At least the weather is nice. Nice day for a walk. - I shouldn't have touched it. - Nonsense, you were great, dear, we made it.
- Teela, I'm sorry for what I did. - Don't be. Yours is the harder road and the darker, And it will grow darker still before the end. - Thane, have a nice day.' You deserve it.
You know, self-surveillance is really the only way to do it My kids don't have a smart phone. He has an old style cell phone with a flip cover. I'm not ready for them to have things where they can maintain complete privacy yet. It's like walking a tightrope on how to give them enough freedom so that they know how to use it while, at the same time, ensuring that they're using it responsibly.
Modification after modification, I was able to do more and more. All the technologies I use help me regain control over my environment. I found an electric wheelchair that I liked. A medical equipment vendor outfitted it with a brain matrix so I could drive with my head. I also have a device that I control with brain waves that allows me to sip a single malt scotch without the need for a caregiver to give it to me in my mouth.
You have a new girlfriend. Why is this a problem? Because it's your fourth night of marathon activity in the last week. It's a distraction. Silence is indispensable to my process. How do you hear it?
And you and I can be sure that there is always someone who will be here to let us in when things finally go sideways. Exactly. This was a NORAD communications center back in the '80s. Guaranteed nuclear survivability. You proved it, didn't you?
Excluded. But not "discriminated against" " Ahem Who here has the law degree I hope it was rhetorical Uh, actually, I have it here.
Jennings, I... I'm lost. And we didn't get out of there alive. I was just doing my job. You do it very well.
Listen... the mistake was Tom's. He was supposed to take the bus with Lila, and I guess... I guess he got confused, and now he feels guilty. Oh, damn it. He's got the transportation schedule printed out, but... I don't know, he read it wrong, I guess.
I'm Groot! Hey! Give me that back! I've always wanted to get my hands on this artifact. You're not the person I expected to have it, though.
Couldn't you wait five minutes? Hey, you told us yourself to go dig around. Tell him what you found out about Spartax's spy network, Drax. Ronan is performing a Kree purification ritual in an ancient temple. Ronan only does it once every celestial cycle.
It is not necessary. Jameson has been warned. I'd like to see how he does. Thank you, Major. General Arnold has everything under control.
I'm either at home or having the best hallucination ever. No one? # For all I know, maybe, maybe I've been... # I smell the coriander. Legos call it curry.
Of the fucking rebellion, Jonathan. The bloody... Benedict Arnold has tried to bring three thousand Yankees, but instead he's come with two boatmen. He's a rat who didn't get the cheese. The ship must be about to sink if the rats abandon it.
But I am not going to apologize for the punishment Lieutenant Gamble received in return. Gamble was well aware of the risks of our particular affairs. I suppose Sackett knew them too. I must say I was rather impressed with the scheme he hatched up with Sutherland and Shanks. A masterstroke, I would have called it.
Yes, good footwear is essential. This place has 25 hectares and we walk it 3 times a night.
I want you to check her background. - How romantic. - You can't trust anyone anymore! I don't want to fall in love and end up a serial killer. - Okay, I'll look into it.
Someone put a GPS in the watch battery. Do you think it was the CIA... when I was on my mission in Thailand? - It's possible. We may never know. - Can we find out where they bought it? No. It's a very common transmitter, which makes it hard to track.
I guess you heard about Austin Elektra's house. - You said you'd let me know. - We can explain... Austin had a knife that matches the murder weapon. The lab tested it... it's clean.
To follow you, I asked a friend of mine for a GPS. - And I put it in... - My watch. - It was you. - Yeah, but you left it at the restaurant.
He gave me away, didn't he? He knew I shouldn't associate with a screenwriter. No, Trevor. You ratted yourself out. When you were shooting Heat Wave... I helped you with that terrible script you commissioned. You sent it back to me with notes about my stupid ideas.
Yes, I've been helping him for a year. - Abe! - Since the murder of Captain Joyce. Oh, yes, I heard about that during my unfortunate captivity. They said the drummer did it.
- Abe! - Since the murder of Captain Joyce. Oh, yes, I heard about that during my unfortunate captivity. They said the drummer did it. No, Rogers said the drummer did it.
I'm ready, John. It takes a long time to get the perfect hairstyle. Did I do it right? You've spent a lot of money having this dress made. Are you sure you want me to take it off?
Helium or nitrogen can be used. I feel a cold. If you put the bag down and tighten it, you will die in 5 minutes. A plastic bag is not aesthetically pleasing, but if you find no other way to die and desperately want to die, it works like any other. Thousands of people have used it.
Thank you. I'm telling you. We need to take a look at section AB-33, okay? The message is confusing. I wrote it and I don't know what it says.
I never thought she would do such a thing to me Her house is locked and she's missing Even her phone is off She's a prostitute it won't be easy to catch her Will she ask for some of the money or will she ask for all of it?
Sir, the call was made from a prepaid number The SIM card was issued on this ID First year student, Holy Cross College Listen to me, I have to pay the hostel rent next week Please tell my brother to pay for it
Why? What happened? Nothing I was just asking. I'll tell you if I find it, okay?
Manik, why are they so naive Lock the door from the inside, it's a grandfather's technique The computer hard drive is gone Your phone is also gone There was a charger in the room, did you see it?
"This cell phone is no longer operational." Well, maybe you have a new number. Yes, or you may have forgotten to pay the bill. Or that you couldn't afford to pay. Or that you didn't bother to tell us you changed it.
It belongs to Emma's mother. She wore it to the hospital. Yeah, you're right. I would never have worn something like that. - Can I keep it?
That was the plan after all. Admit it. Art. the only liberal in the world with reticence, all theatrics. I know what your coat is, Virginia. You wear it to the office every day.
We appeal, again and again and again if necessary, each time to a higher instance. Which might actually be preferable to an outright victory. A long, drawn-out case? How is that preferable? We present it on a national scale.
- It was not a sacrifice. - Bill... It wasn't. I didn't do it for you or Libby or anyone else. I did it for me.
Excuse me, gentlemen, you seem to be playing the most entertaining card game and of course - one that I would love to get into. - It's called "Texas Hold'em." The rules have changed a lot since your time. - I can imagine, but I'll learn.
No way! This is Earp territory, - our territory! - But we can't keep the reborn away until we find the talisman.... I know, because I'm the one who buried it.
We are talking about a woman's body. She has the right to choose what to do with it. Yes, and inside that body, there is the baby's body, and that is the body we are talking about. - But it's inside the woman. - She didn't even put it inside.
Please. - Let go of me. - No. I will not... allow you to destroy yourself, nor will I allow you to be destroyed. Time will show us the way if you will only allow it.
What if it cuts off his whole foot? Han needs all the height he can get. Weren't you saying something about a money cushion? We can't use the cushion. We need it for the dessert bar, in case we have trouble getting started.
Let's talk a little bit about fire. That's how we learned it. Burn the field to create a burned area and hunt there after the fire. We hunt animals from the field. It's very important to tell stories around the campfire because that reminds us that there are many stories about fire and how it was used and stolen by our ancestral heroes, improving the land and the tribe.
It is enough to go out and be there, in the... In her homeland. Like Kumpaya, who looks frail, but when she goes out hunting in the field, it makes her feel better. This watch lizard is full of poop! When preparing the animal for cooking, we throw it over the fire, burn the hide, and then bury it in a hole by the fire and cover it with charcoal.
It tastes strange, but roasted, it has a smoky smell. When you take it out of the fire, it tastes good. Put more wood on the fire. Behind every electrical outlet, even behind a microwave, somewhere there's a fire burning, probably with fossil fuels, but it's out of sight. Here we see it.
And he said, "Did you cook this pig?". And I said... I was afraid to say yes, because that was none of my business, but I said yes. And he said, "Come here." I thought he was going to challenge me, but he grabbed the jug of schnapps, poured some in a glass and gave it to me.
It can be a chef's recipe. You can create anything with fresh raw material. We have Maggi chicken tikka. First we capture the flavor here. We take the skewer, make a skewer, and then we put it inside.
The countries that now make up the region, from Egypt to Iraq, do not grow enough wheat to feed their growing populations. So they must import from places that overproduce, such as Russia, Ukraine, Australia and the European Union. This imbalance creates a complex global wheat economy, where countries like Morocco depend on crops harvested thousands of miles away. We receive 300 metric tons of grain per day and produce 240 tons of flour. When we receive the grain, we wash it, mill it, sift it and produce different types of flour to sell.
In a big, rustic loaf like this one... It's harder to squish it, but it's still air, mostly. And if you look inside, there are bubbles everywhere. When you eat bread, you mainly eat air. Bread is a fascinating combination of cooking, biology and physics. Biology is present because bread has life before we bake it.
I prefer to take them in one at a time. I'll show you why. They come out better if you hold them back just a little bit. I entered the trade with one question: "What is bread? What is worth making bread for?
Hey, man, what's up? You're looking good. Death suits you. Did the scarf come with the promotion? I got it with the raise.
He is a co-worker? He is an employee. - Why is he an employee? - I noticed his tattoo. I recognize him from Texas.
That would make me very happy. One more thing. Yes, Mrs. Park? This ring belonged to my mother-in-law. I've saved it for Joon's future wife.
It's ok. Boop. This might be a stupid question, but can we chew the gum? No, honey, I-I think we're gonna try the peanut butter next. I ate it all.
They made you out to be a hero. What do you think I don't know? That you're one of us. Like it or not, you're a Grimm and you understand how things work. The Kehrseite have ruled the world for too long, and they've ruined it.
All the emails you wrote, all the messages you sent, all your contacts. I wouldn't use that phone if I were you. I knew something was wrong. That's why the phone was in my left pocket. I usually put it in my right.
And what about those who did not believe? Where is your ring? - What is it? - Your wedding ring. I never got it.
By planting them the first time. Because nothing was growing in Wayward Pines. Why is that, Kerry? What's wrong with the soil here? Why didn't Pilcher take that into account?
Sorry, you made it sound like the "abbies" had a plan. They created the fires in the corners, so it would spread faster. The abbies have never used fire as a weapon before. Not in all the years we've been here. Until we used it against them to harvest the crops.
Don't worry. It's not from any of them. This may be Idaho, but we're not that twisted. Well, don't live in the past, Kerry. Let's not even discuss it.
Maybe you'll have one. Maybe even... a different one. Yeah, or maybe you'll never get out of Idaho at all. The past. You carry it with you wherever you go, no matter what you do.
Pilcher told me! Jason, what's going on? I'm your partner in everything! Talk to me! The past. You carry it with you wherever you go.
Mr. Welch's stitches, are they holding up? They should be fine. I just wanted to say, sir, what you did in there with Jason... The pericardial tamponade. You didn't drain him first.
They should be fine. I just wanted to say, sir, what you did in there with Jason... The pericardial tamponade. You didn't drain it first. You didn't drain him at all.
I'll see you in the mountains. I noticed something interesting when I was doing the paperwork. Jason's blood type is AB negative. It's very rare...something like less than one percent of the population has it. There were only four people awake in Wayward Pines who have it.
You have good taste, miss. James Baldwin. - Thank you. Thank you. - No. Then I'll buy it from you. How much is it?
- That's right. - And full of wisdom. And I can't help but think they must have lived through hell. Doing what they do and the way they look. You get the baton from your predecessors and you carry it as far as you can.
- And full of wisdom. And I can't help but think they must have lived through hell. Doing what they do and the way they look. You get the baton from your predecessors and you carry it as far as you can. Then you hand it over.
(Didi on the phone) n. However, two of them did. Not exactly irrefutable proof. But it's still a link. We'll take it.
You have another follower. - Who? Ders. - Yes. I have not received it.
There's my boys, the biggest stars of the Rancho network. You think I'm a star? You see, truz. You've been posting epic content. I appreciate it.
- See you around. Trilly's the best. Hey, you guys gotta go. I'm going to shoot a video for Instagram where I karate-chop my head against a vodka ham hock. I'm calling it a "festival of strength."
- Pete... The usual, please. That lays out the bar's intentions, which may include - from rebuilding to remodeling.... - They want to tear it down?
It was his case. It was supposed to be my case. Do you think I should tell him to take it again? Jo, you already did. If you wanted it, you'd take it.
Frank? Mom's looking for you. You have to start the dance. Okay, okay, okay, okay. You'll start it with him.
She told me not to go into that store, and I did anyway. I let her. Chase, it's not your fault. We know Phenotrans is responsible... for the outbreak at East Mission. That the U.S. Army covered it up.
But don't worry, Afterlife will still happen... the way they wanted. You're willing to kill me to save humanity. Are you willing to make the same sacrifice? None of us want to kill anyone, but I will. There is a Telnet port open on... the network security device, we use it for local administration.
No, surely not, but take my selfie stick and play with it. Use it to look around corners like lookouts. - Right? - Ah, right. I was wondering what you wanted it for.
I wasn't fighting for Skaikru today. I thought I was fighting for myself, but now I know that's not true either. I was fighting for all of us. Skaikru will not take the bunker alone. We will share it equally because we are equals.
Yeah, well, losing a wife can do that to you. I'm up to my ass in meetings. What's the offer? Well... Dion and I have, well, actually it was Dion, Rie and I... we've always wanted our own place, a restaurant. We'd call it Thirio.
There's something I need to talk to you about. What is it? I need... I need legal advice. Look, we're about to open this restaurant and the investor gave us this huge contract. Is there any chance you could review it so that, I don't know, let us know if it looks right?
- A burner ... so no GPS. - TARU simply triangulated. The last call is from Saxon Woods. I have an emergency exception to put a Triggerfish on his phone. If it's on, we'll find it.
You're the one who fired on the previous night. All I will say, they were right. She did. Find the money? Not all of it, not even what I lost, personally, so I'm not sharing, if that's what you mean.
Hi. What are you doing? I think we solved your problem of using my office. I don't have a problem with that. Whoever's problem it is, I'll fix it.
Anyway, maybe he did it to protect your feelings. No, that's not Ed. Maybe he did it to protect your feelings. Enjoy your photo and your parking...and of course, the $15 gift certificate. They actually increased it to $25.
Put that down for a minute. I want to show you something. - Come here. Come here. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. If you turned this into an office for me, I don't want it.
Don't try to get me to open up. It won't work. I made a bad decision once, and my Uncle Ben paid the price. So I understand. But the past doesn't make you a monster unless you let it.
The point is that giving someone too much hope can be a dangerous thing. Yes, but then you live your life in the dark. Now, are you going to tell me what you do or don't have? Okay, what we know is: Babish has been using a credit card in the city for the last two days. He rented a car, the police found him...
Well, if he was here, he's not now. Patton, give me some good news. Why do you think they got me around here? I've been digging deeper into Zorn's credit cards. Turns out he bought his laptop six months ago and that bad boy is built into a geo-location program and I've traced it right back to Babish's house on Lafitte.
Yeah, I don't think so, partner, we're in the aforementioned house and there's nothing here. That's the location sound. The rest is self-explanatory. Sounds like it's in the chimney. You want me to go down there and find it?
And here you are in my wedding dress. I mean, you might as well sign a confession. First of all... I look amazing. And I admit, I was surprised when I tried it on and it fit like a glove.
Who are you? Okay, this is just creepy, so I'm going, I'm going. Help, somebody! Ivanka Trump is trying to kill me! And then I took my heel and threw it right in her face and just ran as fast as I could.
We will re-establish trade with the lake tribe. - Machk will not... - Machk will listen to you. He has to, or his people will not survive the winter. When I have killed Benton, swear to me that you will reduce his empire to ashes. Swear to me that you will.
Only Greshamsbury won't be saved by the gold in the oil of Lebanon. Thorne. Can I help you, Scatcherd? Do you remember what I said about the will? Yes, and I'm concerned that you haven't altered it, if you've done something you don't want to do.
The guy, he's gonna kick my wife's ass. And we're supposed to have sex on Tuesday. What, you have to schedule your sex? I fuck. I get it every Thursday I want.
- Well, we got into a problem on my side of the patent, so we're forming a partnership to split what we make equally. Sheldon, did you draft the contract? You bet I did. You guys are going to do it really hard tonight. So, you're going to sign this without having a lawyer look at it?
Oh, my goodness. Yes, this will do. Pelican Cove. Carole, it's Lacie. I saw the apartment yesterday. I'll take it.
- How much do you have left? Quite a bit. I missed my flight. - How did you miss it? - Well, I didn't miss it, but...
And in those days, you had no options. I mean, you ended up having the baby. I was young and stupid. It was around my eighth grade that I got pregnant. Then I had the baby and gave it up.
Okay, I said some things yesterday, you know, trying to be a tough guy when I said .... "I don't care if they sell this place, I don't need this, I'll be fine without this. " Well, it's not. It just isn't, so please, please, please don't sell it, Horace.
And then we have some money And then, and then, and then what? - Horace... - I've got another idea. Okay. What if we divide it by three, like I was saying: but we keep it open?
You're still a little high, aren't you? I'm sure am. You wanted me to want to know my net worth. You got it.
All right, I can do it, but I'm warning you. I can do it, but I'm warning you, you're not going to like what you're going to find. What does that mean? There was a lot of money in there. We spent most of it, but I think it's Sara you're worried about, isn't it?
It's like all the energy of the ship flows into me. I feel almost invincible. We should turn off the link. Why the hell would we do that? We don't need it.
Even if that's true, how do we know they haven't tampered with your program? If you didn't notice, we try to catch up. We need to run diagnostics, review systems, records. The fastest and most efficient way to do that is with the link. Maybe, but you know what can happen if you keep it too long.
- Only 18 years old. Yes. We know that. The security video from the ATM where your father and uncle were killed, it's gonna be awful, Buzz. You want me to see it first?
Well, I can't abort. The deadline has passed. I'm not suggesting that, Mom. And what are you suggesting, other than that I'm a horrible person with no ability to change? That you have the baby, Mom, but that you give it up for adoption so that child has a decent chance at a normal life.
All right. First... first, we look at the color. First... first, we look at the color. Is it bright purple or garnet ruby? Is it limpid or slightly fuzzy? Now we swirl the wine, aerate it a little bit, you know?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Where does the acid come from? Pickled lemon. Val added it to the braised rabbit.
- Coming! Wait a minute, wait a minute! Lieutenant! Andy! Here's a chance for a good deal. Trust me, if there was a deal to be made, my mother would have done it.
And they say people don't change. But you're saying, Mike, that this currency was never distributed to the Sunnis? No. According to records, Army personnel in charge of financial support were caught in an ambush and were ordered to torch the cash. And then it is shown here, where our victim uses it to tip a girl in a set of strips.
No, Vince wanted the American dream ... beautiful wife, great car. He just ... just don't have the skills to do it, man. Like you do. The knife. Vince took it from a dead republican guard, since with the money.
Fuck you! Terrorism?! Did the FBI really expect this terrorism charge to stick? Well, now that they know who did it, who will be able to reverse engineer Vince's Internet uplink.
Maybe lighter fluid. But it looks like people might have been barbecuing here. We said that an hour and a half ago, before you were late. Kendall, can you make anything out of this mess? Well, we'll know more when we put it under a microscope, but I'd say the victim was cut.
And the thumb... I'll do what I can. How Lieutenant Tao thinks he's going to get a full print on this, I don't know, but yuck. Does Julio still have anger issues? Yeah, he does. You don't go to therapy, you find the problem, you fix it and that's it.
I knew it. This recent photo of Adrian sent from their computers... it's not that recent. How old is it? 126 weeks old. Someone took an old post of Adrian's and has sent it to his social media team.
I don't care how angry you are with someone. Divorce is always better. for me and mine, for example, we found ourselves inadequate and decided to go our separate ways. After he hit her with a clothes hanger and locked her in the closet for two days. We called it a wardrobe.
No, this is the first time. You worked with Jeff Dellinger? For five years, cubicle next to cubicle. And you were working with him, next to him, when this alleged espionage happened? I don't know why they call it spying.
Mr. Froines, to your knowledge did Mr. Dellinger access classified documents and information - while he worked for you? - He did more than that. He... downloaded classified material - and leaked it to journalists.
- after shooting at the cameras? - Uh, no, sir. Looks like our madman just wanted what was in his car. Right. After he unpacked his vehicle, he just left it behind?
- Do we know that? - Uh, the team is required to identify themselves before we can search, but the operator gave our killer a hold receipt for the DMV So whatever car he came back for, he has an expired registration. They don't tow your car for that. But it's a good reason not to drive around with a bag full of guns. So, maybe that's why he dumped it.
4300 Eagle Rock Boulevard. Elliot Chase only has a P.O. Box listed and his secondary address is his ex-wife's house downtown. Wait, Captain. Do you think the suspect's photo should go to the media? No. If Mr. Chase has a plan, I don't want him to accelerate it because of a press report.
Lots of Vanilla! What difference does it make what the vanilla milkshake looks like? Look, that oxy... That cost me a lot of money. I'd never split it with that smug bastard.
He told so many lies about me, I still wake up angry as hell. Have you come across Mr. Cushing lately? This morning, last night? His phone could probably tell us. Do you want us to check?
maybe a student. Run that video again a little bit, Buzz, to the moment when "Campus Doll 101" enters Eric's very nice car It's not exactly mine. I drive it a lot, but... Well, it's registered in his name and the dealer said he paid cash for it.
Your little... Where's the remote? Put the remote back on the table, right now, or I'm going to arrest you for thievery. I'm serious. I don't want it anyway, you probably touched it.
Is that right? That's why. He was fucking my little girl! How can you be so sure? Last week, Brie came over, and while I was cooking him dinner, she took our dog for a walk and left her phone on the counter. It came on with a text from Bobby and I saw it.
He was not a real uncle. He's in the army. What about... Where does he live? It's so cool that he gave you this gift. Can I see it, again for a moment? I'm going to give it back to you. I promise you that.
See you in five. Hey. What, are you coming with me? - Yeah, why not? - Well, what about your car? Somebody's gonna get it.
White shirt? He told me to tell you he'll be leaving soon. Huh? He says he wrote a message for you inside the old closet. He wants me to read it before it's thrown away.
CULTURE Modern medicine has come a long way toward restoring sight thanks to cutting-edge technology and inexpensive materials. That would be a game changer for millions of near-blind people desperate to see again. BEAT BLINDNESS The blurry white substance you see is a cataract, which is a blurry lens. I am moving the lens very gently until it is free, and then I will remove it from the eye.
Dr. Handa is placing the device and wrapping it like a belt so it won't move. - Those points are 60 electrodes? - That's right. It's amazing that a little piece of plastic can give a person the gift of sight. I am now placing it on the eye.
In the distance? Wait. - Did he have it upside down? - I think he did. You can turn it upside down and see whatever you want.
The flags on the map are in the same order as the poles on the farm. When you find this out you can count them on the map 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12... 1, 2, 3, 4. Go along the path counting flags to match them with the ones in the book. This is a map of the flags. Let's not tell anyone.
They're going to make it. Our train is there. Shall we move? We missed the train. - You missed it?
Did I have a heart attack? How were my electrolytes before I went into arrest? Good. Within normal limits. Your heart rate was over 200 on the monitor. Did Lisa see it?
Oh, God! I need a suture kit. No. You know what, I don't really... I don't need one.
Okay, good. Okay, great. So, I don't deliver Charles' placenta. After I cut the cord, I'll sterilize it. I'll put it back in, and we'll give mommy antibiotics.
Of course. Is everything all right? She's wearing... her wedding dress. Hasn't anyone talked about it? Her father brought it earlier.
If you don't accept it, it's zero cents on the dollar. What the hell are you talking about? This money is from our investment fund. It's all the money we have. And once the partners find out we're using it to settle, they'll come after it.
I don't have the seed money for Zane. What? How is that possible? Jessica, listen to me. You know what I did and Hardman found out, but what you don't know is why I did it.
Go. We got a sample of the poison Bobo used and maybe Black Plate can create a cure. There's a lot of poison in the basement. - And how do you know this? - Because I was there when Bobo's men did it.
- Pupils are fixed and dilated. - His head is flattened. Ice is penetrating the side and back of his skull. Yes, it looks like the ice severed the carotid artery. It's up against the wound, but if we move it, it will start pumping.
Mr. Tacker, I promise we'll talk about this later, but right now, our concern is your safety, so we need to get you up to surgery. No, no! Cut him off! - We'll talk later. - I want him out!
It's not part of me. How long have you felt this way? Since I was little. Four or five. I look at it and it just feels weird.
- Good. - Clamp. - Clamp. I don't see the glass. It's buried in the grease, but you got it.
He took off his restraints! Made a tourniquet of tubes. - Half a milligram of Diluadid. - Yes, Dr. Charles. No, no, no, no, don't touch him!
- Keep it, for this business. Hell. He may have small hands and short arms but what's for sure is that the kid runs. He's even faster chasing the ball. When I'm wrong, I admit it.
Gabriela said she had some news regarding your campaign? I wanted to announce...that I will be deferring councilmember salary if elected. And what inspired that decision? There are still families that Councilman Becks... hasn't helped after the tornado. They need it more than I do.
They need it more than I. Is that one of the issues... that you will be bringing up in the final debate? The final debate was last week. Councilman Becks' campaign told us... that a fairer debate had been set up before the election. This is the first I've heard of it.
Oh, don't you play with me Coy. You know it's just for buying cars. It's all right. I... I... I... I-I couldn't stand I threw the dress in Paretskys' backyard, His dog saw it, came over, shrank a little, And then he had diarrhea all over.
-It's okay. You got a nice wine, Pete. -I didn't say I didn't -You know, Horace, just -Stop pushing their fucking mechanisms with your passive-aggressive bullshit. -Well, all right - The guy at the wine store said it was a good wine for the price, and if you open it an hour before you eat, it gives it time to breathe and for the aroma -
Pay yourself an extra 50 cents and make up the difference. - An extra dollar per hour. - There you go. Nice little car. Where'd you get it?
I have the Urban Planning people behind me. Where is the environmental impact study for the project? - Which one? - The one for the west side. I'll call Fitz and tell him I need it right away.
We were planning to rebuild that whole block. Are you sure? Do you remember what happened to that delicatessen? Some bum tried to heat himself by setting the stove on fire and set the whole building on fire. If I stay on as manager, do you leave it open?
- with an ophthalmologist right now. - Could he lose his sight? The thing is, his eye is paralyzed. It's trapped in the fractured socket. We go in there, free it up and then drain the blood.
I have a guest futon. Do you have guests? You'd be the first to use the futon. Yeah. Why am I not surprised? Why did you buy it?
Enough. Or I'll add "int" to words that only have "in" in them. - You wouldn't. Okay, I'm sorry. Thanks for the gift. I really appreciate it.
Standard plumbing pipes are not large enough for humans to pass through. Not duh, but they are small enough to clog easily. I can modify a toy submarine with a GPS tracker. Drop it into the municipal system. Sly controls it from the garage.
Your country thanks you for a job well done. Now I'm lost if I were you. TOBY: W-wait, uh... you forgot a diamond. It's a little tarnished, cause, uh, you used it to cut steel.
Fan-out! Here's your hall pass. Don't let the main catch you. (Badge sniff) I swear I had it.
At the wedding reception, I'll introduce you to my boss's daughter... Perfect match. I like your school uniform, Hennessy. It's funny because it's close to my normal aesthetic, - but why are you wearing it? - What's your point?
It is against the target. We seek compensatory damages of $80,000 and $10,000 in damages, along with a clear instruction from the court that the defendant will not shoot drones in the sky. Actually, your honor, I would like an opportunity - to cross-examine him first. - He has already admitted that he shot it down by shooting it down.
Peter, if you are always being imputed. If not today, then tomorrow. My lawyer will call you. Thank you. He told Dr. Nachmann not to shoot the drone, so he made it safely disappear and returned it.
Why? The ADA offers us a plea bargain. It doesn't make sense. Three years in jail? The evidence doesn't support it.
If you're worried about embarrassing me... I'm not worried about anything, Alicia. When people think badly of you, keep thinking badly of you. That's office gossip you've got there. Who gave it to you?
That's office gossip you've got there. Who gave it to you? Your investigator? No. Well, I'm not going to use it.
I'm sorry. Can I make a confession? Of course you can. I never liked wine. I only drank it because you liked it.
We are offering an opportunity for something better. Connect with Frankie, believe in Frankie. And you... get better. Now, we have the message. The next question is, how do we communicate it to other people?
648, to be precise. After reading most of them, I confess I see the appeal. If you throw away the silly costumes, the square jaws and the skull-sized breasts, there is a cardinal devotion to fairness. The attention to continuity, however, is laughable. This is the tenth issue of the 1940s, and you pulled it out of your purse.
It's not him, not the things he stands for. Funny the way he had his own midnight ranger outfit all ready to go. I didn't have it "ready to go." I had this suit for years. I bought it to go to a comic book convention.
Uh, you heard about the midnight ranger murder? Yeah, the guy in the cape. Heard he got shot the other night. That was his phone. He used it to alert the police to street crimes he couldn't handle alone.
Our rebellion against Him was entirely just. Righteous or unrighteous, your rebellion failed. Yes, we failed. And we fell to a place so far from the light that we forgot even what light and life were. - We called it Hell.
No. You see, I listen until it becomes a kind of roar. And then I wait for the perfect moment to silence it. You see, murder is a beautiful art. I would have done it in honor of the Dark Lord.
It's a good ad. Well produced, but it's dead, bro. I'm sorry. I can't use it. I can't use it. So we're dropping it?
Or what? What are you going to do to me? For the record... I know you haven't actually transferred that money to my account, and that's okay. I don't want it.
And who tied Frank Thatcher's pants to that pony. - I'm being watched. - Mr. Shine? He wishes to make mincemeat of me for his stew. I won't ask you again, Drum.
I'm in high school... a new beginning. First impressions are key. Most people decide what to think about you in the first seven seconds of meeting you. It's in this fantastic book I'm reading. I found it by chance because it was misplaced on the shelf.
Lily, we were going to open Grandma's presents together! I couldn't wait. Grandma left you a watch. The note says, "Your grandfather tore it off the wrist of a dead German soldier."
- Hi. - I brought you a coffee. - Thank you. - And I don't know if you take it black or with milk or soy... And I don't know if you drink it black or with milk or soy... or either way... I brought everything.
I made a joke. You cut the car in half. No. The firemen did. They had already started cutting it so I asked them to go ahead and cut it in two.
no. Yes. She calls us. She tells us when and where to pick up the money. Where do you leave it?
McGee. Are we absolutely sure Senator Kelly did it? I don't believe a word she says. How did she find out about the Senator's military secret? political rivals...a con artist does?
I gave you an open door to lie one more time but you didn't take it. Look, there's no way I can explain it to you. So try telling me the way you would explain it to yourself. Well, I used to think, what if there was a button I could push and all the things that have complicated my life just didn't happen? I would push it, and all the people who shouldn't have died would still be alive.
- Where are you going? - To the archive. The more information they have on her, the better. - It's gone. - Where did you put it?
- For the file. The more information they have on her, the better. - It's missing. - Where did you put it? I don't know, I had it with me when I went to Toby this morning.
- It is not there. - Where did you put it? I don't know, I had it with me when I went to see Toby this morning. I took it. I gave it to Toby.
We would be implicating her in the murder. Elliott just texted me. It's a pin from his location. How does he have your number? I gave it to him when I was babysitting Ali.
Afterwards, I walked you to your apartment so I could tell you about my job. But there was a violinist playing at Kenyon so we sat in the hall for a minute to listen to him... and I thought, why ruin the moment? And when we finally got to your door I started to tell you about my job but you were distracted looking for your keys. I couldn't take my eyes off that little dimple in your chin... thinking how much I wanted to touch it... and kiss you. So I never told you about the job and I called them the next day and told them I didn't want it.
That's noble... but you can't hide forever. At some point, people will expect, you know... a wedding. Oh, my God, my bracelet. I had a gold bracelet on and now it's gone. Where was the last time you had it on?
Spencer Hastings, this is Detective Marco Furey. He's my new supervisor on the Rollins case. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, nice to meet you, too. I'm sure you have a lot of work to do, so I'll leave you to it.
Do you want to tell me why you are here? Alison found a piece of paper with this address on it at her house. So we told her we could go check it out. Do you have that piece of paper? We left it with her.
Yeah, well, Toby's squad maybe scared them off. Oh, well. I didn't tell you guys this before but I really screwed up today. Jenna showed up at my house asking about Elliot and now I think she knows we're on to her. Thanks to me she knows about the burner phone and I'm sure she can figure she wouldn't give it to us without a fight.
Waiter... They look excited. Hence the raid on the caravan. Noel wanted that file. Well, if Noel stole it, then there's something we missed.
Okay. I went to get Yvonne's things, and the only thing missing from the trailer was that file. I'm so sorry I dragged you into all this. Toby, I feel terrible. Well, I'm gonna find out who took it.
Jessica had a file for each of us. She was investigating us. Yes, all of us except Aria. She doesn't have a file. You think someone took it?
You can't just buy something like that in a costume store, which means that you had to... Either the killer is a skilled tailor and mask maker, or it was made up by someone who is. Okay, I was thinking the second option. Well, so, all we have to do is use ourselves as bait, to lure the green Meanie, and then figure out a way to cut a piece of fabric from his costume and carry it around to all the fabric stores in the area, see if they recognize him....
Because we are a real couple. - Okay. Okay, okay, okay. - Well? And then, maybe... Maybe just maybe when Dean Munsch dies, I'll rip that ring off her cold, dead finger and give it to you.
Of course I am! I'm not... I'm not sure it will. I mean, it might burn a layer of brain tissue, but I don't think it's going to leave any lasting damage. Besides, she won't even feel it.
We performed a nerve block on her neck so she won't feel any pain, and I gave her a mild dose of Clonazepam to keep her calm. Calm? Okay. I feel great. I feel great. I mean, you've opened up my brain and exposed it to the world.
What are you doing? Kara, this is crazy. Kara, this is crazy. Why don't you tell me what's going on? - Where's the diaper bag? - I don't know where it is. I thought you had it.
MacMillan Utility is basically the Sonaris virus with lipstick. And only two KLOCs out of 452 separate us from it. And those two KLOCs completely changed the functionality and purpose of the entire program. It's completely amazing. And, you know, I separated it into parts in less than a day.
But you should get a sense of the place. I know I speak for all investors when I express how delighted we are with the growth of our individual user base. That tastes awful. I mean, it tastes like... ugh. Look, maybe we didn't see it from the beginning, but the people have spoken and you are certainly the strong leader we always knew you would be.
Raymond, if that act is not consummated there will be no Louis haute couture or Sun King or golden age for France. Which means by extension there will be no Madame Curie and no Louis Pasteur. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, history will be completely ruined, but I don't have to be there to see the .... you know, the act as it's consummated, right? It's beautiful, your highness. So is yours. Who gave it to you?
On March 23, 1972, you came out of a movie theater... "Slaughterhouse Five." You loved it, and you bumped into a big Marine and knocked him out and he fell on his ass. You were embarrassed and he laughed, said you could make it up to him by going with him for a cup of coffee. And you went... to Mulroney's and you talked and he was handsome and he knew all the Zeppelin songs, and when he asked for your number, you gave it to him, even though you knew your father would be angry.
You're just bad at your job. Yeah, and you're better? Much, much better. You drive down back roads, hunting for random cases. You find out a body has turned up, you take a look and maybe even kill the thing that did it.
We've got a problem. Let me out! What now? Well, we've got his number. We go back to the bunker and track him down.
Maybe it means something? There was a story about this place a couple of months ago. Some neighbors cried miracle when a nearby creek turned red with blood. Turns out there is a slaughterhouse with a drainage system nearby. They shut it down.
Even bribing him would have made it difficult to get him to give up that role. Unless you promised him that he could keep it. With his brother dead, the rights would be his. I don't care about the Bear documentary. I told him if he wanted to, he could direct it.
His first word. And the last. We have to recover her body. I have to bury her, I have to see her. Molly, I want to get her body back too, but they won't give it to us.
Where ... you have a lot of walking to do, shame on you? Not very far. So what's your problem? You own this bar. Yes, my sister and I and my cousin, we own it together.
Marcus met Edgar in some fancy club to get the worm program. When Marcus returned, both him and his laptop smelled like cigars, - And that's all I know. - Where is Marcus' laptop now? Okay, if there's still a copy of the worm program on here, I might be able to find out who created it.
That envelope was my payment to the judge. I'm being blackmailed, just like your sister. What does the judge have to do with you? What does he have to do with Dee? This diary, did you turn it in to the police?
Christian's GPS log... The one you sent me. There was no record of him being at Dee's funeral... but he was there. The log was from your cell, not his. You took a screenshot of your own phone AND passed it off as Christian's.
Let's take this to the next level, shall we? Look, I already told you I can't give you what you want. And now you want more. God, what is it with everyone? You make an agreement, and then they change it?
I find it boring too. You have a book I want. We had just found out where it was... In the hands of another Grimm, a Josef Nebojsa of Prague. We traced it to a bookseller in Leipzig and then to Portland.
You have a book I want. We had just found out where it was... In the hands of another Grimm, a Josef Nebojsa of Prague. We traced it to a bookseller in Leipzig and then to Portland. Turns out the bookseller who bought it is related to one of your friends.
In the hands of another Grimm, a Josef Nebojsa of Prague. We traced it to a bookseller in Leipzig and then to Portland. It turns out that the bookseller who bought it is related to one of your friends. The bookseller was a Blutbaden, yet he chose to give the book to a Grimm. I believe you have the book now, and will give it to me.
And besides, acting is fun. Well, it's Oscar's performance. How come nobody knew about it? What about that amulet? You told me about it, something... that glows in your presence.
I was stupid. Naive. I thought if I could show my sister... that there was something more than just us, something better than us, then I could change. Maybe I could stop... being... her. But...every time I built a new world...she destroyed it.
Congratulations, Fred. It looks like your cinematic debut has come to an end. I don't get it. You guys, great job! I can't believe you guys actually pulled it off.
I could curse Monty for not being here - he misses the Yule Ball! The great and the good. I appreciate the moral support. You need it.
Five foot seven, brown hair, green dress. If you ask him, you haven't seen me! Aren't you apologizing? A gout attack doesn't get me a red card. She just sees it as a challenge.
Well, what are you waiting for? Was anything missing? Your quilt and the lamb. It's his favorite toy. He doesn't allow it at night.
His quilt and the lamb. It is his favorite toy. He won't allow it at night. Nanny says he'll get his teeth crooked. But I always put it on his bed so he can see it.
Speaking in riddles as usual. And who is this Jocabed? That one. Moses' mother. Who put the child in a basket and hid him in the reeds.
- Hi. I got your message. What do you want to talk about? Look, I know you liked the underwear I got you... I loved your gift. I'm wearing it now.
I changed my mind. What? You don't change your mind. You still think lefties haven't learned to use their right hand. That calf will make us $1200 if we take it to the sale.
He was helpless. He's got to have a bigger target. I need to know what he's doing. Really? When Alexander encountered the Gordian knot, a knot so complicated that no one was ever able to untie it... he simply pulled out the sword and cut it in two.
Gray Pharma. In fact, they have a warehouse here in Gotham. You think they might be a target? Well, they're the only pharmacy that carries the drug. If someone wants it, they'll have to go to the source.
Your wife told us that you asked her to stop at the ATM... this morning. I didn't want Rafe Carey to pay for everything, like he always does. But we searched him, Leo. He didn't take any money out of the ATM. You had money, but you didn't withdraw it.
Four of the six knives disappeared.... gone, all gone. Whatever happened, it doesn't go with me. I've left it out. It's gone. The river took it away.
Maurice is back on the booze. And so am I. Lisa... He's taken our money. All the money that you and Jack gave me... he took it with him, he ran off to Florida with a woman he met a month ago.
Tea? No. Lisa's finished too. Did you put out my cigarette? Yes, I put it out.
-I don't apologize, it's the truth. I don't know what to do. It's the Air Force. Should I answer the e-mail? Should I ignore it?
You can't ignore it. It's not the postcard that tells you to go to the dentist. Let's have dinner with everyone. Just a minute. I'm afraid to respond because they'll know I got it.
It's not the postcard that tells you to go to the dentist. Let's have dinner with everyone. Wait a minute. I'm afraid to respond because they'd know I got it. Dude, as soon as you opened that mail, they knew you got it.
It's not nonsense. That's what the U.S. military is like. If anything they are from the United States. They could be foreign military pretending to be from here. If we give them our guidance system, they will use it against us.
- he was constantly beating up... - Connor, stop it. Instead, he's putting the burden on the victim! Young man, you need to get a grip. My client has suffered a lifetime of horrors, and you are continuing the cycle of abuse, and I will not allow it!
My license is current, so the case will continue tomorrow as scheduled. And will he... will he still be lead counsel or whatever? Dude, okay... that wasn't so bad, was it? We'd be a hell of a lot better off if you told us what you did with the money. I told you I spent it.
It will be better to make a statement in private, and promise to attend anger management classes. I'll probably hit those people too. I really need to retire. Sam's insurance money is that good? I spent it all.
Big balls? Oh, God... no. No, I'm serious. Look, I found the person who sent the video. Who sent it?
You're the one who doesn't understand! This isn't about her! It's about the baby! She'll have him in jail, and then what? Who will take care of him?
I went to the bathroom. It was right here. I came back and it was gone and I'll call security if I have to. - I dare you. - I'm not afraid of the cops. Okay, open your backpack then and show us you don't have it.
I have a feeling it was him. He's always very aggressive with you and since he never could be first defender, and... with your job at risk, I thought maybe I should check his computer. He stole your computer because of the arbitration project. We can't give it to the university, though, can we? Otherwise they'd know Michaela stole it.
He is always very aggressive with you and since he could never be first defender, and.... with your job at risk, I thought maybe I should check his computer. He stole your computer for the arbitration project. We can't give it to the university, though, can we? Otherwise they'd know Michaela stole it. I can lie, say I found it somewhere in the courtyard.
- I did this for you, Annalise. No, you did it for yourself, to have the love that no one ever gave you. But guess who did it? I did. And you spit it in my face.
It's better than that. You might even want me to replace Simon as defense attorney... again. You stole that kid's computer. Now you want to steal his job? - He deserves it.
- An anonymous source. They have provided information linking you to the charges. Now you want your lawyer? - TWO WEEKS AGO - Have you lost your cell phone? Last time I had it was at the library.
We have been seeing each other for the past year. He knew about our messages, so he sent me the article as a joke. Always with some damn anonymous email address. Or a secret boyfriend! I didn't want mom to sabotage it.
We'll start again tomorrow. What? Are you shy? Aren't you? It's not how your body looks... It's how you use it.
Thank God I know how to separate sex from feelings. Even with Oliver? Your mother calls you. - You drive. - Why? So Asher and I can make out in the backseat and leave him for you to clean up. So Asher and I can make out in the backseat and leave him for you to clean up.
- Pull the trigger! - Please don't, Frank! - Do it! Pull it! - Please don't do it!
So you're still talking to her. So, is it true? Let me make it clear. This office is not investigating Annalise Keating. And why I helped you get this job is because you deserve it.
I had to show hostility. You acted too soon. With one month more, Marseille would have fallen into your hands. It would have been too easy. If I gave you the power, would you refuse it?
Conviction Review Units generally do not investigate cases of the sitting prosecutor, much less those that the prosecutor himself brought to trial. It's time to break the mold. It's our second case AND Wallace gave you this job. Correction... he blackmailed me into taking it.
Little by little, now. After this case was filed. After all, she knew this would be brought up in court. She is a professional, and has a cunning mind. Why does she twist every fact and then present it?
No, sir. Please. I want to say this, and I must say this! Yes, we take the money, sir. We ask for money and we take it too!
After all, Rajvir Singh comes from a respectable family. He is young, a bright future awaits him. Moreover, the testimonies of the Doctor... the waiter, the manager and the Investigation Officer... all say that the girls are guilty. Consent is not an issue in this case. This was only forced in by the defense... ...because these days consent is all the rage. And that's why they introduced it for convenience.
Do you mind explaining the tablet designs? Yes, the magnetic susceptibility meter and the magnetometer will locate our subway evidence. And it will photograph it. Ground Penetrating Radar? But not as you've ever seen it.
Oh, did you, now? You did, now, uh. So, uh, bring that, uh, sleeping bag with you? No. No, we don't need it.
It's not poison oak, Mike! Why don't you look me in the eye and say that. It's not poison oak... Micro. Then why don't you go ahead and rub it in the balls for me?
Paint stains? Smells like a bait store? Yeah, I might have worn that hat last night. What? Is it possible he wore it or did you wear it?
Good. Kilmer will have it in 50 pieces by now. We... we couldn't get it to Kilmer. We had to drop it off at the junkyard we used for the bank. So, the car with Craig's blood and a dead cop's bullets in it is in San Pedro waiting to be found?
Hey, what happened to the cell phone I bought you? I called you today. Yeah. I was passing by the beach. I didn't hear it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Then put it on vibrate.
No one else gets hurt. Do you understand? I want you to see something. Nice view, huh? I know the planner. The rent's mine if I want it.
We are running out of time. The explosives could go off at any time. Yes, she wears a blocker on her wrist. I pointed it out to Nate before I put a tracker on it. Let's hope she uses it for good and not to sink deeper.
- What's that? What? The container I found in the morning... - it was in the fridge. - ¿Y? In the video, I left it on the counter.
No one knows better how to rob the Baptiste family crypt except Boyd, who apparently was desperate enough to try. Which Lieutenant Murray suspected, but when he got the lead on Boyd you feared the investigation might lead to you. No doubt the missing wire is the murder weapon used to kill Lieutenant Murray. The missing wire? I...that must have been taken when they broke into my house, I...I didn't report it because I-I didn't think anything was missing, but it was obvious what they were after.
He said he needed it to authenticate some kind of ring he was trying to sell. A ring? It's supposed to come back to me. We haven't heard from him, so apparently, he doesn't have the bone yet. That's because we do.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I feel like we should say something to each other. We're in this together. It's us against the world. The world won't know what hit it.
We have everything for a permanent majority. I look like her, don't I? I looked online. Except for the hair. Maybe if I put it back?
Why? Well, it certainly wasn't something you said. You and I have lived together for a period of almost five years. I have some understanding of your... rhythms. Also, on three occasions this summer, you wore a rather fancy outfit to work and then, several weeks later, you wore it again.
Yeah, I've seen how that handles your provolone, You're an idiot, No, I'm just hurt and angry, Do you have any idea how what I'm going through feels? It feels like you just took my heart and ripped it out of my body and then just shoved it up my , , , And then, it just lies there, covered in flies,
You're an idiot, No, I'm just hurt and angry, Do you have any idea how what I'm going through feels? It feels like you just took my heart and ripped it out of my body and then just shoved it up my , , , And then, it just lies there, covered in flies, Even the dog doesn't want it, even though it ate it in the first place,
How about extremely fast and out of control? Forgive me, putting a little bit with beads up about this plan, With beads up:sweaty, worried, I know my experimental conditions, Lieutenant, that fancy plane that's flying, all the minds that designed it, compared to us are morons, so there's no need to sweat,
Okay, they are in communication with Admiral Pace, but their sonar, depth finder and radar have all gone dark, The quickest way to find the sub would be to use the sonar capabilities of the USS Corbett, However, the Corbett's under hacker control, Yes, so we will need a top down approach, Do you get it?
Thanks for your help, shall we? All right, that's the last of them-- is that enough, Walter? The magnetic field is strong, and the sub's already gone into it, but it won't disrupt the hackers' signal unless there's an electrical current running through it, so we get out,
I don't have money to pay you I'm not looking for payment, I'm just looking to spend time talking Well, let's continue I'm looking for someone. he's not too young, but he's not as old as you He has a skin..... and he carries a cane, ...even though he doesn't need it.
And what do you think their motives are? I could not say. Cipriano, you have your ear to the ground... is this an isolated incident, or is it a symptom of some larger rebellion? There is a bit of civil unrest... I wouldn't call it an organized thing...it may have a personal touch.
For the most part. Your suit looks a little uncomfortable. In fact, I designed it to fit me perfectly. It's constructed from a proprietary alloy and it's had its fair share of battle experience. I even wore it in space once.
I was hoping to torture them a bit first, but since they're in such a hurry, I'll gladly accommodate their schedule. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm a scientist. That exosuit? I invented it.
From what I can see, I'll say we're on the island of.... Honshu, near Kyoto? Yes. How did you learn to speak my language? I studied it for many years.
Exactly. Wait, what? You let the shogun steal a 21st century super suit? After I crashed here trying to rescue you. How does the shogun even know how to operate your ATOM suit? I designed it so that even an idiot could use it.
- So it is impenetrable? - Not totally. Underneath the left thruster is the alpha stabilizer. - Alpha stabilizer, I understand. - If you destroy it, the photons flowing through the suit's weapons systems will overheat. Theoretically, that would cause somatic overload.
Look, I've been at this time travel thing for quite a while now. And if I've learned anything, it's that you never know what can change history and have massive consequences. What, you think this doesn't make me mad too? But we have work to do. And if we don't, things could get worse.
- Trying to be cool. Maybe this was a bad idea. You know, it may surprise you, but I was considered pretty cool when I left my cushy six-figure job in Silicon Valley and started my own tech company. Girls were lining up. Listen, hairdo, if you want to take Snart's place, you have to feel the pain, the evil, the rage. Do you have it in you?
Well, I was collecting the bounty on a piece of crap called Quentin Turnbull. - As in "Turnbull country"? - Doesn't ring a bell. That's because it shouldn't exist. This book has changed since I last looked at it.
He wants to see me raising the hay as much as I want to see him. Because... A small town in Oklahoma. It's called Calvert. Turnbull and his men were harassing him.
Goodbye. He didn't even thank us. What's that? I think it's a transponder. Where did you get it? I may or may not have stolen it.
Capone's men are taking over the ship. We've got bigger fish to fry, honey. Rex's killer? He's searching the ship for the amulet. It's only a matter of time before he finds it.
There's only one way to find out. What are you looking for, Cisco? You ever see "Twin Peaks"? Of course not. Why do I ask? This is an old hidden message trick they used for the dancing dwarf, where they record his audio in reverse and then play it forward.
Let's go to the lab. What is this? It's to test how your ability affects molecular motion. That block is solid tungsten and we heat it to over 2,000 degrees Celsius. I want you to cool it down and when we determine how you do that, we can figure out the best way to help you.
What you just witnessed was the appearance of my partner, Randolf Morgan. All right, I see what's going on here. You don't have facial transmogrification on this Earth, do you? No, we certainly don't. All right, then good for me that I found this little toy in my bag... I forgot I brought it.
That is, in addition to Shade, Magenta and Clariss, there are still three unidentified. All right, fine, if more come, we'll stop them. But Alchemy won't be able to get to Wally if he stays in the cell. And besides, burying his head in the sand won't make Alchemy go away. Ignoring the problem won't solve it.
I'm sorry. When did babysitting and proofreading become part of my job? Since I trust you. Really? Well, all things considered? If we didn't think you were the man for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, would we?
Does your story have a point? Yes. That without unity one can achieve nothing in life. And as I got older, I also realized that it means something else, that the scum will never amount to anything without help, that the Solntsevskaya Bratva can pull the turnip all it wants, but it can never, never, never free it.
If you took one step forward and two steps back. That's right. I think that's what they call being in charge. The truth is, you're all this city has left, so... however you want to do your job, just keep doing it the right way. Even if it takes you longer to achieve the result, you'll know it and so will the city.
- What is that? - I like to call it my 3PO processor. I'm fluent in over six million forms of communication. And it translates Dominator language? I didn't program it for that specifically, but in my defense, I didn't even know Dominators existed.
We're trying to connect human technology to a dominating power source. Of course it's overloaded! We need a regulator, okay? something that can take over the Dominator juice. Van Horn Industries was working on a prototype for NASA a year ago. Maybe they've perfected it by now.
You put me to drink and gave me false information... Okay, wait a minute. I wrote a number on a piece of paper... A number that you faked. To see if you'd steal it.
You were handsome. You could dance. And you had, what did you have? Courage. You had plenty of it.
She has all this excess skin. Facing Caleb over that girl. He's screwing her. That's a nice stroller. Where'd you get it?
Begging for forgiveness? begging for forgiveness, then insults, then asking for some more. Good hair sex. Ah, Yesca rocks. Free sex, whenever I want it.
If you give us Figgis, it doesn't have to end badly for you. Do you still have that file with all the evidence against him? You mean the one you gave me? It was a good idea at the time, we all thought so. Yeah, that file is in a safe place, and you're never going to get it.
I know Figgis and you are in more danger than I am. He's coming for you. And I guarantee you his men are going to find this place. That's not gonna happen. I've leased it through a shell company.
- I don't know what to expect... Have you ever dated a disabled man? In college I had a boyfriend, with a glass eye. Did you have any problems? No, I adored him.
- Be careful. - Yes. Thank you. I am being careful. - You want me to do it?
- Ah, not a good time. - But we had sex. I see what you mean. Mm, hi, yes, I want to book the first available flight from New York to Cuzco, Peru, out of Newark. Immediately. No, first available means I want it long before that.
You know, good intentions, but no follow-up. - Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. Do you need that car? Ah, no. You can take it.
Unless someone overrides them from the inside. I'll use the chlorate sails to lure Calvin into the A-ship. I close the hatch, push the button to give me manual control. If I can grab the lever, I'll be able to override the trajectory. And if I control it long enough, I can avoid re-entry.
- Thank you. So what happens now? You mean about what I'll do with your secret? I'll keep it. I care about this town and... you're working double time to make it a better place.
Now we've seen them. Midnight's are dangerous, and you know it. "And now ask the beasts, and let them instruct thee." "And to the birds of the heavens, and let them inform thee." "Or speak to the earth, and let her instruct thee."
And she will die... unknown, unmourned. It will simply vanish without a trace. And you wouldn't even give it a real voice with which to ask yourself if it needs to end like this. I didn't give the machine a name because... I imagined that one day it might want to choose one itself.
If I believed in the old words, I would pray for him. But that's gone for me now. Perhaps that is the root of what has been tormenting me. I have abandoned my faith. Or it has abandoned me.
Sultan, a photo. Sultan's pose! How does it feel to win an Olympic medal? Better ask the medal. Because madam, I didn't win the medal, she won me.
Help, please. It's a fact backed by science. India has one of the best cuisines in the world that has a broad profile of specialized flavors. You don't like Indian food? I don't think she likes me.
No. No. I've had it. It's real. And it's worth fighting for.
It's as if the boiler is not on. I'll go and have a look. Try to go to sleep. Well? Well, I hope it restarts itself.
Good words. But then we moved to the country and started farming. We learned the dark secrets that work with the goods of the land. Your father's sermons were fine for city folk, but once you get down to planting and harvesting, it's the voice of the moon you hear. And she tells a different story.
He made history with his law legalizing sex. Really, babe? I thought it was funny. Supreme Court, Acid Betty. She believes that all citizens have the right to fisting.
Well, if we spill it all over the floor, we have to close that room, and evacuate everybody. So, don't spill it, okay. Don't spill it. With the radioactive tracer in my bloodstream, Andy can measure how much blood is flowing through different parts of my brain. The more I use a part of my brain, the more radioactive dye it will accumulate.
I don't need you to show me around town. Of course you do. This is an exciting time, brother! Now that we are making Los Angeles our home, the City of Angels can finally earn its name. You are making it your home.
Fortunately, there was an eagle hovering over his head as he spoke to make it more like an epic Bible story. Peter had pharaoh-like powers over his subjects. He was able to bend his servants, his nobles and even nature to his will. So with astonishing speed, what had been mosquito-ridden swamps were transformed into this great city. Peter named his city St. Petersburg and it would become the home of the Romanov dynasty, eclipsing Moscow for more than 2 centuries.
What was the money for? For this, what you're looking at. Digital effects, honey. These two had this app. They said you could do "Titanic" on your laptop with it.
Math is not in your favor, He has to make a decision, T-less than 25 seconds to launch, He's closing the hatch, Because if he launches without it sealed, he's dead,
But what if we used that time for Grandma to help you earn that business badge? Mom won't let me. She thinks you're a degenerate. We'll keep our eyes peeled until we get a chance. She calls, we answer.
- Jinsheng! What are you doing here? I'm here on business. I just bought this coal mine. Will you be able to make a profit from it?
I don't want to be lost here all night. Let's ask someone. Okay, okay. Excuse me, where does this road go? This route is not going anywhere, my friend, she will stay here.
Chhotey... May I have the gun? Please, Chhotey. Give me the gun. She's mine.
May I, as a man a year or so older, offer you some advice? Certainly. Beware of the law. It's an old, twisted, crotchety thing. And you may have broken it a dozen times, but let it catch you just once and it will be harder to get rid of than a big...squid.... giant.
We haven't even smoked weed yet, and you're already acting weird. Anyway, dude. Like I was telling you, In this house, there's a guy who will give us a map to a secret place here in the Olympics. The thing is called a 'star blade'. It opens many doors to the supernatural.
Well, Molly doesn't cause memory loss, so I'd like to run a tox screen to see if we can identify what she may have taken. Okay. (sighs) Hang on to it. Okay. [Sighs] She was a little more forthcoming than ever. All right, let's run the tox screen and see if it'll tell us anything that she won't, okay?
There is an instantaneous, immediate pleasure, for a very short time, it lasts about one minute at the most two minutes, but the person stays as if he was riding on a roller coaster, the highest and most fantastic in the world. What impressed me the most was when he disappeared, there was no news for two or three months and we became worried that he might be dead. Does the lady believe that the crack epidemic, if you can call it that, is really out of control? Looking at the statistics that crack use shows in 2009 and today 60% of our attendances are crack users. The drug also has the following: it does not discriminate social status, in fact it is addicted to everyone.
I got away from here, you all know! I cleaned this place out of my heart. But only because she wanted to, because she said she had lived here forever, despite the painful memories of parents, Because I gave up on selling the house. Only because she wanted to.
Even if you do not? Look at me! I'll explain to you here of such things! When we love a woman... I say, "Welcome!". Let us open our hearts to her ... and waiting to enter when she wants.
Kat, me, and also Briggs. So why? Why do they do it? Hope isn't just something you cling to. It's also something she clings to you.
Good luck! He looked really nervous. It's the hood! I'm telling you, it's good luck. I feel like a totally different person with it on.
No, it says "Formal wear". He means renting a tuxedo. Yeah, I know. Looks like she's not going. We should rent the suits anyway. It doesn't say that, okay? She's going.
I persist because I understand the salient facts. Civilization is in free fall. Our world is about to change, violently and forever. Selling out the human race so it can live as one of those monsters. That dominant species ravages the earth and takes it over.
Do you remember years ago an actress, one of our Gonerildas? She was a tall, dark, attractive girl with a Greek nose. - Flora Bacon. - Yeah? Yeah, maybe that was her.
And then I threw it against the wall. Nothing. Nothing. Then I cooked it some more, some more. And finally, I threw it against the wall and it stuck to the wall.
You are full of magic. There must be something you can do. No. No, I no longer have faith in my magic. It has brought me and those around me nothing but misery and death.
Killian... Whatever deal you made to get your revenge on Gold, it's not worth it. The darkness is using you. It doesn't matter what you want. It only matters what she wants.
They run at 64 km / h. To capture one, the wolves work in teams. One gets close enough to bite the hare's tail. But the hare can change direction in an instant. If she keeps changing and making jumps, she will eventually defeat them. Finally, she escapes.
As the shoal shrinks, each sardine desperately tries to hide in the middle. But now, there is no escape. it's a feast eat tons of sardines in less than 1 hour. The predators disappear into the ocean Each one, once again, after its passage. This blue whale continues to search for food to satisfy her enormous appetite. Because she is so large, she needs to consume about 4 tons of food per day.
- Thank you. On Sunday reservations will give the lap had the second meeting. and I was invited and I thought if Robi will be there, and? and? in two times. I'm a little late and everybody knows? to be there. The rest is just her? One chair and she was away from Robi.
There is nothing to be afraid of. I know, but I love not places like this. You know. Look at that old bed? What's wrong with it?
Everyone is disgusting. I'll get you a towel. What a gentleman. It's a little damp, but it's fine. Thank you. Did you know that if a cat has a deformed baby, she just eats the baby?
Aren't you afraid? If I think about it... I... It's not how I want to feel. I've thought about it a lot. And now I see death everywhere... there's no escape from it.
Doctor, please, you must rest. It doesn't make any sense. Look, it only has one bed. Why does it only have one bed? Because it's a bedroom, it's for sleeping in.
Have you received any recently? I received a rare missive when I arrived at the hotel. I didn't think twice about it. What kind of missive? It was a note wishing me luck with a piece wrapped in it.
Shit! Children, be quiet! So... Today, we have a very special guest. This is Madeleine; say good morning to her.
Are there any problems? No problem. Turn left, sir. You will see a sign. With it you will be able to get to the road.
As one scars with 40 years of soldiering on it, I tell them now ... It doesn't matter... Just let it end. And end it will.
I never should have. What are you talking about? You made a big mistake crossing me. Did I never mention... that the dome... saved me from death on that gallows? She redeemed me.
What are you talking about? You made a big mistake crossing me. Did I never mention... that the dome... saved me from death on that gallows? She redeemed me. She chose me... to do what she wants.
Why did he fall on his back as soon as I got home with him? The Norwegian Blue likes to nap lying on his belly. Amazing bird, isn't it? Beautiful plumage. When I got home, I took the liberty of checking the bird, and discovered that it was only sitting still on its perch in the first place because it had been pinned to it.
You thought it was a car. It's very nice. Thanks, Mom. The farm needs it. Just like it needs you.
You are anxious because you can't find it in the Bible. Well, let me help you. When God created the world, he filled it with trees, and he put fruit on the trees. And when it was time to build his house and make it beautiful... God put trees inside it.
- Did I miss it? - Yes, he's brushing his teeth. We had cake for dinner. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It was pie. I take it you're not mad at her anymore?
Get back to work. Does this key look familiar? - Where did you get it? - It doesn't matter. - What does it open?
Close the front door. - I'll go as fast as I can. - No, no, no, no, everything's fine here at home. But your daughter said one word when we got home. I don't say that word, but she said "shit."
Let's do a slower one now, ah, it'll be called, ah, "You Better Move On." It was the only thing like that that we did. And the girls really loved this song. We had a big hit with it in England.
Okay, the apology is only half of it. The most important thing is to make restitution, and that's why I brought this. I went to Steamtown Mall, and I brought you muffins from this place called Nipples. I think it's called Nibbles. The mind sees what it wants. Huh? Here you go.
So stop being so silly and worry about how he feels for once. High school is a time to experiment. With the mind and with the genitals. And that's because in my opinion the genitals are like a placeholder. A divine compass. And we all have it and it guides us to reach our destination.
The Earth's mountain ranges, river valleys and canyons all create islands for life. And it is these islands that the ancestors of the lemurs... found when they arrived in Madagascar. Empty niches, where populations became isolated, and for great lengths of time employed in such wonderfully diverse ways. 150 years after the Origin of Species, the subtlety and beauty of Darwin's vision is still revealing itself to us. It describes how our beautiful, complex tree of life has grown from a once desolate universe.
You are being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to detect acts of terrorism, but it sees everything.
Let's have lunch together. I'm sending the sketches of episode 7 and 8 and the synopsis. The synopsis is not that long. I told her to open the window. What's the point of making a show if she...
You are out! You're out! The Deuce, will I ever stop being afraid of the ball? Gene, listen to me. You're so much bigger and rounder than that ball, she should be scared of you.
- Slowly, that's not how it grips. - I've never used one before. Can you show me how it works? First of all, a gun is like a woman. You have to treat her gently, so she'll treat you the same way.
Aló. The actor's friend called his accountant. - He has a lot of debts. - Did you record the call? Upadhyay made a referral, she must have logged it.
The dogs found him a couple of kilometers from the hotel. He was badly buried under some rocks on a hillside with difficult access. I warn you it won't be pleasant, the quicklime has burned the flesh. Although I'm sure you're not surprised. -I don't know if it's her.
Overcome the problem. Sometimes the bad guys win but only momentarily. The important thing is not the final outcome of the battles, but of the war. If we look at the great variety of the DC Universe, in the end good triumphs over evil. The best stories, the ones that stick with you, are those in which even though good wins, victory has exacted a price. I don't think a hero has won a victory if he hasn't had to pay for it.
It was electrifying to drive because if you think about it, most luxury cars are generally the same. This just felt different. It felt like the future. I took it for a spin this morning, like, you know.... And what I loved about it is because it's just a Gallardo underneath it's not intimidating.
I get my seven servings ready... Two, four, six, eight. Cook on the stove top, and the salmon goes on the plate at the last minute. I can't believe what Bri's doing. I mean, you're going in backwards. I mean, she's upside down, almost like she's slicing.
Okay. That's enough. When I start creating the choreography, I just try to listen to what the song is about. I don't try to control the song. The song was already there before me, so I let it move me.
I'm glad you're so good at keeping secrets. You're testing my patience, I'm testing your self-control! You see temptation is a very powerful thing. It's very hard to fight it.
I didn't sign up to kill women and children. You know what I have to do next. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. Bodley... The amazing thing about the hyena is how it fights to the death for something much bigger than itself.
Somehow Wendy Vail was intimidated into changing her story. Another theory! I'm sick of theories; I'm switching to facts. The allegation has been made and now it has to be dealt with.
But I didn't need anything he had A dove came to me Without any fear She landed on my arm I touched her calm, I envied her love But I didn't need anything she had
A magic bean. The last one known to our species. The others have escaped us. Use it wisely. Follow the course it guides you.
Can't you give me room? Can you promise me that if I wasn't glued to your ass you wouldn't slip up? I can promise you that if you don't stop being glued to my ass something bad is going to happen. What is that supposed to mean? That if I don't control my need, it will control me.
And if you didn't feel this force, you could pass smoothly through solid matter. Over the past two decades, astronomers have discovered beams of light that "bend" around titanic invisible masses surrounding individual galaxies. They believe that these masses are composed of dark matter. They call it dark because they cannot see, feel or touch it. It passes through our world of solid things as if nothing were there.
It's regular. It's infected. What did you do, roll around in the dirt? - Yeah, with your sister. - What happened to the splint I gave you? I couldn't move my finger with it on.
For those few who could make it that far, the long-awaited sight of Jerusalem must have been something incredibly exciting. But it was not just because the journey to be there had been so long and arduous - it was because that place was the holiest site in Christendom. It was the place where Christ had suffered his passion, his life, his death, and, perhaps most important of all, his resurrection. Many Crusaders believed that if they could conquer that city, it could become a divine Jersulamen, a glorious Christian paradise. The walls of Jerusalem, and the Muslim garrison within, made it a greater obstacle than Antioch.
The event was so violent that we have seen it from Earth, 3 billion light-years away. Black holes can suck in planets and tear apart stars. But gravity doesn't always attract things. Any high school student knows that gravity attracts. It pulls, it never pushes.
These leftovers! What a shame. They're tasty too. Did Catherine take a box just to be nice? - She seems nice.
Look at you, manly mechanical man. I was checking the lower hose. I thought there might have been a leak. I really thought the girl was up to it. Oh, no, no, she is, she is.
At this moment, she is deeply immersed in prayer. At the height of her connection with God, Andy injects her with a harmless radioactive dye. Over the course of the next few minutes, as she continues to pray, the dye will move to the parts of her brain where the blood flow is greatest. The brain works in a very simple way in that the more active an area is, the more blood flow it receives, and the less active it is, the less blood flow it receives.
Mona Lisa? Mona Lisa? The leader of the Time Angels. I've always hated that painting! There's nothing in it that I like!
How much oxygen you need is not a conscious thought. You don't think you need to breathe more, this is done unconsciously. How many times your heart beats, this is unconscious. How fat or thin you should be, is an unconscious decision, but it is a decision. The problem with this subconscious or unconscious part is that it doesn't speak English.
It all started to make sense, everything that happened in my store, and the fact that my mother suffered a stroke.... ...what those things had in common was the box. So I decided to try to sell it. A few days later, an elderly couple came in and bought it. And I didn't think about it. I was happy to get rid of it.
You are being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to detect acts of terrorism, but it sees everything.
- In one place, because of the way he was handcuffed, any sign of sexual activity? According to the facial features, he had recently engaged in cunnilingus. - Where's the tongue? - Yeah, with her. Isn't that right, Jack?
I'm not going to mow people's lawns! It's just a few people, okay? ! And paint a fence. And one lady said she needed to fix her birdhouse because now squirrels can get into it.
Who is it? Who is it? Is it your three-second girl? Three-second girl? What you're about to tell us... Does it have to do with that girl? Who is she?
Not everyone can do what we do. The secrets we live with, the personal sacrifices we make. I just pray that the world is a better place for them. I didn't choose this life, Owen. It chose me.
In search of a maritime route to the east. Bartolomé Díaz has two options: Risk death on the rocks or head out into the Atlantic Ocean, into the unknown. He lowers his square sails and puts his faith in an ancient Roman technology. That will become the key to a new era in exploration. The triangular lateen sail. The sail acts like a wing and produces lift much like that of an airplane. And if you have a strong rudder, capable of turning that ship into the wind, it transfers all that energy and produces a forward motion.
Great party, by the way. Do you think Raina will keep you on that pedestal once she knows what you've done? Go find out. I think you know how much family means to Raina, almost as much as she knows... how little it means to you.
It then put an end to the war. Japan had barely recovered when it signed the Peace Treaty in September 1951. Daily Sanyo Maiasa This photo is exceptional. She can move around Japan ...
- Zach told you that? - Yes. And what did Zach say to him? To Pe... He didn't. I think he just accepted it. So, who is she?
They sent her to Wyoming, gave her a place to live, a cat, pictures of the past that never existed, and we gave her a job. School teacher. As did you. And as for the rest, well, the human mind is pretty ingenious. Give it plenty of time and stimulation, and it fills in the gaps on its own.
I saw in your eyes... that you can look for that in yourself. In your eyes there is a child... an innocence, so present within you. Why are you so long doing this with you. Let that child out! Give her life, she's screaming for help.
Here are the slots. This is the screen. The electrons start here. What happens? Well, obviously, the electron particle, it must pass through a slit and it must appear somewhere on the screen, but it has to be able to interfere with itself, there must be regions on the screen where there are no electrons,
(Word game) Woman, freedom, ruins, installation... Friday, no... gold coin, fossil... saint, coordinate... leopard. Mom, do you want me to live my life... tormented by guilt, regretting it?
It really sucks to be cheated, doesn't it? You're right, it does. I'm sorry, Case. I probably deserve it. The truth is, Rebecca was always honest with me about what she wanted, and I was the one trying to force her into a relationship she didn't want.
Aunt... I have never shown anyone the proof of my discovery. Actually... the film has not even been developed. I was obsessed with this new creature. I tried to catch her... while she jumped from branch to branch.
And these malachite veins, about 6,5OO years ago, were at the center of this breakthrough in human ingenuity. Like the gypsum in the crystal cave, these bands of malachite... were formed when hot fluids rose from the depths... and seeped between these rocks. But unlike gypsum, when malachite is heated... something special happens. It releases a metal. Copper. At the time, this copper axe could have been the pinnacle of their technology. For starters, it's heavy. If you hit something or someone with it, it leaves a mark.
Here's to you, buddy. All those things you hear about the end of life when you decide to commit are all true. But it's worth it. So, do you think it's too soon to ask her to go away for the weekend? Not if it's somewhere remote. That way she won't be able to escape.
Our understanding of the solar system began much closer to home. Looking down on us from above was our moon, with its regularly changing face, which first sparked our interest in worlds beyond our own. When we could look further out, we discovered that the solar system was full of moons, each invisibly connected by gravity to its parent planet. Our moon is a cold, geologically dead world, but the powerful link that exists between the gravity of another moon and its parent planet has done something amazing. It has brought life to this moon, making it the most violent place in the solar system.
But to be effective, that energy had to be released almost instantaneously. A slow reaction would produce a uranium flame, not a bomb. So the two sides concentrated their efforts on perfecting the key to a rapid release of energy on a large scale. A chain reaction. Imagine this ping pong ball is a neutron, flying in the direction of the unstable uranium core, a mousetrap. She triggers the mousetrap, which in turn launches a new neutron into the air.
We must rescue Boog before they make a tiny, little thing out of him with the rope of death! Come on! Yes! Wait! That fortress is penetrable. It's very hard to get into.
I came in third. Because you came after me. And then? I'm waiting... From up here, if I stretch my legs, - I can see the whole city... - And what does she look like?
I don't know what to do. Just tell people you're going to get supplies. They won't know the difference. No, I'm talking about Mrs. Davis' camera. Put it back in the drawer if it makes you feel so bad. It's not the camera she wants.
Has it all worked out? Stas is dead. Bad for Stas, good for us. The agency saves a little money and removes a known assassin from the high security threat list at the same time. Whatever that information was, it was worth killing for. What?
Yes. But something must have gone wrong with him because he called me that same night super sad that I didn't kiss him. She's been talking about this since the first day Mr. Wilkes started teaching. See? Even her best friend can testify that she set me up.
Ah, here is God! (Diana uses "Okami-san" instead of "okami-sama".) This is not a restaurant.... (Okami-san meaning "restaurant owner") Okay, I'll show you the right way to do praise. First, they throw money. Then, they ring the bell. She calls out to God.
Energy is the heartbeat of our civilization. The pursuit of energy has created and destroyed fortunes. It has elevated and toppled nations. And it has vastly transformed how we live our lives. But this relentless pursuit of more energy is of far greater importance than discovering what it can do for us.
If they exist, wormholes are smaller than atoms. If we want to pass through them, we need to stretch them and hold them open. Keeping a wormhole open can take a tremendous amount of energy, not the normal kind we know, but something called "negative energy." Negative energy is antigravitational. It repels the fabric of space and time, and could prevent gravity from collapsing a wormhole.
And what did your sergeant say to you? He told me to leave you alone. Jeremy. Look, if I've learned anything it's that life is precious... and it can be over in an instant so you have to make the most of it right now, we only have three weeks left to be together.
But along with the downsides come hidden benefits. As young Koreans grow up in their super-charged digital world they regularly top the world's education charts. I'm with the president of the Korean National Information Agency who says the breakthrough for Korean kids is not just because of the great education system but because from a very young age they interact and work together on the web. This generation is growing up with the web. They are growing up with it as part of their education system. What hopes and expectations do you have for them in the world when they grow up?
It provides the planet with heat and energy but also radiates us with deadly high energy particles. We will now navigate around No. 2 SURFACE OF THE SUN The surface of the Sun is rather chaotic. She is constantly boiling and bubbling.
It's outrageous that it's getting harder and harder... to have the newspaper at your door, not to go down and up if I want it. The same sentence every morning since the pier closed in 1982. This is the only time he leaves his apartment. It's the only conversation he wants to have. Do we poison old age, or does it bring us to our knees?
- What? Tell me about this matter. My sister is missing. The police have no leads. She's losing her breath in an oxygen chamber.
- It will remain undead. Like in a horror film, you kill her, bury her but she comes back from the grave. "Mother." Those are the real monsters. The ones who refuse to stay dead. And one night, when you're too tired to kill that thing, you let it kill you, so at least it's all over.
Will your true life, your true desires, your true self, perhaps be revealed to you? Come, the door of the convent will never be closed to you. The winter has already come and the unknown mother pushes me even more the sadness of the face that you are well loved, and following to us is a sadness that has no reason to be the well to do, I have told you, everything is fulfilled the whim of that continues to last us also equally that the richness of such a word, she is perfect, and perhaps you have it in yourself
Take it, Theo. It's heavy. Hot. Open your mind to the stone and you will feel the power of courage. And make it feel what you feel.
Who here has the right to vote? Who? Them! Do you know what a voter's anger is like? If she wakes up, she'll tear you to pieces!
What changes who started the war and who just wants to end it? Neither side is blameless. It takes two to fight. But isn't freedom something worth fighting for? But is it worth killing for?
Leave me alone! - We need a clear mind. - I need a beer. Just one. Careful she doesn't feel your breath.
I suspect that what the young, and now missing Alwyn Jones, saw in the river was Mr. Meyers' demonstration of the automaton. So the damn thing works. Apparently it does. But according to Prof. Dolomore's notes, his analytical machine wouldn't fit in this room, much less in the head of an automaton. And she couldn't work.
THE PAST ALWAYS ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL THE FUTURE Welcome to the second point. The established powers of the past... will always try to control the future. We received a note from the lawyer... accusing us of illegal activity with our computer. She was representing the recording industry.
Lori! David, who's there? What's wrong with her? Oh, she had some kind of adverse reaction to the dizziness and the pills and just... I don't know. She freaked out.
Books? You're going to have a lot of them at college. Jenny, maybe you need a trunk too, take your pick. Dad, why the sudden interest in vintage? I'm just helping the economy by rewarding my fantastic kids and also because it looks like the gallery was a great investment. It's worth three times what I paid for it.
- There was nothing. - I don't understand. Nothing blew up? That's the weird part. It was like a bomb but backwards. Get it? Instead of exploding, it drew everything on top of it.
(SNAP) Yes. And Doctor Goring, who was another combined effort? 'Elizabeth doesn't have the strength to lift a gun,' never mind that fire. There are plenty of rabbits in the meadow. Take one... (quietly) get on with it, woman!
Find the bag. Stop yelling at me. Where did you put it? Did you look under the table? Did it put itself there?
Thank you for not touching it. Okay, everybody. Can I have your attention? This interview is a fake. It never took place.
Good. Welcome to Cadillac Records. If you're around long enough, everybody gets one. Well, this old truck is mine. I don't own it.
Just pay me when you owe me. Sounds reasonable. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, kid. "I don't belong to her."
- and we'll try to get you to put it in... okay? - I can set you up on a date. - With who? - Are you interested? - Who is she?
That's okay. Letter writing sounds like a dangerous job. Why did you choose this profession? It doesn't choose her. She chose me.
Oh, Isolde, please! We must be practical too. Isolde is right. A violent death fractures the astral plane. She could lead us to the book.
Yes, of course I did. But the other day mom said you went out with her roommate. Oh, right. Is that her? Yeah, that's her.
They ignore them or change them. This valve supposedly blew out due to goal fatigue. Sure, sure... Not remotely, but let's grant this to Mama Nature. And how the hell did it close on its own?
We might need magic to make the antidote. But we can't. It's forbidden. Even if we could. I'll try to make it work without it.
Uther believes he has magical powers, and that makes him guilty. - Uther is wrong. - Do you believe that? What if magic isn't something you choose? What if she chooses you?
- Go away! Let go of me! - Jesus Christ, Greg, let her go! - Abby, we need this food. It's not worth fighting for.
Young people will abandon walking and ride things like this at night, downloading music for their iPod from their iReal. And these machines can talk to each other too. Let's say I want a coffee. Well, I can say to the machine, coffee. And then it will find the nearest coffee shop.
If the universe is stretched by the speed of light, what happens when an accelerator approaches the boundary? For us, light is simple uncomplicated. It is just a natural resource, through which we see the universe. But for science light is a strange and eccentric. Light is everywhere in our daily lives. but we are very little aware of it because it is so strange.
Come on. I heard some gunshots! Come on, honey, yeah. While we were trying to get into Times Square, my dad was trying to get through the traffic. Come on, people! My dad had the key to the city, but she couldn't open a traffic jam.
- What? Forever! I don't want you to stay alone. If you stay, the lawn mower won't work. She never mowed!
We have to find her before someone takes her. You'll have to go without me. What do you mean, "go without you?" - It's Tess. You owe her. - I didn't give the promicin to the world to join under the command of a 16-year-old boy.
I mean, it may be a great program, but... How can you operate on a patient who's screaming bloody murder? Right? You know, Olivia, it's only a matter of time before Julia leaves the gay side. You know, our private life is exactly that. Private. It's for us to know her and for you to have masturbatory fantasies about her.
The best moments of our lives. And the worst too. I loved this. You shouldn't have hidden this house from me for so long. Now it's yours too.
Something happens that causes a star to slow down some gravitational interaction and the other stars slow down because of what happened. And we get a traffic jam. So, galaxies form naturally out of these dense spiral-shaped waves. Two and a half million light-years away a menacing counterpart to our galaxy is standing still and flitting around casting a cautious glance toward the Milky Way. She is the dance partner of our galaxy our largest neighbor and our greatest nemesis.
Éden Log offers you its passport. ability to enter the circle, Éden Log counts you among its employees. the contract is fair. It is thanks to your service in the underground, that you will be able to build your paradise on the surface. Take care of the plant and it will take care of you.
Let me try a test with you. Don't worry, you have nothing to fear except more self-awareness. If you are healthy, the plant will try to contaminate you. this will sound an alarm and stop the transfusion. you need to withstand the liquid, it is as if she is trying to make contact.
But there is potential for fireworks, possibly by feeding the black holes at the centers of galaxies by matter falling into them, possibilities like that exist and so the only safe place to observe the process would be one of those gravitational tails that escape from the collision. Some scientists believe that Andromeda's larger supermassive black hole will eventually consume the Milky Way. The two black holes will spin in the center become a binary black hole, and eventually merge to become a larger supermassive black hole. A small galaxy colliding with a large one is very likely to be dominated by the larger galaxy. It will essentially have most of its material absorbed by the galaxy and be consumed by it.
While we're young, Bob. The bullet exploded inside. No over penetration. What did I tell you? We can take down a man in that crowd with this bullet and rest assured that she will only get the intended target.
Just a moment. - Sold! Reverend! - A very useful acquisition. I have learned that a house needs as many mirrors as there are daughters in it.
I was training a bunch of guys... all of a sudden, three whales came by. And I said, "Stop the training, let's go to the water's edge." All the guys... God, in the middle of the city, three whales... two brothers, Arpoador, so there's nothing more to say. She has several faces, she has several tribes.
I think I'm going to cry because this year is a strange Merry Christmas Could things get any worse? Stop yelling. It's what the bomb wants us to do. Let's do what she wants.
No, tell me. That hidden under that uniform, there's a beautiful butterfly! Take a pill. You're a restless sleeper. It's a new pill. - It's her!
You're going to say about that whore. Or call Officer Jennings. But not now. Not until what needs to happen happens. Be happy you've got that little cock she won't have.
Platoon 5 has been instructed to take baskets of pigeons. It is A-1 priority that they hold on to these until they reach the German trenches. McHUGH: What are they for, sir? When they reach the enemy trenches, you will drop your pigeon. She will fly back to Command and senior officers will be alerted that we have done our job. 2 minutes
I didn't like him last night. You have to tell him yourself. He won't listen to me. How many times have we tried with Roberta? I could set her up with a co-worker downtown. But the important thing is that she's convinced.
And the natural form of these invaders is not human. They are described in ancient accounts as serpents and dragons. And the weapon of men against them is the sword. Cutting off the tail, the serpent lives. Cut off the head, and it dies.
In rehearsals he looks straight at me. You're being paranoid. you're walking fast! She tilts her head, the newborn flower to smell, comparing it to the breath of Adonis, and says, within her lap she will reside.
To compare to the Beatles, which is the biggest band of the But from "Please Please Me" to "Let It Be", they're all good records. Nirvana was going that way too. Everything Nirvana already released is good. It's the same thing with all the great bands, but sometimes there's a great band that has a moment mainly if they have dazzling longevity, like 20 years they have some drawbacks.
What's this 'Central do Brasil' story? They're a rock band! What are those violins here?" Naturally we believed in the material, we believed in the band and it was true. You once said you were ashamed of "Tempo Perdido", because it was so similar to The Smiths.
I almost died. But he didn't. You killed him first. That's why I hate the rain. The stillness it brings.
With a raft, we go down the rapids to the meeting point where the super party will take place. On a 2, gentlemen. I'm sure it's a 2... or an 8. Where will you get the inflatable raft? One of us will jump with it in the backpack.
You'll never see them coming. Well, it's a truly amazing story. In every sense of the word. I should also mention that every one of my clones knows about Merlin's weapon and if any of them at any time, were captured by the Priors and if they somehow let slip that the SGC computer has the location of a lethal weapon for the Ori-- The Priors would not stop until they got hold of it.
- I have sinned too, Mother. - Oh, my God! That's Rolfe! - What the hell is wrong with you? Hey, I didn't start this war, but we're in it!
It is very kind. It went off once. Oh! Left tit. Cute. You know why she's marrying you, don't you?
I forgot how great she is and then I remembered. - Are you trying to get pregnant? - Yeah. Yeah, see? You don't want my dick. Yes. I want to get pregnant with it.
There will be kids watching us. we don't want people in the bleachers throwing up. I know we haven't rehearsed this for a long time. But the battle of Piper's Cove, Kentucky, in 1864 is special to me. It ended the plot by Quantrill's Confederate guerrillas to assassinate Lincoln and my great-great-grandfather was in it.
- Is she having spasms again? - Yes, but they are more violent. Is she taking medication? The voice is not an organic part of a human body. It comes from somewhere in the middle of our body.
The music that accompanies that great humanist finale, the overture to Wagner's opera "Lohengrin," is the same music we heard when Hitler was daydreaming about conquering the world, having a ball shaped like a globe. We can interpret that as the purest redemption of music: the same music that served evil purposes can be redeemed to serve good. Or we can interpret, and I believe it must be so, in a rather ambiguous way, that with music we can never be sure Insofar as it externalizes our inner passions, music is always a threat in potential.
"Could you take care of that?" etc. Obviously there is some kind of censorship here. We have on the one hand an emotionally involving film, but we have to stop before everything is shown, the sexual act, or we can see everything, but in this case we can't get emotionally involved That's the tragedy of pornography. It tries to be as realistic as possible, but it needs to maintain a minimum of fantasy support.
Because all you need is love. Black. This is where we all end up. You don't get to choose life. It chooses you.
¿Y? Just imagine everything smaller. and then I would open up the walls, reset the pillars and upgrade the electrical to current code. Damn, this house is all screwed up. You know, at night, it makes these weird noises like she's moving.
Wait a minute. Give him a second. He can't talk. He has a tube in his throat. He types the words into his computer and she reads the words for him and says the sentences for him.
He must know something. Then why didn't he say anything about us? He did. He said to stay away from me. You know how it is when an idea gets into Hopper's head. He can't get rid of it.
I am. Come on, sweetheart. I'm just worried about you, you know? You just said that... When Hopper gets an idea in his head, he can't get rid of it.
Many will drown in the strong waves. Most will inevitably die over the next 20 years. But those that survive, just like their mothers... will return to the same beach where they were born. We don't yet know how they find their way... across thousands of miles of open ocean. A frigate glides. Somewhere beneath the surface there's food for her.
No. I have created clients for myself, who give me money. In another city, I would have to start from scratch. I could not survive. I'll visit you in your room. If it's big enough, you could sleep in it too.
Who the hell do you think sent it? The invitation fairy? She said she sent you an invitation. I didn't know it was from her. I didn't know it was from you! Well, it was. Is she coming or isn't she?
I was the projectionist of a private exhibition in 1988, and those faces in that room.... Famous and beautiful people from all over Europe.... When I put the film on the projector I saw the same signs you described. When the screening started, I lost my nerves! There she was filming, right in front of me, I was too scared to watch.
There must be a solution to this. Lisa, can you look at your father? That's a good use of a genie, taking care of an idiot's head. That's the answer, Maggie is a real witch! She can reverse the spell!
Guilt will breed more violence and we've had enough Guilt won't take crime, drugs and fear off the streets and we've had enough. Guilt will not improve our schools, ...our families or our jobs. Guilt will rob us of those things and we've had enough. And so I ask you to reflect deeply with me today and find that compassion in your hearts. Because it will keep you on track. And we will walk together and we will work together.
If he senses that they are not well tied, he knows he still has a chance. He gets in the middle, pulling them apart. Gradually, he manages to separate his paws. He has been defeated. It will be the second, stronger male that fertilizes the female's eggs. So, mating on land is not random as it had long been in the sea. Now it is selective. A female springtail is larger than her male and she prefers mates who can give her sustained head thrusts.
By the time she is finished she will have laid several dozen of these taut, sticky vertical lines An ant approaches a circular spider web would never catch one of those she is a guide, leading a scouting party Searching under the plant support almost stumbling over the red back lines she struggles and seals her fate and her followers are after her
I was born with a technical malfunction as they say. I am narcoleptic and this is my story. So what is narcolepsy? The word narcolepsy appeared in 1880 from the Greek "narke" or numbness From it came words like narcotic, drug AND from the Greek "lepsi" or seizure.
And did this sudden marriage cause you any consternation? And why? Perhaps because your affairs were not in the perfect order - In which they should be. - What are you suggesting? She would have realised that when she took control on her return to England. And that prospect alarmed you, didn't it?
I screwed up. The key is under the damn mattress. But it's not there. It's much simpler. Where is it? He sleeps with it around his neck.
- What happened to you? I was helping a cripple up to the stands and she fell. It's just a sprain. At least it's real. Ah, awkward adolescence! We've all been there.
- What happened to you? I was helping a cripple up to the stands and she fell. It's just a sprain. At least it's real. Ah, awkward adolescence! We've all been there.
Ten years later, prepared for death, he crossed the ocean and returned once again to this country. But he had changed, he had become a completely different person. When I became acquainted with the martial arts of the Mainland, I realized the weakness of the martial arts I had learned until then here. There is a technique called Hakkei. With it you defeat your opponent, not with force, but with your internal ki.
Sméagol! Sméagol! Sam. And to you, Frodo Baggins, I give the light of Erendil, our most precious star. May it light you in the dark places when all other lights are extinguished.
I hope that the British Government will take sides with France and Russia without delay. Russia was convinced that Germany was provoking the war. On July 26, it called up its reservists. This was the second key phase of the crisis, as British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey warned on the 28th. From the moment the dispute ceased to be something only between Austria-Hungary and Serbia and another great power became involved it could only end in the greatest catastrophe ever to befall the European continent.
I could not have survived without them or built this ship to return home. Where is your home? Far away from here. My queen, this thing resists your attacks. If she survived us?
The trick to overcoming remorse is to have a plan: pick a room and make it your own Slowly walk through the house... Be polite, introduce yourself... So she can introduce herself to you
I'll get you a plate. The chicken is yours. You look very smart. Minus the downstairs. Instead of talking nonsense, go find a chair. If you can handle it.
Right next to it is the place dedicated to teachings and prayers. The high-ranking lamas preside. The Dalai Lama was to lead the teaching, but he was ill and was unable to participate for the first few days. We return to the stupa, a couple of hundred meters away. This column attracts pilgrims who believe that a healing force emanates from it.
- She doesn't love him. You can tell. - From here? The position of the body. She's not facing forward.
And here we begin to spread the warm tones of the skin over the green, so that it still appears in some areas. Of course now the background and the sky, in that wonderful blue, deep ultramarine sky. Mona Lisa. The painting stands out because it does not fade away as music does, as soon as it is created. She remains and maintains all the appearance of being alive, although in reality she is confined to a surface.
If only babies were born that men wanted the human race would have been wiped out long ago. I think you can't have a child if you can't give it anything. If my parents had thought about it, I wouldn't exist. And if I had thought about it, you wouldn't be here. Life goes on even if you don't think about it.
I will send a signal to Lo'Lah and then we will leave. We must destroy it Why? The mother plant is the key. She fertilizes the others, kill her... and no new Crystherium will grow here.
- Yessssss Have you ever heard of anything like a cow? A cow... You know? Let me think... yes. And do you know the liquor she gives off?
I need Katya's photo, where is it? In my pocket. It's right here. She's here.
There's something wrong with that. It doesn't do that. It's more like that. Yeah, well, that's very hard to explain. When the land goes around the earth, it attracts the water on the other side as well.
Ah, yes, if you want...! Who wrote this? The music, me. The lyrics... Whenever you want, Miss! She sleeps like a stone in the sun, like a silk necklace, until one day... she goes where you breathe, and grabs you and tears you apart, and there's nothing left in you.
Tell me! The wall! It ate my fingers! - What do you mean by "the wall"? - She ate my fingers in my dreams.
Never feed a pain without first feeding hatred. Pay attention: No one here is going to cry. Sadness has patience. It waits.
This is the picture of the man you must kill. If you bring me his head. The rest you can split or do whatever you want. I'm going to stand here looking at it... until I feel the rage entering me. And when she's all grown up...
Yes, by Marisa Gata Mansa, in 196O-61... it was a hit, in the "Beco das Garrafas". Only those who live in the favelas Recognize the charms that she has Recognize the charms that she has Looking at the moon, we see that she is beautiful
No, man, to assess the hypothesis of the brake problem. The dealership said that the car was in perfect condition. I could always say that the overhaul had been performed superficially. Ya! Then why didn't the door work? It was working when the Bagnozi arrived at the estate. She had to get out of the car.
She's beautiful! I'm getting married... to a girl from around here. Really? Who is she?
I warned you that I wasn't good at being whitelighter. But it's in you. It's half of you. The latent half. No, Paige, she's the reason you became a social worker.
I have it, and I've never been in a mine. But it's treatable. There is a drug. Pescaline. You can live normally on it... but they stole our shipment... from the train you were traveling on.
It's about believing in something. And letting that belief be real enough to change your life. It's about faith. Faith can't be fixed. River. It fixes you.
I have it, and I've never been in a mine. But it's treatable. There is a drug. Pescaline. You can live normally on it... but they stole our shipment... from the train you were traveling on.
Hey, what are you doing? They may have won this time, but I'll be back. What do we do now? Well, I have another idea on how to destroy the world. I thought it would be too horrible to talk about, but you leave me no choice.
Maybe later. I have things to do first. - About the weird girl who came to the house? - Glory. And no, not about her.
Not the knife. I learned at the CIA. Culinary Institute of America. Tell me, Mr. Grissom, why does a man choose death as a profession? She chose me.
How did it go? Well, I guess-- I think they really liked the idea. I think... I think they want to do the show. Aren't you gonna ask me how my date went? Yeah, the psychic. How did it go with her?
It will be a bit difficult to enjoy all this, floating in a comatose state, in a tank of sensory depravity. Ha ha, bravo. Yes? We have detected a portal signal coming out, right now, from the Church of St. Mary's. Where is she now?
Bernard deposited at least $1 million into our account. - From your art business? RSL GALLERY MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14 This report is not reliable. The radiation test doesn't lie. Americans are impressed with science but it is as mythical as religion.
Because of their size, the adults can survive without water for several days, but the young, being very small, have fewer reserves to draw on and are becoming dangerously weak. The nights are cooler and better weather for them is moving around, so every evening they go out in search of water. Other Indricotheres do not have the same luck, and tonight the pair joins an old female. Indricotheres can easily reach eighty years of age, and that longevity gives them a unique knowledge of their environment. If there is water nearby, the pair bets that the old female will know how to find it.
This sweet is delicious. Convent pastry. If you are interested, our cook will give you the recipe. Cooking is not my strength. Oh, princess, she is, on the contrary, my weakness.
- All quiet out there? - ahh, yes! ...save me a drink. I apologize for the quality of the food, we have been saving supplies for years in case of an emergency so at first we had no problems but now, nothing is coming in or going out. Even when the pantry was full there was nothing in it that the intruder would prefer to eat us... this is my daughter...
Have you ever woken up... and felt like everything in your life was wrong? I woke up one day last month...and I know it's kind of silly because housewives...sorry, they call us "domestic managers" now...shouldn't have existential crises. I think housewives always suffer from existential crises. Well, I found out that my husband was sleeping with another woman. And he had been dating her for over a year.
Get that gun out of my face! You bastard! I forgot how fast you are. My warrior woman. She almost rips my head off, pushing my mouth against hers so hard it hurts.
- Yes, and... and he's also looking for... - No! Not searching. Inspiration will not find you. She will find you.
I don't know. I just want you to tell me one thing. Do you think about him when you fuck me? Chastity is the rose of virtues. It makes men and women like angels.
If it were a ring where would it be? Well, this is fun but it's going to get boring fast. Most living, breathing things hate the night and love the light. We're different, aren't we? We hate daylight and it hates us out of politeness.
Do you speak German? Then you had no idea what I was saying. But he seemed to understand every word I said. What we can't figure out is where the letter is, Todd. Do you have any idea what happened to it?
- How have you been? - Well, I got divorced. Wow. I'm living on alimony. That's her.
Maybe she was killed on shore. The boy said she got off the boat. Maybe she never came back. - Someone killed her on the shore. - But who? With her on the shore it could have been anyone.
No wonder I loved that Barbara Streisand. Who is she? That very old woman who wishes she was 45. You should see her nose. You can land planes on it.
There were clue errors. No one ordered you to check them. I thought it was a wise precaution, in case we saw an enemy ship. Your initiative pleases me. Gammas lack it.
Before leaving he did not complain of new symptoms, but my scanner still detected strange synaptic potentials. I was hoping that the problem would resolve itself. It hasn't. Can't you do anything? I will try neuropolar induction. But it is a very serious operation and I would prefer not to resort to it unless necessary.
I even prefer them to natural light. They make every object stand out. You will find the deep shadows that still live in my paintings, because they were painted at night. The paint is much stronger than me. It makes me do what it wants.
And I have things to do. I can't get enough of this song. She gets sick of you. I love it. In Algeria everyone cried with her.
I was absolutely perplexed. Perplexed would be the more accurate word. I was certainly sad but, you see, it was so sudden and I couldn't make sense of it all. Taniyama-Shimura continued to become one of the great unproven conjectures. But what did she have to do with Fermat's last theorem?
- Look- - I have a lot of tidying up to do. And it's time to get started. And then what? Then, when Kosh's belongings are loaded on her ship... she will activate herself.
Solomon was excited about the deal he made this morning. I forgot to tell him. -It's a waste of time. -But not ours. The GDC is going to try to get the votes and if they don't get them, we move forward with a less rigid bill and if she passes.
Tear that house down, Hercules. You can do it. Why not leave it standing? Find a better use for it. Make something in it that will be a source of pride for the town.
Heck. Man, he hasn't done anything to her yet. Geez. I'm sure the soul exists in a microscopic gland located somewhere in the spine. It is the last thing to die and with it disappears the life force days after conventional death.
- What would this be for? - You work for our government. I'm an old man now. History bores me. Why did she run away from you?
But the next day, some boys from the reserve told us that they had seen buzzards flying over the quarry where Eric had found the men. The buzzard is a cowardly bird. It doesn't fight for its prey, it lets others kill it. When I see them circling over the desert, it means that someone has died and they are looking for their bones. Or that death is near and they are waiting for it to do their homework for them.
You know, speaking of human ignorance, I always assumed that this hacienda that you are going to sell belonged to Sonya. If you allow me, as my late father bought this hacienda for me to pass, even though I am ignorant of the law... from my sister to Sonya, to whom it belongs. Of course. Who denies it? Of course, it belongs to Sonya. And without her consent, one would not think of selling it and for her benefit it must be sold.
As long as he is alive, they will dare more and more every day. Send him away. I do not intend to make a martyr of him. I have been told of a certain sea serpent that has a very singular method of attracting prey. It lies on the bottom, pretending to be wounded. Her enemies may approach her, but she does not move.
I do not intend to make a martyr of him. I have been told of a certain sea serpent that has a very unique method of attracting prey. It lies on the bottom, pretending to be wounded. Her enemies may approach her but she does not move. Then they may start nibbling at her but she doesn't move.
Don't go. What, did we lose the signal? No. No, there's no light source. We're seeing what he sees.
Stop anyone who gets in our way. Strand. Dr. Strand? We should let nature take its course. If the baby's upside down, he and the mother die.
I screwed up a project and got disqualified from the competition. Oh, Tommy. I'm so sorry about that. But Miss Hadley wants to see my project. But I don't know if he's ready.
Just let him go home. Just let him go home. - What's going on? Nothing. - Nothing. We're running out of time. Okay, I'm taking you to the memory of death. I'm back where Parsons was in his cell. Miller's with him.
Him... Your friend. What's his name? Ted. He's Ted, right?
I will let you know when I have done so. Captain, my research theorizes that fringe singularities can pass through realities and move from one universe to another. Spock, what do the logs show? They're encrypted. But from what we've managed to decipher it appears the Defiant discovered this so-called "black hole" as he traveled into our reality.
I want you to help me save my son. Tell me how! Please, hey, listen! Hey, look. He's my flesh and blood.
Dare I ask why? Because he has proven incapable of keeping that appendage in his pants every time a pretty maiden comes within reach. The last one is Agustine. Tell us, Madame Fraser, what do English ladies call the male member? Well, I've... heard it referred to as a 'cock'.
I want to be the solution to something. You know what this is? A tomato. First, it was a seed. Take care of a garden, and then it will take care of you.
Protection. Never leave the circle, until you are safe. I know what attacked you at home. Your daughter is being hunted by a parasite. He wants to feed on her.
Do you know where he is? No. I don't even have his cell phone number. He must be upset that I'm so invasive. You think it was his fault, the fire? One thing's for sure, he didn't set it by himself.
But that's not what's important. What about the baby? - Is the baby okay? - Yeah, the baby's fine. But, Darren, the baby's not yours.
A unique opportunity presented itself. The almost impenetrable country opened its doors to a joint program of scientists formed by North Korean and Cambridge University volcanologists. So we were invited to film here. But everything we saw looked like a performance, and we accepted it. The only way to get to know this enigmatic country is to see it as it wants to be seen.
And when we are done, there will be no more war. No more pain. Especially now that we are together. It's time for us to take this planet back. Make it the home the Inhumans have always deserved.
It's the only way I'm going to learn. In fact, I came to work early, which is literally the opposite of going rogue. What's in the file, G? Why are you doing this one thing? Is it one thing? It's not a thing, but you're making it one.
That ship sailed long ago, you had your chance. I want Bulgaria. That job is booked. My man is already in the field. Who is he?
He was sitting with his grandson, rocking him to sleep, feeding him. You should have seen his face, right? -Did he look like that? -No. -It wasn't this guy? -No, it wasn't him. -Take a good look, it must be him.
-Did it look like that? -No. -It wasn't this guy? -No, it wasn't him. -See it well, it must be him. -I saw him. It wasn't him. It wasn't him.
-imaná! It's good to be honest, but there's a limit to everything. -Ah, what a paradox! May the day of the Lord's resurrection be the day we bury this people. And well buried, there is nothing more we can do for them.
- Are we invisible to the faction? - And to the director. You won't be able to send a messenger or a conscience here. When the director is online, we will be able to turn off the defenses. Then he will either come to the 21st century or stay where he is.
Most bats use their wings to hunt insects, but here they are so scarce that this bat must use other methods. It has to hunt on land. But what really sets it apart is its prey... a lurking death scorpion. The venom of this species is potent enough to kill a human. To confront it seems insane for a bat weighing a mere 15 grams.
The kid said 15 years, if he's well taken care of. 15 years...? Until 2014. Give or take. We'll be pushing 40, when he dies.
We can't go in for the next two days. We can't go in for the next 2 days. Why? Why? Because as soon as a turkey opens his eyes, he looks at his mother.
In a long-forgotten box deep in the archives of the British Museum, and I can't think of anyone who has seen it in years. In the 11th century, a Carthusian monk only known to us as Brother Gregory began to lose his sanity. He said he had been possessed by a demon, perhaps the father of all demons, the Fallen Angel himself. However, this demon spoke to him in "Verbis Diablo". Brother Gregory wrote down what he said in whatever he could get his hands on.
Let's go. It's time to complete your education. I've already given you your chance. The world is a cruel place, professor. He laughed at her pain.
It's not just the mountain ash that keeps the building safe. It is electromagnetic energy. Eichen is built at the convergence of telluric currents. ley lines. That's what allows to keep certain supernatural creatures in it.
But Mom would have done anything to protect us. That is what I will tell Mirra tomorrow, I hope she understands. Today's service will begin with the message to the Galatians on the freedom of the spirit. In it he says that we will not become hostages of recent events but everything against:
I overcame the issue of pride, it is one of the seven deadly sins. You know... I'm not afraid to ask for help or ask anyone. I don't need to have my back... but my front and sides. Alcoholism has no friends. It wants to kill you, it wants to kill you, it wants to kill him, it wants to kill everyone who engages in it.
Show me that book, show me that book if it exists! My rotten, no-good, bastard father... foolishly insisted on delivering the Raven King's Book to a man in Derbyshire Hills, the last man in England who could read the king's letters. Unfortunately, during a trip, he became involved in a drinking contest with a blacksmith in Sheffield and when he challenged him, proceeded to eat the book. Four years later, I was born...with it written all over my little body.
Why do you say that? I love you, and you love me. I love chocolate, but it's bad for me, so I don't eat it. Are you comparing me to chocolate? He has calories, you have woman.
Bledsoe was right. If we run, Dad will come after us again. The only way to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else is for us to go after him. When that son of a bitch shows his face, I'll make him wish he'd stayed in hell. Yeah, the world is a tough place to face him alone, but it's like what that prison guard said.
- What are you doing? - I'm writing a new book. - ¿Y? - Completely crazy. It describes waking up in modern Berlin.
Are you ok? Yes. - What happened? It was just a stray dog. - It was just a stray dog. I think he was more afraid of me than I was of him. I tried to take him and stuff, but he had other ideas.
I think you should leave the house. Why are you doing this? You are in no condition to leave. Think of the baby. Preacher James, this is Robert. My brother.
What is this? This... is the Silver Angel. How do you do? Now, are we going to talk or drive? I don't feel like I'm playing the violin as much as he's playing me.
- Just listen, please I saw something in the car Candyman and it's going to sound crazy, okay? - But I know what I saw - Ok There was a cooler on the passenger seat He had a brain in it
The two met at the club. He used to study in America. He had his nose pierced. He wore a nose ring. What did he look like?
It can smooth and shape the hair. I think it will come in handy. I have never changed my hairstyle. Can I hold it? Is it heavy, in't it?
Great. It's good that you came so quickly. It's about Djupvik. He's being investigated for the Birkeland case. He has to get back to work.
He called Maja from a hotel in Murmansk. From that number. - What do you think it means? - What you're saying. - He was probably in Russia.
All he needs to do is sell the idea to the rest of the Mafia. After seven months in exile, Lucky Luciano secretly leaves Italy... and heads for a country that has become a Mafia paradise... and is only 140 kilometers from America.... Cuba. Meyer Lansky's association with the Cuban government allows all the Mafiosi to operate without interference, making it the perfect place for Luciano to make his reappearance.
Husband's been found halfway down the hill, Tao. Really? Interesting. Any witnesses? Another vehicle like this was about 50 yards behind the curve and a small production crew was about the same distance behind it, but not close enough to see the car when it went over the edge.
I was afraid that... when you changed... you'd have fangs and demon horns. But you're still my brother. Your brother the monster. It was the cop. It had to be him.
-Evil will befall them all. Noah is not here. Sorry, the book wasn't acting fast enough. -It's not working Roni! -It's trying to resist. The more you try the more it tries to get out of it to come at you.
It's as if we were from different species. The human body is very interesting! Especially the female bust - it has such a complex and strange shape! And yet, it's so beautiful to be able to make something that fits it perfectly.
Seeing you yesterday at the auction seemed rotten. We didn't start it. No, but it does not make you understand. If you have done yoursel f as a parent have ... I hope I should be sorry. He can't help thinking he's a public benefactor. And we can't help thinking he's a pig. Oh, I'm sorry. If survival of the fittest is right ... he may be the fittest, but he's not going to survive.
If it weren't for him. I'm afraid he'll never forgive me. It's such a shame for him. Being in love with him I feel worse than anything I've ever felt before, and that's saying quite a lot. Tears. Look, Dad. He just shouldn't find out. But he's bound to go on, because he knows there's something.
This is known in professional terms as "Ma Er Duo Luo". The putrefaction that the possessed emits. You know he jumped off the roof. Multiple suicide attempts. He even talks about suicide. In the end, he was discovered and tried to escape.
"Jung Kwan, Jung Ryo..." What is that? It's a record of Taejong, the greatest monarch of the Tang Dynasty. What is this complex text doing here? It's him, One Arm.
is cold, but it is an eternal cycle of change. When the sun returns to the Arctic in the spring, the greatest seasonal change on Earth begins. The change governs the life of the only hunter in the sea ice world. The polar bear depends entirely on the ice to hunt. He needs to consume 2/3 of the food needed for an entire year during the next 3 months before the sun melts the ice beneath his feet.
Jamie has no way to get on the ice with the boat, so I move with snowmobile to the bears with the film for the first time. Rolf did not have to go far. Polar bears are one of the few animals on Earth that come to meet us. Crazy! He comes our way.
Ban Ban. Why does he look different? He has been hungry. He will recover in two days. He doesn't recognize me.
Finally, Darren explores new photographic techniques in the waters off Papua New Guinea venturing into the depths of WWII history in the darkest hours of the ocean. THROUGH THE EYES OF THE NARRATOR I was fortunate to spend the last 30 years of my life capturing and sharing the wonders of this planet. Of all that I have photographed, the ocean is my favorite. It is my love, it is my passion. The way the light bounces off it, the animals that inhabit it.
What do you look for in a man? I don't know. Whatever you think is best. Well, the best is what your heart desires. What does he desire?
The talisman is losing power! They're fighting back! I'll get it! The original spell is in my phone. If we cast it again, it will undo itself.
- We are... - We're sorry. We know we screwed up, and we're going to fix it. I see that you do. I obviously have a lot of hate, but I'm trying to get rid of it, because it's toxic.
- I'm so going to miss you. - Promise me it's not your problem! three 00:00:08,461 -- 00:00:12,007 My God! La Jolla is leaving for the weekend, and no trip around the world. Father, we'll spoil the moment. I have phone cards. - Thousands minutes on it, I think that's enough?
That's why he wants Leah. He wants her soul. No, no. Demons can't take souls, Mia. A soul has to be offered to the demon before he possesses it.
Who's Moses? Just before I got punched, I heard someone say, "You're up, Moses." Yeah? Was it the tall guy who punched you? Yes, yes, it was him.
Hey Arjun, what are you thinking? Tiny drops of water, fill the ocean. Tiny grains of sand, the earth. Moment by moment, time collects age. Don't you dare call this moment small, he is the creator of everything.
It took us almost two hours to get here. Same if you had driven yourself. We passed another forest reserve and a lot of space on the way. There are plenty of places to leave them, why leave all three here? It's out of the way. That's good for him.
.. I woke up this morning and couldn't find my pants. I know that feeling. Yeah, very funny. And I realized - I never know where things are. Either you control the environment or it controls you.
And that she was cleaning up, for forensics. She's worried because he gave her a tumble and now he's run off. He's run off? You must be fucking kidding me, I need him. Don't look at me. I haven't gone near him. I don't even know him.
It's Thea. I found this. Partial plate three blocks from downtown. Car's registered to Slade Wilson, and it's got GPS. Where is he now?
Landmines? What kind of island is this? Can the explosive be removed? Certainly. Without him leaving, eh.
Okay, I think I got it. "Monty the Magnificent. Fort Greene Theater." Is that our guy? He's not exactly hiding.
Okay, give us a minute, please. - What have we got? - Anybody got anything? - You got anything? - I have a file for him.
I didn't want to say it, not unless it was necessary. I wanted you to be able to choose your own destiny. What can you know of my destiny? Glinda is the keeper of the Book of Chronicles. In it are the chronicles of Oz's past, present and future.
-He's diving. -Okay, how's that? That's better. No, that side needs to go up. Pull on it and squeeze it, squeeze as hard as you can.
Your new pet, if you're lucky. - It needs a temporary home. - Oh, no. But he's a good dog. He has VIP access... to places you wouldn't normally have without him, like getting into Barney's Sale Warehouse first.
How about oil catching fire in the middle of the Fourth of July Parade? I stop the car at a car wash, put out the flames, and I'm still in time for the "1812 Overture." So you're saying this is a death trap. No, I'm saying this car is indestructible. After the apocalypse, it, my mother and the cockroaches will be the only things that survive.
Dante is not identified in the video. And it is seen that he is not the one taking the money. That is, in this horrible video. Hey, it's from a VHS saved two decades ago. I did a lot of work on it.
I'm not easily distracted by a pretty face. See. So you're the fortune teller? I didn't choose the gift. He chose me.
I registered the pass to Ballistics on Friday. I logged your return yesterday. I don't doubt you. We just need to see you. It's Tom. It's got to be him.
Thanks. Come on, man! What's the matter with you? The mosaic effect... You can see through it! Can you blur it any more?
Not that kind of hungry. I wouldn't answer. I think it's time we talked. You took my baby away from me? We thought we could lessen the danger with him under our control.
The vortex will open here again, but not for a billion years. When then? In 74 hours. Three days. Days to think of something new because he now knows what to expect, Now that he has scanned me and will kill me on sight, thank you Gim here.
- Aaron Scobie. - Who? Aaron Scobie. Prior. Carl. We got a name. He's an older guy Taylor had a crush on.
This morning, before Cara. It doesn't make any sense. I know it doesn't. He's working on a new victim profile. Maybe he'll give us something.
- Aaron Scobie. - Who? Aaron Scobie. Prior. Carl. We got a name. He's an older guy Taylor had a crush on.
As I was saying, Adam stole the fruit from the Tree of God in Eden. Now, when you steal something, you have to give it back. But how could he do that? Adam had already eaten it. It was inside him and it was already part of him.
I need reinforcements at the Hudson River coal plant. There's the briefcase. What's in it? Some kind of antique object. Must be valuable if it was worth killing for.
Thank you, Mom. You are the best. I hope my baby feels the way I feel about you. I'm sure he will. But what if I don't love my baby as much as he loves me?
No devil worshippers applicant! - Come on in. Is your appearance really a guinea worth a square? Gentlemen, it sounds a bit cumbersome. He's no Beethoven.
I think it has something to do with Ruby's prophecy? That is... It is probable that not even the guardians of the lodge know what it is about. Well... Maybe the encounter with that mysterious count will shed some light on this. Lucy said he's dangerous.
What Hanna means is that we have good news. They found a body in the woods. The police think it was someone who was camping. It was Toby. No, Spence, it wasn't him.
Ezra is taking on big responsibilities. And he needs a job. The rangers found a body. It was Toby. No, Spence, it wasn't him.
You guys are nuts. I've never been to this place before. Not according to your cell phone. Then stop my cell phone. Maybe he was here, but I wasn't.
It's like I'm a part of it now. Trust me, you don't want to be a part of it. And was that the guy who got off the bus, was that the guy you were talking about? - It doesn't matter. - Was it him?
Let's do it. The government has made an agreement with Svend Age Saltum. It's done. Which is not to say it's a good deal. And not at all acceptable to him.
The whole thing is screwed up,held subway by some major hooligan soccer leagues. It's all starting in the middle of the block. - What do you mean? - Multiple witness statements, all have confirmed large groups of people entering the place where Joey was the night before. I put the money on it, it's one of the best subway.
The adults return. But the crickets confront them. Dripping their own foul-tasting blood from their eyes. The cricket is still alive, but the stench of its blood attracts the attention of others. Now, HE is the target.
That is so hot. I could sue you even so hot is coffee. Besides that she fancies herself a DJ, Marisa bakes too. It looks like the whole package. He is so hot!
Now you're going through my stuff? You said you got rid of it. You said you wanted a fresh start. You lied. I'd love to forget the past... but he's not going to forget about me.
Khabur River. According to the Hebrew Bible, it was here, in the 6th century B.C., that divine beings came down from heaven and made contact with a 30-year-old Hebrew priest named Ezekiel. Ezekiel stood by the river Jabur and said that a great whirlwind came toward him. He described it as a fire coiling in on itself, and out of the fire came the color amber, which is a Hebrew term meaning "polished spectrum of metal," implying that it was metallic, and it spun and landed in front of him,
Don't even try, Klaus. Enough! My leg is broken! Stan, you can do it! Listen to my body. It knows what to do.
Laceration to the hallucis longus. Whatever he did took a splinter out of his shin bone, so we're talking about an impact of some force. But... here's the thing. Fragment of the trouser recovered from inside the wound. The sharp-eyed among you will notice that it shows no signs of the fire, which means it went into the flesh... before the fire got a hold of it.
Are you suggesting that I had something to do with this? The incident occurred shortly after the discussion. I repeat, what was the subject of the argument? I saw her with another man this afternoon on the pier. Who was he?
- Why are we preparing? - The first ones in space will be the Americans! - The rocket launch is scheduled for March, but it is not a fact that it will happen. - And then, it will be a sub-orbital flight! - It won't last more than 15 minutes!
I'm not gonna let you ruin me like you did Anne. I didn't ruin anyone. What, you think Anne was better off before? Sure, she wasn't clean or refined, she didn't wear your computer cable as a belt, but she loved her life, openly, freely, unashamedly. You ripped the horn off the unicorn, Ryan, because you wanted to make him a normal horse, but he'll never be a normal horse, because now he has that circular scab on his forehead.
- Guys, guys, he's with me. I told you to stay in the car. Yet, as you know, I am insane and consequently immune to simple commands. What the hell are you doing? The bird, he brought me here.
It comes from this matter. The relationship between mental life and the thing that produces it is interactive. A metaphor that helps to think about this is the difference between hardware/software. Computer hardware is nothing. It just sits there unless there is software, and then it makes the computer hardware work to produce the function.
Mr. McVeigh, hi. Do you have a minute? Yeah, what can I do for you? My analysis of the .38 caliber. We have other evidence. The first time I examined the firing mechanism it was easy to access, there was no need to disassemble it.
And mine. The first book I wrote for him earned me his trust and an office in the management. The second one I finished with a phrase he used to repeat: "Money is a dog that doesn't ask for caresses. You throw him the ball farther and farther and he brings it back without stopping".
Why, you want to play a few shots? How about a picture? Come on. That speech was the last of your career. I'm proud of him, Lesley.
You need a container. For the child to be born. A pure one. Like you. - Wait a minute. What child? A child that will grow inside you. Soon. He chose you, my dear.
They were careful to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight they killed Osama bin Laden and took his body into custody. Good job. Susan, get me the Arabian Ambassador on the phone please. He's on line 1, sir.
Me? Snow White is about to give birth to a baby girl... a girl who will save us all when she reaches the age of 28... but only if she is protected from the powerful effects of the curse. But how can I protect the baby? There is an enchanted tree, similar to the one you used to carve Pinocchio. If you build a vessel out of it, it can protect the baby from the queen's magic.
And then, "Going down a dusty Georgian side road I wander." Georgia? So we have Amsterdam, then Georgia, the tallest building in the world not so much, really. Well, what I heard and the story differs a lot... and there are people with different versions, but what I understand is that... he hadn't played live for a long time. And a promoter got him a gig so he expected it to be a great show. And of course, the show didn't turn out to be what he expected...
I mean, you can buy a paper clip at any stationery store. It's a fitting equivalent to the original murder weapon, yet it provides a bit of mystery to the profile of today's killer. He wants to be noticed. His priority was to make the body look like an exact replica of the earlier crime. Him? His? Is it definitely a man?
I mean, people only look at the sex. They think it's the point of everything. Why was that? Because you can't sleep with her. And that's where you come in, son. He resists and you're my son and I trust you.
It will mean the destruction of a major public works program. What's the big deal? The site is a dumping ground. This park keeps inner city dogs off the streets. They depend on this park for the programs and services it provides,
I spent my whole life in the ocean, and I firmly believe that water is just empty space, because it's the only thing I know. And then one day, I realize that this emptiness is actually a substance. And since I am an interested and curious fish, I discover that besides the water, in which I am submerged, there is a solid phase... ice, and there is also steam. Then I would start to worry... if one day the water would freeze and I would die from it. In exactly the same way we are looking at our space, realizing that it too could freeze and kill us all.
You are not in charge. There I say: "Graduate, it is not easy for anyone, I have! He went to the hospital, you know? He had an accident. They say it was serious. For me, he's into drugs.
You see love the wrong way You can't recognize it So look with your heart And not with your eyes The heart understands The heart never lies Believe in what it feels And trust what it shows you
The heart cannot be fooled It is very intelligent Forget what you think Ignore what you hear Watch with your heart, it sees things clearly
I believe in science. And I did not believe in anything, which could not be proven by science. But I am realizing that there are things that cannot be explained by science. Many diseases, too, cannot be cured by science. Right now, I have no idea how to find Shouwu's spirit. You said he could communicate with us.
"And the lonely streets... of my heart..." "Are now... a hotbed of sensations." "Yes, they are." "I'll walk this road." "All my dreams are lodged in it."
Does the castle not surrender? Sire, the castle is armed regally against your access. Regally? Why? There is no king in it.
Royally? Why? There is no king in it. Yes, my lord. In it there is a king.
Well, well done, for the lifetime achievement award and, of course and above all, well done on that lap. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex James. Thank you. Now, in a moment we're going to find out which of these... the €36,000 Morgan trike, the €48,000 Caterham R500 or the €60,000 KTM X-Box... is the most compelling race weekend car. The thing is, if you're going to spend a lot of money on a car you'll want to do something else with it.
These toxins are causing damage that they did not cause before, because they are surrounded by fat. So, as long as you assimilate more toxins than you eliminate your body is not going to allow you to burn fat because burning fat adds more toxins to your body. You have to respond to the fact that you are being attacked by toxins before your body will allow you to burn fat. The body just wants to heal itself, that's what it wants. It wants to detoxify naturally and only the body can detoxify itself but that is not possible if more and more toxins are coming in.
And then close your eyes. Go to yourself, feel yourself, imagine yourself being in that body. Imagine yourself walking on the beach with that body. However you do it, you must do it, when your mind is calm, powerful and relaxed, your subconscious understands. He understands that he doesn't need to be fat, that he got confused by the stress. He doesn't know what to do with the stress of our modern life.
I don't think he did it for money. I want you to stay with the officer. I need a minute, already? Boss, they just sent a video of the Senator to Charlotte. He was pretty roughed up.
Take it off. Let's end this right here and now. Don't be afraid of this little doll. You control him. He does not control you.
"Anthony, it's 40 on the road. "And then she knows that I'm thinking about other universes. He believes there may be other universes because of the process that created ours. It's called inflation. It describes an exponential expansion in the moments after the Big Bang, at a speed the universe never repeated again.
- Yes. You are the most beautiful person in the world, Luis... then I will give it to you. Lift up your shirt. Close your eyes. He no longer sings for me, only for you now.
But like I said, Sam's an artist, and at the end of the day...he really turns me on. Have guys ever gotten boners when they're fighting with you? Shut up, Puckerman-- we're here to talk business. I'm sorry about that. Okay, I want to do a number for the choir. He's my first step to my master plan.
- Good job, Hermes. Fine print magic. Okay, but good luck making a men's calendar with only two female employees. Oh, husband, I'm so excited about this new job! And he's excited about you, LaBarbara.
All right, CK, there's some kind of unwritten agreement about dating another gang's ex-girlfriends, right? Yeah. $12,000 for your car? How'd you get that number? That's what I paid for it.
I do my job That's when I got the message What message? He would not let them live He said he would kill them all, if I don't do what he wants me to do
Did I mention she's a famous actress? She still sucks. Every night, I sing love songs. And then I sit on my bus and write love songs. And the only thing I really know about love is that you can't know anything about it. And now I should go before my heart is broken to pieces by that "I'm so in love with her" look.
Nothing. He stole from the poker game. The hotel doesn't want another shooting, and if he gets out, Hugo's game will be ruined. I make more money in one night running this game than I make in a week working in this dump. And if the police recover the money, we lose the rights to it because it's part of an illegal activity.
But even more magnificent is the sheer scale of the gravitational embrace. It holds together galaxies hundreds of billions of kilometers apart and, in doing so, creates the most magnificent structures. Our own Milky Way is part of one of them, the Virgo cluster. Each point of light in this image is not a star, but a galaxy. There are 2,000 galaxies in this cluster, and they are all held together by gravity, making it the largest structure in our intergalactic neighborhood.
The big problem with quantum mechanics is that the tiny particles we are made of can be in multiple places at once but I am made of tiny particles and you never see me in two places at once, so what happens? Max believes that the mathematics of quantum theory is telling us something extraordinary. Whenever the equations say that this ball is in many places at once, what it really means is that our reality is branched into multiple universes in which the ball is in a definite place. According to his theory, when the photon of light faces the two slits it does not split into two. He splits the world in two.
- Nelson, no. There are things you don't know, Rose, about me, about this job. - I'm not worthy... - Nelson, you're not responsible for the evils in the world. You're the one who's trying to make it a better place.
Kevin, did you practice piano today? I've had enough of piano. What are you talking about? The bat was hurt, so I helped him recover. I tried to let him go, but he kept coming back.
I would not like to end up like De Quinsey, ingesting ten grams a day. Tell Dad he is right not to understand my letters, because I try to reread them after they are written and I understand little of what I meant. Thomas De Quincey. "Memoirs of an English Opium-Eater" . I adored that book. He begins like this:
- Can you get it for us? Of course, but it comes at a price. How much? You see this eye, sir? He doesn't see you.
Which brings us back to you being wrong. Hey, why am I the one who's wrong? Because the other person is me. Okay, well, I'll tell you what. Hair never lies, so let him decide.
Just a small nuisance, regarding his sister. The watchmen received the itinerary at the last moment. And you were the only one who knew that the gold would be delivered to your house. Listen to me carefully. In two minutes that door is going to open and he's going to come in.
Hydrogen has a proton, and therefore it has an electron there in its lowest energy level. Again, it has a space there. I'd like to fill that in as well. So what happens, when I give it a helping hand with this ferrule, is that the hydrogen is forced to react with the oxygen. It's energetically favorable for it to share its electrons.
What is this? - It's called a robot. - A robot? It was abandoned in the attic of the museum. What does it do?
Mama Juana was my assistant. We were very successful, we filled the theater. I was always surrounded by machines in my workshop, where I invented new illusions. Once I built a robot. It was a particular treasure I put my heart and soul into it.
And with that, Tatagami marched off to his destination. I don't understand. You can defeat any enemy as long as you can tear him to pieces, bit by bit. Wahle has a solid game, and we need to redevelop yours, perfect every aspect of it as much as possible.
Yes, but it was me who arrested him the first time. One day our social worker saw him with my father and asked, who is he, and I said I didn't know him. My own brother. So what, you make a mistake and he stays with us forever?
Pow! I've been "Lem-ing". Hey, who's that laid-back, approachable guy? Is that Ted? Yeah, that's him.
Like a leaf on the road. This is but a gentle detour on my path. This is nothing more than a gentle detour on my path. I didn't choose my dream, ma... ...he chose me.
We cover Fitch and Gordon. An unidentified helicopter approaching ours. - I see it to starboard. - Fitch, get out of there! He can't hear us.
There is significant focal tenderness. Colin, we will do a CT scan, to determine the cause of the pain. As promised, here is the status sheet from the accident scene. Thank you. On it is recorded where all your boys were taken.
- So if we can stay solid. - We'll match the game. - We'll match them. Wait, look who it is. I thought it was my driver. We told him to follow us. - That's our cab driver! - Oh, is that him?
Maybe it was an ad they put in a file. Something like, "We have rooms available." "African mammal wanted." What I'm saying is that the elephants had other elephants to hang out with, but the monkey, no. He was on his own.
Yeah. Of course, it's not a real monster. He's just a baby. It's not his fault his father's a shape-shifter. Yeah, but he's a shifter too.
Did he say with whom? By then, I was late for my appointment with my broker, so I left, around 2:30. And that thing about... The universe? He ordered himself.
- Stop following me. I've done all I can for you Now you're on your own. - But I don't know the way home. - Just follow the sun. He'll take you there.
However the medicine did not go very well. At first he seemed hopeless, but gradually improved, particularly since we agreed that he would stay with us for the time being to do studies here. He wanted the shed equipped for him. We don't think it is a particularly suitable place but we have had to spruce it up. Now we will make it a nice, warm, dry place, and it will be done.
Heating the blood alters its proteins, allowing them to combine with the iron in the red blood cells and potassium carbonate, or potash. What happens in the reaction is that the carbonate reacts with the hemoglobin and other blood structures to produce this extraordinarily thick viscous substance that we might call mucus. After heating the substance to a powder, filtering and diluting it, Diesbach added green vitriol, which today we call ferrous sulfate, not knowing that he would create a complex iron compound, ferric ferrocyanide, or Prussian blue. Watch closely. He is going to bubble, perhaps violently. Observe.
Take the money! Just, God, stop making that sound! Yes! I told you I'd get the money. Wait, wait. What happened to it?
- Ah, ball of kings. - Yes. How was it? "I bid farewell to my uniform And all my heart. For he does not belong to me He belongs to a part of the dog."
Until then you must kneel before him. We march for Macragge. And we shall know no fear! Sergeant Crastor. Take care of your battle dress and he will protect you.
this. - Sir, we have to disconnect. - Twenty-seven hundred feet. - We're too deep. - He's going to handle it.
- He looks like Adam. - The old guy? - Yeah, like his father. - Like Adam McKay's father? - Yeah, I think that's him.
There's only one way to find out. We'll have to find out by feel. What do you feel? A lot of things but not Rex. For sure not, the Rex Regis Plasmator is a master at evading capture. Now that some people know about him they will stop at nothing to get him, knowing he is a living fossil.
All their cousins are in there. I feel like I'm being strangled by a bunch of Mexicans in a necklace, trying to.... -That's what love is like. -That's what love is like? Surrender to it and enjoy that woman to the end.
- You must wonder why we are here. You ruined our lives. There is an empty place at our table. It's like a wall between us, a no man's land. I'm sorry about the dog, but he's not coming back.
Your parents may still be alive. They would want to know. It's not him. Come here, you. I was sure it was him.
I'm the only one who's been with Becca. For almost two days! Lemon... there was a great American named George Henderson. He met a forest ape or "Sasquatch" who, despite his dangerous message about environmentalism, befriended him. But when it came time to do the hard thing and send him back to the forest, where he belonged, and the birds could perch on his shoulder because he was friendly,
So, what is this that we're doing, exactly? Well, it's called fucking most of the time. You know what I mean. We both know this world. Let's not make this any more of it.
And she's going to keep the baby. "Vincent hit him several times with the helmet." - "The man stopped moving..." - No. He didn't. Understand?
1,500 dollars? - Okay, no panic. Now I'm talking to this guy. Will you excuse me? This wine is not to our satisfaction. But, sir, when you tasted it, you assured me that... "it was splitting." True, but after that first sip... he's vinegary.
Some yes, mom. You have to get that crazy dream out of your head. I can't. Then I'm afraid God will grant it to you. After you put on the Jalitza's shoe walk in it and make sure it fits well.
The amount of light it blocks when it's in front of it... tells us how big the planet is. So we use that to understand whether it's a small planet like Mercury... a planet like Earth... or a giant as big as Jupiter. And we use the orbital period and the temperature of the star... to tell us if it's in the habitable zone. The orbital period is the time it takes for a planet to go around its star. He goes on his way... and comes back again a year later and does it again.
Very Pregnant. She was this big! She was driving through an intersection, and then a... a car ran a red light, and, uh, actually, it wasn't a... car. It was a plumber's van, it was a plumber's van from Klog King. And he broke me?
- Are you all right? - Where is he? - It's going to happen soon. - You almost saw the cartridge. All right, I got rid of it.
Maybe I'll have it done in the next few years or days. But right now, if I knew that someday I would die of something.... When you hear about something like that, you can't forget it. This way, my future is still mine. I can make of it what I want.
Hooch is crazy. And though he felt warm and safe, he knew it had to end. It's not good to live too much in the past. And, thanks to Dan, the future didn't scare me so much anymore. I could make of it what I wanted.
I'm not crying. Hey, uh, you got a call from a doctor. What'd you grab? Take off your vest. I told you, I feel safer in it.
That's all it took to make things crazy. And when that happens, our perception changes. Are you looking at my ass? No, your ass is where I'm looking. Strictly speaking, he's looking at me.
As she said in court, I am a good businessman. His contract guarantees him creative control over his own line. So I simply told her that PDQ will bring in another designer...to oversee a second line, if he doesn't feel up to the challenge. What did she say? He came into my office and asked me to bring him that dress. It's his size. He's on board.
Ned has already looked at it. Oh, there's no light and shadow in there at all. Maybe not now. What does that mean? What use would this book be if it destroyed itself?
I woke up, and he was covering my mouth! And Mr. Barton is still inside? Yeah. He's gonna go crazy in there. He acts like he owns the place, but it's my name on the lease. It's my apartment! He's a freeloader.
We're all white. Something funny: I was once on a plane with Brett Favre's cousin. It says here that you still have an outstanding school loan? Yes, and I'm on the hook for it.
If you want to go through with it go ahead, but you'll lose a week - and then you'll forget. - When did you start being reasonable? I want you to see that the system works. Yes, it works, but for the people who work in it.
This photo, of a mouse modified to hatch a human ear, has already triggered waves of protest. What? But scientists argue that this process will be able to help thousands of people who are disfigured for some reason, and may need ears or noses.... oh, fucking hell! 'YESTERDAY'S FUTURE IS TODAY' RESEARCH LABS Using a general process of genetic engineering, we can implant almost any body part into the mouse, so that it can develop...
I hear the same thing you do. Why? You were right about the Adviprin. That's where we found the poison. We also found Furlong's fingerprints all over the vial. It was his vial.
- Do you two know each other? - We are getting married. - What, who is this? I kept it a secret, I know you think daddy was a saint and that I don't deserve a love, but I have love, and it's strong and it will win, and I won't give it up.
Who would do that? Remember how much resistance Detective Hyde put up when I asked him to arrest my father? Now you're accusing a cop? It was a police file. It was an old police file. No one could have had access to it.
Kill him! Yes! After dinner, before the bedtime bell rang, we would arm wrestle. At first, Van Wurst was beating me, but as time went on, he found it more difficult. You look at the sky, and he looks at you with split eyes.
For them, fornication is a farce of murder." - Did you write this? - No. I copied it from an old book, "The Witch's Hammer." You look at the sky and it sees you with split eyes.
- We need a symbol. -- What symbol? Something basic. Something terrifying. In the film, Bruce decides to take on the appearance of a bat ... He is a creature that symbolizes his greatest fear.
You! "When an evil spirit goes out of a man, he passes through barren places in search of rest and finds none. Then he says: 'I will return to the house from which I left.' When he arrives he finds the house swept, cleaned and put in order. Then he goes out and seeks seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter to live there.
"The force"... would you mind signing... my life-size promotional cutout, please? Me? My pleasure, Ian. Uh, what's the hole for, Ian? To look through.
We do not want to be judged. We'll contact you at the hotel if we have any more information. Detectives. Yes? About Nicole's baby, do you know what happened to him?
In fact, the world's first spacewalk almost ended in disaster. Alexei Leonov made the first spacewalk... by a human being in 1965. But in the race to pull off this space spectacle... and thereby beat the Americans... the Soviets took some shortcuts on cosmonaut safety... and he blew up like the Michelin Man. The suit stiffened. He couldn't handle the pressure differences... between the breathable atmosphere inside... and the vacuum of space.
-Yes, a thief took him out in a robbery at his store. -A robbery? But who was it? Who killed his father? -What I know about him is that he had an antique shop.
Your movements are translated into movements of the robot. An LCD helmet with two screens puts the image of the two cameras directly on the robot's head and thus, we can do many tasks in a very natural way. The cameras are protected by a helmet... The robot can also operate autonomously when it employs its own artificial intelligence to do pre-programmed tasks. Since he will go on roads that people are afraid to walk on.
They are. only I am nobody's property. I'm not the slave Friday, he's the one who is repatriated among 12, I'm not. I would like to know what use socialism is in such a terrible and absurd situation as it is for a human being to live on Bear Island. What is useful about it?
Bullshit, you know! Why are you calling that guy? I don't know any guy... I need medicine for the dog! He's sick.
After graduating I met the Association for the Defense of Human Rights. I observed them for two years and in 1989 I started working with them. In this institution, hierarchical relations... between men and women are minimal, although I can't say that they don't exist. As human rights defenders... we think that this TV program is harmful. It presents gender violence as something trivial.
His poor mother must be turning in her grave. He wasn't like that when he was little. He was adorable and smart! That one? Even an ass full of shit is more adorable than him.
Wammy's House? That's the orphanage Watari founded. Mello has turned this into a game. Alamo Jastin. It's Armonia Jastin. I already told the old man that I've lost my notebook, however, when I told him about it, he said Ryuk had taken it.
I went upstairs. I smoked in those days. And I was passed by a man in a hurry coming out. And that was the man you later identified as Richard Dunne? Yes, yes, that was him.
Give the phone to this person. He wants to talk to you. Choosing you was surely the better choice. Light-kun has the phone! If it's really him, then he's in danger!
Don't let this job control your life. Work to live, not the other way around. - But I love my job. - Yes, I know you do. But I assure you, it doesn't pay you back.
We are in a vacuum chamber that will contain gases. It will simulate what the early Earth might have looked like. Let's make a bunch of craters so that's what the early Earth landscape must have looked like. Because this was happening all the time, there must have been a lot of craters. The plan is for the projectile to come in, hit the center of the target and watch the crater form. And you'll see the destructive power... ...of it, even though it's a very small object it will do quite a bit of damage.
Stretch. - Petrova! - I'm coming. We 3, the Fossils... we vow to put our name in the History books. For he is ours alone and ours alone.
- Oh, no, thank you. - Please take it. - But why are you giving it to me? I don't know. I can't balance with it.
Feelings you have to let go of. It's that easy, is it? Tony... even if by some kind of miracle Jeanne forgave you, would you be willing to be Tony DiNardo full time, leaving your whole life behind for her? You didn't think of it that way. - Didn't you tell me that the heart wants what it wants?
Will you come with me? Please come with me. Your boyfriend. Good job, guys. - We'll pick you guys up at 5:30. - All right. (Laughs) - Hi. - This is Tony. Sunny.
There has been no official approval. Somewhere around here must be your route recording system, so we'll know where you've been. - Do you think Aurora is what they've been seeing? - Possibly. This machine is as good as a black box. It's a spy plane. If there was a bomb or a crash, he'll tell us.
Over and out of Halesworth, to the North Sea and back to the airport. The time and position of the flight correspond with the crash of the cargo plane. So it was a collision? Well, if you look at the dates, you'll see that they haven't flown since then. So maybe he went down too, or was damaged.
Well, I guess we'll move on, just like we did before. No, according to Lou. she has a lot of plans. i just want this place to run more like a business it's not a business. The only problem is mom isn't here anymore, and if she was, she wouldn't be here discussing the problems! you didn't stay for dessert your sister is making herself very useful with the defrost button on the microwave He still doesn't trust me.
This is our planet, Earth. It is an amazing, ever-changing world, full of natural wonders. But there is more than this about Earth, much more. For our planet is unique in the solar system, perhaps even in the universe. Four and a half billion years have made it a world of extraordinary landscapes and home to life.
Now! Here, take it out. Take it out. How many times have I told you not to chew gum? What if you choke on it?
- William. My dream is to stand up and go into the tube. What's a tube like? What's a tube going to be like? The tube, it closes and comes under the water.
It sounds so good. I can't believe it. And now to sing. No... you have to sing into the microphone. He's not going to follow you.
- Thank you. And you? Well, to know that even if my arms and legs fall off, we'll still be together the same. And when he says my name, it sounds different if it comes out of his mouth. To feel safe with him.
I have wires coming out of everywhere. Plugged in like the TV. Time is already weighing me down. But you know, I kill him. Unless he's killing me.
But it is not responsible for the disaster we are facing. We must not forget that for some sleepers, this is a feared place: nightmares, monsters under the bed, unknown things lurking in the dark corners, shadows... That's what night is for Tim. And his fear created the monster that now threatens us by killing any trace of light and what he loves the most.
Almost. It's always the same for me: separation, depression; drinking, affairs. Meet one guy, then another. Having sex to forget the important one. And after a few months of total emptiness, start looking for love again. Searching everywhere desperately and, after two years of loneliness, meeting a new love and swearing that he is the definitive one until he leaves too.
How big is the ranch? Twenty-five thousand acres. Across those fields and across White Stone Peak. You'll stay a year, you'll never see it all. Is it big enough to get lost in?
No, sahib. You see, sahib? The road will hold, sahib. The road will hold. He will be here more than you and I, sahib.
You probably can't stop daydreaming about your future together. and just thinking that for the rest of your life you're going to be in a bed with Bullit. Suddenly the urge was gone. Night after night, you and Bullit making love until the wee hours of the morning. You, exploring his body as he gets older, older and older.
I write the music, but I can't find anyone for the lyrics, until I meet a girl who sometimes waters my plants: Drew Barrymore. And we write a song together and then... on the snippet we're going to see we do a little demo. It sounds so good, I can't believe it. And now... to sing. no, no, you see, you have to get closer to the microphone, he's not going to follow you.
What do you remember about the nightmare? It started with my mom, the funeral. That damn rain hat an absolute terror. There was a guy, just like Henry Perkins said. I don't know. But he had a gun and he knew to hide me.
Well, where is he? I'll send my people after him. No, no. He's my prey. You're not going alone. You guys keep searching relentlessly for a way to deactivate that detonator. I'm going to meet him.
I am very sorry. There is nothing more to say. So please leave. Talk about people or animals, fighting is all about attitude. If I get scared of the knife, he despises me.
So please leave. Talk about people or animals, fighting is a matter of attitude. If I get scared of the knife, he despises me. If I glare at him... He puts his tail between his legs.
Okay, what made you think you should move in with him in the first place? The closet test. More than half of his closet is full of my stuff. I see. And what about your own closet? It's cluttered with his stuff, isn't it?
The water has to be warm and the light has to come from above or it dies. Lack of light can cause him permanent stress. perfect... so my fish is depressed! Yes. I imagine he has feelings too.
But it is precisely now that they are most vulnerable. A short-eared owl. The petrels are too fast in the air, and the owl too big to follow them deep into their small tunnels. So his best chance is to catch one going in or coming out. First he uses his keen vision to locate an entrance to an active hole. He doesn't go directly toward the petrel, but positions himself above it from the outside.
For the religious historians, the concept of "the divine goddess" . So Sauniére's last act on Earth was to draw the symbol of a goddess on his chest? Why? Captain Fache, obviously I cannot tell you why. I can assure you that he knew the meaning of that symbol and it has nothing to do with the devil.
Especially when one is a child because that is precisely when all these things begin. When one is a child, sin doesn't seem to be something very important. It seems like an attractive thing, in fact a nice, woolly thing. But sin is planned to destroy you. And you nurture that baby for a long time and it grows in your life until you find yourself in trouble and you don't know how to cope and what seemed very innocent to you now controls your life.
Hurry! - It's too late. Romano, you must be strong. Tabitha's soul is watching us from above. - Master, a man has arrived. - Who is he?
I am on a journey. Everything I have told you today is true. I did not choose it. It happened to me. As my journey continues I don't know where it takes me but I walk it without fear.
Well, at least there's one doctor here I can count on. Screw it, Bob. I don't work here! Have a nice day. I hate this place. He hates you, Bob.
When Tina and I talked about getting married, we were both going to wear a fabulous dress. So how come you didn't get married? Tina thought it would be too conventional. She didn't want to cling to the heterosexual schema. And now he's clung to her!
My team, Alan. I'm back and I can feel it. I have discovered a truth about myself. I just love... power. Well, it looks like he has feelings for you too.
- I have no idea what you're talking about. We've had you under surveillance for three months. Really? We tracked a container from Central Europe to the UK. It supposedly contained liquor, but it also had 12 refugees hidden inside it.
Okay? I'll check under every rock. I'll check under every rock. Where's the Colt? Your son is dying, and you're worried about the Colt? We're hunting this demon, and maybe he's hunting us too.
I saw a couple. I don't know, they had something... and I looked at that couple, they were having fun! And I looked at myself, and at Zack, and the love we had, he was in love, and I knew God was sending me a sign.
But if I am Moishale, who is the Pharaoh's daughter? What are you laughing at? Nothing, nothing. That day was long in coming, until one day he arrived.
Exactly one week before Pearl Harbor was bombed. A young chain of radio stations called the National Broadcasting System striving to compete with their established cousins, CBS and NBC while maintaining all the original architecture and Art Deco elements. And they turned it into a studio for radio plays. The most famous was a Sunday series called The Studio 60th Air Theater. After the war, radio gave way to television. And the first program here was "The NBS Philco Hour of Comedy." And nobody ever heard of it because it had the misfortune of being broadcast at the same time as "The Colgate Comedy Hour." And then "Texaco Theater of the Stars."
I am sorry for what happened, but if people do not heed what we say unfortunately, they will suffer the consequences. What do you want? The British Government is in possession of a document. - It's called Aftermath. - I have never heard of it.
Because I was sad. How did you feel after you did that? Better. Why? I don't know, because he was dead and I was still alive.
- No, he was driving. He hit his head against the windshield, his chest against the steering column. An old car, no airbags. He was driving the car that hit the fish market? He wasn't driving it. That's what I'm telling you. He was driving it. He didn't do all this.
Here, once, the sugar mills cut the countryside, Time passed and engulfed them. And time engulfed the sugar mill. There is still one or the other who says that time wins in the end. One day, it engulfs the sugar mill, as it engulfs you and me.
Make a bugger out of your little ass. I'm going to keep it in your hole, you can be sure. Look closely, it looks like a car. - Let go of me! - You've got a nice little ass, but it won't stop you from getting a good spanking!
You are right. We have come so far. Without you I could not be where I am now. Where is the destiny that leads us? We'll go anywhere, it leads us.
What did I win? A conversation. Her perfume was on Melvin Heckman. I'd rather wait tables than sleep with that guy. And how did you get to him?
Okay. "Nietzsche"? What the hell is that? He's a philosopher. Haven't you ever heard the expression that if you look into the abyss,... it ends up looking back at you?
Okay, but you're going to have to do a lot better. "Beer", "You look beautiful", "Let's get naked" What's the problem? We have to get rid of this body! It's too cold, I have to do it my way. This body, we have to get it up now and get rid of it once and for all!
Michael has sex for me and I have his brain! All right, let's get started. "Hey buddy, what happened in there?" You need to calm down, dude. This body, we need to get it up now and get rid of it once and for all!
